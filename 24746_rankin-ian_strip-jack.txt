ian rankin strip jack the fourth book in the inspector rebus series to the only jack ive ever stripped he knows nothing and he thinks he knows everything that points clearly to a political career shaw major barbara the habit of friendship is matured by constant intercourse libianus th century ad quoted in edinburgh by charles mckean acknowledgements the first thing to acknowledge is that the constituency of north and south esk is the authors creation however you dont need to be mungo park to work out that there must be some correlation between north and south esk and the real world edinburgh being a real place and south and east of edinburgh being a vaguely definable geographical area in fact north and south esk bears some resemblance to the midlothian parliamentary constituency prior to s boundary commission changes but also bites a small southernmost chunk out of the present edinburgh pentlands constituency and a westerly chunk out of east lothian constituency gregor jack too is fiction and bears no resemblance to any mp thanks are due to the following for their inestimable help alex eadie who was until his retirement the mp for midlothian john home robertson mp professor busuttil regius professor of forensic medicine university of edinburgh lothian and borders police city of edinburgh police the staff of the edinburgh room edinburgh central library the staff of the national library of scotland staff and customers of sandy bells the oxford bar mathers west end darks bar and the green tree the milking shed the wonder of it was that the neighbours hadnt complained hadnt even as many of them later told the newsmen realized not until that night the night their sleep was disturbed by sudden activity in the street cars vans policemen the static chatter of radios not that the noise ever got out of hand the whole operation was directed with such speed and yes even good humour that there were those who slept through the excitement i want courtesy chief superintendent farmer watson had explained to his men in the briefing room that evening it may be a hoorhoose but its on the right side of town if you take my meaning no telling who might be in there we might even come across our own dear chief constable watson grinned to let them know he was joking but some of the officers in the room knowing the cc better than watson himself apparently did exchanged glances and wry smiles right said watson lets go through the plan of attack one more time christ hes loving this thought detective inspector john rebus hes loving every minute and why not this was watsons baby after all and it was to be a home birth which was to say watson was going to be in charge all the way from immaculate conception to immaculate delivery maybe it was a male menopause thing this need to flex a bit of muscle most of the chief supers rebus had known in his twenty years on the force had been content to push pens over paper and wait for retirement day but not watson watson was like channel four full of independent programmes of minority interest he didnt make waves exactly but by christ he splashed like hell and now he even seemed to have an informer an invisible somebody who had whispered in his ear the word brothel sin and debauchery watsons hard presbyterian heart had been stirred to righteous indignation he was the kind of highland christian who found sex within marriage just about acceptable his son and daughter were proof but who baulked at anything and everything else if there was an active brothel in edinburgh watson wanted it shut down with prejudice but then the informer had provided an address and this caused a certain hesitation the brothel was in one of the better streets of the new town quiet georgian terraces lined with trees and saabs and volvos the houses filled with professional people lawyers surgeons university professors this was no seamans bawdyhouse no series of damp dark rooms above a dockside pub this was as rebus himself had offered an establishment establishment watson hadnt seen the joke watch had been kept for several days and nights courtesy of unmarked cars and unremarkable plainclothes men until there could be little doubt whatever was happening inside the shuttered rooms it was happening after midnight and it was happening briskly interestingly few of the many men arrived by car but a watchful detective constable taking a leak in the dead of night discovered why the men were parking their cars in side streets and walking the hundred yards or so to the front door of the fourstorey house perhaps this was house policy the slamming of afterhours car doors would arouse suspicion in the street or perhaps it was in the visitors own interests not to leave their cars in broad streetlight where they might be recognized registration numbers were taken and checked as were photographs of visitors to the house the owner of the house itself was traced he owned half a french vineyard as well as several properties in edinburgh and lived in bordeaux the year through his solicitor had been responsible for letting the house to a mrs croft a very genteel lady in her fifties according to the solicitor she paid her rent promptly and in cash was there any problem no problem he was assured but if he could keep the conversation to himself meantime the car owners had turned out to be businessmen some local but the majority visiting the city from south of the border heartened by this watson had started planning the raid with his usual blend of wit and acumen he chose to call it operation creeper brothel creepers you see john yes sir rebus answered i used to own a pair myself ive often wondered how they got the name watson shrugged he was not a man to be sidetracked never mind the creepers he said lets just get the creeps the house it was reckoned would be doing good business by midnight one oclock saturday morning was chosen as the time of the raid the warrants were ready every man in the team knew his place and the solicitor had even come up with plans of the house which had been memorized by the officers its a bloody warren watson had said no problem sir so long as weve got enough ferrets in truth rebus wasnt looking forward to this evenings work brothels might be illegal but they fulfilled a need and if they veered towards respectability as this one certainly did then what was the problem he could see some of this doubt reflected in watsons eyes but watson had been enthusiastic from the first and to pull back now was unthinkable would seem a sign of weakness so with nobody really keen for it operation creeper went ahead while other meaner streets went unpatrolled while domestic violence took its toll while the water of leith drowning still remained to be solved okay in we go they left their cars and vans and marched towards the front door knocked quietly the door was opened from within and then things began to move like a video on doublespeed other doors were opened how many doors could a house have knock first then open yes they were being courteous if you wouldnt mind getting dressed please if you could just come downstairs now you can put your trousers on first sir if you like then christ sir come and take a look at this rebus followed the flushed youthful face of the detective constable here we are sir feast your peepers on this lot ah yes the punishment room chains and thongs and whips a couple of fulllength mirrors a wardrobe full of gear theres more leather here than in a bloody milking shed you seem to know a lot about cows son rebus said he was just thankful the room wasnt in use but there were more surprises to come in parts the house resembled nothing more lewd than a fancydress party nurses and matrons wimples and high heels except that most of the costumes revealed more than they hid one young woman seemed to be wearing a rubber diving suit with the nipples and crotch cut away another looked like a cross between heidi and eva braun watson watched the parade righteous fury filling him he had no doubts now it was absolutely proper that this sort of place be closed down then he turned back to the conversation he was having with mrs croft while chief inspector lauderdale lingered only a short distance away he had insisted on coming along knowing his superior and fearing some almighty cockup well thought rebus with a smile no cockups in sight yet mrs croft spoke in a kind of gentrified cockney which became less gentrified as time went on and more couples spilled down the stairs and into the large sofacrammed living room a room smelling of expensive perfume and proprietary whisky mrs croft was denying everything she was even denying that they were standing in a brothel at all i am not my brothels keeper thought rebus all the same he had to admire her performance she was a businesswoman she kept saying a taxpayer she had rights and where was her solicitor i thought it was her that was doing the soliciting lauderdale muttered to rebus a rare moment of humour from one of the dourest buggers rebus had ever worked with and as such it deserved a smile what are you grinning at i didnt know there was an interval get back to work yes sir rebus waited till lauderdale had turned away from him the better to hear what watson was saying and then flicked a quick vsign at him mrs croft though caught the gesture and perhaps thinking it intended at her returned it lauderdale and watson both turned towards where rebus was standing but by then he was already on his way officers who had been posted in the back garden now marched a few palefaced souls back into the house one man had leapt from a firstfloor window and was hobbling as a result but he was insistent too that no doctor was necessary that no ambulance be called the women seemed to find the whole thing amusing and appeared especially taken by the looks on their clients faces looks ranging from the ashamed and embarrassed to the furious and embarrassed there was some shortlived bravado of the iknowmyrights variety but in the main everybody did as they were told that is they shut up and tried to be patient some of the shame and embarrassment started to lift when one of the men recalled that it wasnt illegal to visit a brothel it was only illegal to run one or work in one and this was true though it didnt mean the men present were going to escape into the anonymous night give them a scare first then send them away starve the brothels of clients and youd have no brothels that was the logic so the officers were prepared with their usual stories the ones they used with kerbcrawlers and the like just a quiet word sir between you and me like if i were you id have myself checked over for aids im serious most of these women could well be carrying the disease even if it doesnt show mostly it doesnt show till its too late anyway are you married sir any girlfriends best tell them to have a test too otherwise you never know do you it was cruel stuff but necessary and as with most cruel words there was a truth to it mrs croft seemed to use a small back room as an office a cashbox was found so was a creditcard machine a receiptbook was headed crofter guest house as far as rebus could tell the cost of a single room was seventyfive pounds dear for a b ampb but how many company accountants would take the trouble to check it wouldnt surprise rebus if the place was vat registered to boot sir it was detective sergeant brian holmes newly promoted and bristling with efficiency he was halfway up one of the flights of stairs and calling down to rebus i think you better come up here rebus wasnt keen holmes looked to be a long way up and rebus who lived on the second floor of a tenement had a natural antipathy to stairs edinburgh of course was full of them just as it was full of hills biting winds and people who liked to girn about things like hills and stairs and the wind coming outside a bedroom door a detective constable stood in quiet discussion with holmes when holmes saw rebus reaching the landing he dismissed the dc well sergeant take a look sir anything you want to tell me first holmes shook his head youve seen the male member before sir havent you rebus opened the bedroom door what was he expecting to find a mockup dungeon with someone stretched out naked on the rack a farmyard scene with a few chickens and sheep the male member maybe mrs croft had a collection of them displayed on her bedroom wall and heres one i caught in put up a tough fight but i had it in the end but no it was worse than that much worse it was an ordinary bedroom albeit with red lightbulbs in its several lamps and in an ordinary bed lay an ordinary enough looking woman her elbow pressed into the pillow head resting at an angle on her clenched fist and on that bed dressed and staring at the floor sat someone rebus recognized the member of parliament for north and south esk jesus christ said rebus holmes put his head round the door i cant work in front of a fucking audience yelled the woman her accent rebus noted was english holmes ignored her this is a bit of a coincidence he said to gregor jack mp only my girlfriend and me have just moved into your constituency the mp raised his eyes more in sorrow than in anger this is a mistake he said a terrible mistake just doing a bit of canvassing eh sir the woman had begun to laugh head still resting on her hand the red lamplight seemed to fill her gaping mouth gregor jack looked for a moment as though he might be about to throw a punch in her general direction instead he tried a slap with his open hand but succeeded only in catching her arm so that her head fell back on to the pillow she was still laughing almost girllike she lifted her legs high into the air the bedcovers falling away her hands thumped the mattress with glee jack had risen to his feet and was scratching nervously at one finger jesus christ rebus said again then come on lets get you downstairs not the farmer the farmer might go to pieces lauderdale then rebus approached with as much humility as he could muster sir weve got a bit of a problem i know it must have been that bugger watson wanted his moment of glory captured hes always been keen on publicity you should know that was that a sneer on lauderdales face with his gaunt figure and bloodless face he reminded rebus of a painting hed once seen of some calvinists or seceders some grim bunch like that ready to burn anyone who came to hand rebus kept his distance all the time shaking his head im not sure i the bloody papers are here hissed lauderdale quick off the mark eh even for our friends in the press bloody watson must have tipped them off hes out there now i tried to stop him rebus went to one of the windows and peeped out sure enough there were three or four reporters gathered at the bottom of the steps up to the front door watson had finished his spiel and was answering a couple of questions at the same time retreating slowly back up the steps oh dear rebus said admiring his own sense of understatement that only makes it worse makes what worse so rebus told him and was rewarded with the biggest smile hed ever seen flit across lauderdales face well well whos been a naughty boy then but i still dont see the problem rebus shrugged well sir its just that it doesnt do anyone any good outside the vans were arriving two to take the women to the station two to take the men the men would be asked a few questions names and addresses taken then released the women well that was another thing entirely there would be charges rebuss colleague gill templer would call it another sign of the phallocentric society something like that shed never been the same since shed got her hands on those psychology books nonsense lauderdale was saying hes only got himself to blame what do you want us to do sneak him out the back door with a blanket over his head no sir its just he gets treated the same as the rest of them inspector you know the score yes sir but but what but what well that was the question what why was rebus feeling so uncomfortable the answer was complicatedly simple because it was gregor jack most mps rebus wouldnt have given the time of day but gregor jack was well he was gregor jack vans are here inspector lets round em up and ship em out lauderdales hand on his back was cold and firm yes sir said rebus so it was out into the cool dark night lit by orange sodium lights the glare of headlamps and the dimmer light from open doors and twitching windows the natives were restless some had come out on to their doorsteps wrapped in paisley dressing gowns or wearing hastily found clothes not quite hanging right police natives and of course the reporters flashguns christ there were photographers too of course no camera crews no video machines that was something watson hadnt persuaded the tv companies to attend his little soirée into the van quick as you can called brian holmes was that a new firmness a new authority in his voice funny what promotion could do to the young but by god they were quick not so much following holmes orders rebus knew as keen to escape the cameras one or two of the women posed trying a lopsided glamour learned from page three before being persuaded by wpcs that this was neither the time nor the place but the reporters were hanging back rebus wondered why indeed he wondered what they were doing here at all was it such a big story would it provide watson with useful publicity one reporter even grabbed at a photographers arm and seemed to warn him about shooting off too many pictures but now they were keening now they were shouting and the flashbulbs were going off like flak all because theyd recognized a face all because gregor jack was being escorted down the steps across the narrow pavement and into a van christ its gregor jack mr jack a word any comment to make what were you doing any comment the doors were closing a thump with the constabulary hand on the side of the van and it moved slowly away the reporters jogging after it well rebus had to admit it jack had held his head high no that wasnt being accurate he had rather held his head just low enough suggesting penitence but not shame humility but not embarrassment seven days hes been my mp holmes was saying by rebuss side seven days you must have been a bad influence on him brian bit of a shock though wasnt it rebus shrugged noncommittally the woman from the bedroom was being brought out now having pulled on jeans and a tshirt she saw the reporters and suddenly lifted the tshirt high over her naked breasts get a load of this then but the reporters were busy comparing notes the photographers loading new film theyd be off to the station next ready to catch gregor jack as he left nobody paid her any attention and eventually she let her tshirt fall back down and climbed into the waiting van hes not choosy is he said holmes but then again brian answered rebus maybe he is watson was rubbing at his gleaming forehead it was a lot of work for only one hand since the forehead seemed to extend as far as watsons crown mission accomplished he said well done thank you sir holmes said smartly no problems then not at all sir said rebus casually unless you count gregor jack watson nodded then frowned who he asked brian here can tell you all about him sir said rebus patting holmes back brians your man for anything smacking of politics watson hovering now somewhere between elation and dread turned to holmes politics he asked he was smiling please be gentle with me holmes watched rebus moving back inside the house he felt like sobbing because after all thats what john rebus was an sob scratching the surface it is a truth universally acknowledged that some members of parliament have trouble keeping their trousers on but gregor jack was not thought to be one of these indeed he often eschewed troose altogether opting for the kilt on election nights and at many a public function in london he took the jibes in good part his responses matching the old questions with the accuracy of catechism tell us now gregor whats worn beneath the kilt oh nothing nothing at all its all in perfect working order gregor jack was not a member of the snp though he had flirted with the party in his youth he had joined the labour party but had resigned for never specified reasons he was not a liberal democrat nor was he that rare breed a scots tory mp gregor jack was an independent and as an independent had held the seat of north and south esk south and east of edinburgh since his mildly surprising byelection win of mild was an adjective often used about jack so were honest legal and decent all this john rebus knew from memory from old newspapers magazines and radio interviews there had to be something wrong with the man some chink in his shining armour trust operation creeper to find the flaw rebus scanned the saturday newsprint seeking a story he didnt find it curious that the press had seemed keen enough last night a story breaking at one thirty plenty of time surely to see it into print by the final morning edition unless of course the reporters hadnt been local but they must have been mustnt they having said which he hadnt recognized any faces did watson really have the front to get the london papers involved rebus smiled the man had plenty of front all right his wife saw to that three meals a day three courses each feed the body watson was fond of saying and you feed the spirit something like that which was another thing biblebasher or no watson was starting to put away a fair amount of spirits a rosy glow to the cheeks and chins and the unmistakable scent of extrastrong mints when lauderdale walked into his superiors room these days he sniffed o and sniffed like a bloodhound only it wasnt blood he was sniffing it was promotion lose a fanner gain a fart the nickname had perhaps been unavoidable word association lauderdale became fort lauderdale and fort quickly turned into fart oh but it was an apt name too for wherever chief inspector lauderdale went he left a bad smell take the case of the lifted literature rebus had known the minute lauderdale walked into his office that there would soon be a need to open the windows i want you to stick close to this one john professor costello is highly thought of an international figure in this field and and lauderdale tried to look as though his next utterance meant nothing to him hes a close personal friend of chief superintendent watson ah what is this monosyllable week monosyllable rebus frowned sorry sir ill have to ask ds holmes what that means dont try to be funny im not sir honest its just that ds holmes has had the benefit of a university education well five months worth or thereabouts hed be the very man to coordinate the officers working on this highly sensitive case lauderdale stared at the seated figure for what seemed to rebus at least a very long time god was the man really that stupid did no one appreciate irony these days look lauderdale said at last i need someone a bit more senior than a recently promoted ds and im sorry to say that you inspector god help us all are that bit more senior youre flattering me sir a file landed with a dull thud on rebuss desk the chief inspector turned and left rebus rose from his chair and turned to his sash window tugging at it with all his might but the thing was stuck tight there was no escape with a sigh he turned back and sat down at his desk then he opened the folder it was a straightforward case of theft professor james aloysius costello was professor of divinity at the university of edinburgh one day someone had walked into his office then walked out again taking with them several rare books priceless according to the professor though not to the citys various booksellers and auction rooms the list seemed eclectic an early edition of knoxs treatise on predestination a couple of sir walter scott first editions swedenborgs wisdom of angels a signed early edition of tristram shandy and editions of montaigne and voltaire none of which meant much to rebus until he saw the estimates at auction provided by one of the george street auction houses the question then was what were they doing in an unlocked office in the first place to be read answered professor costello blithely to be enjoyed admired what good would they be locked up in a safe or in some old library display case did anyone else know about them i mean about how valuable they are the professor shrugged i had thought inspector that i was amongst friends he had a voice like a peat bog and eyes that gleamed like crystal a dublin education but a life spent as he put it cloistered in the likes of cambridge oxford st andrews and now edinburgh a life spent collecting books too those left in his office still kept unlocked were worth at least as much as the stolen volumes perhaps more they say lightning never strikes twice he assured rebus maybe not but villains do try to lock your door when you step out eh sir if nothing else the professor had shrugged was this rebus wondered a kind of stoicism he felt nervous sitting there in the office in buccleuch place for one thing he was a kind of christian himself and would have liked to be able to talk the subject through with this wiseseeming man wise well perhaps not worldlywise not wise enough to know how snib locks and human minds worked but wise in other ways but rebus was nervous too because he knew himself for a clever man who could have been cleverer given the breaks he had never gone to university and never would he wondered how different he would be if he had or could the professor was staring out of his window down on to the cobblestoned street on one side of buccleuch place sat a row of neat tenements owned by the university and used by various departments the professor called it botany bay and across the road uglier shapes reared up the modern stone mausoleums of the main university complex if this side of the road was botany bay rebus was all for transportation he left the professor to his muses and musings had the books been filched at random or was this designer theft the thief stealing to order there might well be unscrupulous collectors who would pay no questions asked for an early tristram shandy though the authors names had rung bells only that particular title had meant anything to rebus he owned a paperback copy of the book bought at a carboot sale on the meadows for tenpence maybe the professor would like to borrow it and so the case of the lifted literature had for inspector john rebus begun the ground had been covered before as the casenotes showed but it could be covered again there were the auction houses the bookshops the private collectors all to be talked to and all to satisfy an unlikely friendship between a police chief superintendent and a professor of divinity a waste of time of course the books had disappeared the previous tuesday it was now saturday and they would doubtless be under lock and key in some dark and secret corner what a way to spend a saturday actually if the time had been his own this would have been a nice afternoon which was perhaps why he hadnt balked at the task rebus collected books well that was putting it strongly he bought books bought more of them than he had time to read attracted by this cover or that title or the fact that hed heard good things about the author no on second thoughts it was just as well these were business calls he was making otherwise hed be bankrupting himself in record time in any case he didnt have books on his mind he kept thinking about a certain mp was gregor jack married rebus thought so hadnt there been some big society wedding several years previous well married men were bread and butter to prostitutes they just gobbled them up shame though about jack rebus had always respected the man which was to say now that he thought about it that hed been taken in by jacks public image but it wasnt all image was it jack really had come from a workingclass background had clawed his way upwards and was a good mp north and south esk was difficult territory part mining villages part country homes jack seemed to glide easily between the two hemispheres hed managed to get an ugly new road rerouted well away from his wellheeled constituents but had also fought hard to bring new hightech industry to the area retraining the miners so that they could do the jobs too good to be true too bloody good to be true bookshops he had to keep his mind on bookshops there were only a few to check the ones that had not been open earlier in the week footwork really the stuff he should have been doling out to more junior men but all that meant was that hed feel bound to come round after them double checking what theyd done this way he saved himself some grief buccleuch street was an odd mixture of grimy junk shops and bright vegetarian takeaways student turf not far from rebuss own flat yet he seldom ventured into this part of town only on business only ever on business ah this was it suey books and for once the shop looked to be open even in the spring sunshine there was a need for a light inside it was a tiny shop boasting an unenthusiastic window display of old hardbacks mostly with a scottish theme an enormous black cat had made a home for itself in the centre of the display and blinked slowly if malignly up at rebus the window itself needed washing you couldnt make out the titles of the books without pressing your nose to the glass and this was made difficult by the presence of an old black bicycle resting against the front of the shop rebus pushed open the door if anything the shops interior was less pristine than its exterior there was a bristlemat just inside the door rebus made a note to wipe his feet before he went back into the street the shelves a few of them glassfronted were crammed and the smell was of old relatives houses of attics and the insides of school desks the aisles were narrow hardly enough room to swing a there was a thump somewhere behind him and he feared one of the books had fallen but when he turned he saw that it was the cat it swerved past him and made for the desk situated to the rear of the shop the desk with a bare lightbulb dangling above it anything in particular youre looking for she was seated at the desk a pile of books in front of her she held a pencil in one hand and appeared to be writing prices on the inside leaves of the books from a distance it was a scene out of dickens close up was a different story still in her teens she had hennaed her short spiked hair the eyes behind the circular tinted glasses were themselves round and dark and she sported three earrings in either ear with another curling from her left nostril rebus didnt doubt shed have a pale boyfriend with lank dreadlocks and a whippet on a length of clothesrope im looking for the manager he said hes not here can i help rebus shrugged his eyes on the cat it had leapt silently on to the desk and was now rubbing itself against the books the girl held her pencil out towards it and the cat brushed the tip with its jaw inspector rebus said rebus im interested in some stolen books i was wondering if anyone had been in trying to sell them do you have a list rebus did he drew it out of his pocket and handed it over you can keep it he said just in case she glanced down the typed list of titles and editions her lips pursed i dont think ronald could afford them even if he was tempted ronald being the manager thats right where were they stolen from round the corner in buccleuch place round the corner theyd hardly be likely to bring them here then would they rebus smiled true he said but we have to check well ill hang on to this anyway she said folding the list as she pushed it into a desk drawer rebus reached out a hand and stroked the cat like lightning a paw flicked up and caught his wrist he drew back his hand with a sharp intake of breath oh dear said the girl rasputins not very good with strangers so i see rebus studied his wrist there were inchlong claw marks there three of them whitened scratches they were already rising the skin swelling and breaking beads of blood appeared jesus he said sucking on the damaged wrist he glared at the cat it glared back then dropped from the desk and was gone are you all right just about you should keep that thing on a chain she smiled do you know anything about that raid last night rebus blinked still sucking what raid i heard the police raided a brothel oh i heard they caught an mp gregor jack oh she smiled again word gets about rebus thought not for the first time i dont live in a city i live in a bloody village i just wondered the girl was saying if you knew anything about it i mean if its true i mean if it is she sighed poor beggar rebus frowned now thats his nickname she explained beggar thats what ronald calls him your boss knows mr jack then oh yes they were at school together beggar owns half of this she waved a hand around her as though she were proprietress of some princes street department store she saw that the policeman didnt seem impressed we do a lot of business behind the scenes she said defensively a lot of buying and selling it might not look much but this place is a goldmine rebus nodded actually he said now that you mention it it does look a bit like a mine his wrist was crackling now as though stung by nettles bloody cat right keep an eye out for those books wont you she didnt answer hurt he didnt doubt by the mine jibe she was opening a book ready to pencil in a price rebus nodded to himself walked to the door and rubbed his feet noisily on the mat before leaving the shop the cat was back in the window licking its tail fuck you too pal muttered rebus pets after all were his pet hate dr patience aitken had pets too many pets tiny tropical fish a tame hedgehog in the back garden two budgies in a cage in the living room and yes a cat a stray which to rebuss relief still liked to spend much of its time on the prowl it was a tortoiseshell and it was called lucky it liked rebus its funny patience had said how they always seem to go for the people who dont like them dont want them or are allergic to them dont ask me why as she said this lucky was climbing across rebuss shoulders he snarled and shrugged it off it fell to the floor landing on its feet youve got to have patience john yes she was right if he did not have patience he might lose patience so hed been trying hed been trying which was perhaps why hed been tricked into trying to stroke rasputin rasputin why was it pets always seemed to be called either lucky goldie beauty flossie spot or else rasputin beelzebub fang nirvana bodhisattva blame the breed of owner rebus was in the rutherford nursing a half of eightshilling and watching the fulltime scores on tv when he remembered that he was expected at brian holmes new house this evening expected for a meal with holmes and nell stapleton he groaned then remembered that his only clean suit was at patience aitkens flat it was a worrying fact was he really moving in with patience he seemed to be spending an awful lot of time there these days well he liked her even if she did treat him like yet another pet and he liked her flat he even liked the fact that it was underground well not quite underground in some parts of town it might once have been described as the basement flat but in oxford terrace wellappointed oxford terrace stockbridges oxford terrace it was a garden flat and sure enough it had a garden a narrow isosceles triangle of land but the flat itself was what interested rebus it was like a shelter like a childrens encampment you could stand in either of the front bedrooms and stare up out of the window to where feet and legs moved along the pavement above you people seldom looked down rebus whose own flat was on the second floor of a marchmont tenement enjoyed this new perspective while other men his age were moving out of the city and into bungalows rebus found a sort of amused thrill from walking downstairs to the front door instead of walking up more than novelty it was a reversal a major shift and his life felt full of promise as a result patience too was full of promise she was keen for him to move more of his things in to make himself at home and she had given him a key so beer finished and car persuaded to make the fiveminute trip he was able to let himself in his suit newly cleaned was lying on the bed in the spare bedroom so was lucky in fact lucky was lying on the suit was rolling on it plucking at it with his claws was shedding on it and marking it rebus saw rasputin in his minds eye as he swiped the cat off the bed then he picked up the suit and took it to the bathroom where he locked the door behind him before running a bath the parliamentary constituency of north and south esk was large but not populous the population however was growing new housing estates grew in tight clusters on the outskirts of the mining towns and villages commuter belt yes the region was changing new roads new railway stations even new kinds of people doing new kinds of jobs brian holmes and nell stapleton however had chosen to buy an old terraced house in the heart of one of the smallest of the villages eskwell actually it was all about edinburgh in the end the city was growing spreading out it was the city that swallowed villages and spawned new estates people werent moving into edinburgh the city was moving into them but by the time rebus reached eskwell he was in no mood to contemplate the changing face of country living hed had trouble starting the car he was always having trouble starting the car but wearing a suit and shirt and tie had made it that bit more difficult to tinker beneath the bonnet one fine weekend hed strip the engine down of course he would then hed give up and phone for a tow truck the house was easy to find eskwell boasting one main street and only a few back roads rebus walked up the garden path and stood on the doorstep a bottle of wine gripped in one hand he clenched his free fist and rapped on the door it opened almost at once youre late said brian holmes prerogative of rank brian im allowed to be late holmes ushered him into the hall i did say informal didnt i rebus puzzled for a moment then saw that this was a comment on his suit he noticed now that holmes himself was dressed in opennecked shirt and denims with a pair of moccasins covering his bare feet ah said rebus never mind ill nip upstairs and change not on my account this is your house brian you do as you please holmes nodded to himself suddenly looking pleased rebus was right this was his house well the mortgage was his half the mortgage go on through he said gesturing to a door at the end of the hall i think ill nip upstairs myself first rebus said handing over the bottle he spread his hands out palms upwards then turned them over even holmes could see the traces of oil and dirt car trouble he said nodding the bathrooms to the right of the landing right and those are nasty scratches too id see a doctor about them holmes tone told rebus that the young man assumed a certain doctor had been responsible for them in the first place a cat rebus explained a cat with eight lives left upstairs he felt particularly clumsy he rinsed the washhandbasin after him then had to rinse the muck off the soap then rinsed the basin again a towel was hanging over the bath but when he started to dry his hands he found he was drying them not on a towel but on a footmat the real towel was on a hook behind the door relax john he told himself but he couldnt socializing was just one more skill hed never really mastered he peered round the door downstairs come in come in holmes was holding out a glass of whisky towards him here you go cheers cheers they drank and rebus felt the better for it ill give you the tour of the house later holmes said sit down rebus did so and looked around him a real holmes from home he commented there were good smells in the air and cooking and clattering noises from the kitchen which seemed to be through another door off the living room the living room was almost cuboid with a table in one corner set with three places for dinner a chair in another corner a tv in the third and a standard lamp in the fourth very nice commented rebus holmes was sitting on a twoperson sofa against one wall behind him was a decentsized window looking on to the back garden he shrugged modestly itll do us he said im sure it will now nell stapleton strode into the room as imposing as ever she seemed almost too tall for her surroundings alice after the eat me cake she was wiping her hands on a dishcloth and smiled at rebus hello there rebus had risen to his feet she came over and pecked him on his cheek hello nell now she was standing over holmes and had lifted the glass out of his hand there was sweat on her forehead and she too was dressed casually she took a swallow of whisky exhaled noisily and handed the glass back ready in five minutes she announced shame your doctor friend couldnt make it john he shrugged prior engagement a medical dinner party i was glad of an excuse to get out of it she gave him rather too fixed a smile well she said ill leave you two to talk about whatever it is boys talk about and then she was gone the room seeming suddenly empty shit what had he said rebus had tried to find words to describe nell when speaking about her to patience aitken but somehow the words never told the story bossy stroppy lively canny big bright a handful like another set of seven dwarves certainly she didnt fit the stereotype of a university librarian which seemed to suit brian holmes just fine he was smiling studying what was left of his drink he got up for a refill rebus refusing the offer and came back with a manila folder here he said rebus accepted the folder what is it take a look newspaper cuttings mostly magazine articles press releases all concerning gregor jack mp where did you holmes shrugged innate curiosity when i knew i was moving into his constituency i thought id like to know more the papers seem to have kept quiet about last night maybe theyve been warned off holmes sounded sceptical or maybe theyre just biding their time having just reseated himself he now leapt up again ill see if nell needs a hand leaving rebus with little to do but read there wasnt much he didnt already know workingclass background comprehensive school in fife then edinburgh university degree in economics and accounting chartered accountant married elizabeth ferric theyd met at university she the daughter of sir hugh feme the businessman she was his only daughter his only child he doted on her could refuse her nothing all it was said because she reminded him of his wife dead these past twentythree years sir hughs most recent companion was an exmodel less than half his age maybe she too reminded him of his wife funny though elizabeth jack was an attractive woman beautiful even yet you never heard much about her since when was an attractive wife an asset not to be used by canny politicians maybe she wanted her own life skiing holidays and health resorts rather than an mps round of factory openings tea parties all that rebus recalled now what it was that he liked about gregor jack it was the background so similar to his own born in fife and given a comprehensive education except that back then theyd been called secondary and high schools both rebus and gregor jack had gone to a high school rebus because he passed his elevenplus the younger jack because of good grades at his junior high rebuss school had been in cowdenbeath jacks in kirkcaldy no distance at all really the only muck that had ever been thrown at jack seemed to be over the siting of a new electronics factory just inside his constituency rumours that his fatherinlaw had pulled a few strings it had all died down quickly enough no evidence and a whiff of writs for libel how old was jack rebus studied a recent newspaper photograph he looked younger on paper than he did in real life people in the media always did thirtyseven thirtyeight something like that beautiful wife plenty of money and he ends up caught on a tarts bed during a brothel raid rebus shook his head it was a cruel world then he smiled serve the bugger right for not sticking to his wife holmes was coming back in he nodded towards the file makes you wonder doesnt it rebus shrugged not really brian not really well finish your whisky and sit at the table im informed by the management that dinner is about to be served it was a good dinner too rebus insisted on making three toasts one to the couples happiness one to their new home and one to holmes promotion by then they were on to their second bottle of wine and the evenings main course roast beef after that there was cheese and after the cheese crannachan and after all that there was coffee and laphroaig and drowsiness in the armchair and on the sofa for all concerned it hadnt taken long for rebus to relax the alcohol had seen to that but it had been a nervous kind of relaxation so that he felt hed said too much most of it rubbish there was some shop talk of course and nell allowed it so long as it was interesting she thought farmer watsons drinking habit was interesting maybe he doesnt drink at all maybe hes just addicted to strong mints she thought chief inspector lauderdales ambition was interesting and she thought the brothel raid sounded interesting too she wanted to know where the fun was in being whipped or dressed in nappies or having sex with a scubadiver rebus admitted hed no answer suck it and see was brian holmes contribution it earned him a cushion over the head by quarter past eleven rebus knew two things one was that he was too drunk to drive the other was that even if he could drive or be driven hed not know his destination oxford terrace or his own flat in marchmont where these days did he live he imagined himself parking the car on lothian road halfway between the two addresses and kipping there but the decision was made for him by nell the bed in the spare rooms made up we need someone to christen it so we can start calling it the guest bedroom might as well be you her quiet authority was not to be challenged rebus shrugged his acceptance a little later she went to bed herself holmes switched on the tv but found nothing there worth watching so he turned on the hifi instead i havent got any jazz he admitted knowing rebuss tastes but how about this it was sergeant pepper rebus nodded if i cant get the rolling stones ill always settle for second best so they argued s pop music then talked football for a little while and shop for a bit longer still how much more time do you think doctor curt will take holmes was referring to one of the pathologists regularly used by the police a body had been fished out of the water of leith just below dean bridge suicide accident or murder they were hoping dr curts findings would point the way rebus shrugged some of those tests take weeks brian but actually from what i hear he wont be much longer a day or two maybe and what will he say god knows they shared a smile curt was notorious for his fund of bad jokes and illtimed levity should we stand by to repel puns asked holmes how about this deceased was found near waterfall however study of eyes showed no signs of cataracts rebus laughed thats not bad bit too clever maybe but still not bad they spent a quarter of an hour recalling some of curts true gems before somehow turning the talk to politicsrebus admitted that hed voted only three times in his adult life once labour once snp and once tory holmes seemed to find this funny he asked what the chronological order had been but rebus couldnt remember this too seemed worth a laugh maybe you should try an independent next time like gregor jack you mean rebus shook his head i dont think theres any such thing as an independent in scotland its like living in ireland and trying not to take sides damned hard work and speaking of work some of us have been working today if you dont mind brian i think ill join nell more laughter if you see what i mean sure said holmes on you go i dont feel so bad i might watch a video or something see you in the morning mind you dont keep me awake said rebus with a wink in fact meltdown at the torness reactor couldnt have kept him awake his dreams were full of pastoral scenes skindivers kittens and lastminute goals but when he opened his eyes there was a dark shadowy figure looming over him he pushed himself up on his elbows it was holmes dressed and wearing a denim jacket there was a jangle of car keys from one hand the other hand held a selection of newspapers which he now threw down on to the bed sleep all right oh by the way i dont usually buy these rags but i thought youd be interested breakfastll be ready in ten minutes rebus managed to mumble a few syllables he heaved himself upright and studied the front page of the tabloid in front of him this was what hed been waiting for and he actually felt some of the tension leave his body and his brain the headline was actually subtle jack the lad but the subhead was blunt enough mp nicked in sexden swoop and there was the photograph showing gregor jack on his way down the steps to the waiting van more photos were promised inside rebus turned to the relevant pages a pastyfaced farmer watson a couple of the escorts posing for the cameras and another four shots of jack showing his progress all the way into the van none from the copshop aftermath so presumably hed been spirited away you couldnt hope to spirit this away though photogenic or no ha in the background of one of the photos rebus could make out the cherubic features of detective sergeant brian holmes one for the scrapbook and no mistake there were two more newspapers both telling a similar tale graced by similar sometimes even identical photos the dishonourable member mps vice shame ah the great british sunday headline coined by an elect of teetotal virgins boasting the combined wisdom of solomon and the magnanimity of a zealot rebus could be as prurient as the next man but this stuff was a class above he prised himself out of bed and stood up the alcohol inside him stood up too then it began to pogostick its way around his head red wine and whisky bad news and a chaser what was the phrase never mix the grain and the grape never mind a couple of litres of orange juice would sort him out but first there was the little matter of the fryup nell looked as though shed spent all night in the kitchen she had washed up the debris of the previous night and now was providing a breakfast of hotel proportions cereal toast bacon sausage and egg with a pot of coffee taking pride of place on the dining table only one thing was missing any orange juice rebus suggested sorry said brian i thought the paper shop would have some but theyd run out theres plenty of coffee though tuck in he was busy with another paper a broadsheet this time didnt take them long to stick the knife in did it you mean gregor jack no well what can you expect holmes turned a page strange though he said and let it lie at that wondering whether rebus would know you mean rebus replied its strange that the london sundays knew about operation creeper another page was turned it didnt take long to read a newspaper these days not unless you were interested in the adverts holmes folded the paper into four and laid it down on the table beside him yes he said lifting a piece of toast like i say its strange come on brian papers are always getting tipoffs to juicy stories a copper looking for beer money something like that chances are you raid a posh brothel youre going to come out with some weelkent faces hold on though even as he spoke rebus knew there was something more that night the reporters had been biding their time hadnt they like they knew exactly who or what might be walking out of the door and down the steps holmes was staring at him now what are you thinking rebus asked nothing no nothing at all yet not our business is it and besides this is sunday youre a sly bugger brian holmes ive got a good tutor havent i nell came into the room carrying two plates filled with glistening fried food rebuss stomach pleaded with its owner not to do anything rash anything he would regret later on in the day youre working too hard rebus told nell dont let him treat you like a skivvy dont worry she said i dont but fairs fair brian did wash last nights dishes and hell wash this mornings too holmes groaned rebus opened one of the tabloids and tapped his finger against a photograph better not work him too hard nell not now hes in pictures nell took the paper from him studied it for a moment then shrieked my god brian you look like something off the muppet show holmes was on his feet now too staring over her shoulder and is that what chief superintendent watson looks like he could pass for an aberdeen angus rebus and holmes shared a smile at that he wasnt called farmer for nothing rebus wished the young couple well they had made a commitment to living together they had bought a house together and set up home they seemed content yes he wished them well with all his heart but his brain gave them two or three years at most a policemans lot was not entirely a happy one striving towards inspectorship brian holmes would find himself working still longer hours if he could shut it all out when he got home of an evening or morning fine but rebus doubted the young man would holmes was the type to get involved in a case to let it rule his thinking hours whether on duty or off and that was bad for a relationship bad and often terminal rebus knew more divorced and separated policemen himself included than happily married ones it wasnt just the hours worked it was the way police work itself gnawed into you like a worm burrowing deep eating away from the inside as protection against the worm you wore armour plating more of it perhaps than was necessary and that armour set you apart from friends and family from the civilians ach pleasant thoughts for a sunday morning after all it wasnt all gloom the car had started without a hitch that is without him having to hitch a ride to the nearest garage and there was just enough blue in the sky to send hardy daytrippers off into the country rebus was going on a drive too an aimless tour he told himself a nice day for a drive but he knew where he was headed knew where if not exactly why gregor jack and his wife lived in a large old detached and walled residence on the outskirts of rosebridge a little further south than eskwell a little bit more rural gentry country fields and rolling hills and an apparent moratorium on new building work rebus had no excuse save curiosity for this detour but he was not it seemed alone the jacks house was recognizable by the half dozen cars parked outside its gates and by the posse of reporters who were lounging around chatting to each other or instructing feduplooking photographers on how far they should go morally rather than geographically for that elusive picture clamber on to the wall climb that nearby tree try the back of the house the photographers didnt seem keen but just then something seemed to galvanize them by this time rebus had parked his own car further along the road to one side of the road was a line of perhaps half a dozen houses none of them spectacular in terms of design or size but wonderfully isolated by those high walls long driveways and doubtless vast back gardens the other side of the road was pasture bemused cows and fatlooking sheep some sizeable lambs their voices not yet quite broken the view ended at some steepish hills three or so miles distant it was nice even the troglodyte rebus could appreciate that which was perhaps why the reporters left a more bitter taste than usual beneath his tongue he stood behind them an observer the house was darkstoned reddish from this distance a twostorey construction probably built in the early s tacked on to it at one side was a large garage and in front of the house at the top of the drive sat a white saab one of the series sturdy and reliable not cheap but not showoffish distinctive though a car of distinction a youngish man early thirties a sneer creasing his face was unlocking the gates just wide enough so that a younger woman out of her teens but trying to look ten years older could hand a silver tray to the reporters she spoke louder than she needed to gregor thought you might like some tea there may not be enough cups youll just have to share there are biscuits in the tin no ginger nuts im afraid weve run out there were smiles at this nods of appreciation but throughout questions were being fired off any chance of a word with mr jack can we expect a statement hows he taking it is mrs jack in the house any chance of a word ian is he going to be saying anything this last question was directed at the sneering man who now held up one hand for silence he waited patiently and the silence came then no comment he said and with that he began to close the gates rebus pushed through the goodnatured crush until he was face to face with mr sneer inspector rebus he said could i have a word with mr jack mr sneer and miss teatray seemed highly suspicious even when they accepted and examined rebuss id fair enough hed known of reporters whod try a stunt just like this fake id and all but eventually there was a curt nod and the gates opened again wide enough to allow him to squeeze through the gates were shut again locked with rebus on the inside he had a sudden thought what the hell am i doing the answer was he wasnt sure something about the scene at the gates had made him want to be on the other side of those gates well here he was being led back up the gravel driveway towards the large car the larger house behind it and the garage off to the side being led towards gregor jack mp with whom apparently he wanted a word i believe you want a word inspector no sir just being nosey it wasnt much of an opening line was it watson had warned him before about this this was it a character flaw this need to push his way into the centre of things to become involved to find out for himself rather than accepting somebodys word no matter who that somebody was just passing thought id pay my respects jesus and jack would recognize him wouldnt he from the brothel sitting on the bed while the woman in the bed kicked up her legs screeching with laughter no maybe not hed had other things on his mind after all im ian urquhart gregors constituency agent now that he had his back to the reporters the sneer had left urquharts face what was left was a mixture of worry and bewilderment we got word last night of what was coming ive been here ever since rebus nodded urquhart was compact a bunching of wellkept muscles inside a tailored suit a bit smaller than the mp and a bit less goodlooking in other words just right for an agent he also looked efficient which rebus would say was a bonus this is helen greig gregors secretary urquhart was nodding towards the young woman she gave a quick smile towards rebus helen came over this morning to see if there was anything she could do the tea was my idea actually she said urquhart glanced towards her gregors idea helen he warned oh yes she said reddening efficient and faithful thought rebus rare qualities indeed helen greig like urquhart himself spoke in an educated scots accent which did not really betray county of origin he would hazard at east coast for both of them but couldnt narrow things down any further helen looked either like shed been to an early kirk service or was planning to attend one later on she was wearing a pale woollen twopiece with plain white blouse offset by a simple gold chain around her neck sensible black shoes on her feet and thick black tights she was urquharts height five feet six or seven and shared something of his build you wouldnt call her beautiful youd call her handsome in the way nell stapleton was handsome though the two women were dissimilar in many ways they were passing the saab now urquhart leading was there anything in particular inspector only im sure you can appreciate that gregors hardly in a state it wont take long mr urquhart well in you come then the front door opened and urquhart ushered both rebus and helen greig into the house before him rebus was immediately surprised by how modern the interior was polished pine flooring scatter rugs mackintoshstyle chairs and lowslung italianlooking tables they passed through the hall and into a large room boasting more modern furnishings still pride of place went to a long angular sofa constructed from leather and chrome on which sat in much the same position as when rebus had first met him gregor jack the mp was scratching absentmindedly at a finger and staring at the floor urquhart cleared his throat we have a visitor gregor the effect was that of a talented actor changing roles tragedy to comedy gregor jack stood up and fixed a smile on to his face his eyes now sparkled looking interested his whole face speaking sincerity rebus marvelled at the ease of the transformation detective inspector rebus he said taking the proffered hand inspector what can we do for you here sit down jack gestured towards a squat black chair matching the sofa in design it was like sinking into marshmallow something to drink now jack seemed to remember something and turned to helen greig helen you took the tea out to our friends she nodded excellent cant have the gentlemen of the press going without their elevenses he smiled towards rebus then lowered himself on to the edge of the sofa arms resting on his knees so that the hands remained mobile now inspector what s the problem well sir its really just that i happened to be passing and saw that gang at the gates so i stopped you know why theyre here though rebus was obliged to nod urquhart cleared his throat again were going to prepare a statement for them over lunch he said it probably wont be enough to see them off but it might help you know of course said rebus aware that he had to tread carefully that youve done nothing wrong sir i mean nothing illegal jack smiled again and shrugged it doesnt need to be illegal inspector it just has to be news his hands kept fluttering as did his eyes and head it was as though his mind were elsewhere then something seemed to click you didnt say inspector he said tea or coffee something stronger perhaps rebus shook his head slowly his hangover was a dull presence now no point swaddling it jack raised his soulful eyes to helen greig id love a cup of tea helen inspector youre sure you wont no thank you ian urquhart nodded towards helen greig would you helen said gregor jack what woman rebus wondered would refuse which reminded him your wifes not here then mr jack on holiday jack said quickly weve a cottage in the highlands not much of a place but we like it shes probably there probably then you dont know for sure she didnt make out an itinerary inspector so does she know jack shrugged ive no idea inspector maybe she does shes an insatiable reader of newsprint theres a village nearby stocks the sundays but she hasnt been in touch urquhart didnt bother clearing his throat this time before interrupting theres no phone at the lodge thats what we like about it jack explained cut off from the world but if she knew rebus persisted surely shed get in touch jack sighed and began scratching at his finger again he caught himself doing it and stopped eczema he explained just on the one finger but its annoying all the same he paused liz my wife shes very much a law unto herself inspector maybe shed get in touch maybe she wouldnt shes just as likely not to want to talk about it do you see what i mean another smile a weaker one seeking the sympathy vote jack ran his fingers through his thick dark hair rebus wondered idly whether the perfect teeth were capped maybe the thatch was capped too the opennecked shirt didnt look like chainstore stuff urquhart was still standing or rather was on his feet but in constant movement over to the window to peer through thenet curtains over to a glasstopped table to examine some papers lying there over to a smaller table where the telephone sat disconnected at the wall so that even if mrs jack did try to call neither urquhart nor jack seemed to have thought of that curious the room the taste it displayed seemed to rebus not jacks but his wifes jack looked like a man for older established pieces of furniture safe comfy armchairs and a chesterfield sofa a conservative taste look at the car he chose to drive yes jacks car now there was an idea or rather an excuse an excuse for rebuss presence maybe if we could get that statement out by lunchtime gregor urquhart was saying sooner we dampen thingsdown the better really not very subtle thought rebus the message was state your business and leave rebus knew the question he wanted to ask do you think you were set up wanted to ask but darent he wasnt here officially was a tourist merely about your car mr jack he began only i noticed when i stopped that its sitting there in the drive on full view so as to speak and there are photographers out there if any pictures of your car get into the papers everyone will recognize it in future jack nodded i see what youre getting at inspector yes thank you we hadnt thought of that had we ian better put it in the garage we dont want everyone who reads a newspaper to know what kind of car i drive and its registration rebus added there are all sorts of people out there terrorists people with a grudge plain nutters doesnt do any good thank you inspector the door swung open and helen greig entered carrying two large mugs of tea a far cry from the silver salver routine at the gates she handed one to urquhart and one to gregor jack then removed a slim box from where it had been held between her arm and her side it was a fresh box of ginger nuts rebus smiled lovely helen thanks said gregor jack he eased two biscuits from the packet rebus rose to his feet well he said id better be going like i say i only dropped in i do appreciate it inspector jack had placed mug and biscuits on the floor and was now standing too hand held out again towards rebus a warm strong and unflawed hand i meant to ask do you live in the constituency rebus shook his head one of my colleagues does i was staying with him last night jack raised his head slowly before nodding the gesture could have meant anything ill open the gates for you ian urquhart was saying stay here and drink your tea helen greig said ill see the inspector out if you like helen urquhart said slowly was there a warning in his voice if there was helen greig seemed not to sense it he fished in his pocket for the keys and handed them to her right then rebus said goodbye mr jack mr urquhart he took urquharts hand for a moment and squeezed it but his attention was on the mans left hand wedding ring on one finger and a signet ring on another gregor jacks left hand sported just the one thick band of gold not however on his wedding finger but on the finger next to it the wedding finger was the one with the eczema and helen greig a few trinket rings on both hands but she was neither married nor engaged goodbye helen greig was first out of the house but waited for him beside the car jangling the keys in her right hand have you worked for mr jack long long enough hard work being an mp isnt it i expect he needs to unwind from time to time she stopped and glared at him not you too youre as bad as that lot she gestured with the keys towards the gates and the figures beyond i wont hear a word said against gregor she started walking again more briskly now hes a good employer then hes not like an employer at all my mothers been ill he gave me a bonus in the autumn so i could take her for a wee holiday down the coast thats the sort of man he is there were tears in her eyes but she forced them back the reporters were passing cups between them complaining about sugar or the lack of it they didnt seem to expect much from the approach of the two figures talk to us helen a word with gregor and we can all go home weve got families to think of you know im missing communion joked one of them yes communion with your lunchtime pint returned another one of the local reporters by the accents there werent many of them present had recognized rebus inspector anything to tell us a few ears pricked up at that inspector yes said rebus causing helen greig to stiffen bugger off there were smiles at this and a few groans the gates opened and were about to close leaving rebus on the outside again but he pressed his weight against the gate and leaned towards the young woman his mouth close to her ear i forgot ill have to go back in what i forgot or rather mr jack did he wanted me to check on his wife in case she was taking the news badly he waited for the notion of this to sink in helen greig puckered her lips in a silent o the notion had sunk in only rebus went on i forgot to get the address she stood on her toes and so the newsmen wouldnt hear whispered into his ear deer lodge its between knockandhu and tomnavoulin rebus nodded and allowed her to close and lock the gates his curiosity was not exactly dispelled in fact he was more curious now than when hed gone in knockandhu and tomnavoulin the names of a couple of malt whiskies his head told him never to drink again his heart told him differently damn hed meant to phone patience from holmes house just to let her know he was on his way not that she kept him to an itinerary or anything but all the same he made for the reporter he recognized the local lad chris kemp hello chris got a phone in your car mind if i make a call so said dr patience aitken how was your ménage à trois not bad said rebus before kissing her loudly on the lips how was your orgy she rolled her eyes shop talk and overcooked lasagne you didnt manage home then rebus looked blank i tried phoning marchmont and you werent there either your suit looks like you slept in it blame the bloody cat lucky he was doing the twist all over the jacket till i rescued it the twist nothing shows a mans true age more than his choice of dance step rebus was shedding the suit now you havent got any orange juice have you bit of a sore head time to stop the drinking john time to settle down you mean he pulled off his trousers all right if i take a bath she was studying him you know you dont have to ask no but all the same i like to ask permission granted as always did lucky do that too she was pointing to the scratches on his wrist hed be in the microwave if he had she smiled ill see about the orange juice rebus watched her make for the kitchen he attempted a drymouthed wolfwhistle from nearby one of the budgies showed him how to do it properly patience turned towards the budgie and smiled he lay down in the foaming bath and closed his eyes breathing deeply the way his doctor had told him to relaxation technique hed called it he wanted rebus to relax a bit more high blood pressure nothing serious but all the same of course there were pills he could take betablockers but the doctor was in favour of selfhelp deep relaxation selfhypnosis rebus had had half a mind to tell the doctor that his own father had been a hypnotist that his brother still might be a professional hypnotist somewhere deep breathing emptying the mind relaxing the head the forehead the jaw the neck muscles the chest the arms counting backwards down to zero no stress no strain at first rebus had accused the doctor of pennypinching of not wanting to give out costly drugs but the damned thing seemed to work he could help himself he could help himself to patience aitken here you go she said coming into the bathroom she was holding a long thin glass of orange juice as squeezed by dr aitken rebus slipped a sudsy arm around her buttocks as squeezed by inspector rebus she bent down and kissed him on his head then touched a finger to his hair you need to start using a conditioner john all the lifes going out of your follicles thats because its headed somewhere else she narrowed her eyes down boy she said then before he could make a grab for her again she fled from the bathroom rebus smiling settled further into the bath deep breathing emptying the mind had gregor jack been set up if so who by and to what purpose a scandal of course a political scandal a frontpage scandal but the atmosphere in the jack household had been well strange strained certainly but also cold and edgy as though the worst were still to happen the wife elizabeth something didnt seem right there something seemed very odd indeed background he needed more background he needed to be sure the lodge address was fixed in his mind but from what he knew of highland police stations little good would come of phoning on a sunday background he thought again of chris kemp the reporter yes why not wake up arms wake up chest neck and head sunday was no time to be resting for some people sunday was a day of work patience stuck her head round the door quiet night in this evening she suggested ill cook us a quiet night be damned rebus said rising impressively from the water lets go out for a drink you know me john i dont mind a bit of sleaze but this place is cheapskate sleaze dont you think im worth better rebus pecked patiences cheek placed their drinks on the table and sat down beside her i got you a double he said so i see she picked up the glass not much room for the tonic is there they were seated in the back room of the horsehair public house on broughton street through the doorway could be seen the bar itself noisy as ever people who wanted to have a conversation seemed to place themselves like duellists a good ten paces away from the person they wanted to talk with the result was that a lot of shouting went on producing much crossfire and more crossed wires it was noisy but it was fun the back room was quieter it was a ushaped arrangement of squashy seating around the walls and rickety chairs the narrow lozengeshaped tables were fixed to the floor rumour had it that the squashy seating had been stuffed with horsehair in the s and not restuffed since thus the horsehair whose real and prosaic name had long since been discarded patience poured half a small bottle of tonic water into her gin while rebus supped on a pint of ipa cheers she said without enthusiasm then i know damned fine that theres got to be a reason for this i mean a reason why were here i suppose its to do with your work rebus put down the glass yes he said she raised her eyes to the nicotinecoloured ceiling give me strength she said it wont take long rebus said i thought afterwards we could go somewhere a bit more your style dont patronize me you pig rebus stared into his drink thinking about that statements various meanings then he caught sight of a new customer in the bar and waved through the doorway a young man came forwards smiling tiredly dont often see you in here inspector rebus he said sit down said rebus its my round patience let me introduce you to one of scotlands finest young reporters chris kemp rebus got up and headed for the bar chris kemp pulled over a chair and having tested it first eased himself on to it he must want something he said to patience nodding towards the bar he knows im a sucker for a bit of flattery not that it was flattery chris kemp had won awards for his early work on an aberdeen evening paper and had then moved to glasgow there to be voted young journalist of the year before arriving in edinburgh where he had spent the past year and a half stirring it as he said himself everyone knew hed one day head south he knew it himself it was inescapable there didnt seem to be much left for him to stir in scotland the only problem was his student girlfriend who wouldnt graduate for another year and wouldnt think of moving south before then if ever by the time rebus returned from the bar patience had been told all of this and more there was a film over her eyes which chris kemp for all his qualities could not see he talked and as he talked she was thinking is john rebus worth all this is he worth the effort i seem to have to make she didnt love him that was understood love was something that had happened to her a few times in her teens and twenties and even yes in her thirties always with inconclusive or atrocious results so that nowadays it seemed to her love could as easily spell the end of a relationship as its beginning she saw it in her surgery she saw men and women but mostly women made ill from love from loving too much and not being loved enough in return they were every bit as sick as the child with earache or the pensioner suffering angina she had pity and words for them but no medicines time heals she might say in an unguarded moment yes heals into a callus over the wound hard and protective just like she felt hard and protective but did john rebus need her solidity her protection here we are he said on his return the barmans slow tonight sorry chris kemp accepted the drink with a thin smile ive just been telling patience oh god rebus thought as he sat down she looks like a bucketful of ice i shouldnt have brought her but if id said i was popping out for the evening on my own well shed have been the same get this over and done with maybe the night can be rescued so chris he said interrupting the young man whats the dirt on gregor jack chris kemp seemed to think there was plenty and the introduction of gregor jack into the conversation perked patience up a bit so that she forgot for a time that she wasnt enjoying herself rebus was interested mostly in elizabeth jack but kemp started with the mp himself and what he had to say was interesting here was a different jack different from the public image the received opinion but different too from rebuss own ideas having met with the man he would not for example have taken jack for a drinker terrible one for the whisky kemp was saying probably more than half a bottle a day more when hes in london by all accounts he never looks drunk thats because he doesnt get drunk but he drinks all the same what else there was more plenty more hes a smooth operator but cunning deep down cunning i wouldnt trust him further than i can spit i know someone who knew him at university says gregor jack never did anything in his life that wasnt premeditated and that goes for capturing mrs gregor jack how do you mean story is they met at university at a party gregor had seen her around before but hadnt paid much attention once he knew she was rich though that was another matter he went at it full throttle charmed the pants off her he turned to patience sorry poor choice of words patience on her second g and t merely bowed her head a little hes calculating you see remember he was trained as an accountant and hes got an accountants mind all right what are you having but rebus was rising no chris let me get them but kemp wouldnt hear of it dont think im telling you all this for the price of a couple of beers inspector and when the drinks had been bought and brought to the table it was this train of thought which seemed to occupy kemp why do you want to know anyway rebus shrugged is there a story could be early days they were talking now as professionals the meaning was all in what was left unsaid but there might be a story if there is chris as far as im concerned its yours kemp gulped at his beer i was out there all day you know and all we got was a statement plain and simple no further comment to make et cetera the story ties in with jack rebus shrugged again early days that was interesting what you were saying about mrs jack but kemps eyes were cool i get the story first rebus massaged his neck as far as im concerned kemp seemed to size the offer up as rebus himself knew there was almost no offer there for the sizing then kemp placed his glass on the table he was ready to say a little more what jack didnt know about liz ferric was that she ran with a very fast crowd a rich fast crowd people like her it took gregor quite a while before he was able to insinuate his way into the group a workingclass kid remember still gangly and a bit awkward but it happened he had liz hooked where he went she would et cetera and jack had his own gang still does i dont follow old school friends mostly a few people he met at university his circle you could call it one of them runs a bookshop doesnt he kemp nodded thats ronald steele known to the gang as suey thats why his shops called suey books funny nickname said patience i dont know how he came by it admitted kemp id like to know but i dont who else is there asked rebus im not sure how many there are altogether the interesting ones are rab kinnoul and andrew macmillan rab kinnoul the actor the very same thats funny ive got to talk to him or rather to his wife oh kemp was sniffing his story but rebus shook his head nothing to do with jack some stolen books mrs kinnoul is a bit of a collector not prof costellos missing hoard thats it kemp was nothing if not a newsman any progress rebus shrugged dont tell me said kemp its early days yet and he laughed and patience laughed with him but something had just struck rebus not the andrew macmillan surely kemp nodded they were at school together christ rebus stared at the plastictopped table kemp was explaining to patience who andrew macmillan was a very successful somethingorother went off his head one day toddled off home and sawed off his wifes head patience gasped i remember that she said they never found the head did they kemp shook his own firmly fixed head hed have done his daughter in too but the kid ran for her life shes a bit dotty now herself and no wonder whatever happened to him rebus wondered aloud it had been several years ago and in glasgow not edinburgh not his territory oh said kemp hes in that new psychiatric place the one theyve just built you mean duthilsaid patience thats it up in the highlands near grantown isnt it well thought rebus curiouser and curiouser his geography wasnt brilliant but he didnt think grantown was too far from deer lodge is jack still in touch with him it was kemps turn to shrug no idea and they were at school together thats the story to be honest i think liz jack is the more interesting character by far jacks sidekicks are scrupulous in keeping her out of the way yes why is that because shes still the proverbial wild child still runs around with her old crowd jamie kilpatrick matilda merriman all that sort parties booze drugs orgies god knows the press never gets a sniff he turned again to patience if youll pardon the phrase not a sniff do we get and anything we do get is blue pencilled with a fair amount of prejudice oh well editors are nervous at the best of times arent they and youve got to remember that sir hugh ferric is never slow with a libel suit where his familys concerned you mean that electronics factory case in point so what about this old crowd of mrs jacks aristos mostly old money some new money what about the lady herself well she certainly spurred jack on in the early days i think he always wanted to go into politics and mps can hardly afford not to be married people start to suspect a shirtlifting tendency my guess is he looked for someone pretty with money and with a father of influence found her and wasnt going to let go and its been a successful marriage so far as the publics concerned liz gets wheeled out for the photo opportunities and looks just right then she disappears again completely different to gregor you see fire and ice shes the fire hes the ice usually with whisky added kemp was in a talkative mood tonight there was more but it was speculation still it was interesting to be given a different perspective wasnt it rebus considered this as he excused himself and visited the gents the horsehairs troughlike urinal was brimful of liquid as had always to rebuss knowledge been the case the condensation on the overhead cistern dripped unerringly on to the heads of those unwise enough to get too close and the graffiti was mostly the work of a dyslexic bigot remember there was some new stuff though written in biro the drunk as a lords prayer rebus read our father which are in heavy alload be they name rebus reckoned that if he didnt have all he needed he had all chris kemp was able to give no reason to linger then no reason at all he came out of the gents briskly and saw that a young man had stopped at the table to chat with patience he was moving away now back to the main bar while patience smiled a farewell in his direction who was that rebus asked not sitting down he lives next door in oxford terrace patience said casually works in trading standards im surprised you havent met him rebus murmured something then tapped his watch with his finger chris he said this is all your fault youre too interesting by half we were supposed to be at the restaurant twenty minutes ago kevin and myra will kill us come on patience listen chris ill be in touch meantime he leaned closer to the reporter lowering his voice see if you can find who tipped off the papers about the brothel raid that might be the start of the story he straightened up again see you soon eh cheers cheerio chris said patience sliding out of her seat oh right bye then see you and chris kemp found himself alone wondering if it was something that hed said outside patience turned to rebus kevin and myra she said our oldest friends explained rebus and as good a getout clause as anything besides i did promise you dinner you can tell me all about our nextdoor neighbour he took her arm in his and they walked back to the car her car patience had neverseen john rebus jealous before so it was hard to tell but she could have sworn he was jealous now well well wonders would never cease treacherous steps springtime in edinburgh a freezing wind and nearhorizontal rain ah the edinburgh wind that joke of a wind that black farce of a wind making everyone walk like mime artists making eyes water and then drying the tears to a crust on rednipped cheeks and throughout it all that slightly sour yeasty smell in the air the smell of notsodistant breweries there had been a frost overnight even the prowling furcoated lucky had yowled at the bedroom window demanding entry the birds had been chirping as rebus let him in he checked his watch two thirty why the hell were the birds singing so early when he next awoke at six theyd stopped maybe they were trying to avoid the rush hour this subzero morning it had taken him a full five minutes to start his clown of a car maybe it was time to get one of those red noses for the radiator grille and the frost had swollen the cracks in the steps up to great london road police station swollen and then fissured so that rebus stepped warily over wafers of stone treacherous steps nothing would be done about them the rumours were still rife anyway rumours that great london road was shagged out wabbit past its sellby rumours that it would be shut down a prime site after all prime land for another hotel or office block and the staff split up so the rumours went with most of them being transferred to st leonards the divisional hq central much closer to rebuss flat in marchmont but much further from oxford terrace and dr patience aitken rebus had made himself a little pact a sort of contract in his head if within the next month or two the rumours became fact then it was a message from on high a message that he should not move in with patience but if great london road remained a going concern or if they were moved to fettes hq five minutes from oxford terrace what then what then the fine print on the contract was still being decided morning john hello arthur any messages the duty desk sergeant shook his head rebus rubbed his hands over his ears and face thawing them out and climbed the stairs towards his room where treacherous linoleum replaced treacherous stone and then there was the treacherous telephone rebus here john it was the voice of chief superintendent watson can you spare a minute rebus made noisy show of rustling some papers on his desk hoping watson would think hed been in the office for hours hard at work well sir dont piss about john i tried you five minutes ago rebus stopped shuffling papers ill be right along sir thats right you will and with that the phone went dead rebus shrugged off his weatherproof jacket the one which always let water in at the shoulders he felt the shoulders of his suitjacket sure enough they were damp matching his enthusiasm for a mondaymorning meeting with the farmer he took a deep breath and spread his hands in front of him like an oldtime song and dance man its showtime he told himself only five working days till the weekend then he made a quick phone call to dufftown police station and asked them to check on deer lodge is that dear asked the voice ddouble er corrected rebus thinking but it probably was dear enough when they bought it anything were looking for in particular an mps wife leftovers from a sex orgy flour bags full of cocaine no said rebus nothing special just let me know what you find right you are it might take a while soon as you can eh and so saying rebus remembered that he should be elsewhere soon as you can chief superintendent watson was as blunt as a tramps razor blade what the hell were you doing at gregor jacks yesterday rebus was almost caught off guard almost whos been telling tales never mind that just give me a bloody answer pause coffee i wouldnt say no watsons wife had bought him the coffeemaker as a christmas present maybe as a hint that he should cut down his consumption of teachers whisky maybe so that hed stand a chance of being sober when he returned home of an evening all it had done so far though was make watson hyperactive of a morning in the afternoon however after a few lunchtime nips drowsiness would take over best therefore to avoid watson in the mornings best to wait until afternoon to ask him about that leave you were thinking of taking or to tell him the news of the latest bodged operation if you were lucky youd get off with a tuttut but the mornings the mornings were different rebus accepted the mug of strong coffee half a packet of espresso looked as though it had been tipped into the generous filter now it tipped itself into rebuss bloodstream sounds stupid sir but i was just passing youre right said watson settling down behind his desk it does sound stupid even supposing you were just passing well sir to be honest there was a little more to it than that watson sat back in his chair holding the mug in both hands and waited for the story doubtless he was thinking thisll be good but rebus had nothing to gain by lying i like gregor jack he said i mean i like him as an mp hes always seemed to me to be a bloody good mp i felt a bit well i thought it was bad timing us happening to bust that brothel the same time he was there bad timing did he really believe that was all there was to it so when i did happen to be passing id stayed the night at sergeant holmes new house he lives in jacks constituency i thought id stop and take a look there were a lot of reporters about the place i dont know exactly why i stopped but then i saw that jacks car was sitting out on the drive in full view i reckoned that was dangerous i mean if a photo of it got into the papers everybodyd know jacks car right down to its number plate you cant be too safe can you so i went in and suggested the car be moved into the garage rebus stopped that was all there was to it wasnt it well it was enough to be going on with watson was looking thoughtful he took another injection of coffee before speaking youre not alone john i feel guilty myself about operation creeper not that theres anything to feel guilty about you understand but all the same and now the press are on to the story theyll keep on it till the poor buggers forced to resign rebus doubted this jack hadnt looked like a man ready or willing or about to resign if we can help jack watson paused again wanting to catch rebuss eye he was warning rebus that this was all unofficial all unwritten but that it had already been discussed at some level far above rebus himself perhaps even above watson had the chief super been rapped over the knuckles by the high heidyins themselves if we can help him he was saying id like him to get that help if you see what i mean john i think so sir sir hugh feme had powerful friends rebus was beginning to wonder just how powerful right then just the one thing sir who gave you the info about the brothel watson was shaking his head even before rebus had finished the question cant tell you that john i know what youre thinking youre wondering if jack was set up well if he was it had nothing to do with my informant i can promise you that no if jack was set up the question that needs answering is why he was there in the first place not why we were there but the papers knew too i mean they knew about operation creeper watson was nodding now again nothing to do with my informant but yes ive been thinking about that it had to be one of us hadnt it someone on the team so nobody else knew when it was planned for watson seemed to hold his breath for a moment then shook his head he was lying of course rebus could see that no point probing further not yet at any rate there would be a reason behind the lie and that reason would come out in good time right now and for no reason he could put his finger on rebus was more worried about mrs jack worried well maybe not quite worried maybe not even concerned call it call it interested yes that was it he was interested in her any progress on those missing books what missing books oh those missing books he shrugged weve talked to all the booksellers the list is doing the rounds we might even get a mention in the trade magazines i shouldnt think any bookseller is going to touch them meantime well there are the private collectors still to be interviewed one of thems the wife of rab kinnoul the actor the very same lives out towards south queensferry his wife collects first editions better try to get out there yourself john dont want to send a constable out to see rab kinnoul right sir it was the answer hed wanted he drained his mug his nerves were already sizzling like bacon in a pan anything else but watson had finished with him and was rising to replenish his own mug this stuffs addictive he was saying as rebus left the office but by god it makes me feel full of beans rebus didnt know whether to laugh or cry rab kinnoul was a professional hit man he had made his name initially through a series of roles on television the scottish immigrant in a london sitcom the young village doctor in a farming serial with the occasional guest spot on more substantial fare such as the sweeney playing a glasgow runaway or the drama series knife ledge where he played a hired killer it was this last part which swung things for kinnoul noticed by a londonbased casting director he was approached and screentested for the part of the assassin in a lowbudget british thriller which went on to do surprising business picking up good notices in the usa as well as in europe the films director was soon persuaded to move to hollywood and he in turn persuaded his producers that rab kinnoul would be ideal for the part of the gangster in an elmore leonard adaptation so kinnoul went to hollywood played minor roles in a series of major and minor murder flicks and was again a success he possessed a face and eyes into which could be read anything simply anything if you thought he should be evil he was evil if you thought he should be psychotic he was psychotic he was cast in these roles and he fitted them but if things had taken a different turning in his career he might just as easily have ended up as the romantic lead the sympathetic friend the hero of the piece now hed settled back in scotland there was talk that he was reading scripts was about to set up his own film company was retiring rebus couldnt quite imagine retiring at thirtynine at fifty maybe but not at thirtynine what would you do all day driving towards kinnouls home just outside south queensferry the answer came to him you could spend all day every day painting the exterior of your house supposing that is it was the size of rab kinnouls house like the forth rail bridge by the time youd finished painting it the first bit would be dirty again which was to say that it was a very large house even from a distance it sat on a hillside its surroundings fairly bleak long grass and a few blasted trees a river ran nearby discharging into the firth of forth since there was no sign of a fence separating house from surroundings rebus reckoned kinnoul must own the lot the house was modern if the s could still be considered modern styled like a bungalow but about five times the scale it reminded rebus mostly of those swiss chalets you saw on postcards except that the chalets were always finished in wood whereas this house was finished in harling ive seen better council houses he whispered to himself as he parked on the pebbled driveway getting out of the car he did however begin to see one of the houses attractions the view both spectacular forth bridges not too far away at all the firth itself sparkling and calm and the sun shining on green and pleasant fife across the water you couldnt see rosyth but over to the east could just about be made out the seaside town of kirkcaldy where gregor jack and presumably rab kinnoul had been schooled no said mrs kinnoul cath kinnoul as she walked a little later into the sitting room people are always making that mistake she had come to the door while rebus was still staring admiring the view he grinned back at her is that kirkcaldy over there i think so yes rebus turned and started up the steps towards the front door there were rockeries and neat borders to either side of them mrs kinnoul looked the type to enjoy gardening she wore homely clothes and a homely smile her hair had been permed into waves but pulled back and held with a clasp at the back there was something of the s about her he didnt know what hed been expecting some hollywood blonde perhaps but certainly hed not been expecting this im cath kinnoul she held out a hand im sorry ive forgotten your name hed phoned of course to warn of his visit to make sure someone would be at home detective inspector rebus he said thats right she said well come in of course the whole thing could have been done by telephone the following rare books have been stolen has anyone approached you if anyone should please contact us immediately but like any other policeman rebus liked to see who and what he was dealing with people often gave something away when you were there in person they were flustered edgy not that cath kinnoul looked flustered she came into the sitting room with a tray of tea things rebus had been staring out of the picture window drinking in the scene your husband went to school in kirkcaldy didnt he and then shed said no people are always making that mistake i think because of gregor jack you know the mp she placed the tray on a coffee table rebus had turned from the window and was studying the room there were framed photographs of rab kinnoul on the walls stills from his movies there were also photos of actors and actresses rebus supposed he should know the photos were signed the room seemed to be dominated by a thirtyeightinch television atop which sat a video recorder to either side of the tv piled high on the floor were videotapes sit down inspector sugar just milk please you were saying about your husband and gregor jack oh yes well i suppose because theyre both in the media on television i mean people tend to think they must know one another and dont they she laughed oh yes yes they know one another but only through me people get their stories mixed up i suppose so it started to appear in the papers and magazines that rab and gregor went to school together which is nonsense rab went to school in dundee it was me that went to school with i gregor and we went to university together too so not even the cream of young scottish reporters always got it right rebus accepted the china cup and saucer with a nod of thanks i was plain catherine gow then of course i met rab later when he was already working in television he was doing a play in edinburgh i bumped into him in the bar after a performance she was stirring her tea absentmindedly im cath kinnoul now rab kinnouls wife hardly anyone calls me gowk any more gowk rebus thought hed misheard she looked up at him that was my nickname we all had nicknames gregor was beggar and ronald steele was suey she stopped stirring and looked at him as though seeing him for the first time thats right but how its what his shops called rebus explained this being the truth oh yes she said well anyway about these books three things struck rebus one was that there seemed precious few books around for someone who was supposedly a collector the second was that hed rather talk some more about gregor jack the third was that cath kinnoul was on drugs tranquillizers of some kind it was taking a second too long for her lips to form each word and her eyelids had a droop to them valium moggies even yes he said the books then he looked around him any actor would have known it for a cheap effect mr kinnouls not at home just now she smiled most people just call him rab they think if theyve seen him on television they know him and knowing him gives them the right to call him rab mr kinnoul i can see youre a policeman she almost wagged a finger at him but thought better of it and drank her tea instead she held the delicate cup by its body rather than by the awkward handle drained it absolutely dry and exhaled thirsty this morning she said im sorry what were you saying you were telling me about gregor jack she looked surprised was i rebus nodded yes thats right i read about it in the papers horrible things they were saying about him and liz mrs jack lizyes whats she like cath kinnoul seemed to shiver she got up slowly and placed her empty cup on the tray more tea rebus shook his head she poured milk lots of sugar and then a trickle of tea into her cup thirsty she said this morning she went to the window holding the cup in both hands liz is her own woman youve got to admire her for that it cant be easy living with a man whos in the public eye he hardly sees her hes away a lot you mean well yes but shes away a lot too she has her own life her own friends do you know her well no no i wouldnt say that you wouldnt believe what we got up to at school whod have thought she touched the window do you like the house inspector this was an unexpected turn in the conversation itser big isnt it rebus answered plenty of room seven bedrooms she said rab bought it from some rock star i dont think hed have bothered if it hadnt been a stars home what do we need seven bedrooms for theres only the two of us oh heres rab now rebus came to the window a landrover was bumping up the driveway there was a heavy figure in the front hands clenching the wheel the landrover gave a squeal as it stopped about these books said rebus suddenly an efficient official you collect books i believe rare books yes first editions mostly cath kinnoul too was starting to play another part this time the woman whos helping police with their the front door opened and closed cath whose cars that in the drive rab kinnoul came massively into the room he was six feet two tall and probably weighed fifteen stone his chest was huge a predominantly red tartan shirt stretched across it he wore baggy brown corduroys tied at the waist with a thin straining belt hed started growing a reddish beard and his brown hair was longer than rebus remembered curling over his ears he looked expectantly at rebus who came towards him inspector rebus sir kinnoul looked surprised then relieved then rebus thought worried the problem was those eyes they didnt seem to change did they so that rebus began to wonder whether the surprise relief and worry were in kinnouls mind or in his own inspector whats i mean is there something wrong no no sir its just that some books have been stolen rare books and were going around talking to private collectors oh now kinnoul broke into a grin rebus didnt think hed seen him grin in any of his tv or film roles he could see why the grin changed kinnoul from ominous heavy into overgrown teenager lighting his face making it innocent and benign so its cath you want then he looked over rebuss shoulder at his wife all right cath fine rab kinnoul looked at rebus again the grin had disappeared maybe youd like to see the library inspector cath and you can have a chat in there thank you sir rebus took the back roads on his way into edinburgh they were nicer certainly quieter hed learned very little in the kinnouls library except that kinnoul felt protective towards his wife so protective that hed felt unable to leave rebus alone with her what was he afraid of he had stalked the library had pretended to browse and sat down with a book all the time listening as rebus asked his simple questions and left the simple list and asked cath kinnoul to be on the lookout and shed nodded fingering the xeroxed sheet of paper the library in fact was an upper room of the house probably intended at one time as a bedroom two walls had been fitted with shelves most of them sheeted with sliding glass doors and behind these sheets of glass sat a dull collection of books dull to rebuss eyes but they seemed enough to bring cath kinnoul out of her daydreams she pointed out some of the exhibits to rebus fine first edition rebound in calfskin some pages still uncut just think that book was printed in but if i cut open those pages id be the first person ever to read them oh and thats a creech edition of burns first time burns was published in edinburgh and ive some modern books too theres muriel spark midnights children george orwell have you read them all she looked at rebus as though hed asked her about her sexual preferences kinnoul interrupted caths a collector inspector he came over and put his arm around her it could have been stamps or porcelain or old china dolls couldnt it love but its books she collects books he gave her a squeeze she doesnt read them she collects them rebus shook his head now tapping his fingers against the steering wheel hed shoved a rolling stones tape into the cars cassette player an aid to constructive thought on the one hand you had professor costello with his marvellous library the books read and reread worth a fortune but still there for the borrowing for the reading and on the other hand there was cath kinnoul he didnt quite know why he felt so sorry for her it couldnt be easy being married towell shed said it herself hadnt she except that shed been talking about elizabeth jack rebus was intrigued by mrs jack more he was becoming fascinated by her he hoped he would meet her soon the call from dufftown came just as he got into the office on the stairs hed been told of another rumour by the middle of next week there would be official notification that great london road was to close then back i go to marchmont rebus thought the telephone was ringing it was always ringing either just as he was coming in or else just as he was about to go out he could sit in his chair for hours and never once hello rebus here there was a pause and enough snapcrackle over the line for the call to be transsiberian is that inspector rebus rebus sighed and fell into his chair speaking hello sir this is a terrible line its constable moffat you wanted someone to go to deer lodge rebus perked up thats right well sir ive just been over there and and there was a noise like an excited geiger counter rebus held the receiver away from his ear when the noise had stopped the constable was still speaking i dont know what more i can tell you sir you can tell me the whole bloody lot again for a start rebus said the line went supernova for a minute there constable moffat began again articulating his words as though in conversation with a retard i was saying sir that i went over to deer lodge but theres no one at home no car outside i had a look through the windows id say someone had been there at some time looked like thered been a bit of a party wine bottles and glasses and stuff but theres no one there at the minute did you ask any of the neighbours as he said it rebus knew this to be a stupid question the constable was already laughing there arent any neighbours sir the nearest would be mr and mrs kennoway but theyre a mile hike the other side of thehills i see and theres nothing else you can tell me not that i can think of if there was anything in particular i mean i know the lodge is owned by that mp and i saw in the papers no rebus was quick to say nothing to do with that he didnt want more rumours being tossed around like so many cabers at a highland games just wanted a word with mrs jack we thought she might be up there aye shes up this way occasionally so i hear well if you hear anything else let me know wont you goes without saying sir which rebus supposed it did the constable sounded a bit hurt and thanks for your help rebus added but received only a curt aye before the phone went dead fuck you too pal he said to himself before going off in search of gregor jacks home telephone number of course there was an almighty chance that the phone would still be unplugged still it was worth a try the number itself would be on computer but rebus reckoned hed be quicker looking for it in the filing cabinet and sure enough he found a sheet of paper headed parliamentary constituencies in edinburgh and lothians on which were given the home addresses and telephone numbers of the areas eleven mps he punched in the ten numbers waited and was rewarded with the ringing tone not that that meant hello is that mr urquhart im sorry mr urquharts not here right at the moment but of course by now rebus recognized the voice is that you mr jack its inspector rebus here we met yester why yes hello inspector youre in luck we plugged the phone back in this morning and ians spent all day taking calls hes just taken a break he thought we should unplug the thing again but i plugged it back in myself when hed gone i hate to think im completely cut off my constituents after all might need to get what about miss greig shes working work must go on inspector theres an office to the back of the house where she does the typing and so on helens really been a and mrs jack any news now the flow seemed to have dried up there was a parched cough rebus could visualize a readjustment of facial features maybe even a scratching of finger a running of fingers through hair why yes funny you should mention it she phoned this morning oh yes poor love said shed been trying for hours but of course the phone was disconnected all day sunday and busy most of today shes at your cottage then thats right yes spending a week there i told her to stay put no point in her getting dragged into all this rubbish is there itll soon blow over my solicitor weve checked deer lodge mr jack another pause then oh she doesnt seem to be there no sign of life there was sweat beneath the collar of rebuss shirt he could blame it on the heating of course but he knew the heating wasnt all to blame where was this leading what was he wandering into oh a statement this time a deflated sound i see mr jack is there anything youd like to tell me yes inspector there is i suppose carefully would you like me to come over yes all right ill be there as soon as i can just sit tight all right no answer all right mr jack yes but gregor jack didnt sound it of course rebuss car wouldnt start the sound it made was more and more like an emphysema patients last hacking laugh herkaherkaherkaka herkaherkaher having trouble this was yelled from across the car park by brian holmes waving and about to get into his own car rebus slammed his car door shut and walked briskly over to where holmes was just with a firsttime turn of the ignition starting his metro off home yes a nod towards rebuss doomed car doesnt sound as if you are want a lift as it happens brian yes and you can come along for the ride if you like i dont get it rebus was trying to open the passengerside door without success holmes hesitated a moment before unlocking it its my turn to cook tonight he said nellll be up to high doh if im late rebus settled into the passenger seat and pulled the seatbelt down across his chest ill tell you all about it on the way the way where not far from where you live you wont be late honest ill get a car to bring me back into town but id quite like your attendance holmes wasnt slow careful yes but never slow you mean the male member he said whats he done this time i shudder to think brian believe me i shudder to think there were no pressmen patrolling the gates and the gates themselves were unlocked the car had been put away in the garage leaving the driveway clear they left holmes car sitting on the main road outside quite a place holmes commented wait till you see inside its like a film set ingmar bergman or something holmes shook his head i still cant believe it he said you coming out here yesterday barging your way in hardly barging brian now listen im going to have a word with jack you sniff around see if anything smells rotten you mean literally rotten im not expecting to find decomposing bodies in the flower beds if thats what youre thinking no just keep your eyes open and your ears keen and my nose wet if you havent got a handkerchief on you yes they separated rebus to the front door holmes around to the side of the house towards the garage rebus rang the doorbell it was nearly six no doubt helen greig would be on her way home but it was helen greig who answered the door hello she said come in gregors in the living room you know the way indeed i do keeping you busy is he he laid a finger on the face of his wristwatch oh yes she said smiling hes a real slavemaster an unkind image came to rebus then of jack in leather gear and helen greig on a leash he blinked it away does he seem all right who gregor she gave a quiet laugh he seems fine under the circumstances why just wondering thats all she thought for a moment seemed about to say something then remembered her place can i get you anything no thanks right see you later then and off she went back past the curving staircase back to her office to the rear of the house damn he hadnt told holmes about her if holmes peered in through the office window oh well if he heard a scream hed know what had happened he opened the living room door gregor jack was alone alone and listening to his hifi the volume was low but rebus recognized the rolling stones it was the album hed been listening to earlier let it bleed jack rose from his leather sofa a glass of whisky in one hand inspector you didnt take long youve caught me indulging in my secret vice well we all have one secret vice dont we rebus thought again of the scene at the brothel and jack seemed to read his mind for he gave an embarrassed smile rebus shook the proffered hand he noticed that a plaster had been stuck on the left hands offending finger one secret vice and one tiny flaw jack saw him noticing eczema he explained and seemed about to say more yes you said did i yesterday youll have to forgive me inspector i dont usually repeat myself but what with yesterday and everything understood past jack rebus noticed a card standing on the mantelpiece it hadnt been there yesterday jack realized he had a glass in his hand can i offer you a drink you can sir and i accept whisky all right i dont think theres much else whatever youre having mr jack and for some reason he added i like the rolling stones myself their earlier stuff agreed said jack the music scene these days its all rubbish isnt it hed gone over to the wall to the left of the fireplace where glass shelves held a series of bottles and glasses as he poured rebus walked over to the table where yesterday urquhart had been fussing with some papers there were letters waiting to be signed all with the house of commons portcullis at the head and some notes relating to parliamentary business this job jack was saying approaching with rebuss drink really is what you make of it there are some mps who do the minimum necessary and believe me thats still plenty cheers cheers they both drank then there are those said jack who go for the maximum they do their constituency work and they become involved in the parliamentary process the wider world they debate they write they attend and which camp do you belong to sir he talks too much rebus was thinking and yet he says so little straight down the middle said jack steering a course with his flattened hand here sit down thank you sir they both sat rebus on the chair jack on the sofa rebus had noticed straight away that the whisky was watered and he wondered by whom and did jack know about it now then said rebus you said on the phone that there was something jack used a remote control to switch off the music he aimed the remote at the wall it seemed to rebus there was no hifi system in sight i want to get things straight about my wife inspector he said about liz i am worried about her i admit it i didnt want to say anything before why not sir so far the speech sounded well prepared but then hed had over an hour in which to prepare it soon enough it would run out rebus could be patient he wondered where urquhart was publicity inspector ian calls liz my liability i happen to think hes going a bit far but liz is well not quite temperamental you think she saw the newspapers almost certainly she always buys the tabloids its the gossip she likes but she hasnt been in touch no no she hasnt and thats a bit strange wouldnt you say jack creased his face yes and no inspector i mean i dont know what to think shes capable of just laughing the whole thing off but then again you think she might harm herself sir harm herself jack was slow to understand you mean suicide no i dont think so no not that but if she felt embarrassed she might simply disappear or something could have happened to her an accident god knows what if she got angry enough its just possible he bowed his head again elbows resting on his knees do you think its police business sir jack looked up with glinting eyes thats the crux isnt it if i report her missing i mean report her officially and shes found and it turns out she was simply keeping out of things does she seem the type who would stay out of things sir rebuss thoughts were spinning now someone had set jack up but not his wife surely sunday newspaper thoughts but still they worried him jack shrugged not really its hard to tell with liz shes changeable well sir we could make a few discreet inquiries up north check hotels guest houses it would have to be hotels inspector where liz is concerned expensive hotels okay then we check hotels ask around any friends she might visit not many rebus waited wondering if jack would change his mind after all there was always andrew macmillan the murderer someone she probably knew someone nearby but jack merely shrugged and repeated not many well a list would help sir you might even contact them yourself you know just phoning for a chat if mrs jack was there theyd be bound to tell you unless shed told them not to well that was true but then jack was saying if it turned out shed been off to one of the islands and hadnt heard a thing politics it was all about politics in the end rebus was coming to respect gregor jack less but in a strange way like him more he rose and walked over towards the shelf unit ostensibly to put his glass there at the mantelpiece he stopped by the card and picked it up the front was a cartoon showing a young man in an opentopped sports car champagne in an ice bucket on the passenger seat the message above read good luck inside was another message written in felt pen never fear the pack is with you there were six signatures schoolfriends jack was saying he came over to stand beside rebus and a couple from university days weve stuck pretty close over the years a few of the names rebus recognized but he was happy to look puzzled and let jack provide the information gowk thats cathy gow shes cath kinnoul now kinnoul as in rab the actor his finger drifted to the next signature tampon is tom pond hes an architect in edinburgh bilbo thats bill fisher works in london for some magazine he was always daft on tolkien jacks voice had become soft with sentiment rebus was thinking of the schoolfriends hed kept up with a grand total of none suey is ronnie steele why suey jack smiled im not sure i should tell you ronnie would kill me he considered for a moment gave a mellow shrug well we were on a school trip to switzerland and a girl went into ronnies room and found him doing something she went and told everyone about it and ronnie was so embarrassed that he ran outside and lay down in the road he said he was going to kill himself only no cars came past so eventually he got up and suicide abbreviates to suey thats right jack studied the card again sexton thats alice blake sexton blake you see a detective like yourself jack smiled alice works in london too something to do with pr and what about rebus was pointing to the last secret name mack jacks face changed oh thats andy macmillan and what does mr macmillan do these days mack rebus was thinking as in mack the knife grimly apt jack was aloof hes in prison i believe tragic story tragic in prison rebus was keen to pursue the subject but jack had other ideas he pointed to the names on the card notice anything inspector yes rebus had though he hadnt been going to mention it now he did the names are all written by the same person jack gave a quick smile bravo well mr macmillans in prison and mr fisher and miss blake could hardly have signed could they living in london the story only broke yesterday ah yes good point so who cathy she used to be an expert forger though you might not think it to look at her she used to have all our signatures off by heart but mr pond lives in edinburgh couldnt he have signed his own i think hes in the states on business and mr steele rebus tapped the suey scrawl well sueys a hard man to catch inspector is that so mused rebus is that so there was a knock at the door come in helen helen greig put her head round the door she was dressed in a raincoat the belt of which she was tying im just off gregor ian not back yet not yet catching up on his sleep i expect rebus was replacing the card on the mantelpiece he was wondering too whether gregor jack was surrounded by friends or by something else entirely oh said helen greig and theres another policeman here he was at the back door the door opened to its full extent and brian holmes walked into the room awkwardly it seemed to rebus it struck him that holmes was awkward in the presence of gregor jack mp thank you helen see you tomorrow youre at westminster tomorrow gregor god so i am right see you the day after helen greig left and rebus introduced jack to brian holmes holmes still seemed unnaturally awkward what the hell was the matter it couldnt just be jack could it then holmes cleared his throat he was looking at his superior avoiding eye contact with the mp altogether sir er theres something maybe you should see round the back in the dustbin i had some rubbish in my pockets and i thought id get rid of it and i happened to lift the lid off the bin gregor jacks face turned stark white right said rebus briskly lead the way brian he made a sweeping motion with his arm after you mr jack the back of the house was well lit two sturdy black plastic bins sat beside a bushy rhododendron each bin had attached inside it a black plastic refuse bag holmes lifted the lid off the lefthand bin and held it open so that rebus could peer inside he was staring at a flattened cornflake packet and the wrapping from some biscuits beneath holmes stated simply rebus lifted the cornflake packet it had been concealing a little treasure chest two video cassettes their casings broken tape spewing from them a packet of photographs two small goldcoloured vibrators two pairs of flimsylooking handcuffs and clothing bodystockings knickers with zips rebus couldnt help wondering what the hacks would have done if theyd found this lot first i can explain said jack brokenly you dont have to sir its none of our business rebus said this in such a way that his meaning was clear it might not be our business but youd better tell us anyway i i panicked no not really a panic its just what with that story about the brothel and now liz is off somewhere and i knew you were on your way i just wanted rid of the lot of it he was perspiring i mean i know it must look strange thats precisely why i wanted rid of it all not my stuff you see its lizs her friends the parties they have well i didnt want you to get the wrong impression or the right impression thought rebus he picked up the packet of photographs which just happened to burst open sorry he said making a show of gathering them up they were polaroids taken at a party it was true quite a party by the look of it and who was this rebus held the photograph up so that jack could see it it showed gregor jack having his shirt removed by two women everyones eyes were red the first and last party i ever went to jack stated yes sir said rebus look inspector my wifes life is her own what she chooses to get up to well its out of my hands anger was replacing embarrassment i might not like it i might not like her friends but its her choice right sir rebus threw the photographs back into the bin well maybe your wifes friends will know where she is eh meantime i wouldnt leave that lot in there not unless you want to see yourself on the front pages again the bins are the first place some journalists look its not called getting the dirt for nothing and as i say mr jack its none of our business not yet but it would be soon enough rebus felt it in his gut which tumbled at the thought it would be soon enough back inside the house rebus tried to concentrate on one thing at a time not easy not at all easy jack wrote down the names and addresses of a few of his wifes friends if not quite high society they were certainly more than a few rungs above the horsehair then rebus asked about liz jacks car a black bmw said jack the series my birthday present to her last year rebus thought of his own car very nice too sir and the registration jack reeled it off rebus looked a little surprised but jack smiled weakly im an accountant by training he explained i never forget figures of course sir well wed better be there was a sound the sound of the front door opening and closing voices in the hall had the prodigal wife returned all three men turned towards the living room door which now swung open gregor look who i found coming up the drive ian urquhart saw that gregor jack had visitors he paused startled behind him a tiredlooking man was shuffling into the room he was tall and skinny with lank black hair and round nhsstyle spectacles gregor the man said he walked up to gregor jack and they shook hands then jack placed a hand on the mans shoulder meant to look in before now the man was saying but you know how it is he really did look exhausted with darkringed eyes and a stoop to his posture his speech and movements were slow i think ive clinched a nice collection of italian art books he now seemed ready to acknowledge the visitors presence rebus had been given urquharts hand and was shaking it the visitor nodded towards rebuss right hand you he said must be inspector rebus thats right how do you know that said gregor jack suitably impressed scratch marks on the wrist the visitor explained vanessa told me an inspector rebus had been in and that rasputin had made his mark his considerable mark by the look of things you must be mr steele said rebus shaking hands the very same said steele sorry i wasnt in when you called as gregor here will tell you im a hard man to catch interrupted jack yes ronnie ive already told the inspector no sign of those books then sir rebus asked steele he shrugged too hot to handle inspector do you have any idea how much that lot would fetch my guess would be a private collector stolen to order maybe a fairly broad range though steele seemed to tire quickly of the topic he turned again to gregor jack and held his arms wide open half shrugging gregor what the hell are they trying to do to you obviously said urquhart who was helping himself unasked to a drink someone somewhere is looking for a resignation but what were you doing there in the first place steele had asked the question he asked it into a silence which lasted for a very long time urquhart had poured him a drink and handed it over while gregor jack seemed to study the four men in the room as though one of them might have the answer rebus noticed that brian holmes was studying a painting on one wall seemingly oblivious to the whole conversation at last jack made an exasperated sound and shook his head i think rebus said into the general silence wed better be off remember to empty your dustbin sir was his final message to jack before he led holmes down the driveway towards the main road holmes agreed to give him a lift into bonnyrigg from where rebus could pick up a ride back into town but otherwise reached opened and started the car without comment as he moved up into second gear however holmes finally said nice guy do you think maybe hed give us an invite to one of those parties brian rebus said warningly then not his parties parties attended by his wife it didnt look like their house in those photos really i didnt get that good a look all i saw was my mp being stripped by a couple of eager ladies holmes gave a sudden chuckle what strip jack naked he said pardon its a card game holmes explained strip jack naked you might know it as beggar my neighbour really rebus said trying not to sound interested but was that precisely what someone was trying to do strip jack of his constituency his cleancut image perhaps even his marriage were they trying to beggar the man whose nickname also was beggar or was jack not quite as innocent as he seemed no hell be honest he didnt seem all that innocent anyway fact he had visited a brothel fact he had tried to get rid of evidence that he himself had attended at least one fairly highspirited party fact his wife hadnt been in touch big deal rebuss money was still on the man in religion he might be more pessimisterian than presbyterian but in some things john rebus still clung to faith faith and hope it was charity he usually lacked tips weve got to keep this away from the papers said chief superintendent watson for as long as we can right sir said lauderdale while rebus stayed silent they were not talking about gregor jack they were discussing a suspect in the water of leith drowning he was in an interview room now with two officers and a tape recorder he was helping with inquiries apparently he was saying little could be nothing after all yes sir there was an afternoon smell of strong mints in the room and perhaps this was why chief inspector lauderdale sounded and looked more starched than ever his nose twitched whenever watson wasnt looking at him rebus all of a sudden felt sorry for his chief superintendent in the way that he felt sorry for the scotland squad whenever it was facing defeat at the hands of thirdworld parttimers there but for the grace of complete inability go i just a bit of bragging perhaps overheard in a pub the man was drunk you know how it is quite so sir all the same all the same they had a man in the interview room a man who had told anyone whod listen in a packed leith pub that he had dumped that body under dean bridge it wis me eh how bout that eh me me i did it she deserved worse they all do and more of the same all of it reported to the police by a fearful barmaid nineteen next month and this was her first bar job deserved worse she did they all do only when the police had come into the pub hed quietened down gone all sulky in a corner standing there with head bent under the weight of a cigarette the pint glass seemed heavy too so that his wrist sagged beneath it beer dripping down on to his shoes and the wooden floor now then sir whats all this youve been telling these people eh mind telling us about it down at the station eh weve got seats down there you can have a seat while you tell us all about it he was sitting but he wasnt telling no name no address nobody in the pub seemed to know anything about him rebus had taken a look at him as had most of the cid and uniformed men in the building but the face meant nothing a sad weak example of the species in his late thirties his hair was already grey and thin the face lined bristly with stubble and the knuckles had grazes and scabs on them how did you get them then been in a fight hit her a few times before you chucked her in nothing he looked scared but he was resilient their chances of keeping him in were to put it mildly not good he didnt need a solicitor he knew he just had to keep his mouth shut been in trouble before eh you know the score dont you thats why youre keeping quiet much good will it do you pal much good indeed the pathologist dr curt was now being harried they needed to know accident suicide or murder they desperately needed to know but before any news arrived the man began to talk i was drunk he told them didnt know what i was saying i dont know what made me say it this was the story he stuck to repeating it and refining it they pressed for his name and address i was drunk he said thats all there is to it im sober now and id like to go im sorry i said what i did can i go now nobody at the pub had been keen to press charges not once the offending body was removed from the premises unpaid bouncers thought rebus thats all we are was the man going to walk were they going to lose him not without a fight we need a name and address before we can let you go i was drunk can i go now please your name please can i go curt still wasnt ready to pronounce an hour or two some results he was waiting for just give us a name eh stop pissing about my names william glass i live at semple street in granton there was silence then sighs check that will you one officer asked the other then now that wasnt so painful was it mr glass the other officer grinned then had to explain why painful glass pane of glass see just do that check eh said his colleague rubbing at a headache which these days never seemed to leave him theyve let him go holmes informed rebus about time a wild haggis chase and no mistake holmes came into the office and made himself comfortable on the spare chair dont stand on ceremony said rebus from his desk just because im the senior officer why not take a seat sergeant thank you sir said holmes from the chair i dont mind if i do he gave his address as semple street granton off granton road thats the one holmes looked around its like an oven in here cant you open a window jammed shut and the heatings i know either on full blast or nothing this place holmes shook his head nothing a bit of maintenance wouldnt fix funny said holmes ive never seen you as the sentimental sort sentimental about this place give me st leonard s or fettes any day rebus wrinkled his nose no character he said speaking of which what news of the male member that jokes worn as thin as my hair brian why not partex it against a new one rebus breathed out noisily through his nose and threw down the pen hed been playing with what you mean he said is what news of mrs jack and the answer is none nada zero ive put out the description of her car and all the posh hotels are being checked but so far nothing from which we infer same answer nothing she could still be off at some iona spiritual retreat or shacked up with a gaelic crofter or doing the munros she could be pissedoff at her hubby or not know a thing about any of it and all that kit i found the sexshop stock clearance what about it well holmes seemed stuck for an answer nothing really and there youve put your finger on it sergeant nothing really meantime ive got work enough to be getting on with rebus laid a solemn hand on the pile of reports and casenotes in front of him how about you holmes was out of his chair now oh ive plenty keeping me busy sir please dont worry yourself about me its natural for me to worry brian youre like a son to me and youre like a father to me holmes replied heading for the door the farther i get from you the easier my life seems to be rebus screwed a piece of paper into a ball but the door closed before he had time to take aim ach some days the job could be a laugh well okay a grin at least if he forgot all about gregor jack the load would be lighter still where would jack be now at the house of commons sitting on some committee being fêted by businesses and lobbyists it all seemed a long way from rebuss office and from his life william glass no the name meant nothing to him bill glass billy glass willie glass will glass nothing living at semple street hold on semple street in granton he went to his filing cabinet and pulled out the file yes just last month stabbing incident in granton a serious wounding but not fatal the victim had lived at semple street rebus remembered it now bedsits carved from a house all of them rented a rented bedsit if william glass was living at semple street then he was staying in a rented bedsit rebus reached for his telephone and called lauderdale to whom he told his story well someone there vouched for him when the patrol car dropped him off the officers were told to be sure he did live there and apparently he does names william glass like he said yes but those bedsits are shortlet tenants get their social security cheque hand half the cash over to the landlord maybe more than half for all i know what im saying is its not much of an address he could disappear from there any time he liked why so suspicious all of a sudden john i thought you were of the opinion we were wasting our time in the first place oh but lauderdale always knew the question to ask the question to which as a rule rebus did not have an answer true sir he said just thought id let you know i appreciate it john its nice to be kept informed there was a slight pause there an invitation for rebus to join lauderdales camp and after the pause any progress on professor costellos books rebus sighed no sir oh well mustnt keep you chatting then bye john goodbye sir rebus wiped his palm across his forehead it was hot in here like a dress rehearsal for the calvinist hell the fan had been installed and turned on and an hour or so later doctor curt provided the shit to toss at it murder yes he said almost definitely murder ive discussed my findings with my colleagues and were of a mind and he went on to explain about froth and unclenched hands and diatoms about problems of differentiating immersion from drowning the deceased a woman in her late twenties or early thirties had imbibed a good deal of drink prior to death but she had been dead before shed hit the water and the cause of death was probably a blow to the back of the head carried out by a righthanded attacker the blow itself having come from the right of the head but who was she they had a photograph of the dead womans face but it wasnt exactly breakfasttime viewing and though her description and a description of her clothes had been given out nobody had been able to identify her no identification on the body no handbag or purse nothing in her pockets better search the area again see if we can come up with a bag or a purse she must have had something and search the river sir a bit late for that probably but yes better give it a shot the alcohol dr curt was telling anyone who would listen had muddied the water you see after which he smiled his slow smile and the fish had eaten their fill fish fingers fish feet fish stomach yes sir i see sir all of which rebus mercifully avoided he had once made the mistake of making a sicker pun than dr curt and as a result found himself in the doctors favour one day he knew holmes would make a better pun yet and then curt would have himself a new pupil and confidant so skirting around the doctor rebus made for lauderdales office lauderdale himself was just getting off the phone when he saw rebus he turned stony rebus could guess why i just sent someone round to glasss bedsit and hes gone rebus added yes lauderdale said his hand still on the receiver leaving little or nothing behind him should be easy enough to pick him up sir get on to it will you john he must still be in the city what is it an hour since he left here probably somewhere in the granton area well get out there right away sir said rebus glad of this excuse for a little action oh and john sir no need to look so smug okay so the day filled itself evening coming upon him with surprising speed but still they had not found william glass not in granton pilmuir newhaven inverleith canonmills leith davidsons mains not on buses or in pubs not by the shore not in the botanic gardens not in chip shops or wandering on playing fields they had found no friends no family just bare details so far from the dhss and at the end of it all rebus knew the man might be innocent but for now he was their straw to be clutched at not the most tasteful metaphor under the circumstances but then as dr curt himself might have said it was all water under the bridge so far as the victim was concerned nothing sir rebus reported to lauderdale at the end of play it had been one of those days nothing was the sum total of rebuss endeavours yet he felt weary bone and brain weary so that he turned down holmes kindly offer of a drink and didnt even debate over his destination he headed for oxford terrace and the ministrations of dr patience aitken not forgetting lucky the cat the wolfwhistling budgies the tropical fish and the tame hedgehog hed yet to see rebus telephoned gregor jacks home first thing wednesday morning jack sounded tired having spent yesterday in parliament and the evening at some grotesque function and you can quote me on that there was a new and altogether fake heartiness about him occasioned rebus didnt doubt by the shared knowledge of the contents of that dustbin well rebus was tired too the real difference between them was a question of pay scales have you heard anything from your wife yet mr jack nothing there was that word again nothing what about you inspector any news no sir well no news is better than bad news so they say speaking of which i read this morning that that poor woman at dean bridge was murder im afraid so puts my own troubles into perspective doesnt it mind you theres a constituency meeting this morning so my troubles may just be starting let me know wont you if you hear anything i mean of course mr jack thank you inspector goodbye goodbye sir all very formal and correct as their relationship had to be not even room for a good luck with the meeting he knew what the meeting would be about people didnt like it when their mp got himself into a scandal there would be questions there would need to be answers rebus opened his desk drawer and lifted out the list of elizabeth jacks friends her circle jamie kilpatrick the antique dealer and apparent black sheep of his titled family the hon matilda merriman notorious for her alleged night of nonstop rogering with a onetime cabinet member julian kaymer some sort of artist martin inman professional landowner louise pattersonscott separated wife of the retail millionaire the names just kept on coming most of them as jack himself had put it while making out the list seasoned dissolutes and hangerson mainly old money as chris kemp had said and a long way away from gregor jacks own pack but there was one curio among them one seeming exception even rebus had recognized it as gregor jack scratched it on to the list what the barney byars the original dirty trucker the haulier yes a bit out of place in that sort of company isnt he jack had owned up actually barneys an old schoolpal of mine but as times gone on hes grown friendlier with liz it happens sometimes still somehow i cant see him fitting in with that lot youd be surprised inspector rebus believe me you would be surprised jack gave each word equal weight leaving rebus in no doubt that he meant what he said still byars was another fly fifer another famous son while at school hed made his name as a hitchhiker often claiming hed spent the weekend in london without paying a penny to get there after school he made the news again by hitching his way across france italy germany spain hed fallen in love with the lorries themselves with the whole business of them so hed saved got his hgv licence bought himself a lorry and now was the largest independent haulier that rebus could think of even on last years trip to london rebus had been confronted by a byars haulage artic trying to steer its way through piccadilly circus well it was rebuss job to ask if anyone had seen hide or hair of liz jack hed gladly let others do the hard work with the likes of jamie kilpatrick and the grimsounding julian kaymer but he was keeping barney byars for himself another week or two of this he thought and ill have to buy an autograph book as it happened byars was in edinburgh drumming up custom as the girl in his office put it rebus gave her his telephone number and an hour later byars himself called back he would be busy all afternoon and hed to go to dinner that evening with a few fat bastards but he could see rebus for a drink at six if that was convenient rebus wondered which luxury hotel would be the base for their drink and was stunned perhaps even disappointed when byars named the sutherland bar one of rebuss own watering holes right you are he said six oclock which meant that the day stretched ahead of him there was the case of the lifted literature of course well he wasnt going to hold his breath waiting for a result there they would turn up or they would not his bet would be that by now theyd be on the other side of the atlantic then there was william glass suspect in a murder inquiry somewhere out there in a back close or a cobbled side street well hed turn up come giro day if that is he was more stupid than so far hed proved to be no maybe he was full of cunning in which case he wouldnt go near a dhss office or back to his digs in which case he would have to get money from somewhere so go talk to the tramps the citys dispossessed glass would steal or else he would resort to begging and where he begged there would be others begging too put his description about maybe with a tenner as a reward and let others do your work for you yes it was definitely worth mentioning to lauderdale except that rebus didnt want to do the chief inspector too many good turns otherwise lauderdale would think he was currying favour id rather curry an alsatian he said to himself with a nice sense of timing brian holmes came into the office carrying a white paper bag and a polystyrene beaker whatve you got there rebus asked suddenly hungry youre the policeman you tell me holmes produced a sandwich from the bag and held it in front of rebus corned chuck rebus guessed wrong pastrami on rye bread what and decaffeinated filter coffee holmes prised the lid from the beaker and sniffed the contents with a contented smile from that new delicatessen next to the traffic lights doesnt nell make you up a sandwich women have equal rights these days rebus believed it he thought of inspector gill templer and her psychology books and her feminism he thought of the demanding dr patience aitken he even thought of the freeliving elizabeth jack strong women to a man but then he remembered cath kinnoul there were still casualties out there whats it like he asked holmes had taken a bite from the sandwich and was studying what was left okay he said interesting pastrami now there was a sandwich filling that would be a long time coming to the sutherland bar barney byars too was a long time coming to the sutherland rebus arrived at five minutes to six byars at twentyfive past but he was well worth waiting for inspector sorry im late some cunt was trying to knock me down five per cent on a fourgrand contract and he wanted sixty days to pay know what that does to a cash flow i told him i ran a lorry firm not fuckin rickshaws all of which was delivered in a thick fife tongue and at a volume appreciably above that of the bars early evening rumble of tv and conversation rebus was seated at one of the bar stools but stood and suggested they take a table byars however was already making himself comfortable on the stool next to the policeman laying his brawny arms along the bartop and examining the array of taps he pointed to rebuss glass that any good not bad ill have a pint of that then whether from awe fear or just good management of his customers the barman was on hand to pour the requested pint another yourself inspector im okay thanks and a whisky too ordered byars a double mind not the usual smeartest byars handed a fiftypound note to the barman keep the change he said then he roared with laughter only joking son only joking the barman was new and young he held the note as though it were likely to ignite ehh you havent got anything smaller on you his accent was effeminate west coast rebus wondered how long hed last in the sutherland byars exasperated but rejecting rebuss offer of help dug into his pockets and found two crumpled onepound notes and some change he accepted his fifty back and pushed the coins towards the barman then he winked at rebus ill tell you a secret inspector if i had to choose between having five tenners or one fifty id go for the one fifty every time want to know why tenners in your pocket people think nothing of it but whip a fifty out and they think youre croesus he turned to the barman who was counting the coins out into the open till hey son got anything for eating the barman jerked round as though hit by a pellet ehh i think theres some scotch broth left over from lunch his vowels turned broth into brawwrath the braw wrath of the scots rebus thought to himself byars was shaking his head a pie or a sandwich he demanded the barman proffered the last lonely sandwich in the place it looked unnervingly like pastrami but turned out to be as byars put it the guid roast beef one pound ten the barman said byars got out the fiftypound note again snorted and produced a fiver instead he turned back to rebus and lifted his glass cheers both men drank not bad at all byars said of the beer rebus gestured towards the sandwich i thought you were going to dinner later on i am but more importantly im paying this way i wont eat as much and wont cost myself so much he winked again maybe i should write a book eh business tips for sole traders that sort of thing heh speaking of tips i once asked a waiter what tips meant know what he said rebus hazarded a wild guess to insure prompt service no to insure i dont piss in the soup byars voice was back to the level of megaphone diplomacy he laughed then took a bite of sandwich still chortling as he chomped he was not a tall man five seven or thereabouts and he was stocky he wore newish denims and a black leather jacket beneath which he sported a white poloshirt in a bar like this youd take him for well just about anybody rebus could imagine him ruffling feathers in plush hotels and business bars image he told himself its just another image the hard man the nononsense man a man who worked hard and who expected others to work hard too always in his favour he had finished the sandwich and was brushing crumbs from his lap youre from fife he said casually sniffing the whisky yes rebus admitted i could tell gregor jacks from fife too you know you said you wanted to talk about him is it to do with that brothel story i found that a bit hard to swallow he nodded towards the empty plate in front of him not as hard as that sandwich though no its not really to do with the with mr jacksno its more to do with mrs jack lizzie what about her were not sure where she is any ideas byars looked blank knowing lizzie youd better get interpol on the case shes as likely to be in istanbul as inverness what makes you say inverness byars looked stuck for an answer it was the first place that came to mind then he nodded i see what you mean though you were thinking she might be at deer lodge it being up that way have you looked rebus nodded when did you last see mrs jack a couple of weeks ago maybe three weekends ago i can check funnily enough it was at the lodge a weekend party the pack mostly he looked up from his drink i better explain that its all right i know who the pack are three weekends ago you say aye but i can check if you like a weekend party you mean a party lasting the whole weekend well just a few friends all very civilized a light came on behind his eyes ahha i know what youre getting at you know about lizs parties then no no this was tame stuff dinner and a few drinks and a brisk country walk on the sunday not really my mug of gin but liz had invited me so you prefer her other kinds of party byars laughed of course youre only young once inspector i mean its all above board isnt it he seemed genuinely curious not without reason why should a policeman know about those parties who could have told him if not gregor and what exactly would gregor have said as far as i know sir so you dont know any reason why mrs jack might want to disappear i can think of a few byars had finished both drinks but didnt look like he was hanging around for another he kept shifting on the stool as if unable to get comfortable that newspaper story for a start i think id want to be well away from it wouldnt you i mean i can see how its bad for gregors image not having his wife beside him but at the same time any other reasons byars was half standing now a lover he suggested maybe hes whisked her off to tenerife for a bit of pash under the sun he winked again then his face became serious as though hed just remembered something there were those phone calls he said phone calls now he was standing anonymous phone calls lizzie told me about them not to her to gregor bound to happen the game hes in caller would phone up and say he was sir somebodysomebody or lord this n that and gregor would be fetched to the phone soon as he got to it the line would go dead thats what she told me did these calls worry her oh yes you could see she was upset she tried to hide it but you could see gregor just laughed it off of course cant afford to let something like that rattle him she might even have mentioned letters something about gregor getting these letters but tearing them up before anyone could see them but youd have to ask lizzie about that he paused or gregor of course of course right byars stuck out his hand youve got my number if you need me inspector yes rebus shook hands thanks for your help mr byars any time inspector oh and if you ever need a lift to london ive got lorries make that trip four times a week wont cost you a penny and you can still claim the journey on expenses he gave another wink smiled generally around the bar and marched back out as noticeably as hed marched in the barman came to clear away plate and glass rebus saw that the tie the young man was wearing was a clipon standard issue in the sutherland if a punter tried to grab you the tie came away in his hand was he talking about me rebus blinked eh what makes you think that i thought i heard him mention my name rebus poured the dregs from his glass into his mouth and swallowed dont say the kid was called gregor lizzie maybe what name is that then lawrie rebus was more than halfway there before he realized he was headed not for stockbridge comforts and patience aitken but for marchmont and his own neglected flat so be it inside the flat the atmosphere managed to be both chill and stale a coffee mug beside the telephone resembled glasgow insofar as it too was a city of culture an interesting green and white culture but if the living room was growing mould surely the kitchen would be worse rebus sat himself down in his favourite chair stretched for the answering machine and settled to listen to his calls there werent many gill templer wondering where he was keeping himself these days as if she didnt know his daughter samantha phoning from her new flat in london giving him her address and telephone number then a couple of calls where the speaker had decided not to say anything be like that then rebus turned off the machine drew a notebook from his pocket and reading the number from it telephoned gregor jack he wanted to know why jack hadnt said anything about his own anonymous calls strip jack beggar my neighbour well if someone were out to beggar gregor jack jack himself didnt seem overly concerned he didnt exactly seem resigned but he did seem unbothered unless he was playing a game with rebus and what about rab kinnoul onscreen assassin what was he up to all the time he was away from his wife and ronald steele too a hard man to catch were they all up to something it wasnt that rebus distrusted the human race wasnt just that he was brought up a pessimisterian he was sure there was something happening here he just didnt know what it was there was nobody home or nobody was answering or the apparatus had been unplugged or hello rebus glanced at his watch just after quarter past seven miss greig he said inspector rebus here he does keep you working late doesnt he you seem to work fairly late hours yourself inspector what is it this time impatience in her voice perhaps urquhart had warned her against being friendly perhaps it had been discovered that shed given rebus the address of deer lodge a word with mr jack if possible not possible im afraid she didnt sound afraid she sounded if anything a bit smug hes speaking at a function this evening oh how did his meeting go this morning meeting i thought he had some meeting in his constituency oh that i think it went very well so hes not for the chop then she attempted a laugh north and south esk would be mad to get rid of him all the same he must be relieved i wouldnt know he was on the golf course all afternoon nice i think an mp is allowed one afternoon off a week dont you inspector oh yes absolutely thats what i meant rebus paused he had nothing to say really he was just hoping that if he kept her talking helen greig herself might tell him something something he didnt know oh he said about those telephone calls what calls the ones mr jack was getting the anonymous ones i dont know what youre talking about sorry ive got to go now my mums expecting me home at quarter to eight right you are then miss gr but she had already put the phone down golf this afternoon jack must be keen the rain had been falling steadily in edinburgh since midday he looked out of his unwashed window it wasnt falling now but the streets were glistening the flat felt suddenly empty and colder than ever rebus picked up the phone and made one more call to patience aitken to say he was on his way she asked him where he was im at home oh picking up some more of your stuff thats right you could do with bringing a spare suit if youve got one right and some of your precious books since you dont seem to approve of my taste romances were never my thing patience in fiction as in life he thought to himself on the floor around him were strewn some of his precious books he picked one up tried to remember buying it couldnt well bring whatever you like john and as much as you like you know how much room weve got here we weve got okay patience see you later he replaced the receiver with a sigh and took a look around him after all these years there were still gaps on the wallshelves from where his wife rhona had removed her things still gaps in the kitchen too where the tumbledrier had sat and her precious dishwasher still clean rectangular spaces on the walls where her posters and prints had been hung the flat had last been redecorated when in or ach it still didnt look too bad though who was he kidding it looked like a squat what have you done with your life john rebus the answer was not much gregor jack was younger than him and more successful barney byars was younger than him and more successful who did he know who was older than him and less successful not a single soul discounting the beggars in the city centre the ones hed spent the afternoon with without a result but with a certain uncomfortable sense of belonging what was he thinking about youre becoming a morbid old bugger selfpity wasnt the answer moving in with patience was the answer so why didnt it feel like one why did it feel like just another problem he rested his head against the back of the chair im caught he thought between a cushion and a soft place he sat there for a long time staring up at the ceiling it was dark outside and foggy too a haar drifting in across the city from the north sea in a haar edinburgh seemed to shift backwards through time you half expected to see pressgangs on the streets of leith hear coaches clattering over cobblestones and cries of gardyloo in the high street if he sold the flat he could buy himself a new car send some money to samantha if he sold the flat if he moved in with patience if shit was gold his father used to say youd have a tyke at yer erse the old bugger had never explained exactly what a tyke was jesus what made him think of that it was no good he couldnt think straight not here perhaps it was that his flat held too many memories good and bad perhaps it was just the mood of the evening or perhaps it was that the image of gill templers face kept appearing unbidden he told himself unbidden in his mind up the river burglary with violent assault just the thing for a dreich thursday morning the victim was in hospital head bandaged and face bruised rebus had been to talk with her and was at the house in jocks lodge overseeing the dusting for prints and the taking of statements when word reached him from great london road the call came from brian holmes yes brian theres been another drowning drowning another body in the river oh christ whereabouts this time out of town up towards queensferry another woman she was found this morning by someone out for a walk he paused while someone handed him something rebus heard a muted thanks as the person moved away it could be our mr glass couldnt it holmes said now pausing again to slurp coffee we expected him to stick around the city but he could as easily have headed north queensferrys an easy walk and mostly across open land well away from roads where he might be spotted if i was on the run thats the way id do it yes rebus knew that country hadnt he been out there just the other day quiet back roads no traffic nobody to notice hang on there was a stream no more a river running past the kinnouls house brian he started and thats another thing holmes interrupted the woman who found the body guess who it was cathy gow rebus said casually holmes seemed puzzled who anyway no it was rab kinnouls wife you know rab kinnoul the actor whos this cathy gow it was uphill from the kinnoul house and along the side of the hill too not too far a walk but the country grew if anything bleaker still fifty yards from the fastflowing river there was a narrow road leading eventually to a wider road which meandered down to the coast for someone to get here they either had to walk past the kinnoul house or else walk down from the road no sign of a car rebus asked holmes both men had zippered their jackets against the snell wind and the occasional smirr any car in particular holmes asked the roads tarmac ive had a look for myself no tyre tracks where does it lead it peters out into a farm track then surprise surprise a farm holmes was moving his weight from one foot to the other trying in vain to keep warm better check at the farm and see someones up there doing precisely that rebus nodded holmes knew this routine well enough by now he would do something and rebus would double check that it had been done and mrs kinnoul shes in the house with a wpc drinking sweet tea dont let her take too many downers well need a statement holmes was lost until rebus explained about his previous visit here what about mr kinnoul he went off somewhere this morning early thats why mrs kinnoul went for a walk she said she always went for a walk in the morning when she was on her own do we know where hes gone holmes shrugged just on business thats all she could tell us couldnt say where or how long hed be but he should be back this evening according to mrs kinnoul rebus nodded again they were standing above the river near the roadway the others were down by the river itself it was in spate after the recent rain just about wide enough and deep enough to be classed a river rather than a stream the others included police officers dressed in waders and plunging their arms into the icy water feeling for evidence which would long have been flushed away forensics men hovering above the body the identification unit similarly hovering but armed with cameras and video equipment and dr curt dressed in a long flapping raincoat its collar turned up he trudged towards rebus and holmes reciting as he came when shall we three meet again blasted heath et cetera good morning inspector morning doctor curt what have you got for us curt removed his glasses and wiped spots of water from them double pneumonia i shouldnt wonder he answered replacing them accident suicide or murder asked rebus curt tuttutted him shaking his head sadly you know i cant make snap decisions inspector granted this poor woman hasnt been in the water as long as the previous one but all the same how long a day at most but with the weight of water and all debris and so on shes taken a bit of a battering lucky she was found at all really how do you mean didnt the sergeant say her wrist caught in a dead branch otherwise shed almost certainly have been swept down into the river and out into the sea rebus thought about the direction the river would take bypassing the only settlements yes a body falling into the stream here might well have disappeared without trace any idea who she is no identification on the body plenty of rings on her fingers though and shes wearing quite a nice dress too care to take a look why not eh come on brian but holmes stood his ground i had a look earlier sir dont let me stop you though so rebus followed the pathologist down the slope he was thinking difficult to bring a body down here but you could always roll it from the top yes roll it hear the splash and assume it had fallen into the river you might not know the wrist had caught in a branch but to get a body up here in the first place dead or alive surely youd need a car was william glass capable of stealing a car why not everyone else seemed to know how to do it these days kids in primary school could show you how to do it like i say curt was saying shes been bashed about a bit cant tell yet whether post or antemortem oh about that other drowning at dean bridge yes recent sexual intercourse traces of semen in the vagina we should be able to get a dna profile ah here we go the body had been laid out on a plastic sheet yes it was a nice dress distinctive summery though torn now and smeared with mud the face was muddy too and cut and swollen the hair drawn back and part of the skull exposed rebus swallowed hard had he been expecting this he wasnt sure but the photographs hed seen made him sure in his mind i know her he said what even the forensics men looked up at him in disbelief the tableau must have alerted brian holmes for he came stumbling down the slope to join them i said i know her at least i think i do no im sure i do her name is elizabeth jack her friends call her liz or lizzie shes she was married to gregor jack mp good god said dr curt rebus looked at holmes and holmes stared back at him and neither seemed to know what to say there was more to identification than that of course much more death was certainly suspicious but this had to be decided officially by the gentleman from the procurator fiscals office the gentleman who now stood talking with dr curt nodding his head gravely while curt made hand gestures which would not have disgraced an excited italian he was explaining explaining tirelessly explaining for the thousandth time about the movement of diatoms within the body while his listener grew paler still the identification unit was still busy shooting off photographs and some video film wiping their camera lenses every thirty seconds or so the rain had if anything grown heavier the sky an unbroken shading of greyblack an autopsy was needed agreed the procurator fiscal the body would be transported to the mortuary in edinburgh s cowgate and there formal identification would take place involving two people who knew the deceased in life and two police officers who had known her in death if it turned out not to be elizabeth jack rebus was in a dungpile of trouble watching the body being taken away rebus allowed himself a muffled sneeze perhaps dr curts diagnosis of pneumonia was right he knew where he was headed the kinnoul house with luck he might find hot tea there the forensics team squeezed wetly into their car and headed back to police headquarters at fettes come on brian said rebus lets see how mrs kinnouls getting on cath kinnoul seemed in a state of shock a doctor had been to the house but had left by the time rebus and holmes reached the scene they shed their sodden jackets in the hall while rebus had a quiet word with the wpc no sign of the husband no sir how is she comfortably numb rebus tried to look bedraggled and pathetic it wasnt difficult the wpc read his mind and smiled ill make some tea shall i anything hot would hit the spot believe me cath kinnoul was sitting in one of the living rooms huge armchairs the chair itself looked like it was in the process of consuming her while she looked about half the size and a quarter of the age shed been when rebus had last seen her hello again he said mockcheerily inspector rebus thats it and this is sergeant holmes no jokes please hes heard them all before havent you sergeant holmes saw that they were playing the comedy duo trying to bring some life back into mrs kinnoul he nodded encouragingly in fact he was glancing around wistfully hoping to find a roaring log or coal fire but there wasnt even a roaring gas fire for him to stand in front of instead there was a onebar electric job just about glowing with warmth and there were two radiators he went and stood in front of one of these separating his trousers from his legs he pretended to be admiring the pictures on the wall in front of him rab kinnoul with a tv actor with a tv comedian with a gameshow host my husband mrs kinnoul explained he works in television rebus spoke no idea what hes up to today though mrs kinnoul no she said quietly no idea two witnesses who had known the deceased in life well thought rebus you can scrub cath kinnoul shed fall apart if she knew it was liz jack out there never mind having to identify the body even now someone was trying to get in touch with gregor jack and jack would probably arrive at the mortuary with ian urquhart or helen greig either of whom would do as the second nod of the head no need to bother cath kinnoul you look soaked she was saying something to drink the wpcs making some tea but as he spoke rebus knew this was not what she was suggesting a drop of the cratur wouldnt go amiss though if its not too much trouble she nodded towards a sideboard righthand cupboard she said please help yourself rebus thought of suggesting that she join them but what pills had the doctor given her and what pills had she taken of her own he poured glenmorangie into two long slim glasses and handed one to holmes who had taken up a canny position in front of a radiator mind you dont get steaming rebus said in a murmur just then the wpc appeared carrying a tray of tea things she saw the alcohol and almost frowned heres tae us said rebus downing the drink in one at the mortuary gregor jack seemed hardly to recognize rebus at all jack had been holding his weekly constituency surgery ian urquhart explained to rebus in a conspiratorial whisper this was usually held on a friday but there was a private members bill in the commons this friday and gregor jack wanted to be part of the debate so gregor having been in the area on wednesday anyway theyd decided to hold the surgery on thursday leaving friday free listening to all this in silence rebus thought why are you telling me but urquhart was clearly nervous and felt the need to talk well mortuaries could have that effect never mind the fact that your employer was about to see scandal heaped upon scandal never mind the fact that your job was about to be made more difficult than ever how did the golf game go rebus asked back what golf game yesterday oh urquhart nodded you mean gregors game i dont know i havent asked him yet so urquhart himself hadnt been involved he paused for so long that rebus thought a dead end had been reached but the need to speak was too great thats a regular date urquhart went on gregor and ronnie steele most wednesday afternoons ah suey mr wouldbe teenage suicide rebus tried to make his next question sound like a joke doesnt gregor ever do any work urquhart looked stunned hes always working that game of golf its about the only free time ive ever known him have but he doesnt seem to be in london very often ah well the constituency comes first thats gregors way look after the folk who voted you in and theyll look after you something like that urquhart allowed there was no more time for talk the identification was about to take place and if gregor jack looked bad before he saw the body he looked like a halffilled rag doll afterwards oh christ that dress he seemed about to collapse but ian urquhart had a firm grip on him if youll look at the face someone was saying we need to be definite they all looked at the face yes thought rebus thats the person i saw beside the stream yes said gregor jack his voice wavering thats my thats liz rebus actually breathed a sigh of relief what nobody had expected what nobody had really considered was sir hugh ferrie lets just say said chief superintendent watson that a certain amount of pressure is being applied as ever rebus couldnt hold his tongue theres nothing to apply pressure to what are we supposed to do that were not already doing sir hugh considers that we should have caught william glass by now but we dont even know now we all know sir hugh can be a bit hotheaded but hes got a point meaning thought rebus hes got friends in high places hes got a point and we can do without the media interest thats bound to erupt all im saying is that we should give the investigation an extra push whenever and wherever we can lets get glass in custody lets make sure we keep everyone informed and lets get that autopsy report as soon as humanly possible not so easy with a drowning john you know dr curt fairly well dont you were on secondname terms how about giving him that extra little nudge what happens if he nudges me back sir watson looked like a kindly uncle suddenly tiring of a precocious nephew nudge him harder i know hes busy i know hes got lectures to give university work to do god knows what else but the longer we have to wait the more the media are going to fill the gaps with speculation go have a word john eh just make sure he gets the message message what message dr curt told rebus what hed always told him i cant be rushed delicate business deciding an actual drowning from mere immersion professional reputation darent make mistakes more haste less speed patience is a virtue many a mickle makes a muckle all of this delivered between appointments in the doctors teviot place office the department of pathologys forensic medicine unit divided in loyalties between the faculty of medicine and the faculty of law had its offices within the university medical school in teviot place which seemed to rebus natural enough you didnt want your commercial law students mixing with people who keened over cadavers diatoms dr curt was saying washerwomans skin bloodtinged froth distended lungs almost a litany now and none of it got them any further tests on tissue examination diatoms toxicology fractures diatoms curt really did have a thing about those tiny algae unicellular algae he corrected rebus bowed his head to the correction well he said rising to his feet fast as you can eh doctor if you cant catch me in the office you can always try me by unicellular phone fast as i can agreed doctor curt chuckling he too got to his feet oh one thing i can tell you straight away he opened his office door for rebus yes mrs jack was depilated thered be no getting her by the shortandcurlies because teviot place wasnt far from buccleuch street rebus thought hed wander along to suey books not that he was expecting to catch ronald steele for ronald steele was a hard man to catch busy behind the scenes busy out of sight the shop itself was open the rickety bicycle chained up outside rebus pushed the door open warily its okay called a voice from the back of the shop rasputins gone out for a wander rebus closed the door and approached the desk the same girl was sitting there and her duties still seemed to entail the pricing of books there wasnt any room for any more books on the shelves rebus wondered where these new titles were headed how did you know it was me he asked that window she nodded towards the frontofshop it might look filthy from the outside but you can see out of it all right like one of those twoway mirrors rebus looked yes because the shops interior was darker than the street you could see out all right you just couldnt see in no sign of your books if thats what youre wondering rebus nodded slowly it was not what he was wondering and ronalds not here she checked the oversized face of her wristwatch should have been in half an hour ago must have got held up rebus kept on nodding steele had told him this girls name what was it again was he in yesterday she shook her head we were shut all day i was a bit off colour couldnt come in at the start of the university year we do okay business on a wednesday wednesday being a halfteaching day but not just now rebus thought of vaseline vanishing cream i vanessa that was it well thanks anyway keep an eye out for those books oh heres ronald now rebus turned round just as the door rattled open ronald steele closed it heavily behind him started up the central aisle of books but then almost lost balance and had to rest against a bookcase his eyes caught a particular spine and he levered the book out from the others around it fish out of water he said out of water he threw the book as far as he could a matter of a yard or so it crashed into a bookcase and fell open on to the floor then he began picking books out at random and throwing them with force his eyes red with tears vanessa screamed at him and came round from her desk making towards him but steele pushed past her and stumbled past rebus past the desk and through a doorway at the very back of the shop there was the sound of another door closing whats back there the loo said vanessa stooping to recover a few of the books what the hells the matter with him maybe hes had a bit of bad news rebus speculated he was helping her retrieve books he stood up and examined the blurb on the back jacket of fish out of water the front cover illustration showed a woman seated more or less demurely on a chaise longue while a rugged suitor leant over her from behind his lips just short of her bared shoulder i think i might buy this he said looks like just my sort of thing vanessa accepted the book then stared up from it to him her disbelief hot quite showing through the shock of the scene shed just witnessed fifty pence she told him quietly fifty pence it is said rebus and after the formal identification while the autopsy took its defined and painstaking course there were the questions there were an awful lot of questions cath kinnoul had to be questioned gently questioned with her husband by her side and a bloodstream dulled by tranqs no she hadnt really taken a close look at the body shed known from a good way off what it was she could see the dress could see that it was a dress shed run back to the house and telephoned for the police nineninenine the way they told you to in emergencies no she hadnt gone back out to the river she doubted shed ever go there again and turning to mr kinnoul where had he been this morning business meetings he said meetings with potential partners and potential backers he was trying to set up an independent television company though hed be grateful if the information went no further and the previous evening hed spent it at home with his wife and they hadnt seen or heard anything not a thing theyd been watching tv all night not current tv but old stuff kept on video stuff featuring mr kinnoul himself knife ledge the onscreen assassin you must have learned a few tricks of the trade in your time mr kinnoul you mean acting no i mean about how to kill and then there was gregor jack rebus kept out of that altogether hed look at any notes and transcripts later he didnt want to get involved there was too much he already knew too much prejudgement which was another way of saying potential prejudice he let other cid men deal with mr jack and with ian urquhart and with helen greig and with all elizabeth jacks cronies and cohorts for this wasnt merely a case of the lady vanishing this was a matter of death jamie kilpatrick the hon matilda merriman julian kaymer martin inman louise pattersonscott even barney byars theyd all either been questioned or were about to be perhaps theyd all be questioned again at a later date there were missing days to be filled huge gaps in liz jacks life the whole final week of her life where had she been who had she seen when had she died hurry up please dr curt chopchop how had she died ditto where was her car but rebus read all the transcripts all the notes he read through the interview with gregor jack and the interview with ronald steele a detective constable was sent to braidwater golf course to check the story of the wednesday afternoon game the interview with steele rebus read very carefully indeed asked about elizabeth jack steele admitted that she always accused me of not being enough fun she was right i suppose im not exactly what youd call a party animal and i never had enough money she liked people with money to throw around or who threw it around even if they couldnt afford it a touch of bitterness there or just the bitter truth to all of which rebus added one other question had elizabeth jack ever left edinburgh in the first place then there was the separate hunt the hunt for william glass if he had gone to queensferry where would be next west towards bathgate linlithgow or boness or north across the forth to fife police forces were mobilized descriptions were issued had liz jack spent any time at all at deer lodge how could william glass simply disappear was there any connection between mrs jacks death and her husbands night out at an edinburgh brothel this last line was the one pursued most eagerly by the newspapers they seemed to be favouring a verdict of suicide in the case of elizabeth jack husbands shame discovered after shes been on retreat on her way home she decides she cant face things sets off perhaps to visit her friend the actor rab kinnoul but grows more desperate and having read the details of the dean bridge murder decides to end it all throws herself into the river above rab kinnouls house end of story except that it wasnt the end of the story as far as the papers were concerned it was just the beginning after all this one had it all a tv actor an mp a sex scandal a death the headline writers were boggled trying to decide which order to put things in sex scandal mps wife drowns in tv stars stream or tv stars agony at mp friends wifes suicide act you could see the problem all those possessives and the grieving husband kept well away from the media by protective friends and colleagues but he was always available for interview by the police when clarification of some point was required while his fatherinlaw gave the media as many interviews as they needed but kept his comments to the police succinct and scathing what do you want to talk to me for find the bugger who did it then you can talk all you want i want the animal who did this put behind bars better make them bloody strong bars too otherwise i might just pull them apart and strangle the life out of the bugger myself were doing what we can believe me sir hugh is it enough though thats what i want to know everything we can yes everything leaving just the one final question did anyone do it only dr curt could answer that highland games rebus packed an overnight bag it was a large sports holdall bought for him by patience aitken when shed decided he should get fit theyd enrolled together in a health club bought all the gear and had attended the club four or five times together theyd played squash been massaged had saunas encountered the plunge pool gone swimming survived the expensively equipped gymnasium tried jogging but ended up spending more and more time in the health club bar which was stupid the drinks being double the price they were at the pleasantenough pub round the corner no longer a sports bag then but these days an overnight bag not that rebus was taking much this trip he packed a change of shirt socks and underwear toothbrush camera notebook a kagoul would he require a phrase book probably but he doubted if one existed something to read though bedtime reading he found the copy of fish out of water and threw it in on top of everything else the phone was ringing but he was in patiences flat and she had her own answering machine all the same he went through to the living room and listened as the message played then the callers voice this is brian holmes trying to get in touch with rebus picked up the receiver brian whats up ah caught you thought maybe youd already headed for the hills i was just leaving sure you dont want to drop by the station first why should i because dr curt is about to pronounce the problem with drowning was that drowning and immersion were two entirely different things a body conscious or unconscious might fall or be pushed into water and drown or an already dead body might be dumped into water as a means of concealment or to lead the police astray cause of death became problematical as did time of death rigor mortis might or might not be present bruising on and damage to the body might be the result of rocks or other objects in the water itself however froth from mouth and nose when the chest was pumped down on was a sign that the body was alive when it entered the water so was the presence in the brain marrow kidney and so forth of diatoms diatoms dr curt never tired of explaining were microorganisms which penetrated the lung membrane and would be pumped around the bloodstream by a stillbeating heart but there were other signs too silted matter in the bronchial tubes provided evidence of inhalation of water a living person falling into water made attempts to grip something a truelife clutching at straws and so the hands of the corpse would be clenched washerwomans skin the shedding of nails and hair the swelling of the body all these could lead to an estimate of the amount of time the corpse had spent in the water as curt pointed out not all the relevant tests had been completed yet it would be a few more days before the toxicology tests would yield results so they couldnt be sure yet whether the deceased had taken any drink or drugs prior to death no semen had been found in the vagina but then the deceaseds husband had provided information that the deceased had trouble with the pill and that her preferred method of contraception had always been the sheath christ thought rebus imagine poor old jack being asked about that still there might be even less pleasant questions to answer what we have so far curt said while everyone begged him silently to get on with it is a series of negatives no froth from the mouth and nose no silted matter no clenched hands whats more rigor mortis would suggest that the body was dead prior to immersion and that it had been kept in a confined space youll see from the photographs that the legs are bent quite unnaturally at that moment they knew but still he hadnt said it id say the body was in the water not less than eight hours and not more than twentyfour as to when death occurred well some time before that obviously but not too long a matter of hours and cause of death dr curt smiled the photographs of the skull show a clear fracture to the righthand side of the head she was hit very hard from behind gentlemen id say death was almost instantaneous there was more but not much more and much mumbling between officers rebus knew what they were thinking and saying it was the same mo as the dean bridge killing but it wasnt the woman found at dean bridge had been murdered at that spot not transported there and she had been murdered on a riverside path in the middle of a city not well where had liz jack died anywhere it could be anywhere while people were muttering that william glass had to be found rebus was thinking in a different direction mrs jacks bmw had to be found and found quickly well he was already packed and hed okayed the trip with lauderdale constable moffat would be there to meet him and gregor jack had provided the keys so there it is ladies and gentlemen curt was saying murder would be my opinion yes murder the rest is down to your forensic scientists and yourselves off are you lauderdale commented seeing rebus toting his bag thats right sir good hunting inspector lauderdale paused whats the name of the place again where is it expensive to be a mason sir i dont follow ah right a dear lodge rebus winked at his superior and made his way out towards his car it was very pleasing the way scotland changed every thirty miles or so changed in landscape in character and in dialect mind you stick in a car and youd hardly guess the roads all seemed much the same so did the roadside petrol stations even the towns long straight main streets with their supermarkets and shoe shops and wool shops and chip shops even these seemed to blur one into the other but it was possible to look beyond them possible too to look further into them a small country thought rebus yet so various at school his geography teacher had taught that scotland could be divided into three distinct regions southern uplands lowlands and highlands something like that geography didnt begin to tell the story well maybe it did actually he was heading due north towards a people very different to those found in the southern cities or the coastal towns he stopped in perth and bought some supplies apples chocolate a half bottle of whisky chewing gum a box of dates a pint of milk you never knew what might not be available further north it was all very well on the tourist trail but if he stepped off that trail in blairgowrie he stopped for fish and chips which he ate at a formicatopped table in the chip shop lashings of salt vinegar and brown sauce on the chips two slices of white pan bread thinly spread with margarine and a cup of darkbrown tea the haddock was covered in batter which rebus picked off eating it first before starting on the fish you look as if you enjoyed that the friers wife said wiping down the table next to him he had enjoyed it all the more so since patience wouldnt be smelling his breath this evening checking for cholesterol and sodium and starch he looked at the list of delights printed above the counter red white and black puddings haggis smoked sausage sausage in batter steak pie mince pie chicken with pickled onions or pickled eggs on the side rebus couldnt resist he bought another bag of chips to eat while he drove today was tuesday five days since elizabeth jacks body was found probably six days since she died memories were short rebus knew her photograph had been in all the newspapers had appeared on television and on several hundred police posters and still no one had come forward with information hed worked through the weekend seeing little of patience and hed come up with this notion this latest straw to be clutched at the scenery deepened around him growing wilder and quieter he was in glenshee in it and through it as quickly as he could there was something sinister and empty about the place a louring sense of disease the devils elbow wasnt the treacherous spot it had seemed in his youth the road had somehow been levelled or the corner straightened braemar balmoral turning off just before ballater towards cockbridge and tomintoul that stretch of road which always seemed to be the first of the winter to close for snow bleak yes hed call it bleak but it was impressive too it just went on and on and on deep valleys hewn by glaciers collections of scree rebuss geography teacher had been an enthusiast he was close now close to his destination he turned to the directions which he had scribbled down an amalgam of notes from sergeant moffat and gregor jack gregor jack jack had wanted to talk with him about something but rebus hadnt given him the chance too dangerous to get involved not that rebus believed for one second that jack had anything to hide all the same the others though the rab kinnouls and ronald steeles and ian urquharts there was definitely well maybe not definitely but there was ach no he couldnt put it into words he didnt really want to think about it even thinking about it about all those permutations and possibilities all those what ifs well they just made his head whirl left and then right along the track beside a fir plantation up to the top of the rise through a gateway its like treasure hunt the car was behaving impeccably touch wood touch wood he only had to stop the car and stretch his arm out of the window no plantation now but a wild wood the track was heavily rutted with grass growing high along a strip between the ruts some of the larger potholes had been filled in with gravel and rebuss speed was down to five miles an hour or less but that didnt seem to stop his bones being shaken his head snapped from side to side it didnt seem possible that there could be a habitation ahead maybe hed taken a wrong turning but the tyre tracks he was following were fresh enough and besides he didnt fancy reversing all the way back along the trail and there was no spot wide enough for a threepoint turn at last the surface improved and he was driving on gravel as he turned a long highcambered bend he found himself suddenly in front of a house on the grass outside was parked a police mini metro a narrow stream trickled past the front entrance there was no garden to speak of just meadow and then forest and a smell of wet pine in the air in the distance beyond the back of the house the land climbed and climbed rebus got out of the car feeling his nerves jangle back into position the door of the metro had already opened and out stepped a farm labourer in police uniform it was like some sort of guinness challenge how large a man can you get in the front of a mini metro he was also young late teens or early twenties he gave a big rubicund smile inspector rebus constable moffat the hand rebus shook was as large as a coal shovel but surprisingly smooth almost delicate detective sergeant knox was going to be here but something came up he sends his apologies and hopes ill do instead this being my neck of the woods so to speak rebus who was rubbing his neck at this point smiled at the joke then he pressed a thumb either side of his spine and straightened up exhaling noisily vertebrae clicked and crunched long drive eh constable moffat commented but youve made not bad time ive only been here five minutes myself have you had another look round not yet no thought id best wait rebus nodded lets start with the outside big place isnt it i mean after that road up to it i was expecting something a bit more basic well the house was here first thats the point used to have a fine garden wellkept drive and that forest was hardly there at all before my time of course i think the place was built in the s part of the kelman estate the estate got sold off bit by bit there used to be estate workers to keep the place in check not these days and this is what happens still the house looks in good nick oh aye but youll see theres a few slates missing and the gutters could do with patching up moffat spoke with the confidence of the diyer they were circling the house it was a twostorey affair of solidlooking stone to rebuss mind it wouldnt have been out of place on the outskirts of edinburgh it was just a bit odd to find it in a clearing in the wilderness there was a back door beside which sat a solitary dustbin do the bins get emptied around here they do if you can get them down to the roadside rebus lifted the lid the smell was truly awful a rotting side of salmon by the shape of it and some chicken or duck bones im surprised the animals havent been at those moffat said the deer or the wildcats looks as though its been in the bin long enough doesnt it i wouldnt say they were last weeks leavings sir if thats what youre getting at rebus looked at moffat thats what im getting at he agreed the whole of last week and for a few days before that mrs jack was away from home driving a black bmw supposedly staying here well if she did nobody ive spoken to saw her rebus held up a door key lets see if the inside of the house tells a different story eh but first he returned to his car and produced two pairs of clear polythene gloves he handed one pair to the constable im not even sure thesell fit you he told him but they did right try not to touch anything even though youre wearing gloves it might be you could smear or wipe a fingerprint remember this is murder were talking about not joyriding or cattle rustling okay yes sir moffat sniffed the air did you enjoy your chips i can smell the vinegar from here rebus slammed shut the car door lets go the house smelt damp at least the narrow hallway did the doors off this hallway were wide open and rebus stepped through the first into a room which stretched from the front of the house to the back the room had been decorated with comfort in mind there were three sofas a couple of armchairs and beanbags and scatter cushions there were tv and video and a hifi system sitting on the floor one of its speakers lying side on there was also mess mugs cups and glasses for a start rebus sniffed one of the mugs wine well the vinegary stuff left in it had once been wine empty bottles of burgundy champagne armagnac and stains on the carpet on the scatter cushions and on one wall where a glass had landed with some force shattering on impact ashtrays overflowed and there was a small handmirror half hidden under one of the floor cushions rebus bent down over it traces of white powder around its rim cocaine he left it where it was and approached the hifi examining the choice of music cassettes mostly fleetwood mac eric clapton simple minds and opera don giovanni and the marriage of figaro a party sir yes but how recent rebus got the feeling that this wasnt all the result of a single evening a load of bottles looked to have been pushed to one side making a little oasis of space on the floor in the midst of which sat a solitary bottle still upright and two mugs one with lipstick on its rim and how many people do you reckon half a dozen sir you could be right a lot of booze for six people maybe they dont bother clearing up between parties just what rebus was thinking lets have a look around across the hall there was a front room which had probably once been dining room or lounge but now served as a makeshift bedroom a mattress took up half the floor space sleeping bags covering the other half there were a couple of empty bottles in here too but nothing to drink out of a few art prints had been pinned to the walls on the mattress sat a pair of shoes mens size nine into one of which had been stuffed a blue sock the only room left was the kitchen pride of place seemed to go to a microwave oven beside which sat empty tins and packets of something called microwave popcorn the tins had contained lobster bisque and venison stew the double sink was filled with dishes and grey speckled water on a foldaway table sat unopened bottles of lemonade packs of orange juice and a bottle of cider there was a larger pine breakfast table its surface dotted with soup droppings but free from dishes and other detritus on the floor around it however lay empty crisp packets a knockedover ashtray breadsticks cutlery a plastic apron and some serviettes quick way of clearing a table said moffat yes said rebus have you ever seen the postman always rings twice the later version with jack nicholson moffat shook his head i saw him in the shining though not the same thing at all constable only theres a bit in the film where you must have heard about it where jack nicholson and the bosss wife clear the kitchen table so they can have a spot of youknowwhat on it moffat looked at the table suspiciously no he said clearly this idea was new to him what did you say the film was called its only an idea said rebus then there was upstairs a bathroom the cleanest room in the house beside the toilet sat a pile of magazines but they were old too old to yield any clue and two more bedrooms one a makeshift attempt like the one downstairs the other altogether more serious with a newishlooking wooden fourposter wardrobe chest of drawers and dressing table improbably above the bed had been mounted the head of a highland cow rebus stared at the stuff on the dressing table powders lipsticks scents and paints there were clothes in the wardrobe mostly womens clothes but also mens denims and cords gregor jack could give no description of what clothing his wife had taken with her when she left he couldnt even be sure that shed taken any until he noticed that her small green suitcase was missing the green suitcase jutting out from beneath the bed rebus pulled it out and opened it it was empty so were most of the drawers we keep a change of clothes up there jack had told detectives enough for emergencies thats all rebus stared at the bed its pillows had been fluffed up and the duvet lay straight and smooth across it a sign of recent habitation god knows this was it the last room in the house what had he learned at the end of his hundredoddmile drive hed learned that mrs jacks suitcase the one mr jack said shed taken with her was here anything else nothing he sat down on the bed it crackled beneath him he stood up again and pulled back the duvet the bed was covered in newspapers sunday newspapers all of them open at the same story mp found in sex den raid so shed been here and she knew knew about the raid about operation creeper unless someone else had been here and planted this stuff no keep to the obvious his eye caught something else he moved aside one of the pillows tied to the post behind it was a pair of black tights another pair had been tied to the opposite post moffat was staring quizzically but rebus thought the young man had learned enough for one day it was an interesting scenario all the same tied to her bed and left there moffat could have come looked the house over and gone without ever being aware of her presence upstairs but it wouldnt work if you were really going to restrain someone you wouldnt use tights too easy to escape tights were for sexgames for restraint youd use something stronger twine or handcuffs like the handcuffs in gregor jacks dustbin at least now rebus knew that shed known so why hadnt she got in touch with her husband there was no telephone at the lodge wheres the nearest callbox he asked moffat who still seemed interested in the tights about a mile and a half away on the road outside cragstone farm rebus checked his watch it was four oclock okay id like to take a look at it then well call it a day but i want this place gone over for fingerprints christ knows there should be enough of them then we need to check and double check the shops petrol stations pubs hotels say within a twentymile radius moffat looked doubtful thats an awful lot of places rebus ignored him a black bmw i think some more handouts are being printed today theres a photo of mrs jack and the car description and registration if she was up this way and she was somebody must have seen her well folk keep to themselves you know yes but theyre not blind are they and if were lucky they wont be suffering from amnesia either come on sooner we look at that phonebox the sooner i can get to my digs actually rebuss original plan had been to sleep in the car and claim the price of a b ampb pocketing the money but the weather looked uninviting and the thought of spending a night cramped in his car like a halfshut knife so on the way to the phonebox he signalled to a stop outside a roadside cottage advertising bed amp breakfast and knocked on the door the elderly woman seemed suspicious at first but finally agreed that she had a vacancy rebus told her hed be back in an hour giving her time to air the room then he returned to his car and followed moffats careful driving all the way to cragstone farm it wasnt much of a farm actually a short track led from the main road to a cluster of buildings house byre some sheds and a barn the phonebox was by the side of the main road fifty yards along from the farm and on the other side of the road next to a layby big enough to allow them to park their two cars it was one of the original red boxes they darent change it said moffat mrs corbie up at the farm would have a fit rebus didnt understand this at first but then he opened the door to the phonebox and he understood for one thing it had a carpet a good carpet too a thickpiled offcut there was a smell of air freshener and a posy of field flowers had been placed in a small glass jar on the shelf beside the apparatus its better kept than my flat rebus said when can i move in its mrs corbie moffat said with a grin she reckons a dirty phonebox would reflect badly on her seeing her house is closest shes been keeping it spick and span since god knows when a pity though rebus had been hoping for something some hint or clue but supposing there had been anything it must certainly have been tidied away id like to talk to mrs corbie its a tuesday said moffat shes at her sisters on a tuesday rebus pointed back along the road to where a car was braking hard signalling to pull into the farms driveway what about him moflat looked then smiled coldly her son alec a bit of a tearaway he wont tell us anything gets into trouble does he speeding mostly hes one of the local boy racers cant say i blame him theres not much to occupy the teenagers round here you cant be much more than a teenager yourself constable you didnt get into trouble i had the church sir believe me the fear of god is something to reckon with rebuss landlady mrs wilkie was something to reckon with too it started when he was changing in his bedroom it was a nice bedroom a bit overdone on the frills and finery but with a comfortable bed and a twelveinch black and white television mrs wilkie had shown him the kitchen and told him he should feel free to make himself tea and coffee whenever he felt like it then she had shown him the bathroom and told him the water was hot if he felt like a bath then she had led him back to the kitchen and told him that he could make himself a cup of tea or coffee whenever he felt like it rebus didnt have the heart to tell her hed heard it all before she was tiny with a tiny voice between his first visit and his second she had dressed in her best b ampbkeepers clothes and tied some pearls around her neck he reckoned her to be in her late seventies she was a widow her husband andrew having died in and she did the b ampb as much for the company as the money she always seemed to get nice guests interesting people like the german jambuyer who had stayed for a few nights last autumn and heres your bedroom ive given it a bit of an airing and its very nice thank you rebus put his bag on the bed saw her ominous look and shifted it off the bed and on to the floor i made the bedspread myself she said with a smile i was once advised to go professional selling my bedspreads but at my age she gave a chuckle it was a german gentleman told me that he was in scotland to buy jam would you credit it he stayed here a few nights eventually she recalled her duties shed just go and make them a spot of supper supper rebus glanced at his watch unless it had stopped it was not yet five thirty but then hed booked bed and breakfast and any hot meal tonight would be a bonus moffat had given him directions to the closest pub tourist place tourist prices before leaving him for the undoubted delights of dufftown the fear of god he had just slipped off his trousers when the door opened and mrs wilkie stood there is that you andrew i thought i heard a noise her eyes had a glassy faraway look rebus stood there frozen then swallowed go and make us some supper he said quietly oh yes mrs wilkie said you must be hungry youve been gone such a long time then the idea of a quick bath appealed he looked into the kitchen first and saw that mrs wilkie was busy at the stove humming to herself so he headed for the bathroom there was no lock on the door or rather there was a lock but half of it was hanging loose he looked around him but saw nothing he could wedge against the door he decided to take his chance and started both taps running there was a furious pressure to the water and the bath filled quickly and hotly rebus undressed and sank beneath the surface his shoulders were stiff from the drive and he massaged them as best he could then he lifted his knees so that his shoulders neck and head slid into the water immersion he thought of dr curt of drowning and immersion skin wrinkling hair and nails shedding silt in the bronchial a noise brought him to the surface he cleared his eyes blinked and saw that mrs wilkie was staring down at him a dish towel in her hands oh she said oh dear im sorry and she retreated behind the door calling through it i quite forgot you were here i was just going to well never mind it can wait rebus screwed shut his eyes and sank beneath the waves the meal was to his surprise good if a bit odd cheese pudding boiled potatoes and carrots followed by tinned steamed pudding and packet custard so convenient as mrs wilkie commented the shock of seeing a naked man in her bathtub seemed to have brought her into the here and now and they talked about the weather the tourists and the government until the meal was over rebus asked if he could wash the dishes and was told he could not much to his relief instead he asked mrs wilkie for a frontdoor key then set off stomach full clean of body and underwear for the heather hoose not a name he would have chosen for his own pub he entered by the lounge door but the place being dead pushed through another door into the public bar two men and a woman stood at the bar and shared a joke while a barman studiously filled glasses from a whisky optic the group looked round at rebus as he came and stood not too far from them evening they nodded back almost without seeing him and the barman returned the greeting setting down three double measures of whisky on the bar and one for yourself said one of the customers handing across a tenpound note thanks said the barman ill have a nip myself for later on behind the array of optics bottles and glasses the wall was mirrored so rebus was able to study the group without seeming to the man who had spoken sounded english there had been only two cars in the pubs courtyard a beatenup renault and a daimler rebus reckoned he knew who owned which yes sir asked the barman and renault owner pint of export please certainly the wonder of it was that three welloff english tourists would drink in the public bar maybe they just hadnt noticed that the heather hoose possessed such an amenity as a lounge all three looked a bit the worse for wear mostly from drink the woman had a formidable face framed by dyed platinum hair her cheeks were too red and her eyelashes too black when she sucked on her cigarette she arched her head up to blow the smoke ceilingwards rebus tried counting the lines on her neck maybe it worked the way it did with treerings there you are the pint glass was placed on a mat in front of him he handed over a fiver quiet tonight midweek and not quite the season recited the barman who had obviously just said the same thing to the other group itll get busier later on then he retreated to the till another round here when youre ready said the englishman the only one of the three to have finished his whisky he was in his late thirties younger than the woman he looked fit prosperous but somehow faintly disreputable it had something to do with the way he stood slightly slouched and looming as though he might be about either to fall down or else pounce and his head swayed a little from side to side in time with his sleepy eyelids the third member of the group was younger still midthirties he was smoking french cigarettes and staring at the bottles above the bar either that thought rebus or hes looking at me in the mirror the way im looking at him certainly it was a possibility the man had an affected way of tapping the ash from his affected cigarette rebus noticed that he smoked without inhaling holding the smoke in his mouth and releasing it in a single belch while his companions stood he rested on one of the high bar stools rebus had to admit he was intrigued an unlikely little threesome and about to become more unlikely still a couple of people had entered the lounge bar and looked like staying there the barman slipped through a doorway between rooms to serve these new customers and this seemed to start off a conversation between the two men and the woman god the nerve he hasnt served us yet well jamie were not exactly gasping are we speak for yourself i hardly felt that first one slip down should have asked for quadruples in the first place have mine said the woman if youre going to become ratty i am not becoming ratty said the slouching pouncer becoming very ratty indeed well fuck you then rebus had to stifle a grin the woman had said this as though it were part of any polite conversation and fuck you too louise ssh the frenchsmoker warned remember were not alone the other man and woman looked towards rebus who sat staring straight ahead glass to lips yes we are said the man were all alone this utterance seemed to signal the end of the conversation the barman reappeared same again barman if youll be so kind the evening hotted up quickly three locals appeared and started to play dominoes at a nearby table rebus wondered if they were paid to come in and add the requisite local colour there was probably more colour in a meadowbank thistleraith rovers friendly two other drinkers appeared wedging themselves in between rebus and the threesome they seemed to take it as an insult that there were other drinkers in the bar before them and that some of those drinkers were standing next to their space at the bar so they drank in dour silence merely exchanging looks whenever the englishman or his two friends said anything look said the woman are we heading back tonight if not wed better think about accommodation we could sleep at the lodge rebus put down his glass dont be so sick the woman retorted i thought that was why we came i wouldnt be able to sleep maybe thats why they call it a wake the englishmans laughter filled the silent bar then died a domino clacked on to a table another chapped rebus left his glass where it was and approached the group did i hear you mention a lodge the englishman blinked slowly whats it to you im a police officer rebus brought out his id the two dour regulars finished their drinks and left the bar funny how an id had that effect sometimes detective inspector rebus which lodge did you mean all three looked sober now it was an act but a good act years in the learning well officer said the englishman now what business is that of yours depends which lodge you were talking about sir theres a nice police station at dufftown if youd prefer to go there deer lodge said the frenchsmoker a friend of ours owns it owned it corrected the woman you were friends of mrs jack then they were introductions were made the englishman was actually a scot jamie kilpatrick the antique dealer the woman was louise pattersonscott wife separated of the retail tycoon the other man was julian kaymer the painter ive already spoken with the police julian kaymer said they telephoned me yesterday yes they had all been questioned asked if they knew mrs jacks movements but they hadnt seen her for weeks i spoke to her on the telephone mrs pattersonscott announced a few days before she went off on holiday she didnt say where she was going just that she fancied a few days away by herself so what are you all doing here rebus asked this is a wake said kilpatrick our little token of friendship our time of mourning so why dont you bugger off and let us get on with it ignore him inspector said julian kaymer hes a bit pissed what i am stated kilpatrick is a bit upset emotional rebus offered exactly inspector kaymer carried on the story it was my idea wed all been on the phone to each other none of us really able to take it in devastated so i said why dont we take a run to the lodge that was where we all met last at a party asked rebus kaymer nodded a month back a great bloody big pissup it was confirmed kilpatrick so said kaymer the plan was to drive here have a few drinks in memory of lizzie and drive back not everybody could make it prior commitments and so on but here we are well said rebus i would like you to look inside the house but theres no point going out there in the dark what i dont want is the three of you going out there on your own the place still has to be gone over for fingerprints they looked a bit puzzled at this you havent heard rebus said recalling that curt had only revealed his findings that morning its a murder hunt now mrs jack was murdered oh no christ im going to be and louise pattersonscott wife of the et cetera threw up on to the carpeted floor julian kaymer was weeping and jamie kilpatrick was losing all the blood from his face the barman stared in horror while the domino players stopped their game one of them had to restrain his dog from investigating further it cowered under the table and licked its whiskery chops local colour as provided by john rebus finally a hotel was found not far out of dufftown it was arranged that the three would spend the night there rebus had considered asking mrs wilkie if she had any spare rooms but thought better of it they would stay at the hotel and meet rebus at the lodge in the morning bright and early some of them had jobs to get back to when rebus returned to the cottage mrs wilkie was knitting by her gas fire and watching a film on the tv he put his head round the living room door ill say goodnight mrs wilkie nightnight son mind say your prayers ill be up to tuck you in a bit later on rebus made himself a mug of tea went to his room and wedged the chair against the door handle he opened the window to let in some air switched on his own little television and fell on to the bed there was something wrong with the picture on the tv and he couldnt fix it the vertical hold had gone so he switched it off again and dug into his bag coming up with fish out of water well hed nothing else to read and he certainly didnt feel tired he opened the book at chapter one rebus woke up the next morning with a bad feeling he half expected to turn and see mrs wilkie lying beside him saying come on andrew time for the conjugals he turned mrs wilkie was not lying beside him she was outside his door and trying to get in mr rebus mr rebus a soft knock then a hard the door seems to be jammed mr rebus are you awake ive brought you a cup of tea during which time rebus was out of bed and half dressed coming mrs wilkie but the old lady was panicking youre locked in mr rebus the doors stuck shall i call for a carpenter oh dear hold on mrs wilkie i think ive got it his shirt still unbuttoned rebus put his weight to the door keeping it shut and at the same time lifted the chair away stretching so as to place it nearer the bed then he made show of thumping the edges of the door before pulling it open are you all right mr rebus oh dear thats never happened before dear me no rebus lifted the cup and saucer from her hand and began pouring the tea back from saucer into cup thank you mrs wilkie he made show of sniffing is something cooking oh dear yes breakfast and off she toddled back down the stairs rebus felt a bit guilty for having pulled the lockeddoor stunt hed show her after breakfast that the door was all right really that she didnt need to phone for cowboy carpenters to put it right but for now he had to continue the process of waking up it was seven thirty the tea was cold but the day seemed unseasonably warm he sat on the bed for a moment collecting his thoughts what day was it it was wednesday what needed to be done today what was the best order to do it in hed to return to the cottage with the three stooges then there was mrs corbie to speak to and something else something hed been thinking about last night in the melting moment between waking and sleep well why not he was in the area anyway hed telephone after breakfast a fryup by the smell of it rather than patiences usual choice of muesli or bran crunch ah that was another thing hed meant to phone patience last night hed do it today just to say hello he thought about her for a little while patience and her collection of pets then he finished dressing and made his way downstairs he was first to arrive at the lodge he let himself in and wandered into the living room immediately he knew something was different the place was tidier tidier well say then that there was less debris around than before half the bottles looked to have disappeared he wondered what else had vanished he lifted the scatter cushions searching in vain for the handmirror damn he fairly flew through to the kitchen the back window was lying in shards in the sink and on the floor here the mess was as bad as before except that the microwave had gone he went upstairs slowly the place seemed deserted but you never could tell the bathroom and small bedroom were as before so was the main bedroom no hold on the tights had been untied from their bedposts and were now lying innocently on the floor rebus crouched and picked one up then dropped it again thoughtfully he made his way back downstairs a burglary yes break in and steal the microwave that was the way it was supposed to look but no petty thief would take empty bottles and a mirror with him no petty thief would have reason to untie pairs of tights from bedposts that didnt matter though did it what mattered was that the evidence had to disappear now it would merely be rebuss word yes sir im sure there was a mirror in the living room lying on the floor a small mirror with traces of white powder on it and youre sure youre not merely imagining this inspector you could be wrong couldnt you no no he couldnt but it was too late for all that why take the bottles and only some of them not all obviously because some bottles had certain prints on them why take the mirror maybe fingerprints again should have thought of all this yesterday john stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid and hed done the damage himself hadnt he told the three stooges not to go near the lodge because it hadnt been fingerprinted then hed let them wander off with no guard left on the house a constable should have been here all night stupid stupid it had to be one of them didnt it the woman or one of the men but why why had they done it so it couldnt be proved theyd been there in the first place again why it didnt make much sense not much sense at all stupid he heard a car approaching pulling up outside and went to meet it it was the daimler kilpatrick driving pattersonscott in the passenger seat and julian kaymer emerging from the rear kilpatrick looked a lot breezier than before inspector good morning to you morning sir how was the hotel fair id say only fair better than average added kaymer kilpatrick turned to him julian when youre used to excellence as i am you no longer recognize average and better than kaymer stuck his tongue out children children chided louise pattersonscott but they all seemed light of heart you sound chirpy rebus said a decent nights sleep and a long breakfast said kilpatrick patting his stomach you stayed at the hotel last night they seemed not to understand his question you didnt go for a drive or anything no kilpatrick said his tone wary its your car isnt it mr kilpatrick yes and you kept the keys with you last night look inspector did you or didnt you i suppose i did in my jacket pocket hanging up in your bedroom correct look can we go ins any visitors to your room inspector interrupted louise pattersonscott perhaps if youd tell us someone broke into the lodge during the night disturbing potential evidence thats a serious crime madam and you think one of us i dont think anything yet madam but whoever did it must have come by car mr kilpatrick here has a car both julian and i are capable of driving inspector yes said kaymer and besides we all went to jamies room for a latenight brandy so any one of you could have taken the car kilpatrick shrugged mightily i still dont see he said why you think we should want as i say mr kilpatrick i dont think anything all i know is that a murder inquiry is under way mrs jacks last known whereabouts remain this lodge and now someones trying to tamper with evidence rebus paused thats all i know you can come inside now but please dont touch anything id like to ask you all a few questions really what he wanted to ask was is the house pretty much in the state you remember it from the last party here but he was asking too much yes they remembered drinking champagne and armagnac and a lot of wine they remembered cooking popcorn in the microwave some people drove off recklessly no doubt into the night while others slept where they lay or staggered off into the various bedrooms no gregor hadnt been present he didnt enjoy parties not his wifes at any rate a bit of a bore old gregor commented jamie kilpatrick at least i thought he was till i saw that story about the brothel just goes to show but there had been another party hadnt there a more recent party barney byars had told rebus about it that night in the pub a party of gregors friends of the pack who else knew rebus was on his way up here who else knew what he might find who else might want to stop him finding anything well gregor jack knew and what he knew the pack might know too maybe not one of these three then maybe someone entirely different seems funny said louise pattersonscott to think we wont be having parties here any more to think liz wont be here to think shes gone she began to cry loudly and tearfully jamie kilpatrick put an arm around her and she buried her face in his chest she reached out a hand and found julian kaymer pulling him to her so that he too could be embraced and thats pretty much how they were when constable moffat arrived rebus with a real sense of bolting the stable door left moffat to stand guard much against the young mans will but the forensics team would be arriving before lunchtime and detective sergeant knox with them there are some magazines in the bathroom if you need something to read rebus told moffat or better still here and he opened the car reached into his bag and took out fish out of water dont bother returning it think of it as a sort of present then the daimler having already left rebus got into his own car waved back at constable moffat and was off hed read fish out of water last night every fraught sentence of it it was a dreadful romantic tale of doomed love between a young italian sculptor and a wealthy but bored married woman the sculptor had come to england to work on a commission for the womans husband at first she uses him like a plaything but then falls in love meantime the sculptor bowled over by her at first has moved his attentions to her niece and so on it looked to rebus as though the title alone had been what had made ronald steele pluck it from the shelf and throw it with such venom yes just that title the title too of the young sculptors statue the fish out of water was liz jack but rebus wondered whether shed been out of water or just out of her depth he drove to cragstone farm parking in the yard to the rear of the farmhouse scattering chickens and ducks before him mrs corbie was at home and took him into the kitchen where there was a wondrous smell of baking the large kitchen table was white with flour but only a few globes of leftover pastry remained rebus couldnt help recalling that scene in the postman always rings twice sit yourself down she ordered ive just made a pot rebus was given tea and some of yesterdays batch of fruit scones with fresh butter and thick strawberry jam ever thought about doing b ampb mrs corbie me i wouldnt have the patience she was wiping her hands on her white cotton apron she seemed always to be wiping her hands mind you its not for shortage of space my husband passed away last year so now theres just alec and me what running the whole farm she made a face running it down would be more like it alec just isnt interested its a sin but there you are weve got a couple of workers but when they see hes not interested they cant see why they should be wed be as well selling up thats what alec would like maybe thats the only thing that stops me from doing it she was looking at her hands then she slapped them against her thighs goodness would you listen to me now inspector what was it you wanted after all his years on the force rebus reckoned that at last he was in the presence of someone with a genuinely clear conscience it didnt usually take so long for people to ask what a policeman was after when it did take so long the person either knew already what was wanted or else had absolutely nothing to fear or to hide so rebus asked his question i notice you keep the telephone kiosk sparkling mrs corbie i was wondering if youd noticed anything suspicious recently i mean anything up at the box oh well let me think she placed the flat of one hand against her cheek i cant say what sort of thing exactly inspector rebus couldnt look her in the eye for he knew that she had started to lie to him a woman perhaps making a telephone call something left in the box a note or a telephone number anything at all no no nothing in the box his voice hardened a little well outside the box then mrs corbie im thinking specifically of a week ago last wednesday or maybe the tuesday she was shaking her head have another scone inspector he did and chewed slowly in silence mrs corbie looked to be doing some thinking she got up and checked in her oven then she poured the last of the tea from the pot and returned to her seat studying her hands again laying them against her lap for inspection but she didnt say anything so rebus did you were here last wednesday she nodded but not the tuesday i go to my sisters on a tuesday i was here all day wednesday though what about your son she shrugged he might have been here or maybe he was in dufftown he spends a lot of time off gallivanting hes not here just now no hes gone to town which town he didnt say just said he was off rebus stood up and went to the kitchen window it faced on to the yard where chickens now pecked at rebuss tyres one of them was sitting on the bonnet of the car is it possible to see the kiosk from the house mrs corbie eh yes from the sitting room but we dont spend much time in there that is i dont i prefer here in the kitchen could i take a look well it was clear enough who did spend time in the living room there was a direct line between sofa coffee table and television set the coffee table was marked with rings made by too many hot mugs on the floor by the sofa there was an ashtray and the remains of a huge bag of crisps three empty beer cans lay on their sides beneath the coffee table mrs corbie tuttutted and went to work lifting the cans rebus went to the window and peered out he could make out the kiosk in the distance but only just it was possible alec corbie might have seen something possible but doubtful not worth sticking around for hed let ds knox come and ask corbie the questions well he said thanks for your help mrs corbie oh her relief was palpable right you are inspector ill see you out but rebus knew he had one last bet worth laying he stood with mrs corbie in the yard and looked around him i used to love farms when i was a lad a pal of mine lived on one he glibly lied i used to go up there every evening after tea it was great he turned his wideeyed nostalgic smile towards her mind if i take a wander round oh no relief now rather sheer terror which didnt stop rebus no it pushed him on so that before she knew it he was walking up to the hutches and sties looking in moving on on past the chickens and the roused ducks into the barn straw underfoot and a strong smell of cattle concrete cubicles coiled hosepipes and a leaking tap there were pools of water underfoot one sicklooking cow blinked slowly at him from its enclosure but the livestock wasnt his concern the tarpaulin in the corner was whats under here mrs corbie thats alecs property she shrieked dont touch it its nothing to do with but hed already yanked the tarpaulin off what was he expecting to find something nothing what he did find was a black bmw series bearing elizabeth jacks registration it was rebuss turn to tuttut but only after hed sucked in his breath and held back a whoop of delight dear me mrs corbie he said this is just the very car ive been looking for but mrs corbie wasnt listening hes a good laddie he doesnt mean any harm i dont know what id do without him and so on while rebus circled the car looking but not touching lucky the forensics team was on its way theyd be kept busy wait what was that on the back seat a huddled shape he peered in through the tinted glass expect the unexpected john he muttered to himself it was a microwave duthil rebus telephoned edinburgh to make his report and request an extra days stay up north lauderdale sounded so impressed that the car had been found that rebus forgot to tell him about the breakin at the lodge then once alec corbie had arrived home drunk and in charge of a vehicle but let that pass hed been arrested and taken to dufftown rebus seemed to be stretching the local police like theyd never been stretched before so that detective sergeant knox had to be diverted from the lodge and brought to the farm instead he looked like an older brother of constable moffat or perhaps a close cousin i want forensics to go over that car rebus told him priority the lodge can wait knox rubbed his chin itll take a towtruck a trailer would be better ill see what i can do where will you want it taken anywhere secure and with a roof the police garage itll do what exactly are we looking for christ knows rebus went back into the kitchen where mrs corbie was sitting at the table studying an array of burnt cakes he opened his mouth to speak but kept his silence she was an accessory of course shed lied to him to protect her son well they had the son now and he was the one that mattered as quietly as he could rebus left the farmhouse and started his car staring through the windscreen at his bonnet where one of the chickens had left him a little gift he was able to avail himself of dufftown police station for the interview with alec corbie youre in keech up to your chin son start at the beginning and leave nothing out rebus and corbie seated across the table from one another were smoking ds knox resting against the wall behind rebus was not corbie had prepared an extremely thin veneer of macho indifference which rebus was quick to wipe off this is a murder investigation the victims car has been found in your barn itll be dusted for prints and if we find yours im going to have to charge you with murder anything you think you know that might help your case youd better talk then seeing the effect of these words youre in keech up to your chin son start at the beginning and leave nothing out corbie sang like his namesake it didnt make for edifying listening but it had an honest sound first though he asked for some paracetamol ive got a hell of a headache thats what daytime drinking does to you said rebus knowing it wasnt the drinking that was to blame it was the stopping the tablets were brought and swallowed washed down with water corbie coughed a little then lit another cigarette rebus had stubbed his out he just couldnt deal with them any more the car was in the layby corbie began it was there for hours so i went and took a look the keys were still in the ignition i started her up and brought her back to the farm why he shrugged never refuse a gift horse he grinned or gift horsepower eh the two detectives were not impressed no well it was you know like with treasure finders keepers you didnt think the owner was coming back he shrugged again never really thought about it all i knew was that there were going to be some gey jealous looks if i turned up in town driving a bmw you planned to race it the question came from ds knox sure knox explained to rebus they take cars out on to the back roads and race them one against one rebus remembered the phrase moffat had used boy racer you didnt see the owner then he asked corbie shrugged what does that mean it means maybe there was another car in the layby looked like a couple were in it having an argument i heard them from the yard what did you see just that the bmw was parked and this other car was in front of it you didnt get a look at the other car no but i could hear the shouting sounded like a man and a woman what were they arguing about no idea no corbie shook his head firmly okay said rebus and this was on wednesday wednesday morning maybe around lunchtime rebus nodded thoughtfully alibis would need rechecking where was your mother all this time in the kitchen same as always did you mention the argument to her corbie shook his head no point rebus nodded again wednesday morning elizabeth jack was killed that day an argument in a layby youre sure it was an argument ive been in enough in my time it was an argument all right the woman was screeching anything else alec corbie seemed to relax at the use of his first name maybe he wouldnt be in trouble after all so long as he told them well the other car disappeared but the bmw was still there couldnt tell if there was anyone in it windows being tinted but a radio was playing then in the afternoon so the car had been there all morning thats right then in the afternoon what time precisely no idea i think there was horseracing or something on the telly go on well i looked out and there was another car had turned up or maybe it was the same one come back you still couldnt see i saw it better the second time dont know what make it was but it was blue light blue im fairly sure of that cars would need checking jamie kilpatricks daimler wasnt blue gregor jacks saab wasnt blue rab kinnouls landrover wasnt blue anyway corbie was saying then there was more shouting the odds i reckon it was coming from the bmw because at one point the volume went right up on the radio rebus nodded appreciation of the observation then what corbie shrugged it went quiet again next time i looked out the other car was gone and the bmw was still there later on i took a wander into the yard and through the field took a closer look the passenger door was a bit open didnt look as though anyone was there so i crossed the road keys were in the ignition he gave a final shrug he had told his all and an interesting all it was two other cars or had the car from the morning returned in the afternoon who had liz jack been calling from the phonebox what had she been arguing about the volume rising on the radio to mask an argument or because in the course of a struggle the knob had been moved his head was beginning to birl again he suggested they have some coffee three plastic cups were brought with sugar and a plate containing four digestive biscuits corbie seemed relaxed in the hardback chair one leg slung over the other and smoking yet another cigarette so far knox had eaten all the biscuits right said rebus now what about the microwave the microwave was easy the microwave was more treasure again found by the side of the road you dont expect us to believe that knox sneered but rebus could believe it its the truth corbie said easily whether you believe it or not sergeant knox i was out in the car this morning and saw it lying in a ditch i couldnt believe it someone had just dumped it there well it looked good enough so i thought id take it home but why did you hide it corbie shifted in his seat i knew my mum would think id nicked it well anyway shed never believe i just found it so i decided to keep it out of her way till i could come up with a story there was a breakin last night rebus said at deer lodge do you know it that mp owns it the one from the brothel you know it then i think that microwave was stolen during the breakin not by me it wasnt well well know soon enough the place is being dusted for prints lot of dusting going on corbie commented you lot are worse than my mum believe it rebus said rising to his feet one last thing alec the car what did you tell your mum about it nothing much said i was storing it for a friend not that shed have believed it but if she lost her son she lost her farm too all right alec said rebus its time to get it all down on paper just what youve told us sergeant knox will help you he paused by the door then if were still not happy that youve told us the truth and nothing but maybe itll be time to talk about drunk driving eh it was a long drive back to mrs wilkies and rebus regretted not having taken a room in dufftown still it gave him time to think he had made a telephone call from the station putting back a certain appointment until tomorrow morning so the rest of today was free clouds had settled low over the hills so much for the nice weather this was how rebus remembered the highlands louring and forbidding terrible things had happened here in the past massacres and forced migrations blood feuds as vicious as any cases of cannibalism too he seemed to recall terrible things who had killed liz jack and why the husband was always the first to fall under suspicion well others could do the suspecting rebus for one didnt believe it why not why not well look at the evidence that wednesday morning jack had been at a constituency meeting then a game of golf and in the evening hed attended some function according to whom according to jack himself and to helen greig plus his car was white there could be no mistaking it for blue plus someone was out to get jack into terrible trouble and that was the person rebus needed to find unless it had been liz jack herself hed thought about that too but then there were the anonymous phone calls according to whom only barney byars helen greig had been unable or unwilling to confirm their existence rebus realized now that he really did need to talk to gregor jack again did his wife have any lovers judging by what rebus had learned of her the question needed changing to how many did she have one two more or was he guilty of judging what he did not know after all he knew next to nothing about elizabeth jack he knew what her allies and her critics thought of her but he knew nothing of her except that judging by her tastes in friends and furnishings she hadnt had much taste thursday morning a week since the body had been found he woke up early but was in no hurry to rise and this time he let mrs wilkie bring him his tea in bed shed had a good night never once thinking him her longdead husband or longlost son so he reckoned she deserved not to be kept out of the bedroom not only tea this morning but ginger nuts too and the tea was hot but the day was cool still grey and drizzly well never mind hed be heading back to civilization just as soon as hed paid his respects elsewhere he ate a hurried breakfast and received a peck on the cheek from mrs wilkie before leaving come back again some time she called waving to him from the door and i hope the jam sells all right the rain came on at its heaviest just as his windscreen wipers gave up he stopped the car to study his map then dashed outside to give the wipers a quick shake it had happened before they just stuck and could be righted with a bit of force except this time they really had packed in and not a garage in sight so he drove slowly and found after a while that the heavier the rain fell the clearer his windscreen became it was the slow fine rain that was the problem blotting out all but the vaguest shapes and outlines the heavy dollops of rain came and went so fast that they seemed to clear the windscreen rather than obscuring it which was just as well for the rain stayed heavy all the way to duthil duthil special hospital had been planned and built to act as a showpiece for treatment of the criminally insane like the other special hospitals dotted around the british isles it was just that a hospital it wasnt a prison and patients who arrived in its care were treated like patients not prisoners treatment not punishment was its function and with the brand new buildings came uptodate methods and understandings all this the hospitals medical director dr frank forster told rebus in his pleasant but purposeful office rebus had spent a long time last night on the telephone with patience and shed told him much the same thing fine thought rebus but it was still a place of detention the people who came here came with no time limit attached no sentence that had to be served the main gates were operated electronically and by guards and everywhere rebus had gone so far the doors had been locked again behind him but now dr forster was talking about recreation facilities staffpatient ratios the weekly disco he was obviously proud he was also obviously overdoing it rebus saw him for what he was the frontman whose job it was to publicize the benefits of this particular special hospital the caring attitude the role of treatment the likes of broadmoor had come in for a lot of criticism in previous years to avoid criticism you needed good pr and dr forster looked good pr he was young for a start a good few years younger than rebus and he had a healthy scrupulous look to him with a smile always just around the corner he reminded rebus of gregor jack that enthusiasm and energy that public image it used to be the sort of stuff rebus associated with american presidential campaigns now it was everywhere even in the asylums the lunatics hadnt taken over the imagemen had we have just over three hundred patients here forster was saying and we like the staff to get to know as many of them as possible i dont just mean faces i mean names first names at that this isnt bedlam inspector rebus those days are long past thank god but youre a secure unit yes you deal with the criminally insane forster smiled again you wouldnt know it to look at most of our patients do you know the majority of them over sixty per cent i believe have aboveaverage iqs i think some of them are brighter than i am a laugh this time then the serious face again the caring face a lot of our patients are confused deluded theyre depressed or schizophrenic but theyre not i assure you anything like the lunatics you see in the movies take andrew macmillan for example the file had been on forsters desk all along he now opened it hes been with us since the hospital opened before that he was in much less savoury surroundings he was making no progress at all before he came here now hes becoming more talkative and he seems about ready to participate in some of the available activities i believe he plays a very good game of chess but is he still dangerous forster chose not to answer he suffers occasional panic attacks hyperventilation but nothing like the frenzies he went into before he closed the file i would say inspector that andrew macmillan is on his way to a complete recovery now why do you want to talk to him so rebus explained about the pack about the friendship between mack macmillan and gregor jack about elizabeth jacks murder and the fact that she had been staying not forty miles from duthil i just wondered if shed visited well we can check that for you forster was flipping through the file again interesting theres nothing in here about mr macmillan knowing mr jack or about his having that nickname mack did you say he reached for a pencil ill just make a note he did so then flicked through the file again apparently mr macmillan has written to several mps in the past and to other public figures mr jack is mentioned he read a little more in silence then closed the file and picked up the telephone audrey can you bring me the records of recent visitors say in the last month thanks duthil wasnt exactly a tourist attraction and out of sight being out of mind there were few enough entries in the book so it was the work of minutes to find what rebus was looking for the visit took place on saturday the day after operation creeper but before the story became public knowledge eliza ferrie he read patient visited andrew macmillan relation to patient friend signed in at three oclock and out again at four thirty our regular visiting hours forster explained patients can have visitors in the main recreation room but ive arranged for you to see andrew in his ward his ward just a large room really four beds to a room but we call them wards to enforce perhaps enhance would be a better word to enhance the hospital atmosphere andrews in the kinnoul ward rebus started why kinnoul pardon why call the ward kinnoul forster smiled after the actor you must have heard of rab kinnoul he and his wife are among the hospitals patrons rebus decided not to say anything about cath kinnoul being one of the pack about her having known macmillan at school it was no business of his but the kinnouls went up in his estimation well cath did she had not it seemed forgotten her onetime friend nobody calls me gowk any more and liz jack too had visited albeit under her maiden name and with a twist to her christian name to boot he could understand that the papers would have had a field day mps wifes visits to crazed killer all those possessives she couldnt have known that the papers were about to have their story anyway perhaps at the end of your visit dr forster said youd like to see some of our facilities pool gym workshops workshops simple mechanics car maintenance that sort of thing you mean you give the patients spanners and screwdrivers forster laughed and we count them in again at the end of the session rebus had thought of something did you say car maintenance i dont suppose somebody could take a look at my windscreen wipers forster started to laugh again but rebus shook his head im serious he said then ill see what we can do forster rose to his feet ready when you are inspector im ready said rebus not at all sure that he was there was much passing through corridors and the nurse who was to show rebus to kinnoul ward had to unlock and relock countless doors a heavy chain of keys swung from his waistband rebus attempted conversation but the nurse replied with short measures there was just the one incident they were passing along a corridor when from an open doorway a hand appeared grabbing at rebus a small elderly man was trying to say something eyes shining mouth making tiny movements back into your room homer said the nurse prising the fingers from rebuss jacket the man scuttled back inside rebus waited a moment for his heart rate to ease then asked why do you call him homer the nurse looked at him because thats his name they walked on in silence forster had been right there were few moans or groans or sudden curdling shrieks and few enough signs of movement never mind violent movement they passed through a large room where people were watching tv forster had explained that actual television wasnt allowed since it couldnt be predetermined instead there was a daily diet of specially chosen video titles the sound of music seemed to be a particular favourite the patients watched in mute fascination are they on drugs rebus hazarded the nurse suddenly became talkative as many as we can stick down their throats keeps them out of mischief so much for the caring face nothing wrong with it the nurse was saying giving them drugs its all in the mha mha mental health act allows for sedation as part of the treatment process rebus got the feeling the nurse was reciting a little defence hed prepared to deal with visitors who asked he was a big bugger not tall but broad with bulging arms do any weight training rebus asked who that lot rebus smiled i meant you oh a grin yeah i push some weights most of these places the patients get all the facilities and theres nothing for the staff but weve got a pretty good gym yeah pretty good in here another door was unlocked another corridor beckoned but off this corridor a sign pointed through yet another door unlocked to the kinnoul ward in there the guard commanded pushing open the door his voice became firm okay walk to the wall rebus thought for a moment the nurse was talking to him but he saw that the object of the command was a tall thin man who now rose from his bed and walked to the far wall where he turned to face them hands against the wall the nurse commanded andrew macmillan placed the palms of his hands against the wall behind him look began rebus is this really macmillan smiled wryly dont worry the nurse told rebus he wont bite not after what weve pumped into him you can sit there he was pointing to a table on which a board had been set for chess there were two chairs rebus sat on the one which faced andrew macmillan there were four beds but they were all empty the room was light its walls painted lemon there were three narrow barred windows through which some rare sunshine poured the nurse looked to be staying and took up position behind rebus so that he was reminded of the scene in dufftown interview room with himself and corbie and knox good morning macmillan said quietly he was balding and looked to have been doing so for some years he had a long face but it was not gaunt rebus would have called the face kindly good morning mr macmillan my names inspector rebus this news seemed to excite macmillan he took half a step forward against the wall said the nurse macmillan paused then retreated are you an inspector of hospitals he asked no sir im a police inspector oh his face dulled a little i thought maybe youd come to they dont treat us well here you know he paused there because ive told you that ill probably be disciplined maybe even put into solitary everything any dissension gets reported back but ive got to keep telling people or nothing will be done i have some influential friends inspector rebus thought this was for the nurses ears more than his own friends in high places well dr forster knew that now thanks to rebus friends i can trust people need to be told you see they censor our mail they decide what we can read they wont even let me read das kapital and they give us drugs the mentally ill you know by whom i mean those who have been judged to be mentally ill we have less rights than the most hardened mass murderer hardened but sane mass murderer is that fair is that humane rebus had no ready answer besides he didnt want to be sidetracked you had a visit from elizabeth jack macmillan seemed to think back then nodded so i did but when she visits me shes ferrie not jack its our secret what did you talk about why are you interested rebus decided that macmillan did not know of liz jacks murder how could he know there was no access to news in this place rebuss fingers toyed with the chessmen its to do with an investigation to do with mr jack what has he done rebus shrugged thats what im trying to find out mr macmillan macmillan had turned his face towards the ray of sunshine i miss the world he said his voice dropping to a murmur i had so many friends do you keep in touch with them oh yes macmillan said they come and take me home with them for the weekend we enjoy evenings out at the cinema the theatre drinking in bars oh we have some wonderful times together he smiled ruefully and tapped his head but only in here hands against the wall why he spat why do i have to keep my hands against the wall why cant i just sit down and have a normal conversation like a normal person the angrier he got the lower his voice dropped there were flecks of saliva either side of his mouth and a vein bulged above his right eye he took a deep breath then another then bowed his head slightly im sorry inspector they give me drugs you know god knows what they are they have this effect on me thats all right mr macmillan rebus said but inside he was quivering was this madness or sanity what happened to sanity when you chained it to a wall chained it moreover with chains that werent real you were asking macmillan went on breathless now you were asking about eliza ferrie youre right she did come and visit quite a surprise i know they have a home near here yet theyve never visited before lizzie eliza did visit once a long time ago but gregor well hes a busy man isnt he and shes a busy woman i hear about these things from cath kinnoul rebus didnt doubt yes she visited a very pleasant hour we spent we talked about the past about friends friendship is their marriage in trouble why do you say that another creased smile she came alone inspector she told me she was on holiday alone yet a man was waiting for her outside either it was gregor and he didnt want to see me or else it was one of her friends how do you know nursie here told me if you dont want to sleep tonight inspector get him to show you the punishment block i bet doc forster didnt mention the punishment block maybe thats where theyll throw me for talking like this shut it macmillan rebus turned to the nurse is it true he asked was someone waiting outside for mrs jack yeah there was somebody in the car some guy i only saw him from one of the windows hed got out of the car to stretch his legs what did he look like but the nurse was shaking his head he was getting back in when i saw him i just saw his back what kind of car was it black series no mistake about that oh hes very good at noticing things inspector except when it suits him shut it macmillan ask yourself this inspector if this is a hospital why are all the socalled nurses members of the prison officers association this isnt a hospital its a warehouse but full of headcases rather than packing cases the twist is the headcases are the ones in charge he was moving away from the wall now walking on slow doped legs but his energy was unmistakable every nerve was blazing against the wall headcases i took her head off god knows i did macmillan the nurse was moving too but it was so long ago a different warning you and i want so much so much to right thats it the nurse had him by the arms touch the earth in the end macmillan offered little resistance as the straps were attached to his arms and legs the guard laid him out on the floor if i leave him on the bed he told rebus he just rolls off and injures himself and you wouldnt want that said macmillan sounding almost peaceful now that hed been restrained no nurse you wouldnt want that rebus opened the door making to leave inspector he turned yes mr macmillan macmillan had twisted his head so it was facing the door touch the earth for me please rebus left the hospital on shakier legs than hed entered it he didnt want the tour of the pool and the gym instead hed asked the nurse to show him the punishment block but the nurse had refused look hed said you might not like what goes on here i might not like some of what goes on but youve seen how it is theyre supposed to be patients but you cant turn your back on them you cant leave them alone theyll swallow lightbulbs theyll be shitting pens and pencils and crayons theyll try to put their head through the television i mean they might not but you just cant ever be sure ever try to keep an open mind inspector i know its not easy but try and rebus had wished the young man luck with his weight training before making his exit into the courtyard he stooped by a flowerbed and plunged his fingers deep into it rubbing the soil between forefinger and thumb it felt good it felt good to be outside funny the things he took for granted like earth and fresh air and free movement he looked up at the hospital windows but couldnt be sure which if any belonged to macmillans ward there were no faces staring at him no signs of life at all he rose to his feet went to his car and got in staring out through the windscreen the brief sunshine had vanished there was drizzle again obscuring the view rebus pressed the button and the windscreen wipers came on came on and stayed on their blades moving smoothly he smiled hands resting on the steering wheel and asked himself a question what happens to sanity when you chain it to a wall he took a detour on his way back south coming off the dual carriageway at kinross he passed loch leven scene of many a family picnic when rebus had been a kid took a right at the next junction and headed towards the tired mining villages of fife he knew this territory well hed been born and brought up here he knew the grey housing schemes and the corner shops and the utilitarian pubs the people cautious with strangers and almost as cautious with friends and neighbours streetcorner dialogues like bareknuckle fights his parents had taken his brother and him away from it at weekends travelling to kirkcaldy for shopping on the saturday and loch leven for those long sunday picnics sitting cramped in the back of the car with salmonpaste sandwiches and orange juice flasks of tea smelling of hot plastic and for summer holidays there had been a caravan in st andrews or bed and breakfast in blackpool where michael would always get into trouble and have to be hauled out by his older brother and a lot of bloody thanks i got for it rebus kept driving byars haulage was sited halfway up a steep hill in one of the villages across the road was a school the kids were on their way home swinging satchels at each other and swearing choicely some things never changed the yard of byars haulage contained a neat row of artics a couple of nondescript cars and a porsche carrera none of the cars was blue the offices were actually portakabins he went to the one marked main office below which someone had crayoned the boss and knocked inside a secretary looked up from her wordprocessor the room was stifling a calorgas heater roaring away by the side of the desk there was another door behind the secretary rebus could hear byars talking fast and loud and uproariously behind the door since no one answered him back rebus reckoned it was a phone call well tell shiteforbrains to get off his arse and get over here pause sick sick sick means hes shagging that missus of his cant blame him mind yes the secretary said to rebus can i help you well never mind what he says came byars voice ive got a load here thats got to be in liverpool yesterday id like to see mr byars please said rebus if youll take a seat ill see whether mr byars is available whats the name please rebus detective inspector rebus at that moment the door of byars office opened and byars himself came out he was holding a portable phone in one hand and a sheet of paper in the other he handed the paper to his secretary thats right wee man and theres a load coming up from london the day after byars voice was louder than ever rebus noticed that unseen by her byars was staring at his secretarys legs he wondered if this whole performance was for her benefit but now byars had spotted rebus it took byars a second to place him then he nodded a greeting in rebuss direction aye you give him big licks wee man he said into the telephone if hes got a sicknote fine if not tell him im looking out his cards okay he terminated the call and shot out a hand inspector rebus what the hell brings you to this blighted neck of the bings well said rebus i was passing and passing my arse plenty of people pass through but nobody stops unless they want something even then id advise them to keep on going but you come from round here dont you into the office then i can spare you five minutes he turned to the secretary and rested a hand on her shoulder sheena hen get on to tadgerbreath in liverpool and tell him tomorrow morning definite will do mr byars will i make a cup of coffee no dont bother sheena i know what the polis like to drink he gave rebus a wink in you go inspector in you go byars office was like the back room of a dirty bookshop its walls apparently held together by nude calendars and centrefolds the calendars all seemed to be gifts donated by garages and suppliers byars saw rebus looking goes with the image he said a hairyarsed truck driver with tattoos on his neck comes in here he thinks he knows the sort of man hes dealing with and what if a woman comes in byars clucked shed think she knew too im not saying shed be all wrong either byars didnt keep his whisky in the filing cabinet he kept it inside a wellington boot from the other boot he produced two glasses which he sniffed fresh as the morning dew he said pouring the drinks thanks said rebus nice car eh oh outside you mean aye its no bad nary a dent in it either you should see the insurance payments though talk about steep they make this brae look like a billiard table good health he sank the measure in one gulp then noisily exhaled rebus having taken a sip examined the glass then the bottle byars chuckled think id give glenlivet to the baheids i get in here im a businessman not the samaritans they look at the bottle think they know what theyre getting and theyre impressed image again like the scuddy pics on the wall but its really just cheap stuff i pour into the bottle not many folk notice rebus thought this was meant as a compliment image thats what byars was all surface and appearance was he so different from mps and actors or policemen come to that all of them hiding their ulterior motives behind a set of gimmicks so what is it you want to see me about that was easily explained he wanted to ask byars a little more about the party at deer lodge seemingly the last party to be held there not many of us there byars told him a few cried off pretty late i dont think tom pond was there though he was expected thats right he was off to the states by then suey was there ronald steele thats the man and liz and gregor of course and me cathy kinnoul was there but her husband wasnt lets see who else oh a couple who worked for gregor urquhart ian urquhart yes and some young girl helen greig byars laughed why bother to ask if you already know i think that was about it you said a couple who worked for gregor did you get the impression that they were a couple christ no i think everybody but urquhart tried to get the girl into the sack did anyone succeed not that i noticed but after a couple of bottles of champagne i tend not to notice very much it wasnt like one of lizs parties you know not wild i mean everybody had plenty to drink but that was all all well you know lizs crowd was wild byars stared towards one of the calendars seemingly reminiscing a real wild bunch and no mistake rebus could imagine barney byars lapping it up mixing with pattersonscott kilpatrick and the rest and he could imagine them tolerating byars a bit of nouveau rough no doubt byars was the life and soul of the party a laugh a minute only they were laughing at him rather than with him how was the lodge when you arrived rebus asked byars wrinkled his nose disgusting it hadnt been cleaned since the last party a fortnight before one of lizs parties not one of gregors gregor was going spare liz or somebody was supposed to have had it cleaned it looked like a bloody sixties squat or something he smiled actually i probably shouldnt be telling you this you being a member of the constabulary and all but i didnt bother staying the night drove back about four in the morning absolutely guttered but there was nobody about on the roads for me to be a menace to wait till you hear this though i thought my feet were cold when i stopped the car got out to open the garage and i didnt have any shoes on just the one sock and no fucking shoes christ knows how come i didnt notice spite and malice did john rebus receive a heros welcome he did not there were some who felt hed merely added to the chaos of the case perhaps he had chief superintendent watson for example still felt william glass was the man they were looking for he sat and listened to rebuss report while chief inspector lauderdale rocked to and fro on another chair sometimes staring ruminatively at the ceiling sometimes studying the one immaculate crease down either trouserleg it was friday morning there was coffee in the air there was coffee too coursing through rebuss nervous system as he spoke watson interrupted from time to time asking questions in a voice as thin as an afterdinner mint and at the end of it all he asked the obvious question what do you make of it john and rebus gave the obvious if only mostly truthful answer i dont know sir lets get this straight said lauderdale raising his eyes from a trousercrease shes at a telephone box she meets a man in a car theyre arguing the man drives off she hangs around for some time another car maybe the same car arrives another argument the car goes off leaving her car still in the layby and next thing we know of her shes turning up dumped in a river next to the house owned by a friend of her husbands lauderdale paused as though inviting rebus to contradict him we still dont know when or where she died only that she managed to end up in queensferry now you say this actors wife is an old friend of gregor jacks yes any hint that they were a bit more than friends rebus shrugged not that i know of what about the actor rab kinnoul maybe he and mrs jack maybe convenient isnt it said the chief superintendent rising to pour himself another cup of black death i mean if mr kinnoul did ever want to dispose of a body what better place than his own fastflowing river discharging into the sea body turning up weeks later or perhaps never at all and hes always played killers on the tv and in films maybe its all gone to his head except said lauderdale that kinnoul was in a series of meetings all day that wednesday and wednesday night at home with his wife watson nodded we come back to mrs kinnoul again could she be lying shes certainly under his thumb said rebus and shes on all sorts of antidepressants id be surprised if she could tell wednesday night at home in queensferry from the twelfth of july in londonderry watson smiled nicely put john but lets try to stick to facts what precious few there are said lauderdale i mean we all know who the obvious candidate is mrs jacks husband she finds out hes been caught trousersdown in a brothel they have a row he may not mean to kill her but he strikes her next thing shes dead he was caught trousersup rebus reminded his superior besides added watson mr jack too has his alibis he read from a sheet of paper constituency meeting in the morning round of golf in the afternoon corroborated by his playing partner and checked by detective constable broome then a dinner appointment where he made a speech to eighty or so fine upstanding members of the business community in central edinburgh and he drives a white saab rebus stated we need to check car colours for everyone involved in the case all mrs jacks friends and all mr jacks ive already put ds holmes on to it said lauderdale and forensics say theyll have a report on the bmw ready by morning ive another question though he turned to rebus mrs jack was apparently up north for anything up to a week did she stay all that time at deer lodge rebus had to give lauderdale credit the bugger had his thinking cap on today watson was nodding as though hed been about to ask the selfsame thing but of course he hadnt rebus had thought about it though i dont think so he said i do think she spent some time there otherwise where did the sunday papers and the green suitcase come from but a whole week i doubt it no signs of recent cooking all the food and cartons and stuff i found were either from one party or another there had been an attempt to clear a space on the living room floor so one person or maybe two could sit and have a drink but maybe that goes back to the last party too i suppose we could ask the guests while were fingerprinting them fingerprinting them asked watson lauderdale sounded like an exasperated parent purposes of elimination sir to see if any prints are left that cant be identified what would that tell us watson said the point is sir commented lauderdale if mrs jack didnt stay at deer lodge then who was she with and where did she stay was she even up north all that time ah said watson nodding again as though understanding everything she visited andrew macmillan on the saturday added rebus yes said lauderdale getting into his stride but then shes next seen on the wednesday by that yob at the farm what about the days in between she was at deer lodge on the sunday with her newspapers rebus said then he realized the point lauderdale was making when she saw the story he continued you think she may have headed south again lauderdale spread out his hands examining the nails its a theory he said merely well weve plenty bloody theories said watson slapping one of his own much meatier hands down on the desk we need something concrete and lets not forget friend glass we still want to talk to him about dean bridge if nothing else meanwhile he seemed to be trying to think of some path they might take of some instructions or inspiration he might give but he gave up and swigged back his coffee instead meanwhile he said at last while rebus and lauderdale waited for the imparted wisdom lets be careful out there the old mans really showing his age now thought rebus as he waited to follow lauderdale out of the office hill street blues was a long long time ago in the corridor after the door was closed behind them lauderdale grasped rebuss arm his voice was an excited hiss looks like the chief supers on the way out doesnt it cant be long before the high heidyins see whats going on and pension him off he was trying to control his glee yes rebus was thinking one or two very public foulups thats all it would take and he wondered he wondered if lauderdale was capable of engineering a ballsup with this in mind someone had tipped off the papers about operation creeper christ it seemed such a long time ago but wasnt chris kemp supposed to be doing some digging into that hed have to remember to ask kemp what hed found so much still needed to be done he was shrugging his arm free of lauderdale when watsons door opened again and watson stood there staring at the two of them rebus wondered if they looked as guilty and conspiratorial as he himself felt then watsons eyes settled on him john he said telephone call its mr jack he says hed be grateful if youd go and see him apparently theres something hed like to talk to you about rebus pressed the bell at the locked gate the voice over the intercom was urquharts yes inspector rebus to see mr jack yes inspector be right with you rebus peered through the bars the white saab was parked outside the house he shook his head slowly some people never learned a reporter had been sent from one of the line of cars to ask who rebus was the other reporters and photographers took shelter in the cars themselves listening to the radio reading newspapers soup or coffee was poured from flasks they were here for the duration and they were bored as he waited the wind sliced against rebus squeezing through a gap between jacket and shirt collar trickling down his neck like ice water he watched urquhart emerge from the house apparently trying to sort out the tangle of keys in his hand the reconnaissance reporter still stood beside rebus twitching readying himself to ask urquhart his questions i shouldnt bother son advised rebus urquhart was at the gate now mr urquhart blurted the reporter anything to add to your previous statement no said urquhart coolly opening the gate but ill repeat it for you if you like bugger off and with that rebus safely through the gate he slammed it shut and locked it giving the bars an extra shake to make sure they were secure the reporter smiling sourly was heading back to one of the cars youre under siege rebus observed urquhart looked like hed done without sleep for a night or two too many its diabolical he confided as they walked towards the house day and night theyre out there god knows what they think theyre going to get a confession rebus hazarded he was rewarded with a weak smile that inspector theyll never get the smile left his face but i am worried about gregor what all this is doing to him hes well youll see for yourself any idea what this meetings all about he wouldnt say inspector urquhart had stopped hes very fragile i mean he might say anything i just hope you can tell truth from fantasy then he started to walk again are you still diluting his whiskyrebus asked urquhart gave him an appraising look then nodded thats not the answer inspector thats not what he needs he needs friends andrew macmillan too had gone on about friends rebus wanted to talk to jack about andrew macmillan but he wasnt in a hurry he had paused beside the saab causing urquhart to pause too what is it you know said rebus ive always liked saabs but ive never had the money around to buy one do you think mr jack would mind if i just sat in the drivers seat for a minute urquhart looked at a loss for an answer he ended up making a gesture somewhere between a shrug and a shake of the head rebus tried the drivers door it was unlocked he slid into the seat and rested his hands on the steering wheel leaving the door itself open so urquhart could stand there and watch very comfortable rebus said so i believe youve never driven it yourself then no oh rebus stared out of the windscreen then at the passenger seat and the floor yes well designed comfortable plenty of room eh and he turned in his seat twisting his whole body round to examine the rear seat the rear floor heaps of room he commented lovely maybe gregor would let you take her for a spin rebus looked up keenly do you think so i mean when this has all blown over of course he started to get out of the car urquhart snorted blown over this sort of thing doesnt blow over not when youre an mp the broth those allegations in the newspapers they were bad enough but now murder no he shook his head this wont just blow over inspector its not a raincloud its a mud bath and mud sticks rebus closed the door nice solid clunk top when you shut it isnt there how well did you know mrs jack pretty well i used to see her most days but i believe mr and mrs jack led fairly separate lives i wouldnt go that far they were married and in love urquhart thought for a moment id say so yes despite everything rebus was walking around the car now as though deciding whether or not to buy it im not sure i understand oh you know different sorts of friends different lifestyles separate holidays gregor is an mp inspector he cant always get away at the drop of a hat whereas rebus said mrs jack was what would you say spontaneous flighty maybe even the sort whod say lets just up and go actually yes thats fairly accurate rebus nodded and tapped the boot what about luggage room urquhart himself actually came forward and opened the boot goodness said rebus yes theres plenty of room quite deep isnt it it was also immaculately clean no mud or scuff marks no crumbs of earth it looked as though it had never been used inside were a small reserve petrol tank a red warning triangle and a halfset of golf clubs hes keen on golf isnt he oh yes rebus closed the boot shut ive never seen the attraction myself the balls too small and the pitch is too big shall we go in gregor jack looked like hed been to hell and back on an lrt bus hed probably combed his hair yesterday or the day before and last changed his clothes then too he was shaven but there were small patches of dark stubble the razor had missed he didnt bother rising when rebus entered the room he just nodded a greeting and gestured with his glass to a vacant chair one of the infamous marshmallow chairs rebus approached with care there was whisky in jacks crystal tumbler and a bottle of the stuff three quarters empty on the rug beside him the room smelt unaired and unpolished jack took a gulp of liquid then used the edge of the glass to scratch at his raw red finger i want to talk to you inspector rebus rebus sat down sinking sinking yes sir i want to say a few things about me and maybe about liz too in a roundabout way it was another prepared speech another wellconsidered opening there were just the two of them in the room urquhart had said hed make a pot of coffee rebus still jumpy from his meeting with watson had begged for tea helen greig it seemed was at home her mother having been taken ill again as urquhart put it before marching off kitchenwards faithful women helen greig and cath kinnoul doggedly faithful and elizabeth jack doggiestyle faithful maybe christ that was a terrible thing to think and especially of the dead especially of a woman hed never met a woman who liked to be tied to bedposts for a spot of its nothing to do with well i dont know maybe it is jack paused for thought you see inspector i cant help feeling that if liz saw those stories about me and if they upset her then maybe she did something or stayed away and maybe he leapt to his feet and wandered over towards the window looking out at nothing what im trying to say is what if im responsible responsible sir for lizs murder if wed been together if wed been here together it might never have happened it wouldnt have happened do you see what i mean no good blaming yourself sir jack whirled towards him but thats just it i do blame myself why dont you sit down mr jack gregor please all right gregor now why dont you sit down and calm down jack did as he was told bereavement affected different people in different ways the weak becoming strong and the strong becoming weak ronald steele hurled books around gregor jack became pathetic he was scratching at the finger again but its all so ironic he spat hows that rebus wished the tea would hurry up maybe jack would pull himself together in urquharts presence that brothel jack said fixing rebuss eyes with his own thats what started it all and the reason i was there rebus sat forward why were you there gregor gregor jack paused swallowed seemed to take a breath while he thought about whether to answer or not then he answered to see my sister there was silence in the room so profound that rebus could hear his watch ticking then the door flew open tea said ian urquhart sidling into the room rebus who had been so eager for urquharts arrival now couldnt wait for the man to leave he rose from the chair and walked to the mantelpiece the card from the pack was still there but it had been joined by over a dozen condolence cards some from other mps some from family and friends some from the public urquhart seemed to sense the atmosphere in the room he left the tray on a table and without a word made his exit the door had barely closed before rebus said what do you mean your sister i mean just that my sister was working in that brothel well i suspected she was id been told she was i thought maybe it was a joke a sick joke maybe a trap to get me to a brothel a trap and a trick i thought long and hard before i went but i still went hed sounded so confident who had the caller id been getting these calls ah yes rebus had meant to ask about those by the time i got to the phone the caller would have hung up but one night the caller got me straight away and he told me your sisters working in a brothel in the new town he gave me the address and said if i went around midnight shed just be starting her shift the words were like some food he didnt enjoy but given him at a banquet so that he didnt dare spit it out but had to go on chewing trying hard not to swallow he swallowed so along i went and she was there the caller had been telling the truth i was trying to talk to her when the police came in but it was a trap too the newsmen were there rebus was remembering the woman in the bed the way she kicked her legs in the air the way shed lifted her tshirt for the photographers to see why didnt you say anything at the time gregor jack laughed shrilly it was bad enough as it was would it have been any better if id let everyone know my sisters a tart well then why tell me now his voice was calm it looks to me inspector like im in deep water im just jettisoning what i dont need you must know then sir you must have known all along that someone is setting you up to take a very big fall jack smiled oh yes any idea who i mean any enemies the smile again im an mp inspector the wonder is that i have any friends ah yes the pack could one of them inspector ive racked my brain and im no nearer finding out he looked up at rebus honest you didnt recognize the callers voice it was heavily muffled gruff a man probably but to be honest it could have been a woman okay then what about your sister tell me about her it was soon told shed left home young and never been heard of vague rumours of london and marriage had drifted north over the years but that was all then the phone call how could the caller know how might they have found out now thats a mystery because ive never told anybody about gail but your schoolfriends would know of her slightly i suppose i doubt any of them remember her she was two years below us at school you think maybe she came back up here looking for revenge jack spread his palms revenge for what well jealousy then why didnt she just get in touch it was a point rebus made a mental note to get in touch with her supposing she was still around you havent heard from her since not before not since why did you want to see her gregor one i really was interested he broke off and two two i dont know maybe to talk her out of what she was doing for her own good or for yours jack smiled youre right of course bad for the image having a sister on the game there are worse forms of prostitution than whoring jack nodded impressed very deep inspector can i use that in one of my speeches not that ill be making many of those from now on whichever way you look at it my careers down the swanny never give up sir think of robert the bruce and the spider you mean i hate spiders so does liz he halted did liz rebus wanted to keep the conversation moving the amount of whisky jack had drunk he might tip over any minute can i ask you about that last party up at deer lodge what about it for a start who was present having to use his memory seemed to sober jack up not that he could add much to what barney byars had already told rebus it was a boozy sitaroundandchat evening followed by a morning hike up some nearby mountain lunch at the heather hoose and then home jacks only regret was inviting helen greig to go im not sure she saw any of us in a decent light barney byars was doing elephant impressions you know where you pull out your trouser pockets and yes i know well helen took it in good enough part but all the same nice girl isnt she the sort my mum would have wanted me to marry mine too thought rebus the whisky wasnt just loosening jacks tongue it was also loosening his accent the polish was fading fast leaving the raw wood of towns like kirkcaldy leven methil this party was a couple of weeks ago wasnt it three weeks ago we were back here five days when liz decided she needed a holiday packed a case and off she went never saw her again he raised a fist and punched the soft leather of the sofa making hardly a sound and no discernible mark why are they doing this to me im the best mp this constituencys ever had dont take my word for it go out and talk to them go to a mining village or a farm or a factory or a fucking afternoon tea party they tell me the same thing well done gregor keep up the good work he was on his feet again now feet holding their ground but the rest of the body in motion keep up the good work the hard work hard work it bloody is hard work i can tell you his voice was rising steadily worked my balls off for them now somebodys trying to piss on my whole life from a very high place why me why me liz and me liz urquhart tapped twice before putting his head round the door everything all right jack put on a grotesque mask of a smile everythings fine ian listening behind the door are you good wouldnt want you to miss a word would we urquhart glanced at rebus rebus nodded everythings okay in here really it is urquhart retreated and closed the door gregor jack collapsed into the sofa im making such a mess of everything he said rubbing his face with his hand ians such a good friend ah yes friends i believe said rebus that you havent just been receiving anonymous calls what someone said something about letters too oh oh yes letters crank letters do you still have them jack shook his head not worth keeping did you let anyone see them not worth reading what exactly was in them mr jack gregor jack reminded him please call me gregor what was in them rubbish garbled nonsense ravings i dont think so what someone told me youd refuse to let anyone open them he thought they might be love letters jack hooted love letters i dont think they were either but it strikes me how could ian urquhart or anyone else know which letters they were to hand to you unopened the handwriting difficult to tell though isnt it no it had to be the postmark it had to be what was on the envelope ill tell you where those letters came from mr jack they came from duthil they came from your old friend andrew macmillan and they werent raving were they they werent garbled or nonsense or rubbish they were asking you to do something about the system in the special hospitals isnt that right jack sat and studied his glass mouth set petulantly a kid whos been caught out isnt that right jack gave a curt nod rebus nodded too embarrassing to have a sister whos a prostitute but how much more embarrassing to have an old friend whos a murderer and mad to boot gregor jack had worked hard to form his public image and harder still to preserve it rushing around with his vacuously sincere grin and strongenoughfortheoccasion handshake working hard in his constituency working hard in public but his private life well rebus wouldnt have wanted to swap it was a mess and what made it so messy was that jack had tried to hide it he didnt have skeletons in his closet he had a crematorium wanted me to start a campaign jack was muttering couldnt do that why did you start this crusade mr jack to help an old friend which old friend is that mr jack the one who cut his wifes head off now if youll excuse me oh and please remember to vote for me next time round and he began a drunken wailing laugh nearmanic nearcrying finally actually becoming crying tears streaming down his cheeks dripping into the glass he still held gregor rebus said quietly he repeated the name and again and again always quietly jack sniffed back more tears and looked blurrily towards him gregor said rebus did you kill your wife jack wiped his eyes on his shirtsleeve sniffed wiped again he began to shake his head no he said no i didnt kill my wife no because william glass killed her he killed the woman under dean bridge and he killed elizabeth jack rebus had missed all the excitement he had driven back into town unaware of it he had climbed the steps up to great london road station without knowing and he had entered a place of jumpy jittery clamour christ what did it mean was the station definitely staying open no move to st leonard s which meant if he remembered his bet that hed set up home with patience aitken but no it was nothing to do with the station staying open or being reduced to rubble it was william glass a beat constable had come across him sleeping amidst the dustbins behind a supermarket in barnton he was in custody he was talking they were feeding him soup and giving him endless cups of tea and fresh cigarettes and he was talking but whats he saying hes saying he did them both of them hes saying what rebus started calculating barnton not so far from queensferry when you thought about it they were thinking hed have headed north or west but in fact hed started crawling back into town supposing hed ever got as far as queensferry in the first place hes admitting both murders whos with him chief inspector lauderdale and inspector dick lauderdale christ hed be loving it this would be the making of him the final nail in the chief supers coffeemaker but rebus had other things to be doing he wanted jacks sister found for a start gail jack but she wouldnt be calling herself that would she he went through the operation creeper casenotes gail crawley that was her shed been released of course and had given a london address he found one of the officers whod interviewed her yes she said she was heading south couldnt keep her could we didnt want to either just gave her a kick up the arse and told her not to come back up here again isnt it incredible catching glass like that incredible yes said rebus he photocopied what notes there were along with gail crawleys photograph and scribbled some further notes of his own on to the copy then he telephoned an old friend an old friend in london inspector flight speaking hello george whens the retirement party then there was laughter you tell me you were the one who persuaded me to stay on cant afford to lose you meaning you want a favour official business george but speed is of the as usual all right what is it give me your fax number and ill send you the details if shes at the address id like you to talk to her ive put down a couple of phone numbers you can reach me anytime on one or the other two numbers eh got yourself in deep have you in deep jettisoning what i dont need you could say that george whats she like by which he meant patience not gail she likes domesticity george pets and nights in candles and firelight sounds perfect george flight paused ill give it three months max sod you said rebus grinning flight was laughing again four months then he said but thats my final offer that done rebus headed for the nerve centre the one place he needed to station himself the gents toilets part of the ceiling had fallen down and had been replaced with a piece of brown cardboard on which some joker had drawn a huge eyeball rebus washed his hands dried them chatted to one of the other detectives shared a cigarette in a public toilet hed have been picked up for loitering he was loitering too loitering with intent the door opened bingo it was lauderdale a frequent user of rest rooms when he was on an interrogation all the time youre coming and going hed told rebus the suspects sweating that bit more wondering whats up whats happened thats new whats up rebus asked now lauderdale smiled and went to splash water on his face patting his temples and the back of his neck he looked pleased with himself more worrying he didnt smell looks like our chief super may have got it right for once lauderdale admitted he said we should be concentrating on glass hes confessed as good as looks as though hes sorting his defence out first whats that then the media said lauderdale drying himself the media pushed him into doing it i mean killing again he says it was expected of him sounds to me like hes one domino shy of a set im not putting any words into his mouth if thats what youre thinking its all on tape rebus shook his head no no i mean if he says he did it then fair enough thats fine and by the way it was me that shot jfk lauderdale was examining himself in the spattered mirror he still looked triumphal his neck rising from his shirt collar so that his head sat on it like a golf ball on its tee a confession john he was saying its a powerful thing is a confession even when the guys been sleeping rough for nights on end strung out on brasso and hunted by edinburghs finest confession might be good for the soul sir but sometimes all its worth is a bowl of soup and some hot tea lauderdale tidied himself then turned towards rebus youre just a pessimist john think of all the questions glass cant answer ask him some of them how did mrs jack get to queensferry how come he dumped her there just ask him sir ill be interested to read the transcript i think youll find the conversations all one way exit the inspector rebus leaving behind the chief inspector lauderdale brushing himself down like a statue examining itself for chips he seems to find one too for he frowns suddenly and spends longer in the washroom than intended i need just a little bit more john they were lying in bed together just the three of them rebus patience and lucky the cat rebus affected an american accent i gave ya everything i got baby patience smiled but wasnt to be placated she thumped her pillows and sat up drawing her knees up to her chin i mean she said i need to know what youre going to do what were going to do i cant decide whether youre moving in with me or else moving out in and out he said a final attempt at humour and escape she punched him on the shoulder punched him hard he sucked in his breath i bruise easily he said so do i there were almost tears in her eyes but she wasnt going to give him the satisfaction is there anybody else he looked surprised no what makes you think that the cat had crawled up the bed to lie in patiences lap plucking at the duvet with its claws as it settled she started stroking its head its just that i keep thinking theres something youre about to tell me you look as though youre gathering up the strength to say it but then you never quite manage id rather know whatever it is what was there to know that he still hadnt made up his mind about moving in that he still carried if not a flame then at least an unstruck scottish bluebell for gill templer what was there to know you know how it is patience a policemans lot is not a happy one and all that why do you have to get involved what in all these bloody cases why do you have to get involved john its just a job like any other i manage to forget about my patients for a few hours at a stretch why cant you he gave her just about his only honest answer of the evening i dont know the telephone rang patience picked the extension up off the floor and held it between them yours or mine she asked yours she picked up the receiver hello yes this is doctor aitken yes hello mrs laird is he now is that right it isnt maybe just flu rebus checked his watch nine thirty it was patiences turn to do standby emergency for her group practice aha she was saying aha as the caller talked on she held the receiver away from her for a second and hurled a silent scream towards the ceiling okay mrs laird no just leave him be ill be there as soon as i can what was your address again at the end of the call she stomped out of bed and started to dress mrs lairds husband says hes on the way out this time she said thats the third time in as many months damn the man do you want me to drive you no its all right ill go myself she paused came over and pecked him on the cheek but thanks for the offer youre welcome lucky disturbed from his rest was now kneading rebuss half of the duvet rebus made to stroke its head but the cat shied away see you later then said patience giving him another kiss well have a talk eh if you like i like and with that she was gone he could hear her in the living room getting together her stuff then the front door opening and closing the cat had left rebus and was investigating the warm section of mattress from which patience had lately risen rebus thought about getting up then thought about not the phone rang again another patient well he wouldnt answer it kept on ringing he answered with a noncommittal hello took your time said george flight havent interrupted anything have i what have you got george well ive got the trots since you ask i blame it on that curry i had at gungas last night ive also got the information you requested inspector is that so inspector well would you mind passing it the hell on flight snorted thats all the thanks i get after a hard days graft we all know the kind of graft the mets interested in george flight tuttutted wires have ears john anyway the address was a noshow yes a friend of miss crawleys lives there but she hasnt seen her for weeks last she heard crawley was in edinburgh he pronounced it headinburrow is that it i tried asking a couple of sleazebags connected with croft whos croft flight sighed the woman who ran the brothel oh right only weve had dealings with her before you see maybe thats why she moved her operation north so i talked to a couple of her former associates and nothing not even a trade discount on french with spanking right well thanks anyway george sorry john when are we going to see you down here when are we going to see you up here no offence john but its all that square sausage and fizzy beer it doesnt agree with me ill let you get back to your smoked salmon and scotch then night george he put the phone down and considered for a moment then he got out of bed and started to dress the cat looked satisfied with this arrangement and stretched himself out rebus searched for paper and a pen and scribbled a note to patience lonely without you gone for a drive john he thought about adding a few kisses yes a few kisses were definitely in order xxx checking that he had car keys flat keys and money he let himself out locking the door behind him if you didnt know you wouldnt see it was a pleasant enough night for a drive as it happened the cloud cover kept the air mild but there was no sign of rain or wind it wasnt at all a bad night for a drive inverleith then granton an easy descent to the coast past what had been william glasss digs then granton road then newhaven the docks if you didnt know you wouldnt see he was a lonely man just out driving just out driving slowly they stepped out of shadowy doorways or else crossed and recrossed at the traffic lights like a sodiumlit fashion show crossed and recrossed while drivers slowly drove and slower yet and slower he saw nothing he wanted so he took the car the length of salamander street then turned it oh he was a keen one shy lonely quiet and keen driving his beatenup old car around the nighttime streets looking for well maybe just looking at unless he could be tempted he stopped the car she came walking smartly towards him not that her clothes were smart her clothes were cheap and cheerless a pale raincoat one size too big and beneath it a bright red blouse and a miniskirt the miniskirt rebus felt was her big mistake since her legs were bare and thinly unattractive she looked cold she looked as if she had a cold but she tried him with a smile get in he said handjobs fifteen blows twentyfive thirtyfive the other naive he could have arrested her on the spot you never never talked money till you were sure the punter was straight get in he repeated she had a lot to learn she got in rebus fished out his id detective inspector rebus id like a word gail you lot never give up do you there was still cockney in the accent but shed been back north long enough for her native fife to start reasserting itself a few more weeks and that final you would be a yiz youse lot nivir gie up dae yiz she was a slow learner how come you know my name she asked at last were you on that raid after a freebie are you is that it that wasnt it at all i want to talk about gregor the colour drained from her face leaving only eye makeup and slick red lipstick whos he when hes at home hes your brother we can talk down the station or we can talk at your flat either suits me she made a perfunctory attempt at getting out of the car it only needed a touch of his hand to restrain her the flat then she said levelly just dont be all night about it eh it was a small room in a flat full of bedsits rebus got the feeling she never brought men back here there was too much of her about the place it wasnt anonymous enough for a start there was a picture of a baby on the dressing table then there were newspaper cuttings pinned to the walls all of them detailing the fall of gregor jack he tried not to look at them and instead picked up the photograph put that down he did so who is it if you must know its me she was sitting on the bed her two arms stretched out behind her her mottled legs crossed the room was cold but there was no sign of any means of heating it clothes spilled from an open chest of drawers and the floor was littered with bits and pieces of makeup get on with it then she said there being nowhere to sit he stood keeping his hands in his jacket pockets you know that the only reason your brother was in that brothel was so he could talk to you yeah and that if youd told this to anyone why should i she spat why the fuck should i i dont owe him no favours why not why not because hes an oily gits why not always was hes got it made hasnt he mum and dad always liked him better than me her voice trailed off into silence is that why you left home none of your business why i left home ever see any old friends i dont have any old friends you came back north you must have known there was a chance youd bump into your brother she snorted we dont exactly move in the same circles no i thought prostitutes always reckoned mps and judges were their best clients theyre just johns to me thats all how long have you been on the game she folded her arms tight just sod off will you and there they were again the notquitetears twice tonight hed just failed to reduce a woman to tears he wanted to go home and have a bath but where was home just one more question gail ms crawley to you just one more question ms crawley yeah someone knew you were working in that brothel someone who then told your brother any idea who it might be there was a moments thought not a clue she was lying obviously rebus nodded towards the clippings still youre interested in him arent you you know he came to see you that night because he cares dont give me that crap rebus shrugged it was crap too but if he didnt get this woman on to gregor jacks side then he might never find out who was behind this whole ugly thing suit yourself gail listen if you want to talk im at great london road police station he fished out a card with his name and phone number on it thatll be the day well he headed for the door a matter of two and a half strides the more trouble that pisspots in the better ill like it but her words had lost their force it wasnt quite indecision but perhaps it was a start within range on monday morning first findings started filtering down from dufftown where the forensic tests of elizabeth jacks bmw were under way specks of blood found on the driversside carpet matched mrs jacks type and there were signs of what might have been a struggle marks on the dashboard scuffmarks on the interiors of both front doors and damage to the radiocassette as though it had been hit with the heel of a shoe rebus read the notes in chief inspector lauderdales office then handed them back across the desk what do you think lauderdale asked stifling a monday morning yawn you know what i think said rebus i think mrs jack was murdered in that layby inside her car or outside it maybe she tried to run away and was hit from behind or maybe her assailant knocked her unconscious first then hit her from behind to make it look like the work of the dean bridge murderer however it happened i dont think william glass did it lauderdale shrugged and rubbed his chin checking the closeness of the shave he still says he did you can read the transcripts any time you like he says he was lying low knowing we were after him he needed money for food he came upon mrs jack and hit her over the head what with a rock and what did he do with all her stuff threw it into the river come on sir she didnt have any money thats what made him so angry hes making it up sounds plausible to me no with respect sir what it sounds like is a quick solution one thatll please sir hugh ferric doesnt it matter to you that it isnt the truth now look here lauderdales face was reddening with anger look here inspector all ive had from you so far is well what is it its nothing really is it nothing solid or concrete nothing you could hang a shirt on never mind a case in a court of law nothing how did she get to queensferry who drove her there what sort of state was she in for christs sake i know its not cut and dried there are still gaps gaps you could fit hampden into them three times over lauderdale smiled there you go again john exaggerating why cant you just accept theres less to this than meets your eye look sir fine charge glass with the dean bridge murder thats okay by me but lets keep an open mind on mrs jack eh at least until forensics are finished with the car lauderdale thought about it just till they finish the car rebus pressed he wasnt about to give up monday mornings were hell for lauderdale and the man would agree to just about anything if it meant getting rebus out of his office all right john lauderdale said have it your way but dont get bogged down in it remember ill keep an open mind if you will okay okay lauderdale seemed to relax a little have you seen the chief superintendent this morning rebus had not im not even sure hes in yet maybe he had a heavy weekend eh none of our business really sir lauderdale stared at him of course none of our business but if the chief supers personal problems start interfering with his the phone rang lauderdale picked up the receiver yes he straightened suddenly in his chair yes sir was i sir he flipped open his desk diary oh yes ten he checked his watch well ill be there right away yes sir sorry about that he had the good grace to blush as he put down the receiver the chief super guessed rebus lauderdale nodded i was supposed to be in a meeting with him five minutes ago forgot all about the bloody thing lauderdale got to his feet plenty to keep you occupied john plenty i believe ds holmes has some cars for me to look at oh thinking of getting rid of that wreck of yours about time eh and this being his idea of wit lauderdale actually laughed brian holmes had cars for him cars aplenty well actually a detective constable seemed to have done the work holmes it appeared was already learning to delegate a list of the cars owned and run by friends of the jacks make registration and colour rebus glanced down it quickly oh great the only possessor of a colour blue was alice blake the packs sexton blake but she lived and worked in london there were whites reds blacks and a green yes ronald steele drove a green citroen bx rebus had seen it parked outside gregor jacks house the night holmes had gone through the bins green well yes green he remembered it more as a greenyblue a blueygreen keep an open mind okay it was green but it was easier to mistake green for blue than say red for blue or white or black wasnt it then there was the question of that particular wednesday everyone had been asked where were you that morning that afternoon some of the answers were vaguer than others in fact gregor jacks alibis were more watertight than most steele for example had been uncertain about the morning his assistant vanessa had been off work that day and steele himself couldnt recall whether or not hed gone into the shop there was nothing in his diary to help him remember either jamie kilpatrick had been sleeping off a hangover all day no visitors no phone calls while julian kaymer had been creating in his studio rab kinnoul too was hesitant he recalled meetings but not necessarily the people hed met he could check but it would take time time the one thing rebus didnt have he too needed all the friends he could get so far hed ruled out two suspects tom pond who was abroad and andrew macmillan who was in duthil pond was a nuisance he wasnt back from the states yet he had been questioned by telephone of course and he knew all about the tragedy but he had yet to be fingerprinted anyone who might have been at deer lodge had been or was being or would be fingerprinted just so they were reassured for processes of elimination just in case there were any fingerprints left in the lodge any that couldnt be accounted for it was painstaking work this collection and collation of tiny facts and tiny figures but it was how murder cases worked mind you they worked more easily when there was a distinct scene of crime a locus rebus wasnt in much doubt that elizabeth jack had been killed or as good as in the layby had alec corbie seen something something he was holding back was there something he might know without knowing he knew maybe something he didnt think was important what if liz jack had said something to andrew macmillan something he didnt realize might be a clue christ macmillan still didnt know she was dead how would he react were rebus to tell him maybe it would jog his memory then again maybe it would have an altogether different effect and besides could anything he said be trusted wasnt it possible that he held a grudge against gregor jack the way gail crawley did the way others might too who really was gregor jack was he merely a tarnished saint or was he a bastard hed ignored macmillans letters hed tried to keep his sister from disgracing him he was embarrassed by his wife were his friends really friends or were they truly a pack wolves ran in packs hounds ran in packs and so did newshounds rebus remembered that hed still to track down chris kemp maybe he was clutching at straws but it felt more as if they were clutching at him and speaking of clutch that was something else to be added to his cars list of woes there was a worrying whirring and grinding as he pushed the gearshift from neutral into first but the car wasnt behaving badly windscreen wipers aside theyd begun sticking again it had taken him north and back without so much as a splutter all of which worried rebus even more it was like a terminal patients final rally that last gleam of life before the support machines took over maybe next time hed take the bus after all chris kemps flat was only a quarter of an hour from great london road the harassedsounding woman on the news desk had given him the address as soon as he asked for it and he had asked for it only when told that kemp was on his day off shed given him the reporters home phone number first and recognizing the first three digits as designating a local code rebus had asked for the address you could just as easily have looked in the book shed said before ringing off thank you too he answered to the dead connection it was a secondfloor flat he pressed the intercom button beside the main door of the tenement and waited and waited should have phoned first john but then a crackle and after the crackle yeah the voice groggy rebus glanced at his watch quarter to two didnt wake you did i chris who is that john rebus get your breeks on and ill buy you a pie and a pint a groan what time is it nearly two christ never mind the alcohol i need coffee theres a shop at the corner fetch some milk will you ill put the kettle on back in two ticks the intercom crackled into silence rebus went and fetched the milk then buzzed the intercom again there was a louder buzz from behind the door and he pushed it open entering the dim stairwell by the time he reached the second floor he was peching and remembering exactly why he liked living in patiences basement the door to kemps flat was ajar another name had been fixed to the door with sellotape just below kemps own v christie the girlfriend rebus supposed a bicycle wheel missing its tyre rested against the hall wall so did books dozens of them rickety towering piles of them he tiptoed past milkman he called in here the living room was at the end of the hall it was large but contained almost no space kemp dressed in last weeks tshirt and the week befores denims ran his fingers through his hair morning inspector a timely alarm call im supposed to be meeting someone at three oclock hint taken i was just passing and kemp threw him a disbelieving glance then busied himself at the sink where he was trying his damnedest to get the stains off two mugrims the room served as living room and kitchen both there was a fine old cooking range in the fireplace but it had become a display case for pot plants and ornamental boxes the actual cooker was a greasylooking electrical device sited just next to the sink on a dining table sat a word processor boxes of paper files and next to the table stood a green metal filing cabinet four drawers high its bottom drawer open to show more files books magazines and newspapers were stacked on most of the available floor space but there was room for a sofa one armchair tv and video and a hifi cosy said rebus he actually thought he meant it but kemp looked around and made a face im supposed to be cleaning this place up today good luck coffee was spooned into the mugs the milk splashed in after it the kettle came to the boil and switched itself off and kemp poured sugar no thanks rebus had settled on the arm of the sofa as if to say dont worry im not about to linger he accepted the mug with a nod kemp threw himself on to the armchair and gulped at the coffee screwing up his face as it burned his mouth and throat christ he gasped heavy night heavy week rebus wandered over in the direction of the dining table its a terrible thing drink maybe it is but i was talking about work oh sorry he turned from the table and headed over to the sink the cooker stopping beside the fridge kemp had left the carton of milk sitting on top of the fridge next to the kettle id better put this away he said lifting the carton he opened the fridge oh look he said pointing there already is milk in the fridge looks fresh enough doesnt it i neednt have bothered going to the shop he put the new carton of milk in beside the other slammed shut the door and returned to the arm of the sofa kemp was attempting something like a grin youre sharp for a monday but i can be blunt when i need to what were you hiding from old uncle rebus chris or did you just need the time to check there was nothing to hide a bit of blaw that sort of thing or maybe something else eh some story youre working on working on late into the night something i should know about how about it come on inspector im the one whos doing you a favour remember youll have to refresh my memory you wanted me to see what i could find about the brothel story about how the sundays knew it was breaking but you never got back to me chris well ive been pressed for time you still are remember youve got that meeting at three better tell me what you know then i can be on my way now rebus slid off the arm and on to the sofa proper he could feel the springs probing at him through what was left of the patterned covering well said kemp sitting forward in his chair it looks like there was a kind of mass tipoff all the papers thought they were getting an exclusive then when they all turned up they knew theyd been had how do you mean well if there was a story they had to publish if they didnt and their rivals did editors would be asking questions about how come they got scooped exactly so whoever set the story up was guaranteed maximum exposure but who did set it up kemp shook his head nobody knows it was anonymous a telephone call on the thursday to all the news desks police are going to raid a brothel in edinburgh on friday night heres the address if youre there around midnight youre guaranteed to bag an mp the caller said that apparently his exact words were at least one mp will be inside but he didnt name any names he didnt have to royalty mps actors and singers give those papers a sniff of any category and youve got them hooked im probably mixing metaphors there but you get the gist oh yes chris i get the gist so what do you make of it looks like jack was set up to take a fall but note his name wasnt mentioned by the caller all the same yes all the same rebus was thinking furiously if he hadnt been slouching on the sofa he might have said he was thinking on his feet actually he was debating with himself about whether or not to do gregor jack a huge favour points against he didnt owe jack any favours besides he should try to remain objective wasnt that what lauderdale had been getting at points for one really he wouldnt just be doing jack a favour he might also flush out the rat whod set jack up he made his decision chris i want to tell you something kemp caught the whiff of a story attributable but rebus shook his head afraid not accurate then oh yes i can guarantee its accurate go on im listening last chance to bottle out no he wasnt going to bottle out i can tell you why gregor jack was at that brothel yes but i want to know something first are you holding something back kemp shrugged i dont think so rebus still didnt believe him but then kemp had no reason to tell rebus anything it wasnt as if rebus was going to tell him anything that he didnt want him to know they sat in silence for half a minute neither friends nor enemies more like trench soldiers on a christmas day kickabout at any moment the sirens might sound and shrapnel pierce the peace rebus recalled that he knew one thing kemp wanted to know how ronald steele got his nickname so kemp said why was he there because someone told him his sister was working there kemp pursed his lips working as a prostitute rebus explained someone phoned him anonymously and told him so he went along that was stupid agreed and was she there yes she calls herself gail crawley how do you spell that crawey and youre sure of this im sure ive spoken with her shes still in edinburgh still working kemp kept his voice level but his eyes were gleaming you know this is a story rebus shrugged saying nothing you want me to place it another shrug why rebus stared at the empty mug in his hands why because once it was public knowledge the caller would have failed at least in his or her own terms and having failed maybe theyd feel compelled to try something else if they did rebus would be ready kemp was nodding okay thanks ill think it over rebus nodded too he was already regretting the decision to tell kemp the man was a reporter and one with a reputation to make there was no way of knowing what hed do with the story it could be twisted to make jack sound like samaritan or slime meantime kemp was saying rising from his chair i better take a bath if im going to make that meeting right rebus rose too and placed his mug in the sink thanks for the coffee thanks for the milk the bathroom was on the way to the front door rebus made show of looking at his watch go get into your bath he said ill let myself out bye then see you chris he walked to the door checking that his weight on the floorboards did not make them creak then glanced round and saw that kemp had disappeared into the bathroom water started splashing gently rebus turned the snib and locked it at the off position then he opened the door and slammed it noisily behind him he stood in the stairwell pulling the door by its handle so that it couldnt swing back open there was a spyhole but he kept himself tucked in against the wall anyway if kemp came to the door hed notice the snib was off a minute passed nobody came to the door more fortuitously perhaps nobody came into the stairwell he didnt fancy explaining what he was doing standing there holding on to a door handle after two minutes he crouched down and opened the letter box peering in the bathroom door was slightly ajar the water was still running but he could hear kemp humming then ahaheehaing as he got into the bath the water continued to run giving the noisecover he needed he opened the door quietly slipped back indoors and closed it jamming it shut with a hardback book from the top of one of the stacks the remaining books looked as though they might topple but they steadied again rebus exhaled and crept along the corridor past the door taps pouring kemp still humming this part was easy getting back out would be the hard part if he had nothing to show for the deception he crossed the living room and studied the desk the files gave nothing away no sign of the big story kemp was working on the computer disks were marked numerically no clues there nothing interesting in the open drawer of the filing cabinet he turned back to the desk no scribbled sheets of notes had been tucked beneath other blank sheets he flipped through the pile of lps beside the stereo but no sheets had been hidden there either under the sofa no cupboards drawers no bugger it he went to the great iron range tucked away at the back behind three or four pot plants sat an uglylooking trophy kemps young journalist of the year prize along the front of the range sat the row of ornamental boxes he opened one it contained a cnd badge and a pair of anc earrings in another box was a free nelson mandela badge and a ring which looked to be carved out of ivory the girlfriends stuff obviously and in the third box a tiny cellophane package of dope he smiled hardly enough to run someone in for half a quarter at most was this what kemp had been so eager to conceal well rebus supposed a conviction wouldnt do the campaigning journalist tag much good difficult to chastise public figures for their small vices when youd been done for possession bugger it and on top of everything hed now to get out of the flat without being seen or heard the taps had stopped running no noise to cover his retreat he crouched by the range and considered the bold as brass approach might be best just go marching past saying something about having left behind your keys aye sure kemp would fall for that might as well put five bar on cowdenbeath for the league and cup double he found that as he thought he was staring at the ranges small oven or rather at the closed door of that oven a spiderplant sat above it with two of its fronds trapped in the door dear me he couldnt have that could he so he pulled open the door releasing the leaves sitting in the oven itself were some books old hardbacks he lifted one and examined its spine john knox on predestination well wasnt that a coincidence the bathroom door flew in christs sake chris kemp who had been lying with his head floating on the surface of the water now shot up rebus marched over to the toilet lowered its lid and made himself comfortable carry on chris dont mind me just thought i might borrow a few of your books he slapped the pile he was holding they were resting on his knees all seven of them i like a good read kemp actually blushed wheres your search warrant rebus looked stunned search warrant why should i need a search warrant im just borrowing a few books thats all thought i might show them to my old friend professor costello you know professor costello dont you only this stuffs right up his street no reason why you should mind me borrowing them is there if you like ill go get that search warrant and fuck off language son rebus reprimanded dont forget youre a journalist youre the protector of our language dont go cheapening it you just cheapen yourself i thought you wanted me to do you a favour what you mean the story about jack and his sister rebus shrugged i thought i was doing you a favour i know keen young reporters whod give their eye teeth for what do you want now rebus sat forward where did you get them chris the books kemp ran his hands down his sleek hair theyre my girlfriends as far as i know she borrowed them from her university library rebus nodded its a fair story i doubt it would get you off the hook but its a fair story for a start it wont explain why you hid them when you knew i was on my way up to see you hid them i dont know what youre talking about rebus chuckled fine chris fine there i was thinking i could do you a favour another favour i should say what favour rebus slapped the books again seeing these get back to their rightful owner without anyone needing to know where theyve been in the interim kemp considered this in exchange for what whatever it is youre keeping from me i know you know something or you think you do i just want to help you do your duty my duty helping the police it is your duty chris like its your duty to go creeping around peoples flats without their permission rebus didnt bother replying he didnt need to reply he just needed to bide his time now that he had the books he had the reporter in his pocket too safe and snug for future use kemp sighed the waters getting cold mind if i get out any time you like ill go wait next door kemp came into the living room wearing a blue towelling robe and using a matching towel to rub at his hair tell me about your girlfriend rebus said kemp filled the kettle again he had used the minutes solitary time to do a little thinking and he was ready now to talk vanessa he said shes a student a divinity student with access to professor costellos room everybodys got access to prof costellos room he told you that himself but not everyone knows a rare book when they see it vanessa also works part time in suey books ah rebus nodded pencilling in her prices earrings and a bicycle old costellos a customer so vanessa knows him fairly well kemp added well enough to steal from him at any rate chris kemp sighed dont ask me why she did it was she planning to sell them i dont know did she want to keep them for herself i dont know ive asked her believe me maybe she just had a a brainstorm yes maybe whatever she reckoned costello might not even miss them books are books to him maybe she thought hed be as happy with the latest paperback editions but she presumably wouldnt be look just take them back okay or keep them for yourself anything the kettle clicked off rebus refused the offer of more coffee so he said as kemp made himself a mug what have you got to tell me chris its just something vanessa told me about her employer ronald steele yes what about him hes having an affair with mrs rab kinnoul really yes not your business you see inspector nothing to do with law and order but a juicy story nevertheless eh rebus found it hard to talk his head was biding again new possibilities new configurations so how did she come to this conclusion it started a while back our entertainment correspondent on the paper had gone to interview mr kinnoul but thered been a cockup over the dates he turned up on a wednesday afternoon when it should have been thursday anyway kinnoul wasnt there but mrs kinnoul was and she had a friend with her a friend introduced as ronald steele one friend visits another i dont see but then vanessa told me something a couple of wednesdays back there was an emergency at the shop well not exactly an emergency some old dear wanted to sell some of her deceased husbands books she brought a list to the shop vanessa could see there were a few gems in there but she needed to talk to the boss first he doesnt trust her when it comes to the buying now wednesday afternoons are sacrosanct the weekly round of golf with gregor jack yes precisely but vanessa thought hell kill me if this lot get away so she rang the golf club out at braidwater i know it and they told her that messrs steele and jack had cancelled yes well i started to put two and two together steeles supposed to be playing golf every wednesday yet one wednesday my colleague finds him out at the kinnoul house and another wednesday theres no sign of him on the golf course rab kinnouls known to have a temper inspector hes known as a very possessive man do you think he knows that steeles visiting his wife when hes not there rebuss heart was racing you might have a point chris you might have a point but like i say its hardly police business is it hardly it was absolutely police business two alibis chipped into the same bunker was rebus nearer the end of the course than hed suspected was he playing nine holes rather than eighteen he got up from the sofa chris ive got to be going like spokes on a bicycle wheel turning in his head liz jack gregor jack rab kinnoul cath kinnoul ronald steele ian urquhart helen greig andrew macmillan barney byars louise pattersonscott julian kaymer jamie kilpatrick william glass like spokes on a bicycle wheel inspector rebus he paused by the door what kemp pointed to the sofa dont forget to take your books with you rebus stared at them as though seeing them for the first time right he said heading back towards the sofa by the way he said picking up the bundle i know why steeles called suey then he winked remind me to tell you about it some time when this is all over he returned to the station intending to share some of what he knew with his superiors but brian holmes stopped him outside the chief superintendents door i wouldnt do that rebus his fist raised high ready to knock paused why not he asked every bit as quietly as holmes himself had spoken mrs jacks fathers in there sir hugh ferrie rebus lowered his hand carefully then began backing away from the door the last thing he wanted was to be dragged into a discussion with ferrie why havent you found what are you doing about when will you no life was too short and the hours too long thanks brian i owe you one who else is in there just the farmer and the fart best leave them to it eh they moved a safe distance from the door that list of cars you made up was pretty comprehensive well done thanks lauderdale never told me exactly what it was anything else happening what no quiet as the grave oh nell thinks she might be pregnant what holmes gave a bemused smile were not sure yet were you you know expecting it the smiled stayed expect the unexpected as they say rebus whistled how does she feel about it i think shes holding back on the feelings till we know one way or the other what about you me if its a boy hell be called stuart and grow up to be a doctor and a scottish international rebus laughed and if its a girl katherine actress ill keep my fingers crossed for you thanks oh and another bit of news ponds back tom pond the very one back from across the pond we reached him this morning i thought id go have a talk with him unless you want to rebus shook his head hes all yours brian for what hes worth right now hes about the only bugger i think is in the clear him and macmillan and mr glass have you seen the interview transcript no well i know you and chief inspector lauderdale dont always get on but ill say this for him hes sharp a glasscutter you might say holmes sighed i might but you always seem to beat me to the pun edinburgh was surrounded by golf courses catering to every taste and presenting every possible degree of difficulty there were links courses where the wind was as likely to blow your ball backwards as forwards and there were hilly courses all slope and gully with greens and flags positioned on this or that handkerchiefsized plateau the braidwater course belonged to the latter category players made the majority of their shots trusting either to instinct or fortune since the flag would often be hidden from view behind a rise or the brow of a hill a cruel course designer would have tucked sand traps just the other side of these obstacles and indeed a cruel course designer had people who didnt know the course often started their round with high hopes of a spot of exercise and fresh air but finished with high blood pressure and the dire need of a couple of drams the club house comprised two contrasting sections there was the original building old and solid and grey but to which had been added an oversized extension of breeze block and pebbledash the old building housed committee rooms offices and the like but the bar was in the new building the club secretary led rebus into the bar where he thought one of the committee members might be found the bar itself was on the first floor one wall was all window looking out over the eighteenth green and beyond to the rolling course itself on another wall were framed photos rolls of honour mockparchment scrolls and a pair of very old putters looking like emaciated crossbones the clubs trophies the small trophies were arrayed on a shelf above the bar the larger the more ancient the more valuable trophies were kept in the committee room in the old building rebus knew this because some of them had been stolen three years before and hed been one of the investigating officers they had been recovered too though utterly by accident found lying in an open suitcase by officers called out to a domestic the club secretary remembered rebus though cant recall the name hed said but i know the face he showed rebus the new alarm system and the toughened glass case the trophies were kept in rebus hadnt the heart to tell him that even an amateur burglar could still be in and out of the place in two minutes flat what will you have to drink inspector ill have a small whisky if its no trouble no trouble at all the bar wasnt exactly busy a lateafternoon hiatus as the secretary had explained those who played in the afternoon usually liked to get started before three while those who came for an early evening round arrived around five thirty two men in identical yellow vneck pullovers sat at a table by the window and stared out in silence sipping from time to time at identical bloody marys two more men sat at the bar one with a flatlooking half pint of beer the other with what looked suspiciously like a glass of milk they were all in their forties or slightly older all my contemporaries thought rebus bill here could tell you a few stories inspector the club secretary said nodding towards the barman bill nodded back half in greeting half in agreement his own vneck was cherry red and did nothing to hide his bulging stomach he didnt look like a professional barman but took a slow conspicuous pride in the job rebus reckoned him for just another member doing his stint of duty nobody had twitched at the secretarys mention of inspector these men were lawabiding or if not they were certainly lawabetting they believed in law and order and that criminals should be punished they just didnt think fiddling your tax was a criminal act they looked secure they thought of themselves as secure but rebus knew he held the skeleton keys water inspector the secretary pushed a jug towards him thank you rebus adulterated the whisky the secretary was looking around him as though surrounded by bodies hectors not here i thought he was bill the barman chipped in hell be back in a sec gone for the proverbial jimmy added the drinker of milk while rebus pondered which proverb he meant ah here he comes rebus had imagined a large hector curly hair distended gut tangerine vneck but this man was small and had thinning brylcreemed black hair he too was in his forties and peered at the world through thicklensed thickrimmed glasses his mouth was set in a defiance at odds with his appearance and he examined rebus thoroughly while the introductions were made how do you do he said slipping a small damp hand into rebuss paw it was like shaking hands with a wellbroughtup child his vneck was camelcoloured but expensivelooking cashmere inspector rebus the secretary said is wondering about a particular round which was either played or was not played a couple of wednesdays ago yes i told him youre the brains of the setup hector yes the secretary seemed to be struggling we thought maybe youd but hector now had enough information and had digested it first thing to do he said is look at the bookings they may not tell us the whole story but theyre the place to start who was playing the question was directed at rebus two players sir he replied a mr ronald steele and a mr gregor jack hector glanced behind rebus to where the two drinkers sat at the bar the room hadnt exactly grown quieter but there was a palpable change of atmosphere the drinker of milk spoke first those two rebus turned to him yes sir those two how do you mean but it was hectors place to answer messrs jack and steele have a regular booking mr jack was an mp you know he still is sir so far as i know not for much longer muttered the milkdrinkers companion im not aware that mr jack has committed any crime i should think not snapped hector hes still a royal pain in the arse commented the milkdrinker hows that sir books and never shows him and his cronies rebus became aware that this was a longfestering sore and that the mans words were directed more towards the club secretary and hector than towards him gets away with it too just because hes an mp mr jack has been warned hector said reprimanded corrected the club secretary the milkdrinker just screwed up his face you kissed his bloody arse and you know it now then colin said bill and the barman no need to its about time somebody said it out loud hear hear said the beerdrinker colins right an argument wasnt much use to rebus do i take it he said that mr jack and mr steele had a regular booking but then wouldnt turn up you take it absolutely right said colin lets not exaggerate or misrepresent said hector quietly let us deal in facts well sir said rebus while were dealing in facts its a fact that a colleague of mine detective constable broome came out here last week to check on whether that particular round of golf had been played i believe he dealt with you seeing how the club secretary here was ill that day remember hector the secretary interrupted nervously one of my migraines hector nodded curtly i remember you werent exactly honest with dc broome were you sir said rebus colin was licking his lips enjoying the confrontation on the contrary inspector said hector i was scrupulously honest in answering the detective constables questions he just didnt ask the right ones in fact he was very sloppy indeed took one look at the bookings and seemed satisfied i recall he was in a hurry he had to meet his wife right thought rebus broome was for a carpeting then even so even so sir it was your duty i answered his questions inspector i did not lie well then lets say that you were economical with the truth colin snorted hector gave him a cold look but his words were for rebus he wasnt thorough enough inspector its as simple as that i dont expect my patients to help me if im not thorough enough in my treatment of them you shouldnt expect me to do your work for you this is a serious criminal case sir then why are we arguing ask your questions the barman interrupted hold on before you start ive got a question he looked at each of them in turn what are you having bill the barman poured the drinks the round was on him and he totted up the amount and scribbled it into a small notebook kept beside the till the bloody marys from the window came over to join in the beerdrinker was introduced to rebus as david cassidy no jokes please how were my parents supposed to know and the man called colin was indeed drinking milk ulcer doctors orders hector accepted a thin delicate glass filled to the lip with dry sherry he toasted our general health but not the national health eh hector added colin going on to explain to rebus that hector was a dentist private cassidy added which hector retorted is what this club is supposed to be private members private business should be none of our concern which is why rebus speculated youve been acting as alibi for jack and steele hector merely sighed alibi is rather strong inspector as club members they are allowed to book and to cancel at short notice and thats what happened sometimes yes but not all the time they played occasionally how occasionally id have to check about once a month barman bill said he held on to the glasstowel as if it were a talisman so said rebus three weeks out of four theyd cancel how did they cancel by telephone said hector usually mr jack always very apologetic constituency business or mr steele was ill or well there were a number of reasons excuses you mean cassidy said mind you said bill sometimes gregord turn up anyway wouldnt he colin conceded that this was so i went a round with him myself one wednesday when steele hadnt shown up so said rebus mr jack came to the club more often than mr steele there were nods at this sometimes hed cancel then turn up he wouldnt play just sit in the bar never the other way round steele never turned up without jack and on the wednesday in question the wednesday rebus was interested in it bucketed down colin said hardly any bugger went out that day never mind those two they cancelled then oh yes they cancelled and no not even mr jack had turned up not that day and not since the lull was over members were coming in either for a quick one before starting out or for a quick one before heading home they came over to the little group shook hands swapped stories and the group itself started to fragment until only rebus and hector were left the dentist laid a hand on rebuss arm one more thing inspector he said yes i hope you wont think im being unsubtle yes but you really should get your teeth seen to so ive been told sir rebus said so ive been told incidentally i hope you wont think im being unsubtle yes inspector rebus leaned close to the man the better to hiss into his ear im going to try my damnedest to see you on a charge for obstruction he placed his empty glass on the bar cheers then said barman bill he took the glass and rinsed it in the machine then placed it on the plastic dripmat when he looked up hector was still standing where the policeman had left him his sherry glass rigid in his hand you told me on friday rebus said that you were jettisoning what you didnt need yes then i take it you did feel you needed the alibi of your golf game what your weekly round with your friend ronald steele what about it funny isnt it im making the statements and youre asking the questions should be the other way round should it gregor jack looked like a war casualty who could still hear and see the battle no matter how far from the front he was dragged the newsmen were still outside his gates while ian urquhart and helen greig were still inside the sounds of a printer doing its business came from the distant back office urquhart was ensconced in there with helen another day another press release do i need a solicitor jack asked now his eyes dark and sleepless thats entirely up to you sir i just want to know why youve lied to us about this round of golf jack swallowed there was an empty whisky bottle on the coffee table and three empty coffee mugs friendship inspector he said is its an excuse you need more than excuses sir what i need right now are some facts he thought of hector as he said the word facts he repeated but jack was still mumbling something about friendship rebus rose awkwardly from his illfitting marshmallowchair he stood over the mp mp this wasnt an mp this wasnt the gregor jack where was the confidence the charisma where the voteworthy face and that clear honest voice he was like one of those sauces they make on cookery programmes reduce and reduce and reduce rebus reached down and grabbed him by his shoulders he actually shook him jack looked up in surprise rebuss voice was cold and sharp like rain where were you that wednesday i was i was nowhere nowhere really everywhere everywhere except where you were supposed to be i went for a drive where down the coast i think i ended up in eyemouth one of those fishing villages somewhere like that it rained i walked along the sea front i walked a lot drove back inland everywhere and nowhere he began to sing youre everywhere and nowhere baby rebus shook him again and he stopped did anyone see you did you speak to anyone i went into a pub two pubs one in eyemouth one somewhere else why where was suey what was he up to suey jack smiled at the name good old suey friends you see inspector where was he he was where he always was with some woman im his cover if anyone asks were out playing golf and sometimes we are but the rest of the time im covering for him not that i mind its quite nice really having that time to myself i go off on my own walking thinking whos the woman what i dont know im not even sure its just the one you cant think of any candidates who jack blinked you mean liz my liz no inspector no he smiled briefly no all right what about mrs kinnoul gowk now he laughed gowk and suey maybe when they were fifteen inspector but not now have you seen rab kinnoul hes like a mountain suey wouldnt dare well maybe suey will be good enough to tell me youll apologize wont you tell him i had to tell you id be grateful rebus said stonily if youd think back on that afternoon try to remember where you stopped the names of the pubs anyone who might remember seeing you write it all down like a statement just to help you remember it often helps when you write things down thats true meantime im going to have to think about charging you with obstruction what the door opened it was urquhart he came in and closed it behind him thats that done he said good jack said casually urquhart too looked like he was just hanging on his eyes were on rebus even when he was speaking to his employer i told helen to run off a hundred copies as many as that well whatever you think ian now urquhart looked towards gregor jack he wants to shake him too rebus thought but he wont youve got to be strong gregor youve got to look strong youre right ian yes look strong like wet tissue paper rebus thought like an infestation of woodworm like an old persons bones ronald steele was a hard man to catch rebus even went to his home a bungalow on the edge of morningside no sign of life rebus went on trying the rest of the day at the fourth ring of steeles telephone an answering machine came into play at eight oclock he stopped trying what he didnt want was gregor jack warning steele that their story had come apart at its badly stitched seams given the means hed have kept steeles answering machine busy all night but instead his own telephone rang he was in the marchmont flat slumped in his own chair with nothing to eat or drink and nothing to take his mind off the case he knew who it would be it would be patience she would just be wondering if and when he intended making an appearance she would just have been worried that was all theyd spent a rare weekend together shopping on saturday afternoon a film at night a drive to cramond on sunday wine and backgammon on sunday night rare he picked up the receiver rebus jesus youre a hard man to catch it was a male voice it was not patience it was holmes hello brian ive been trying you for hours always engaged or else not answering you should get an answering machine ive got an answering machine i just sometimes forget to plug it in what do you want anyway dont tell me youre telephoneselling as a sideline hows nell as well as can be not expecting shes negative then im positive she is maybe next time eh listen thanks for the interest but thats not why im calling i thought youd want to know i had a very interesting chat with mr pond aka tampon thought rebus oh yes he said youre not going to believe it said brian holmes for once he was right brothel creepers the way tom pond explained it to rebus architects were either doomed to failure or else doomed to success he had no doubt at all that he came into the latter category i know architects my age guys i went to college with theyve been on the dole for the past half dozen years or else they give up and go do something sensible like working on a building site or living on a kibbutz then there are some of us for a time we cant put a foot wrong this prize leads to that contract and that contract gets noticed by an american corporation and we start calling ourselves international note i say for a time it can all turn sour you get in a rut or the economic situation cant support your new ideas ill tell you the best architectural designs are sitting locked away in drawers nobody can afford to build the buildings not yet anyway maybe not ever so im just enjoying my lucky break thats all im doing it was not quite all tom pond was doing he was also crossing the forth road bridge doing something in excess of one hundred miles an hour rebus darent look at the speedo after all pond had explained its not every day i can go breaking the speed limit with a policeman in the car to explain it away if we get stopped and he laughed rebus didnt rebus didnt say much after they hit the ton tom pond owned a fortygrand italian racing job that looked like a kitcar and sounded like a lawnmower the last time rebus had been sitting this close to ground level hed just slipped on some ice outside his flat ive got three habits inspector fast cars fast women and slow horses and he laughed again if you dont slow down son rebus yelled above the engines whine im going to have to book you for speeding myself pond looked hurt but eased back on the accelerator and after all he was doing them all a favour wasnt he thank you rebus conceded holmes had told him he wouldnt believe it rebus was still trying pond had arrived back the previous day from the states only to find a message waiting for him on his answering machine it was mrs heggarty mrs heggarty being she looks after my cottage ive got a cottage up near kingussie mrs heggarty goes in now and again to give it a clean and check everythings okay and this time everything wasnt thats right at first she said thered been a breakin but then i called her back and from what she said theyd used my spare key to get in i keep a key under a rock beside the front door hadnt made any mess or anything not really but mrs heggarty knew somebodyd been there and it hadnt been me anyway i happened to mention it to the detective sergeant the detective sergeant whose geography was better than fair kingussie wasnt far from deer lodge it certainly wasnt far from duthil holmes had asked the obvious question would mrs jack have known about the key maybe beggar knew about it i suppose everybody knew about it really all of which holmes had relayed to rebus rebus had gone to see pond their conversation lasting just over half an hour at the end of which he had announced a wish to see the cottage be my guest pond had said and so rebus was trapped in this narrow metal box travelling so fast at times that his eyeballs were aching it was well after midnight but pond seemed neither to notice nor to mind im still in new york he said brain and body still disconnected you know this all sounds incredible all this stuff about gregor and liz and her being found by gowk just incredible pond had been in the united states for a month already he was hooked he was testing out the language the intonation even some of the mannerisms rebus studied him thick wavy blond hair dyed highlighted atop a beefy ace the face of someone who had been goodlooking in youth he wasnt tall but he seemed taller than he was a trick of posture yes to a certain extent but he also had that confidence that aura gregor jack had once possessed he was firing on all cylinders can this car take a corner or what say what you like about the italians they build a mean ice cream and a meaner car rebus gritted his lower intestine he was determined to taik seriously with pond it was too good a chance to miss the two of them trapped like this he tried to talk without his teeth knocking each other out of his mouth so youve known mr jack since school i know i know its hard to believe isnt it i look so much younger than him but yes we only lived three streets apart i think bilbo lived in the same street as beggar sexton and mack lived in the same street too i mean the same street as one another not the same as beggar and bilbo suey and gowk lived a bit further away other side of the school from the rest of us so what drew you all together i dont know funny ive never really thought about it i mean we were all pretty clever i suppose down a gear for this corner and like shit off a goddamned shovel rebus felt as though his seat was trying to push its way irough his body more like a motorbike than a car what do you think inspector do you keep in touch with mack rebus asked at last oh you know about mack well no not really beggar was the catalyst i think it was only because i kept in touch with him that i kept in touch with everybody else but after mac well when he went into the nuthouse no i dont keep in touch i think gowk does you know she was the cleveist of the lot of us and look what happened to her what did happen to her she mairried that spunkhead and started shovelling valium because it was the only way she could cope is her problem common knowledge then he shruged i only know because ive seen it happen to other people other times have you tried talking to her its her life inspector ive got enough trouble keeping myself togther the pack what did a pack do when one of its number grew lame or sick they left it to die the fittest trotting along at the head pond seemed to sense rebuss thoughts sorry if that sounds calious i was never one for tea and sympathy who was sexton was always ready with a willing ear but then she buggered off south suey too i suppose you could talk to him he never had any answers mind but he was a good listener rebus hoped hed be as good a talker there were more and more questions to be answered he decided how would an american phrase it yes to throw pond a few curveballs if elizabeth jack had a lover who would be your guess pond actually slowed down a little he thought for a moment me he said at last after all shed be stupid to plump for anybody else wouldnt she and he grinned again second choice well there were rumours there were always rumours yes jesus you want me to list them okay barney byars for a start do you know him i know him well barneys all right i suppose bit screwed up about class but otherwise hes fine the two of them were pretty close for a while who else jamie kilpatrick julian kaymer i think that fat bastard kinnoul even tried his luck then she was supposed to have had a fling with that grocers ex you mean louise pattersonscott can you imagine it story was the morning after a party they were found together in bed but so what anyone else probably hundreds you never me pond shrugged we had a kiss and a cuddle a few times he smiled at the memory it could have gone anywhere but it didnt the thing with liz was generosity pond nodded to himself pleased that he had found the right word the fitting epitaph here lies elizabeth jack she gave can i use your telephone rebus asked sure he called patience he had tried twice before in the course of the evening no reply but there was a reply this time this time he got her out of bed where are you she asked heading north when will i see you her voice had lost all emotion all interest rebus wondered if it was merely a trick of the telephone tomorrow definitely tomorrow it cant keep on like this john really it cant he sought for words which would reassure her while not embarrassing him in front of pond he sought too long bye john and the receiver went dead they reached kingussie well before dawn having met little enough traffic and not a single patrol car they had brought torches though these werent really necessary the cottage was situated at the far corner of a village a little off the main road but still receiving a good share of what streetlighting there was rebus was surprised to find that the cottage was quite a modern bungalow surrounded by a high hedge on all four sides excepting the necessary gates which opened on to a short gravel drive leading up to the house itself when gregor and liz got their place pond explained i thought what the hell only i couldnt bear to rough it the way they do i wanted something a bit more modern less charm better amenities nice neighbours pond shrugged hardly ever seen them the place next door is a holiday home too half the houses in the village are he shrugged again what about mrs heggarty lives the other side of the main drag so whoevers been living here they could have come and gone without anyone noticing no doubt about that pond left his headlights on while he opened the front door of the house suddenly hallway and porch were illuminated rebus freed from the cage was stretching and trying to stop his knees from folding in on him is that the stone thats the one pond said it was a huge pebbleshaped piece of pinkish rock he lifted it showing that the spare key was still there nice of them to leave it when they went come on ill show you around just a second mr pond could you try not to touch anything we might want to check for fingerprints later on pond smiled sure but my printsll be everywhere anyway of course but all the same besides if mrs heggartys tidied up after our guests the placell be polished and tidied from ceiling to floor rebuss heart sank as he followed pond into the cottage there was certainly a smell of furniture polish mingling with airfreshener in the living room not a cushion or an executive toy looked to be out of place looks the same as when i left it pond said youre sure pretty sure im not like liz and her crew inspector i dont go in for parties i dont mind other peoples but the last thing i want to have to do is clean salmon mousse off the ceiling or explain to the village that the woman with her arse hanging out of a bentley back window is actually an hon you wouldnt be thinking of the hon matilda merriman the same christ you know them all dont you ive yet to meet the hon matilda actually take my advice defer the moment lifes too short and the hours too long thought rebus todays hours had certainly been way too long the kitchen was neat glasses sat sparkling on the draining board shouldnt think youll get many prints off them inspector mrs heggartys very thorough isnt she not always so thorough upstairs come on lets see well someone had been thorough the beds in both bedrooms had been made there were no cups or glasses on display no newspapers or magazines or unfinished books pond made show of sniffing the air no he said its no good i cant even smell her perfume whose lizs she always wore the same brand i forget what it was she always smelt beautiful beautiful do you think she was here someone was here and we think she was in this area but who was she with thats what youre wondering rebus nodded well it wasnt me mores the pity i was having to make do with call girls and get this they want to check your medical certificate before they start aids aids okay finished up here beginning to look like a wasted journey isnt it maybe theres still the bathroom pond pushed open the bathroom door and ushered rebus inside ahha he said looks like mrs heggarty was running out of time he nodded towards where a towel lay in a heap on the floor usually that would go straight in the laundry the shower curtain had been pulled across the bath rebus drew it back the bath was drained but one or two long hairs were sticking to the enamel rebus was thinking we can check those a hairs enough for an id then he noticed the two glasses sitting together on a corner of the bath he leaned over and sniffed white wine just a trickle of it left in one glass two glasses for two people two people in the bath and enjoying a drink your telephones downstairs isnt it thats right come on then this rooms out of bounds until further notice and im about to become a forensic scientists nightmare sure enough the person rebus ended up speaking to on the telephone did not sound pleased weve been working our bums off on that car and that other cottage i appreciate that but this could be just as important it could be more important rebus was standing in the small dining room he couldnt quite tie up these furnishings to ponds personality but then he saw a framed photograph of a couple young and in love captured some time in the s then he understood ponds parents the furniture here had once belonged to them pond had probably inherited it but decided it didnt go with his fast womenslow horses lifestyle perfect though for filling the spaces in his holiday home pond himself who had been sitting on a dining chair rose to his feet rebus placed a hand over the receiver where are you going for a pee dont panic ill go out the back just dont go upstairs okay fine the voice on the telephone was still complaining rebus shivered he was cold no he was tired body temperature dropping look he said bugger off back to bed then but be here first thing in the morning ill give you the address and i mean first thing all right youre a generous man inspector theyll put it on my gravestone he gave pond slept with rebuss envious blessing in the master bedroom while rebus himself kept vigil outside the bathroom door once bitten he didnt want a repetition of the deer lodge breakin this evidence if evidence it was would stay intact so he sat in the upstairs hallway his back against the bathroom door a blanket wrapped around him and dozed then he slid down the door so that he was lying in front of it on the carpet curled into a foetus he dreamed that he was drunk that he was being driven around in a bentley the chauffeur was managing to drive and at the same time stick his backside out of the window there was a party in the back of the bentley holmes and nell were there copulating discreetly and hoping for a boy gill templer was there and attempting to undo rebuss zip but he didnt want patience to catch them lauderdale seemed to be there too watching just watching someone opened the drinks cabinet but it was full of books rebus picked one out and started to read it it was the best book hed ever read he couldnt put it down it had everything in the morning when he awoke stiff and cold he couldnt recall a line or a word of the book he rose and stretched twisting himself back into human shape then he opened the bathroom door and stepped inside and looked towards where the glasses should be the glasses were still there rebus despite his aches almost smiled he stood in the shower for a long time letting the water trampoline on his head his chest and his shoulders where was he he was in the oxford terrace flat he should be at work by now but that could be explained away he felt rough but not as rough as hed feared amazingly hed been able to sleep on the journey back a journey taken at a more sedate pace than that of the previous night clutch trouble pond had said only twenty miles out of kingussie hed pulled into the side of the road and had a look under the bonnet there was a lot of engine under the bonnet i wouldnt know where to start looking hed admitted the trouble with these fancy cars was that capable mechanics were few and far between in fact he had to take the car to london for every service so theyd ambled an earlymorning amble having left the cottage under the stewardship of a bemused detective sergeant knox and two overworked forensics people and rebus had slept not enough admittedly which was why hed resisted the temptation to run a bath and had opted for the shower instead difficult to nod off in a shower all too easy in a hot morning bath and he had chosen patiences flat over his own an easy choice since oxford terrace was the right side of edinburgh after the drive theyd had a hellish crossing of the forth bridge commuter traffic crawling citywards sales reps in astras gave the italian car the onceover and comforted themselves with the thought that its crew looked like crooks of some kind pimps or moneylenders he turned off the shower and towelled himself dry changed into some clean clothes and began the process of becoming a human being again shaving brushing his teeth then a mug of freshbrewed coffee lucky pleaded at a window and rebus let the cat in he even tipped some food into a bowl the cat looked up at him full of suspicion this wasnt the rebus he knew just be thankful while it lasts what day was it it was tuesday over a fortnight since the brothel raid nearly two weeks since alec corbie heard the layby argument and saw either two or three cars there had been progress most of it thanks to rebus himself if only he could shake his superiors minds free of william glass there was a note on the mantelpiece propped up against the clock why dont we try meeting some time dinner tonight or else patience no kisses always a bad sign no crosses meant she was cross she had every right to be he really had to make up his mind one way or the other move in or move out stop using the place as a public amenity somewhere to have a shower a shave a shit and on occasions a shag was he any better than liz jack and her mysterious companion making use of tom ponds cottage hell in some ways he was worse dinner tonight or else meaning or else i lose patience he took the biro out of his pocket and turned the note over if not dinner then just desserts he wrote utterly ambiguous of course but it sounded clever he added his name and a row of kisses chris kemp had his scoop a frontpage scoop at that the young reporter had worked hard after the visit from john rebus hed tracked down gail crawley a photographer in tow she hadnt exactly been forthcoming but there was a photograph of her alongside a slightly blurred picture of a teenage girl gail jack aged fourteen or so the story itself was riddled with getout clauses just in case it proved to be false the reader was left more or less to make up his or her own mind mps visit to mystery prostitute his secret sister but the photos were the clincher they were definitely of the same person same nose same eyes and chin definitely the photo of gail jack in her youth was a stroke of genius and rebus didnt doubt that the genius behind it was ian urquhart how else could kemp have found and so quickly found the photograph he needed a call to urquhart explaining that the story was worth his cooperation either urquhart himself searched out the picture or else he persuaded gregor jack to find it it was in the morning edition by tomorrow the other papers would have their own versions they could hardly afford not to rebus having recovered his car from outside ponds flat idling at traffic lights had seen the papersellers board brothel mp exclusive hed crossed the lights and parked by the roadside then jogged back to the newspaper booth returned to the car and read the story through twice admiring it as a piece of work then hed started the car again and continued towards his destination i should have bought two copies he thought to himself he wont have seen it yet the green citroen bx was in its drive the garage doors open behind it as rebus brought his own car to a halt blocking the end of the driveway the garage doors were being pulled to rebus got out of the car the folded newspaper in one hand looks like i just caught you he called ronald steele turned from the garage what he saw the car parked across his driveway look would you mind im in a then he recognised rebus oh its inspector rebus rebus yes rasputins friend rebus turned his wrist towards steele healing nicely he said look inspector steele glanced at his wristwatch was it anything important only im meeting a customer and ive already overslept nothing too important sir rebus said breezily its just that weve found out your alibi for the wednesday mrs jack died is a pack of lies wondered if youd anything to say to that steeles face already long grew longer oh he looked down at the toes of his wellscuffed shoes i thought it was bound to come out he tried a smile not much you can keep hidden from a murder inquiry eh not much you should keep hidden sir do you want me to come down to the station maybe later sir just so we can get everything on record but for the moment your living room would do right steele started to walk slowly back towards the bungalow nice area this commented rebus what oh yes yes it is lived here long rebus wasnt interested in steeles answers his only interest was in keeping the man talking the more he talked the less time he had in which to think and the less time he had to think the better the chances of him coming out with the truth three years before that i had a flat in the grassmarket they used to hang people down there did you know that did they hard to imagine it these days oh i dont know they were indoors now steele pointed to the hall phone do you mind if i call the customer make my apologies whatever you like sir ill wait in the living room if thats all right through there fine rebus went into the room but left the door wide open he heard steele dialling it was an old bakelite telephone the kind with a little drawer in the bottom containing a notepad people used to want rid of them now they wanted them back and were willing to pay the conversation was short and innocent an apology and a rescheduling of the meeting rebus opened his morning paper wide in front of him and made show of reading the inside pages the receiver clattered back into its cradle thats that said steele entering the room rebus read on for a moment then lowered the paper and began to fold it good he said steele as he had hoped was staring at the paper whats that about gregor he said hm oh you mean you havent seen it yet rebus handed over the paper steele still standing devoured the story what do you reckon sir he shrugged christ knows i suppose it makes sense i mean none of us could think what gregor was doing in a place like that i cant think of a much better reason the photos certainly look similar i dont remember gail at all well i mean she was always around but i never paid much attention she never mixed with us he folded the paper so gregors off the hook then rebus shrugged steele made to hand the paper back no no you can keep it if you like now mr steele about this nonexistent golfing fixture steele sat down it was a pleasant booklined room in fact it reminded rebus strongly of another room a room hed been in recently gregor would do anything for his friends steele said candidly including the odd telling of a lie we made up the golf game well thats not strictly true at first there was a weekly game but then i started seeing a a lady on wednesdays i explained it to gregor he didnt see why we shouldnt just go on telling everyone we were playing golf he looked up at rebus for the first time a jealous husband is involved inspector and an alibi was always welcome rebus nodded youre being very honest mr steele steele shrugged i dont want gregor getting into trouble because of me and you were with this woman on the wednesday afternoon in question the afternoon mrs jack died steele nodded solemnly and will she back you up steele smiled grimly not a hope in hell the husband again the husband steele acknowledged but hes bound to find out sooner or later isnt he rebus said so many people seem to know already about you and mrs kinnoul steele twitched as though a small electric shock had been administered to his shoulder blades he stared down at the floor willing it to become a pit he might jump into then he sat back how did you a guess mr steele a bloody inspired guess but you say other people other people are guessing too you persuaded mrs kinnoul to take up an interest in rare books it makes a good cover after all doesnt it i mean if youre ever found there with her i even notice that shes modelled her library on your own room here its not what you think inspector i dont think anything sir cathy just needs someone to listen to her rab never has time the only time he has is for himself gowk was the cleverest of the lot of us yes so mr pond was telling me tom hes back from the states then rebus nodded i was with him just this morning at his cottage rebus waited for a reaction but steeles mind was still fixed on cath kinnoul it breaks my heart to see her to see what shes shes a friend rebus stated yes she is well then shes sure to back up your story a friend in need and all that steele was shaking his head you dont understand inspector rab kinnoul is he can be a violent man mental violence and physical violence he terrifies her rebus sighed then weve only your own word for your whereabouts steele shrugged he looked as though he might cry tears of frustration rather than anything else he took a deep breath you think i killed liz did you steele shook his head no well then youve nothing to worry about have you sir steele managed that grim smile again not a worry in the world he said rebus rose to his feet thats the spirit mr steele but ronald steele looked like there was just about enough spirit left in him to fill a teaspoon all the same youre not making it easy for yourself have you spoken to gregor steele asked rebus nodded does he know about cathy and me i couldnt say they were both heading for the front door now would it make any difference if he did christ knows no maybe not the day was turning sunny rebus waited while steele closed and double locked the door just one more thing yes inspector would you mind if i took a look in the boot of your car what steele stared at rebus but saw that the policeman was not about to explain he sighed why not he said steele unlocked the boot and rebus peered inside peered at a pair of mudcrusted wellingtons there was muck on the floor too tell you what sir said rebus closing the boot maybe itd be best if you came down to the station just now sooner we get everything cleared up the better eh steele stood up very straight two women were walking past gossiping am i under arrest inspector i just want to make sure we get your side of things mr steele thats all but rebus was wondering were there any forensics people left spare or had he tied each and every one of them up already if so steeles car might have to wait if not well here was another little job for them it really was turning into guinness book of records stuff wasnt it how many forensic scientists can one detective squeeze into a case what case ive just told you sir lauderdale looked unimpressed you havent told me anything about the murder of mrs jack youve told me about mysterious lovers alibis for assignations a whole barrelload of mixedup yuppies but not a blind thing about murder he pointed to the floor ive got someone downstairs who swears he committed both murders yes sir rebus said calmly and youve also got a psychiatrist who says glass could just as easily admit the murders of gandhi or rudolf hess how do you know that what about the psychiatric report call it an inspired guess sir lauderdale began to look a little dispirited he licked his lips thoughtfully all right he said at last go through it one more time for me so rebus went through it one more time it was like a giant collage to him now different textures but the same theme but it was also like a kind of artists trick the closer he moved towards it the further away it seemed he was just finishing and lauderdale was still looking sceptical when the telephone rang lauderdale picked it up listened and sighed its for you he said holding the receiver towards rebus yes rebus said woman for you explained the switchboard operator says its urgent put her through he waited till the connection was made rebus here he said he could hear background noise announcements a railway station then about bleedin time im at waverley my train goes in fortyfive minutes get here before it leaves and ill tell you something the line went dead short and sour but intriguing for all that rebus checked his watch ive got to go to waverley station he told lauderdale why dont you talk to steele yourself meantime sir see what you make of him thank you said lauderdale maybe i will she was sitting on a bench in the concourse conspicuous in sunglasses which were supposed to disguise her identity that bastard she said putting the papers on to me like that she was talking of her brother gregor jack rebus didnt say anything one yesterday she went on then this morning half a dozen of the bastards picture plastered all over the front pages maybe it wasnt your brother rebus said what who else could it be behind the dark lenses rebus could still make out gail crawleys tired eyes she was dressed as though in a hurry tight jeans high heels baggy tshirt her luggage seemed to consist of a large suitcase and two carrier bags in one hand she clutched her ticket to london in the other she held a cigarette maybe rebus suggested it was the person who knew who you were the person who told gregor where to find you she shivered thats what i wanted to tell you about god knows why i dont owe the bastard any favours nor do i thought rebus yet i always seem to be doing them for him what about a drink she suggested sure said rebus he picked up her suitcase while she clipclopped along carrying the bags her shoes made a lot of noise and attracted glances from some of the men lolling about rebus was quite relieved to reach the safety of the bar where he bought a half of export for himself and a bacardi and coke for her they found a corner not too near the gaming machine or the frazzled loudspeaker of the jukebox cheers she said trying to drink and inhale at much the same time she spluttered and swore then stubbed out the cigarette only seconds later to light another good health said rebus sipping his own drink so what was it you wanted to get off your chest she snorted i like that get off your chest this time she remembered to swallow her mouthful of rum before drawing on the cigarette only she said what you were saying about how somebody might have known who i was yes well i remembered it was a night a while back like a couple of months six weeks something like that i hadnt been up here long anyway the usual trio of pissed punters comes in funny how they usually come in threes she paused snorted if youll pardon the expression so three men came to the brothel just said so didnt i anyway one of them liked the look of me so off we went upstairs i told him my name was gail i cant see the point of all those stupid names everybody else uses candy and mandy and claudette and tina and suzy and jasmine and roberta id just forget who i was supposed to be rebus glanced at his watch a little over ten minutes left she seemed to understand so anyway i asked him if he had a name and he laughed he said you mean you dont recognize the face i shook my head and he said of course youre a londoner arent you well hen he said im weel kent up here something stupid like that then he says im gregor jack well i just started laughing dont ask me why he did ask me why so i said no youre not i know gregor jack that seemed to put him off his stroke in the end he buggered off back to his pals all the usual winks and slaps on the back and i didnt say anything what did he look like big like a highlander one of the other girls said she thought she had seen him on the telly rab kinnoul rebus described him briefly sounds about right she conceded what about the men who were with him didnt pay much attention one of them was the shy type tall and skinny like a beanpole the other was fat and had on a leather jacket you didnt catch their names no well it didnt matter rebus would bet she could pick them out from a lineup ronald steele and barney byars a night out on the town byars steele and rab kinnoul a curious little assembly and another incendiary he could toss in steeles direction finish your drink gail he said then lets get you on to that train but on the way he extracted an address from her the same one she had given before the one hed had george flight check on thats where ill be she said she took a final look around her the train was idling filling with people rebus lifted her suitcase in through one of the doors she was still staring up at the glass roof of the station then she lowered her gaze to rebus i should never have left london should i maybe nothing would have happened if id stayed where i was rebus tilted his head slightly youre not to blame gail but all the same he couldnt help feeling that she had a point if shed stayed away from edinburgh if she hadnt come out with that i know gregor jack who could say she stepped up on to the train then turned back towards him if you see gregor she began but there wasnt anything else she shrugged and turned away carrying her case and her bags with her rebus never one for emotional farewells where prostitutes were concerned turned briskly on his heels and headed back towards his car youve what ive let him go youve let steele go rebus couldnt believe it he paced what there was of lauderdales floor why now lauderdale smiled coldly what was the charge john be realistic for christs sake did you talk to him yes and he seems very plausible in other words you believe him i think i do yes what about his car boot you mean the mud he told you himself john mrs kinnoul and he go for walks that hillsides hardly what youd call paved you need wellies and wellies get muddy its their purpose he admitted he was seeing cath kinnoul he admitted nothing of the sort he just said there was a woman thats all hed say when i brought him in but he admitted it back in his house i think its quite noble of him trying to protect her or could it be that he knows she couldnt back up his story anyway you mean its a pack of lies rebus sighed no i think i believe it too well then lauderdale sounded for lauderdale genuinely gentle sit down john youve had a hard twentyfour hours rebus sat down ive had a hard twentyfour years lauderdale smiled tea i think some of the chief superintendents coffee would be a better idea lauderdale laughed kill or cure certainly now look youve just admitted yourself that you believe steeles story up to a point lauderdale accepted the clause but still the man wanted to leave how the hell was i going to hold him on suspicion were allowed to hang on to suspects a bit longer than ninety minutes thank you inspector im aware of that so now he toddles back home and gives the boot of his car a damned good clean you need more than mucky wellies for a conviction john youd be surprised what forensics can do ah now thats another thing i hear youve been getting up peoples noses faster than a vicks inhaler anybody in particular everybody in the field of forensic science it seems stop hassling them john yes sir take a break just for the afternoon say what about the professors missing tomes back with their owner oh lauderdale waited for elucidation a turnup for the books sir rebus said instead he stood up well if theres nothing else the telephone rang hold on lauderdale ordered the way things have been going thatll probably be for you he picked up the receiver lauderdale then he listened ill be right down he said at last before replacing the receiver well well well take a guess whos downstairs the dundonald and dysart pipe band close jeanette oliphant rebus frowned i know the name shes sir hugh femes solicitor and also it seems mr jacks theyre both down there with her lauderdale had risen from his chair and was straightening his jacket lets see what they want eh gregor jack wanted to make a statement a statement regarding his movements on the day his wife was murdered but the prime mover was sir hugh ferrie that much was obvious from the start i saw that piece in the paper this morning he explained phoned gregor to ask if it was true he says it was i felt a sight better for knowing it though i told him hes a bloody fool for not telling anyone sooner he turned to gregor jack a bloody fool they were seated around a table in one of the conference rooms lauderdales idea no doubt an interview room wasnt good enough for sir hugh ferrie gregor jack had been smartened up for the occasion crisp suit tidied hair sparkling eyes seated however between sir hugh and jeanette oliphant he was always going to come home third in the projection stakes the point is said jeanette oliphant mr jack told sir hugh about something else hed been keeping secret namely that his wednesday round of golf was a concoction bloody fool and oliphant went on a little more loudly sir hugh contacted me we feel that the sooner mr jack makes a statement regarding his genuine actions on the day in question the less doubt there will be jeanette oliphant was in her midfifties a tall elegant but sternfaced woman her mouth was a thin slash of lipstick her eyes piercing missing nothing her ears stuck out ever so slightly from her short permed hair as though ready to catch any nuance or ambiguity any wrong word or overlong pause sir hugh on the other hand was stocky and pugnacious a man more used to speaking than listening his hands lay flat against the table top as though they were attempting to push through it lets get everything sorted out he said if thats what mr jack wants lauderdale said quietly its what he wants replied ferrie the door opened it was detective sergeant brian holmes carrying a tray of cups rebus looked up at him but holmes refused to meet his eyes not normally a dss job playing waiter but rebus could just see holmes waylaying the real teaboy he wanted to know what was going on so it seemed did chief superintendent watson who came into the room behind him ferrie actually half rose from his chair ah chief superintendent they shook hands watson glanced from lauderdale to rebus and back but there was nothing they could tell him not yet holmes having laid the tray on the table was lingering thank you sergeant said lauderdale dismissing him from the room in the general melee rebus saw that gregor jack was looking at him looking with his sparkling eyes and his little boys smile here we are again he was saying here we are again watson decided to stay another cup would be needed but then rebus declined the offer of tea so there was a cup for watson after all it was obvious from his face that he would have preferred coffee his own coffee but he accepted the cup from rebus with a nodded thanks then gregor jack spoke after inspector rebuss last visit i did some thinking i was able to recall the names of some of the places i went to that wednesday he reached into his jackets inside pocket and drew out a piece of paper i looked in on a bar in eyemouth itself but it was packed i didnt stay i did have a tomato juice at a hotel outside the town but again the bar there was packed so i cant be sure anyone will remember me and i bought chewing gum at a newsagents in dunbar on the way down apart from that im afraid its pretty vague he handed the list to the chief superintendent a walk along the front at eyemouth a stop in a layby just north of berwick there was another car in the layby a rep or something but he seemed more interested in his maps than he did in me thats about it watson nodded studying the list as though it contained exam questions then he handed it on to lauderdale its certainly a start said watson the thing is chief superintendent said sir hugh the boy knows hes in trouble but it seems to me the only trouble hes in stems from trying to help other people watson nodded thoughtfully rebus stood up if youll excuse me a moment and he made for the door closing it behind him with a real sense of escape he had no intention of returning there might be a slap on the wrist later from lauderdale or watson bad manners that john but no way could he sit in that stifling room with all those stifling people holmes was loitering at the far end of the corridor whats up he asked when rebus approached nothing to get excited about oh holmes looked deflated only we all thought you all thought he was coming in to confess quite the opposite brian is glass going to end up going down for both murders then rebus shrugged nothing would surprise me he said despite his morning shower he felt grimy and unhealthy makes it nice and neat doesnt it were the police brian were not meant to be char ladies sorry i spoke rebus sighed sorry brian i didnt mean to dust you off they stared at one another for a second then laughed it wasnt much but it was better than nothing right im off to queensferry autographhunting something like that need a chauffeur why not come on then a snap decision rebus was later to think which probably saved his life old school ties they managed not to speak about work on the way out to queensferry instead they spoke about women what about the four of us going out some night brian holmes suggested at one point im not sure patience and nell would get on rebus mused what different personalities you mean no similar personalities thats the problem rebus was thinking of tonights dinner with patience of trying to take time off from the jack case of not making a jackass of himself of jacking it all in it was only a thought said holmes thats all only a thought the rain was starting as they neared the kinnoul house the sky had been darkening for the duration of the drive until now it seemed evening had come early rab kinnouls landrover was parked outside the front door curiously the door to the house was open rain bounced off the car bonnet becoming heavier by the second better make a run for it said rebus they opened their doors and ran rebus however was on the right side for the house while holmes had to skirt around the car first so rebus was first up the steps and first through the doorway and into the hall he shook his hair free of water then opened his eyes and saw the carving knife swooping down on him and heard the shriek behind it bastard then someone pushed him sideways it was holmes flying through the doorway the knife fell into space and kept falling floorwards cath kinnoul fell after it her weight propelling her holmes was on her in an instant pulling her wrist round twisting it up against her back he had his knee firmly on her spine just below the shoulder blades christ almighty gasped rebus jesus christ almighty holmes was examining the sprawled figure she took a knock when she fell he said shes out cold he prised the knife from her grasp and released her arm it flopped on to the carpet holmes stood up he seemed wonderfully calm but his face was unnaturally pale rebus meantime was shaking like a sick mongrel he rested against the hallway wall and closed his eyes for a moment breathing deeply there was a noise at the door who the rab kinnoul saw them then looked down at the unconscious figure of his wife oh hell he said he knelt down beside her dripping rainwater on to her back her head he was drenched shes all right mr kinnoul holmes stated knocked herself out thats all kinnoul saw the knife holmes was holding she had that he said his eyes opening wide dear god cathy he touched a trembling hand to her head cathy cathy rebus had recovered a little he swallowed she didnt get those bruises from falling though yes there were bruises on her arms freshlooking kinnoul nodded we had a bit of a row he said she went for me so i i was just trying to push her away but she was hysterical i decided to go for a walk until she calmed down rebus had been looking at kinnouls shoes they were caked with mud there were splashes too on his trousers go for a walk in that rain no hed run for it pure and simple hed turned tail and run doesnt look as though she calmed down rebus said matter of factly matter of factly she had almost murdered him mistaking him for her husband or so incensed by then that any man any victim would do tell you what mr kinnoul i could do with a drink ill see what there is said kinnoul rising to his feet holmes phoned for the doctor cath kinnoul was still unconscious theyd left her lying in the hall just to be on the safe side it was best not to move fall victims anyway and besides this way they could keep an eye on her through the open door of the living room she needs treatment rebus said he was sitting on the sofa nursing a whisky and what were left of his nerves what she needs kinnoul said quietly is to be away from me were useless together inspector but then were just as useless apart he was standing with his hands resting against the window sill his head against the glass what was the fight about kinnoul shook his head it seems stupid now they always start with something petty and it just builds and builds and this time kinnoul turned from the window the amount of time im spending away from home she didnt believe there were any projects she thinks its all just an excuse so i can get out of the house and is she right partly yes i suppose shes a shrewd one a bit slow sometimes but she gets there and what about evenings what about them you dont always spend them at home either do you sometimes you have a night out with friends do i say with barney byars with ronald steele kinnoul stared at rebus appearing not to understand then he snapped his fingers christ you mean that night jesus the night he shook his head who told you never mind it must have been one or the other what about it i just thought you made an unlikely trio kinnoul smiled youre right there i dont know byars all that well hardly at all really but that day hed been in edinburgh and hed sewn up a deal a big deal we bumped into each other at the eyrie i was in the bar having a drink drowning my sorrows and he was on his way up to the restaurant somehow i got roped in him and the firm hed done the deal with after a while well it was good fun what about steele well barney was planning on taking these guys to a brothel he knew about but they werent interested they went their way and barney and me nipped into the strawman for another drink thats where we picked up ronnie he was a bit pissed too something to do with the lady in his life kinnoul was thoughtful for a moment anyway hes usually a bit of a boring fart but that night he seemed all right rebus was wondering did kinnoul know about steele and cathy it didnt look like it but then the man was an actor a pro and kinnoul was saying we all ended up going on to the illfamed house did you have a good time kinnoul seemed to think this an unusual question i suppose so he said i cant really remember too clearly oh thought rebus you can remember clearly enough you can remember all right but now kinnoul was looking through the hallway at cathys still figure you must think im a bit of a shite he said in a level tone youre probably right but christ the actor had run out of words he looked around the room looked out of the window at what weather willing would have been the view then looked towards the door again he exhaled noisily then shook his head did you tell the others what the prostitute told you now kinnoul looked startled i mean said rebus did you tell them what she said about gregor jack how the hell do you know about that kinnoul fell onto one of the chairs an inspired guess did you i suppose so he thought about it yes definitely well it was such a strange thing for her to say a strange thing for you to say too mr kinnoul kinnoul shrugged his huge shoulders just a laugh inspector i was a bit pissed i thought it would be funny to pretend to be gregor to be honest i was a bit hurt that she didnt recognize rab kinnoul look at the photos on the wall ive met all of them he was up on his feet again now studying the pictures of himself like he was in an art gallery and not seeing them for the thousandth the ten thousandth time bob wagner larry hagman i knew them all once the litany continued martin scorsese the top director absolutely the top john hurt robbie coltrane and eric idle holmes was motioning for rebus to come into the hall cathy kinnoul was coming round rab kinnoul stood in front of his photographs his mementoes the list of names sloshing around in his mouth take it easy holmes was telling cathy kinnoul how do you feel her speech was slurred to incoherence how many have you taken cathy rebus asked tell us how many she was trying to focus ive checked all the rooms holmes said no sign of any empty bottles well shes taken something maybe the doctor will know yes maybe rebus leaned down close to cathy kinnoul his mouth two inches from her ear gowk he said quietly tell me about suey the names registered with her but the question seemed not to you and suey rebus went on have you been seeing suey just the two of you eh like the old days have you and suey been seeing one another she opened her mouth paused then closed it again and slowly began to shake her head she mumbled something what was that gowk clearly this time rab mussn know he wont know gowk trust me he wont know she was sitting up now holding her head in one hand while the other hand rested on the floor so rebus persisted you and suey have been seeing one another eh gowk and suey she smiled drunkenly gow an suey she said enjoying the words gow an suey remember gowk remember the day before you found the body remember that wednesday that wednesday afternoon did suey come and see you did he gowk did suey pay a visit that wednesday wensay wensay she was shaking her head poor lizzie poor poor now she held her hand palm upwards gi me th knife she said rabll never know gi me th knife rebus glanced at holmes we cant let you do that gowk that would be murder she nodded thas right murder she said the final word very carefully enunciating each letter then repeated it cut off his head she said an theyll put me beside mack she smiled again the thought pleasing her and all the time rab kinnouls names were drifting from the other room best absolutely like to work with him again consummate professionalism and good old george cole too the old school yes the old school the old school mack cathy kinnoul was saying mack suey sexton beggar poor beggar the old school some school ties you just kept too long way after they should have been thrown out rebus telephoned barney byars the secretary put him through inspector came byars voice all energy and business i just cant shake you off can i youre too easy to catch rebus said byars laughed ive got to be he said otherwise the clients cant catch me i always like to make myself available now whats your beef this time its about an evening you spent not so long ago with rab kinnoul and ronald steele byars was able to substantiate the story in all but the most crucial details rebus explained about kinnoul coming downstairs and repeating what gail had said to him i dont remember that byars said i was well on by then mind so well on i think i stumped up for the three of us he chuckled suey had his usual excuse of being flat broke and rab was carrying not more than ten bar by then another chuckle see i always remember my sums especially when its money but youre sure you dont recall mr kinnoul telling you what the prostitute told him im not saying he didnt say it mind but no i cant for the life of me remember it which made it kinnouls word against byars memory the only thing for it was to talk to steele again rebus could call in on the way to patiences it was a long way round for a shortcut but it shouldnt take too long cathy kinnoul was another problem it didnt do to have knifewielding pillpoppers running around at large the family doctor summoned by holmes had listened to their story and suggested that mrs kinnoul be admitted to a hospital on the outskirts of the city would there be any criminal charges of course said holmes testily attempted murder for starters but rebus was thinking he was thinking of how badly cath kinnoul had been treated thinking too of all those obstruction charges he might be filing hector steele jack himself and most of all thinking of andrew macmillan hed seen what special hospitals did with the criminally insane cath kinnoul would be treated anyway so long as she underwent treatment what was the point of pressing a charge of attempted murder on her so he shook his head to brian holmes astonishment no no charges not if she was admitted straight away the doctor checked that the paperwork would be a mere formality and kinnoul who had come back to something like his senses by this time agreed to the whole thing in that case said the doctor she can be admitted today rebus made one more call to chief inspector lauderdale where the hell did you disappear to its a long story sir it usually is how did the meeting go it went listen john were formally charging william glass what the dean bridge victim had had intercourse just before she died forensics tell me the dnatest matches our man glass lauderdale paused but rebus said nothing dont worry john well start with the dean bridge murder but really just between us do you think youre getting anywhere really sir just between us i dont know well youd better get a move on otherwise im going to charge glass with mrs jack too ferrie and that solicitor are going to start asking awkward questions any minute now its on a knife edge john understand yes sir oh yes i understand all about knife edges believe me rebus didnt walk up to ronald steeles front door not straight away first he stood in front of the garage and peered in through a crack between the two doors steeles citroen was at home which presumably meant the man himself was at home rebus went to the door and pushed the bell he could hear it sounding in the hall halls he could write a book on them my night sleeping in a hallway the day i was almost stabbed in a hallway he rang again it was a loud and unpleasant bell not the kind you could easily ignore so he rang one more time then he tried the door it was locked he walked on to the little strip of grass running in front of the bungalow and pressed his face against the living room window the room was empty maybe hed just popped out for a pint of milk rebus tried the gate to the side of the garage the gate giving access to the back garden it too was locked he walked back to the front gate and stood beside it looking up and down the silent street then he checked his watch he could give it five minutes ten at most the last thing he felt like was sitting down to dinner with patience but he didnt want to lose her either quarter of an hour to get back to oxford terrace twenty minutes to be on the safe side yes he could still be there by seven thirty time enough well youd better get a move on why bother why not give glass his moment of infamy his second his famous victim why bother with anything not for the praise of a pat on the back not for the rightness of it maybe then from sheer stubbornness yes that would just about fit the bill someone was coming his car was pointing the wrong way but he could see in his rearview not a man but a woman nice legs carrying two carrier bags of shopping she walked well but she was tired it couldnt be what the he rolled down his window hello gill gill templer stopped stared smiled you know i thought i recognized that heap of junk ssh cars have feelings too he patted the steering wheel she put down her bags what are you doing here he nodded towards steeles house waiting to talk to someone who isnt going to show trust you what about you me i live here well next street on the right to be honest you knew id moved he shrugged i didnt realize it was round here she gave him an unconvinced smile no honest he said but now i am here can i give you a lift she laughed its only a hundred yards please yourself she looked down at her bags oh go on then he opened the door for her and she put the bags down on the floor squeezing her feet in beside them rebus started the car it spluttered wheezed died he tried again choke full out the car gasped whinnied then got the general idea like i said heap of junk thats why its behaving like this rebus warned temperamental like a thoroughbred horse but the field of an eggandspoon race could probably have beaten them over the distance finally they reached the house unscathed rebus looked out nice he said it was a doublefronted affair with bay windows either side of the front door there were three floors all told with a small and steep garden dissected by the stone steps which led from gate to doorway i havent got the whole house of course just the ground floor nice all the same thanks she pushed open the door and manoeuvred her bags out on to the pavement she gestured towards them vegetable stirfry interested it took him a moments eternity to decide thanks gill im tied up tonight she had the grace to look disappointed maybe another time then yes said rebus as she pushed the passenger door shut maybe another time the car crawled back along her road if it gives out on me he thought ill go back and take her up on her offer itll be a sign but the car actually began to sound healthier as it passed steeles bungalow there was still no sign of life so rebus kept going he was thinking of a set of weighing scales on one side sat gill templer on the other dr patience aitken the scales rose and fell while rebus did some hard thinking christ it was hard too he wished he had more time but the traffic lights were with him most of the way and he was back at patiences by half past i dont believe it she said as he walked into the kitchen i really dont believe you actually kept a date she was standing beside the microwave inside something was cooking rebus pulled her to him and gave her a wet kiss on the lips patience he said i think i love you she pulled back from him a little the better to look at him and theres not a drop of alcohol in the man either what a night for surprises well i think i should tell you that ive had a foul day and as a result im in a foul mood thats why were eating chicken she smiled and kissed him i think i love you she mimicked you should have seen the look on your face when you said that a picture of sheer puzzlement youre not exactly the last of the redhot romantics are you john rebus so teach me said rebus kissing her again i think said patience i think well have that chicken cold he was up early next morning more unusually he was up before patience herself who lay with a satisfied debauched look on her sleeping face and with her hair wild around her on the pillow he let lucky in and gave him a bigger than normal bowl of food then made tea and toast for himself and patience pinch me i must be dreaming she said when he woke her up she gulped at the tea then took a small bite from one buttered triangle rebus half refilled his own cup drained it and got up from the bed right he said im off what she looked at her clock night shift is it this week its morning patience and ive a lot on today he bent over her to peck her forehead but she pulled at his tie tugging him further down so that she could give him a salty crumbly kiss on the mouth see you later she asked count on it it would be nice to be able to but he was already on his way lucky came into the room and leapt on to the bed the cat was licking his lips me too lucky said patience me too he drove straight to ronald steeles bungalow the traffic was heavy coming into town but rebus was heading out it wasnt yet quite eight he didnt take steele for an early riser this was a grim anniversary two weeks to the day since liz jack was murdered time to get things straight steeles car was still in its garage rebus went to the front door and pressed the bell attempting a jaunty rhythm of rings a friend or the postman someone youd want to open your door to come on suey chopchop but there was no answer he peered through the letter box nothing he looked in through the living room window exactly as it had been yesterday evening the curtains hadnt even been pulled shut no sign of life i hope you havent done a runner rebus muttered though maybe it would be better if he had at least it would be an action of some kind a sign of fear or of something to hide he could ask the neighbours if theyd seen anything but a wall separated steeles bungalow from theirs he decided against it it might only serve to alert steele to rebuss interest an interest strong enough to bring him here at breakfast time instead he got back into the car and drove to suey books a hundredtoone shot this as hed suspected the shop was barred and meshed and padlocked rasputin lay asleep in the window rebus made a fist and pounded it against the glass the cats head shot up and it let out a sharp shocked yowl remember me said rebus grinning traffic was slower now treacle through the sieve of the road system he slipped down on to the cowgate to avoid the worst of it if steele couldnt be found there was only one thing for it hed have to change farmer watsons mind whats more hed have to do it this morning while the old boy was bristling with caffeine now there was a thought what time did that deli just off leith walk open well thank you john rebus shrugged we drink enough of your cofee thought it was time someone else did the change watson opened the bag and sniffed mmm freshly ground he started to tip the dark powder into his filter the machine was already full of water what kind did you say breakfast blend sir i think robustica and arabica something like that im not exactly an expert but watson waved the apology aside he put the jug in position and flipped the switch takes a couple he said sitting down behind his desk right john his hands together in front of him what can i do for you well sir its about gregor jack yes you know how you told me wed to help mr jack if possible how you felt hed perhaps been set up watson merely nodded well sir im close to proving not only that he was but who did it oh go on so rebus told his story the story of a chance meeting in a redlit bedroom and of three men what i was wondering was i know you said you couldnt divulge your source sir but was it one of them watson shook his head way off im afraid john mmm do you smell that the room was filling with how could rebus not smell it yes sir very nice so it wasnt it wasnt anyone who knows gregor jack if pro he stuttered to a halt cant wait for that coffee he said rather too eagerly you were about to say sir but what what providence provost prodigal problem provost no no not provost protestant proprietor a name or a title nothing john nothing i wonder if ive any clean cups a name or a title professor professor you werent about to mention a professor then watsons lips were sealed but rebus was thinking fast now professor costello for instance hes a friend of yours isnt he sir he doesnt know mr jack then watsons ears were turning red got you thought rebus got you got you got you that coffee was worth every last penny interesting though mused rebus that the professor would know about a brothel watson slapped the desk enough his light morning mood had vanished his whole face was red now except for two small white patches one on either cheek all right he said you might as well know it was professor costello who told me and how did the professor know he said he said he had a friend whod visited the place one night and now felt ashamed of course watson lowered his voice to a hiss there isnt any friend its the old chap himself he just cant bring himself to admit it well his voice rising again were all tempted some time arent we rebus thought of gill templer last night yes tempted indeed so i promised the professor id have the place closed down rebus was thoughtful and did you let him know when operation creeper was set for it was watsons turn to be thoughtful then he nodded but hes hes a professor of divinity he wouldnt have been the one to tip off the papers and he doesnt know gregor bloody jack but you told him date and time more or less why why did he need to know his friend the friend needed to know so he could warn anyone he knew from going there rebus leapt to his feet jesus christ sir he paused with respect but dont you see there was a friend there was someone who needed to be warned but not so they could stop their friends being caught so they could ensure gregor jack walked straight into the trap as soon as they knew when we were going in all they had to do was phone jack and tell him his sister was there they knew he couldnt not go and check it out for himself he tugged open the door where are you off to to see professor costello not that i need to not really but i want to hear him say the name i want to hear it for myself enjoy your coffee sir but watson didnt it tasted like charred wood too bitter too strong for some time now hed been wavering now he made the decision hed stop drinking coffee altogether it would be his penance just like inspector john rebus was his comforter good morning inspector morning sir not disturbing you professor costello waved his arm airily around the empty room not a student in edinburghs awake at this to them ungodly hour not the divinity students at any rate no inspector youre not disturbing me you got the books all right sir costello pointed towards his glassfronted bookshelves safe and sound the officer who delivered them said something about them being found abandoned something like that sir rebus glanced back at the door you havent had a proper lock fitted yet mea culpa inspector fear not ones on its way only i wouldnt like you to lose your books again point taken inspector sit down wont you coffee the hand this time was directed towards an evillooking percolator sitting smoking on a hotplate in a corner of the room no thanks sir bit early for me costello bowed his head slightly he slid into the comfortable leather chair behind his comfortable oaken desk rebus sat on one of the modern spindly metalframed chairs the other side of it so inspector social niceties dispensed with what can i do for you you gave some information to chief superintendent watson sir costello pursed his lips confidential information inspector at one time perhaps but it may help us with a murder inquiry surely not rebus nodded so you see sir that changes things slightly we need to know who your friend was the one who told you about the er i believe the phrase is hoorhoose almost poetic much nicer at any rate than brothel costello almost squirmed in his chair my friend inspector i did promise him murder sir id advise against withholding information oh yes agreed agreed but ones conscience was it ronald steele costellos eyes opened wide then you already know just an inspired guess sir youre a frequent customer in his shop arent you well i do like to browse and you were in his shop when he told you thats right it was a lunchtime vanessa his assistant she was on her break shes a student here actually lovely girl if only you knew thought rebus anyway yes ronald told me his little guilty secret hed been taken to this hoorhoose one night by some friends he really was very embarrassed about it all was he oh terribly he knew i knew superintendent watson and he wondered if i could pass word on about the establishment so we could close it down yes but he needed to know the night he was desperate to know his friends you see the ones whod taken him he wanted to warn them off you know mr steele is a friend of gregor jacks who the mp im sorry the name doesnt gregor jack costello frowned shook his head no hes been in all the newspapers really rebus sighed the real world it seemed stopped at the door to costellos office this was a lighter realm altogether he was almost startled by the sudden electronic twittering of the hightech telephone costello apologized and picked up the receiver yes speaking yes he is wait one moment please he held the receiver out towards rebus its for you inspector somehow rebus wasnt surprised hello the chief superintendent said id find you there it was lauderdale good morning to you too sir cut the crap john im just in and already a bit of the ceilings fallen off and missed my head by inches im not in the mood for it okay understood sir im only phoning because i thought youd be interested yes sir forensics didnt take long with those two glasses you found in mr ponds bathroom of course they didnt they had all the matchup prints they needed taken so as to eliminate people from deer lodge guess who they belong to lauderdale asked one set will be mrs jack the other set ronald steele there was silence on the other end of the telephone was i close asked rebus how the hell did you know what if i told you it was an inspired guess id tell you youre a liar get back here we need to talk right you are sir just one more thing what mr glass is he still on for the double the line went dead escort service the way rebus saw it well it didnt take too much brain activity once the name had been established the way he saw it ronald steele and elizabeth jack had been lovers probably for some time christ sir hugh was going to love this when it came out maybe nobody knew maybe everybody but gregor jack knew anyway liz jack decided to head north and steele joined her whenever he could deer lodge and back every day a superhuman effort no wonder steele looked ready to drop all the time deer lodge itself though was a tip a heap so they moved into ponds cottage only using deer lodge itself for fetching changes of clothes maybe liz jack had been fetching clean clothes when shed stopped and bought the sunday rags and found out all about her husbands apparently naughty night steele though had plans way above the occasional legover scenario he wanted liz he wanted her to himself the quiet ones always got intense about that sort of thing didnt they hed been making anonymous calls maybe and sending letters anything to throw a spanner in the works of the marriage anything to unsettle gregor maybe thats why liz had headed north to get away from it all steele saw his chance hed already been to the brothel and hed already discovered just who gail crawley was all it took was a halfway decent memory and maybe a question or two asked of the likes of cathy kinnoul ah cathy yes maybe steele was seeing her too but rebus doubted it was for anything but conversation and counselling there was that side to steele too which didnt do anything to stop him trying to strip gregor jack his lifelong friend ally in his bookshop allround good guy to strip him completely and utterly naked the brothel plan was simple and knifesharp find out the time of the planned raid a call to gregor jack and calls beforehand to the docklands dirtdiggers the setup and gregor jack shed his first layer did steele try to keep it from liz maybe maybe not he thought it would be the final screw in the marriagecoffin it nearly was but he couldnt be north with her all the time telling her how great they could be together what a shit gregor was et cetera et cetera and during the time she was alone liz jack wavered until finally she made up her mind not to leave gregor but to leave steele something like that she was unpredictable after all she was fire and they argued in his interview hed alluded to the argument itself she always accused me of not being enough fun and i never had enough money either so they argued and he stormed off leaving her in the layby alec corbies blue car had been a green car the green citroen bx steele had sped off only to return and continue the argument an argument which became violent violence which went a little too far the next bit was to rebuss mind the cleverest either that or the most fortuitous steele had to dump the body the first thing to do was to get it away from the highlands there were too many clues up there to the fact that theyd spent time together so he headed back towards edinburgh with her in the boot but what to do with her wait there had been another killing hadnt there a body dumped in a river he could make it look the same better still he could send her body out to sea so he headed for someplace he knew the hill above the kinnoul house hed walked up there with cathy so many times he knew the small road a road never used and he knew that even if the body were found the first suspect would be the dean bridge killer so at some point he gave her that blow to the head the blow so like the one administered to the dean bridge victim and the beautiful irony was his alibi for the afternoon was provided by gregor jack himself and thats how you see it is it the meeting was in watsons office watson lauderdale and rebus on the way in rebus had passed brian holmes i hear theres a meeting in the farmhouse youve got good hearing whats it about you mean youre not on the guest list brian rebus winked too bad ill try to bring you a doggiebag big of you rebus turned look brian the paints hardly dry on your promotion as it is relax take it easy if youre looking for a quick road to detective inspector go track down lord lucan meantime im expected elsewhere okay okay too cocky by half thought rebus but speaking of cocky he was doing a bit of strutting himself wasnt he sitting here in watsons office spouting forth while lauderdale looked worriedly towards his suddenly caffeinefree superior and thats how you see it is it the question was watsons rebus merely shrugged it sounds plausible said lauderdale rebus raised half an eyebrow having lauderdales support was a bit like locking yourself in with a starved alsatian what about mr glass asked watson well sir said lauderdale shifting a little in his seat psychiatric reports dont show him to be the most stable individual he lives in a sort of fantasy world you might say you mean he made it up very probably which brings us back to mr steele i think wed better have him in for a word hadnt we did you say you brought him in yesterday john thats right sir i thought we might give the boot of his car a onceover but mr lauderdale seemed convinced by steeles story and let him go the look on lauderdales face would remain long in rebuss memory man bites alsatian is that so said watson also seeming to enjoy lauderdales discomfort wed no reason to hold him then sir its only information received this morning which has allowed us all right all right so have we picked him up again hes not at home sir said rebus i checked last night and then again this morning both men looked at him watsons look said very efficient lauderdales look said you bastard well said watson wed better get a warrant out hadnt we i think theres quite enough that needs explaining by mr steele his cars still in its garage sir we could get forensics to take a look at it most probably hell have cleaned it but you never know forensics they loved rebus he was their patron saint right you are john said watson see to it will you he turned to lauderdale another cup of coffee theres plenty in the pot and you seem to be the only one drinking it strut strut strut he was the little red rooster he was the cock of the north hed felt it all along of course ronald steele suey who had once tried to commit suicide when found by a girl masturbating in his hotel room bound to be a bit screwed up who needed a psychology degree what rebus needed now was a combination of orienteering skills and oldfashioned manhunting his instincts told him that steele would have headed south leaving the car behind what use was it after all the police already had its description and licence number and hed known they were closing in or rather hed known rebus was closing in aint nothing but a bloodhound he sang to himself hed just phoned the hospital where cathy kinnoul was now a patient early days hed been told but shed had a peaceful night rab kinnoul however hadnt been near maybe this was understandable it could be that shed go for him with a broken water jug or try to strangle him with pyjama cord all the same kinnoul was as shitty as the rest of them gregor jack too risking all for a career in politics a career hed planned from birth it seemed marrying liz ferrie not for herself but for her father completely unable to control her so that he just stuffed her into a compartment dusting her off for photoshoots and the occasional public engagement yes shitty only one person to rebuss mind came out of this with anything like dignity intact and that person was a burglar the forensics team had come up with a match for the prints on the microwave julian kaymer hed swiped jamie kilpatricks keys and driven to deer lodge in the dead of night smashing the window to gain entry why to tidy away evidence of anything too scandalous which meant the cocainestained handmirror and two pairs of tights tied to a fourposter why simple to protect what he could of a friends reputation a dead friends reputation pathetic but noble too in a way stealing the microwave was outrageous really pc plod was supposed to put the whole thing down to kids smashing their way into an empty house on the offchance and making off not with the hifi always a favourite but with the microwave hed driven off with it then thrown it away only to have it found by the magpie himself alec corbie yes steele would be in london by now his shop operated in the sphere of cash there would have been some hidden somewhere perhaps quite a lot he might be on a flight out of heathrow or gatwick a train to the coast and the boat over to france trains and boats and planes somebody sounds happy it was brian holmes standing in the doorway to rebuss office rebus was seated at his desk feet resting on the desk itself hands behind his head mind if i come in or do we need to reserve tickets to touch your hem you leave my hem out of this sit down holmes was halfway to the chair when he tripped over a gash in the linoleum he put his hands out to save himself and found himself sprawled on rebuss desktop an inch from one of the shoes yes said rebus you may kiss them holmes managed something between a smile and a grimace this place really should be condemned he slumped into the chair mind out for the shoogly leg warned rebus any progress on steele not much holmes paused none at all really why didnt he take his car we know it too well remember i thought you were responsible for putting together that list everybody in the worlds car make colour and registration number oh no i forgot you delegated the work to a detective constable what was it for anyway rebus stared at him seriously im just a sergeant as youll recall nobody tells me anything lauderdale was vaguer even than usual mrs jacks bmw was parked in a layby explained rebus that much i knew so was another car an eye witness said it might be blue it wasnt it was green that reminds me said holmes i meant to ask you what was she waiting around for who mrs jack at that layby what was she hanging around there for while rebus considered this holmes thought of another question what about mr jacks car rebus sighed what about it well i didnt get a good look at it that night you dragged me out there i mean it was in the garage and there were lights to the front and back of the house but not to the side but you did say to have a snoop the side door to the garage was open so i wandered in too dark really and i couldnt find the light switch jesus christ brian get on with it well i was only going to ask what about the car in jacks garage it was blue at least i think it was blue this time rebus rubbed his temples its white he explained slowly its a white saab but holmes was shaking his head blue he said it could never have been white it was blue and it was an escort definitely an escort rebus stopped rubbing his temples what there was some stuff on the passenger seat too i peered in through the side window all that bumpf they give you with hire cars that sort of thing yes the more i think back on it the clearer it comes a blue ford escort and whatever else was in that garage there certainly wasnt room to swing a saab no rooster now no strutting cock no bloodhound but rather cowed sheepish with his tail between his legs rebus took holmes and his story to watson first and watson called for lauderdale i thought lauderdale said to rebus you told us mr jacks car was white it is white sir youre sure it was a hire car watson asked holmes holmes thought again before nodding this was serious he was where he wanted to be in the thick of things but he was realizing too that here one mistake one slightest error could send him to limbo we can check said rebus how phone gregor jacks house and ask and warn him off we dont have to talk to jack ian urquhart or helen greig would know they could still tip him off maybe of course theres another possibility the car brian saw could have been urquharts or even miss greigs miss greig doesnt drive said holmes and urquharts cars nothing like the one i saw remember theyve all been checked well whatever said watson lets tread carefully eh get on to the hire firms first what about steele rebus asked until we know what were dealing with we still want to talk to him agreed said lauderdale he seemed aware that watson was back in control at least for now well said watson what are you all waiting for jump to it they jumped there werent that many hire firms in edinburgh and the third call brought a result yes mr jack had hired a car for a few days yes a blue ford escort did he give any reason for the hire yes his own car was going in for a service and thought rebus he needed a change of cars so he could escape the attentions of the press christ hadnt rebus put the idea into his head himself your cars out there being photographed everyonell know what it looks like so jack had hired another car for a few days just to help him get around incognito rebus stared at the office wall stupid stupid stupid he would have banged his head against the wall if he could have been sure it wouldnt fall down it had been a devil of a job the man from the hire firm said the client had wanted his carphone transferred from his own car to the hire car of course how else could liz jack have contacted him he had been on the move all day hadnt he had the hire car been cleaned since its return naturally a full valet service what about the boot the boot the boot had it been cleaned too a bit of a wipe maybe where was the car now on hire again a london businessman a fortyeighthour hire only and due back by six oclock it was now a quarter to five two cid men would be waiting to drive it from the carhire offices to the police pound were there any forensics people available at fettes hq stupid stupid stupid not the same car returning to the layby but another car holmes had asked the question what had liz jack been waiting for shed been waiting for her husband she must have telephoned him from the box in the layby shed just had the argument with steele too upset to drive herself home maybe so hed told her to wait there and hed pick her up he had a free afternoon anyway hed pick her up in the blue escort but when hed arrived there had been another argument about what it could have been anything what would it take to smash the ice that was gregor jack the original newspaper story the police finding evidence of his wifes lifestyle shame and embarrassment the thought of further public scrutiny of losing his precious constituency there was enough there to be going on with okay said lauderdale so weve got the car lets see if jacks at home he turned to rebus you phone john rebus phoned helen greig answered hello miss greig its inspector rebus hes not here she blurted out i havent seen him all day or yesterday come to that but hes not in london we dont know where he is he was with you yesterday morning wasnt he he came into the station yes ians going up the wall what about the saab its not here either hold on she placed her hand over the mouthpiece but not very effectively its that inspector rebus he heard her say then a frantic hiss dont tell him anything and helen again too late ian followed by a sort of snarl she removed her hand miss greig said rebus how has gregor seemed same as you might expect of a man whose wifes been murdered and hows that depressed hes been sitting around in the living room just staring into space not saying much like he was thinking funny the only time i got a conversation out of him was when he asked me about last years holiday the one you went on with your mum yes remind me where did you go again down the coast she said eyemouth round there yes of course jack had uttered the name of the first town that had come to mind then hed pumped helen for details so he could prop up his rickety story he put down the receiver well asked watson his cars gone and gregor jack with it all that stuff he told us about eyemouth eye wash more like he got it all from his secretary she went there on holiday last year the room was stuffy the late afternoon outside preparing itself for thunder watson spoke first what a mess yes said lauderdale holmes nodded he was a relieved man more than that inwardly he was rejoicing the hire car had turned out to be fact hed proved his worth what now im just thinking said rebus about that layby liz jack has an argument with steele she tells him shes going back to her husband steele buggers off whats the next he hears of her that shes dead answered holmes rebus nodded throwing all those books around the shop in his grief and his anger not only dead but murdered and the last he saw of her she was waiting for gregor so said watson he must know jack did it is that what youre suggesting you think lauderdale said steeles run off to protect gregor jack i dont think anything of the sort said rettus but if gregor jack is the murderer then ronald steele has known for some time that he is why hasnt he done anything think about it how could he come to the police he was in way too deep himself it would mean explaining everything and explaining it would make him if anything a bigger suspect than gregor jack himself so what would he do rebus shrugged he might try persuading jack to come forward but that would mean admitting to jack that exactly that he was elizabeth jacks lover what would you do in jacks position holmes dared to supply the answer id kill him id kill ronald steele rebus sat all that evening in patiences living room an arm around her as they both watched a video a romantic comedy only there wasnt much romance and precious little comedy you knew from reel one that the secretary would go off with the bucktoothed student and not with her bloodsucking boss but you kept on watching anyway not that he was taking much of it in he was thinking about gregor jack about the person hed seemed to be and the person he really was you peeled away layer after layer stripped the bone and beyond and never found the truth strip jack naked a card game also known as beggar my neighbour patience was a card game too he stroked her hair her forehead thats nice patience was a game easily won the film rolled past him another foil had entered the picture a bighearted con man rebus had yet to meet a con man in real life who was anything but the most predatory shark what was the phrase theyd steal your false teeth and drink the water out of the glass well mabye this con man was in with a chance the secretary was interested but she was loyal to her boss too and he was doing everything short of whipping his sausage out and slapping it on her desk a penny for them theyre not worth it patience theyd find steele theyd find jack why couldnt he relax he kept thinking of a set of clothes and a note left on a beach stonehouse lucan had done it hadnt he disappeared without trace it wasnt easy but all the same the next thing he knew patience was shaking him by the shoulder wake up john time for bed hed been asleep for an hour the con man or the student he asked neither she said the boss changed his ways and gave her a partnership in the firm now come on partner she held her hands out to help him up on to his feet after all tomorrow is another day another day another dolour thursday two weeks since theyd found elizabeth jacks body now all they could do was wait and hope no more bodies turned up rebus picked up his office phone it was lauderdale the chief supers bitten the bullet he told rebus were holding a press conference putting out wanteds on both of them steele and jack does sir hugh know yet i wouldnt want to be the one who tells him he marches in here with his soninlaw not knowing the bugger killed his daughter no i wouldnt want to be the one who tells him am i supposed to be there of course and bring holmes too after all hes the one who spotted the car the line went dead rebus stared at the receiver alsatian bites man after all spotted it and told nell about it all last night repeating the story adding missed details hardly able to sit down until shed screeched at him to stop or else shed go off her head that calmed him down a little but not much you see nell if theyd told me earlier if theyd let me in on the whole story of the car colours of why they were needed well wed have nailed him all the sooner wouldnt we i dont want to but really i blame john it was him who i thought you said it was lauderdale who gave you the job in the first place yes true but even so john should have shut up for gods sake just shut up mind you youre right laud shutup he shut up and now here he was at the press conference and there was inspector gill templer who had such a rapport with the press handing out sheets of paper the official release and generally making sure that everyone knew what was going on and rebus of course looking the same as ever which was to say tired and suspicious watson and lauderdale hadnt made their entrance yet but would do so soon well brian said rebus quietly reckon theyll promote you to inspector for this no what then you look like a kid whos about to get the school prize come on be fair we all know you did most of the work yes but you stopped me haring after the wrong man so so now i owe you a favour rebus grinned i hate owing favours ladies and gentlemen came gill templers voice if youll find yourselves a seat we can start a moment later watson and lauderdale entered the room watson was first to speak i think you all know why weve called this conference he paused were looking for two men we think may be able to help us with a certain inquiry a murder inquiry the names are ronald adam steele and gregor gordon jack the local evening paper had it in by its lunchtime edition the radio stations were broadcasting the names in their hourly news slots the early evening tv news carried the story the usual questions were being asked to which the usual no comments were being appended but the phone call itself came only at half past six the call was from dr frank forster id have known sooner inspector only we dont like to let the patients listen to the news it just upsets them its only when i was getting ready to go home that i turned on the radio in my office rebus was tired rebus was terribly terribly tired what is it dr forster its your man jack gregor jack he was here this afternoon he was visiting andrew macmillan hothead it was nine that evening when rebus reached duthil hospital andrew macmillan was sitting in forsters office arms folded waiting hello again he said hello mr macmillan there were five of them two nurses dr forster macmillan and rebus the nurses stood behind macmillans chair their bodies less than two inches from his weve sedated him forster had explained to rebus he may not be as talkative as usual but he should stay calm i heard about what happened last time nothing happened last time dr forster he just wanted to have a normal conversation whats wrong with that macmillan looked on the verge of sleep his eyes were heavylidded his smile fixed he unfolded his arms and rested the hands delicately on his knees reminding rebus at that moment of mrs corbie inspector rebus wants to ask you about mr jack explained forster thats right said rebus resting against the edge of the desk there was a chair for him but he was stiff after the drive i was wondering why he visited its unusual after all isnt it its a first corrected macmillan they should put up a plaque when i saw him come in i thought he must be here to open an extension or something but no he just walked right up to me his hands were moving now carving air his eyes held by the movements they made walked right up to me and he said he said hello mack just like that like wed seen one another the day before like we saw one another every day what did you talk about old friends yes old friends old friendships wed always be friends he told me we couldnt not be friends we went back all the way yes all the way back all of us suey and gowk beggar and me bilbo tampon sexton blake friends are important thats what he said i told him about gowk about how she visited sometimes about the money she gives this place he didnt know about any of that he was interested he works too hard though you can see that he doesnt look healthy any more not enough sunlight have you ever seen the house of commons hardly any windows they work away in there like moles did he say anything else i asked him why he never answered my letters do you know what he said he said he never even received them he said hed take it up with the post office but i know who it is he turned to forster its you dr forster youre not letting out any of my mail youre steaming off the stamps and using them for yourself well be warned gregor jack mp knows all about it now somethingll be done now he remembered something and turned quickly to rebus did you touch the earth for me rebus nodded i touched the earth for you macmillan nodded too satisfied how did it feel inspector it felt fine funny its something ive always taken for granted never take anything for granted inspector said macmillan he was calming a little all the same you could see him fighting against the soporifics in his bloodstream fighting for the right to get angry to get to get mad i asked him about liz he said he told me shes the same as ever but i didnt believe that im sure their marriage is in trouble incompatible my wife and i were just the same his voice trailed off he swallowed laid his hands flat against his knees again and studied them liz was never one of the pack he should have married gowk only kinnoul got to her first he looked up now theres a man who needs treatment if gowk knew what she was about shed have him see a psychiatrist all those roles hes played bound to have an effect arent they ill tell gowk next time i see her i havent seen her for a while rebus shifted his weight a little did beggar say anything else mack anything about where he was headed or why he was here macmillan shook his head then he sniggered headed did you say headed he chuckled to himself for a few moments then stopped as abruptly as hed started he just wanted to let me know we were friends he laughed quietly as if i needed reminding and one other thing guess what he wanted to know guess what he asked after all these years what he wanted to know what id done with her head rebus swallowed forster was licking his lips and what did you tell him mack i told him the truth i told him i couldnt remember he brought the palms of his hands together as if in prayer and touched the fingertips to his lips then he closed his eyes the eyes were still closed when he spoke is it true about suey what about him mack that hes emigrated that he might not be coming back is that what beggar told you macmillan nodded opening his eyes to gaze at rebus he said suey might not be coming back the nurses had taken macmillan back to his ward and forster was putting on his coat getting ready to lock up and see rebus out to the car park when the telephone rang at this time of night it might be for me said rebus he picked up the receiver hello it was ds knox from dufftown inspector rebus i did as you said and had someone stake out deer lodge and a white saab drove in through the gateway not ten minutes ago there were two cars parked by the side of the road one of them was blocking the entrance to deer lodges long driveway rebus got out of his own car ds knox introduced him to detective constable wright and constable moffat weve already met rebus said shaking moffats hand oh yes said knox how could i forget youve been keeping us so busy so what do you think sir rebus thought it was cold cold and wet it wasnt raining now but any minute it might be on again youve called for reinforcements knox nodded as many as can be mustered well we could wait it out till they arrive yes rebus was sizing knox up he didnt seem the kind of man who enjoyed waiting or he said we could go in three of us one standing guard on the gate after all hes either got a corpse or a hostage in there if steeles alive the sooner we go in the better chance hes got so what are we waiting for rebus looked to dc wright and constable moffat who nodded approval of the plan its a long walk up to the house mind knox was saying but if we take a car hes bound to hear it we can take one up so far and walk the rest suggested moffat that way the exit roads good and blocked i wouldnt fancy wandering up that bloody road in the dark only to have him come racing towards me in that car of his okay agreed well take a car rebus turned to dc wright you stay on the gate son moffat here knows the layout of the house wright looked snubbed but moffat perked up at the news right said rebus lets go they took knoxs car leaving moffats parked across the entrance knox had taken one look at rebuss heap and then shaken his head best take mine eh he drove slowly rebus in the front beside him moffat in the back the car had a nice quiet engine but all the same all around was silence any noise would travel rebus actually began to pray for a sudden storm thunder and rain for anything that would give them soundcover i enjoyed that book said moffat his head just behind rebuss what book fish out of water christ id forgotten all about it cracking story said moffat how much further asked knox t cant remember theres a bend to the left then another to the right said moffat we better stop after the second one its only another couple of hundred yards they parked opening the doors and leaving them open knox produced two large rubber torches from the glove compartment i was a cub scout he explained be prepared and all that he handed one torch to rebus and kept the other moffat here eats his carrots he doesnt need one right whats the plan now lets see how things look at the house then ill tell you fair enough they set off in a line after about fifty yards rebus turned off his torch it was no longer necessary all the lights in and around the lodge seemed to be burning they stopped just before the clearing peering through what cover there was the saab was parked outside the front door its boot was open rebus turned to moffat remember theres a back door circle around and cover it right the constable moved off the road and into the forest disappearing from sight meantime lets check the car first then take a look through the windows knox nodded they left their cover and crept forwards the boot itself was empty nothing on the cars back seat either lights were on in the living room and the front bedroom but there was no sign of anyone knox pointed with his torch towards the door he tried the handle the door opened a crack he pushed it a little further the hall was empty they waited a moment listening there was a sudden eruption of noise drums and guitar chords knox jumped back rebus rested a calming hand on his shoulder then retreated to look again through the living room window the stereo he could see its leds pulsing the cassette player probably on automatic replay a tape had been winding back while theyd approached the house now it was playing early stones paint it black rebus nodded hes in there he said to himself my secret vice inspector one of many at any rate it meant he might not have heard the cars approach and now the music was on again he might not even hear them entering the house so they entered moffat was covering the kitchen so rebus headed directly upstairs knox behind him there was fine white powder on the wooden banister leftovers from the dusting the house had been given by forensics up the stairs and on to the landing what was that smell what was that smell petrol whispered knox yes petrol the bedroom door was closed the music seemed louder up here than downstairs thumpthumpthump of drum and bass clashing guitar and sitar and those cheesegrater vocals petrol rebus leaned back and kicked in the door it swung open and stayed open rebus took in the scene gregor jack standing there and against the wall a bound and gagged figure its face puffy forehead bloody ronald steele gagged no not exactly a gag scraps of paper seemed to fill his mouth scraps torn from the sunday papers on the bed all the stories which had started with his plotting well jack had made him eat his words petrol the can lay empty on its side the room was reeking steele looked to have been drenched in the stuff or was it just sweat and gregor jack standing there his face at first full of mischief but then turning turning softening softening into shame shame and guilt guilt at being caught all of this rebus took in a second but it took less time than that for jack to strike the match and drop it the carpet caught immediately and then jack was flying forwards knocking rebus off balance powering past knox heading for the stairs the flames were moving too fast too fast to do anything rebus grabbed steele by his feet and started to drag him towards the door dragging him of necessity through the fire itself if steele was soaked in petrol well no time to think about that but it was sweat that was all the fire licked at him but it didnt suddenly engulf the body out into the hallway knox was already pounding down the stairs following jack the bedroom was an inferno now the bed like a kind of pyre in the centre of it rebus went back and glanced in the mounted cows head above the bed had caught and was crackling he grabbed the door handle and dragged the door shut thanking god he hadnt kicked it off its hinges in the first place it was a struggle but he managed to haul steele to his feet blood was caked on the face and one eye had swollen shut the other eye had tears in it paper was spilling from his mouth as he tried to speak rebus made a perfunctory attempt at loosening the knots it was baler twine and tight as tight could be christ his head was hurting he couldnt think why he hefted the taller man on to his shoulder and started down the stairs at some point steele disgorged the paper from his mouth his first words were your hairs on fire so it was at the nape of the neck rebus patted his head with his free hand the back of his head was crispy like strands of breakfast cereal and something else it was hurting like blazes they were at the bottom of the stairs now rebus dumped steele on to the floor then straightened up there was a tidal sound in his ears and his eyes fogged over for a moment his heart was thumping in sympathy with the rock music ill get a knife from the kitchen he said entering the kitchen he saw that the back door was wide open there were noises from outside shouts but indistinct then a figure stumbled into view it was moffat he was holding both hands to his nose covering the nose like a protective mask blood was pouring down his wrists and chin he lifted the mask away to speak the bastard butted me flecks of blood flew from his mouth and his nostrils butted me you could tell he thought it wasnt fair play youll live said rebus the sergeants gone after him rebus pointed to the hall behind him steeles in there find a knife and cut him loose then both of you get out he pushed past moffat and out of the back door light from the kitchen flooded the immediate scene but beyond that was darkness hed dropped his torch up in the bedroom and now cursed the fact then eyes adjusting to the changing light he ran across the small clearing and into the forest beyond more haste less speed he moved carefully past trunks and bushes and saplings briars tugged at him but they were a minor nuisance his main worry was that he didnt know where he was heading the ground was sloping upwards that much he could tell as long as he kept moving upwards with it he wouldnt be chasing his own tail his foot caught on something and he fell against a tree the breath left him his shirt was wringing wet his eyes stinging from a mixture of recent smoke and present sweat he paused he listened jack dont be stupid jack it was knox up ahead a good distance ahead but not impossible rebus took a deep breath and started walking miraculously he came out of the forest and into a larger clearing the slope seemed steeper here the ground sprawling with bracken and gorse and other low spiky plants he caught a sudden flash of light knoxs torch way over to the right of him and slightly uphill rebus began jogging lifting his legs high to avoid the worst of the undergrowth all the same something kept tearing at his trouserlegs and his ankles stinging and scratching then there were patches of short grass areas where quicker progress was possible or would have been possible if hed been fitter and younger ahead of him the torch moved in a circle the meaning was clear knox had lost his quarry instead of continuing to head for the beam of light rebus swung away from it if it were possible for only two men to fan out then thats what rebus was trying to ensure they did widening the arc of the search he came to the top of the rise and the ground levelled out he got the feeling that in daytime it would make a bleak picture there was nothing here but stunted wilderness hardly fit for the hardiest sheep way ahead a shadow rose into the sky some hill range or other the wind which had dried his shirt but chilled him to the marrow now dropped jesus his head was hurting like sunburn but a hundred times worse he stared up at the sky the outlines of the clouds were visible the weather was clearing a sound had replaced the whistling of the wind in his ears the sound of running water it grew louder as he moved forwards he had lost knoxs torchlight now and was conscious of being alone conscious too that if he strayed too far he might not find his way back a route wrongly taken could leave him heading towards nothing but hill and forest he glanced back the line of trees was still just about visible though the house lights beyond were not jack jack knoxs voice seemed miles away rebus decided that he would skirt round towards it if gregor jack was out there let him freeze to death the rescue services would find him tomorrow the running water was much closer now and the ground beneath his feet was becoming rockier the vegetation sparse the water was somewhere below him he stopped again the shapes and shades in front of him they didnt make sense it was as if the land were folding in on itself just then a huge chunk of cloud moved away from the moon the large nearly full moon there was light now and rebus saw that he was standing not four feet from a sheer drop of five or six yards a drop into a dark twisting river there was a noise to his right he turned his head towards it a figure was staggering forwards bent over nearly double from exhaustion its arms swinging loose and almost touching the ground an ape he thought at first he looks just like an ape gregor jack was panting hoarsely almost moaning from effort he wasnt watching where he was going all he knew was that he had to keep moving gregor the figure wheezed the head jerking up it came to a stop gregor jack rose to his full height arching his head to the sky he lifted his tired arms and rested his hands on his waist for all the world like a runner at the end of his race one hand went instinctively to his hair tidying it back into place then he bent forwards and put his hands on his knees and the hair flopped forwards again but his breathing was becoming steadier eventually he straightened up again rebus saw that he was smiling showing his perfect teeth he began shaking his head and chuckling rebus had heard the sound before from people whod lost lost everything from their freedom to a big bet or a game of fiveaside they were laughing at circumstance gregors laughter collapsed into a cough he slapped at his chest then looked at rebus and smiled again then sprang rebuss instinct was to dodge but jack was moving away from him and both of them knew precisely where he was headed as his foot touched the last inch of earth he leapt out into the air jumping feet first a couple of seconds later came the sound of his body hitting the water rebus toed his way to the edge of the rock and looked down but the cloud was closing in again overhead the moonlight was lost there was nothing to see making their way back to deer lodge there was no need for knoxs torch the flames lit up the surrounding countryside glowing ash landed on the trees as they made their way through the woods rebus ran his fingers over the back of his head the skin was stinging but he got the feeling shock might have set in the pain wasnt quite so bad as before his ankles stung too thistles probably hed run through what had turned out to be a field full of them there was no one near the house moffat and steele were waiting by knoxs car how good a swimmer is he rebus asked steele beggar steele was massaging his untethered arms cant swim a stroke we all learned at school but his mum used to give him a note excusing him why steele shrugged she was scared hed catch verrucas hows the head inspector i wont need a haircut for a while what about jack moffat asked he wont be needing one either they searched for gregor jacks body the following morning not that rebus was there to participate he was in hospital and feeling dirty and unshaven except for his head if you have a problem with baldness one senior doctor told him you could always wear a toupee till it grows back or a hat your scalp will be sensitive too so try to keep out of the sun sun what sun but there was sun during his time off work there was plenty of it he stayed indoors stayed underground reading book after book emerging for brief forays to the royal infirmary to have his dressings changed i could do that for you patience had told him never mix business and pleasure was rebuss enigmatic response in fact there was a nurse up at the infirmary who had taken a shine to him and he to her ach it wouldnt go anywhere it was just a bit of flirting he wouldnt hurt patience for the world holmes visited always with a dozen cans of something gassy hiya baldie was the perennial greeting even when the skinhead had become a suedehead the suedehead longer still whats the news asked rebus apart from the fact that gregor jacks body had still not been recovered the big news was that the farmer was off the booze after having been visited by the lord at some revivalist baptist meeting its communion wine only from now on said holmes mind you pointing to rebuss head for a while there i thought maybe you were going to go buddhist on us i might yet said rebus i might yet the media clung to the jack story clung to the idea that he might still be alive rebus wondered about that too more he still wondered why jack had killed elizabeth ronald steele could shed no light on the problem apparently jack had spoken hardly a word to him all the time hed held him captive well that was steeles story whatever had been said it wasnt going any further all of which left rebus with scenarios with guesswork he played out the scene time after time in his head jack arriving at the layby and arguing with elizabeth maybe shed told him she wanted a divorce maybe the argument was over the brothel story or maybe thered been something else all steele would say was that when hed left her shed been waiting for her husband i thought about hanging around and confronting him but steele shrugged cowardice its not doing something wrong thats the problem inspector its getting caught wouldnt you agree but if you had stayed steele nodded i know maybe liz would have told gregor to bugger off and have stuck with me instead maybe theyd both still be alive if steele hadnt fled from the layby if gail jack hadnt come north in the first place what then rebus was in no doubt it would have worked out some other way not necessarily any less painful a way fire and ice and skeletons in the closet he wished he could have met elizabeth jack just once even though he had the feeling they wouldnt have got on there was one more news story it started as another rumour but the rumour turned out to be a leak and the leak was followed by notification great london road was to undergo a programme of repair and refurbishment which means thought rebus i move in with patience to all intents he already had you dont have to sell your flat she told him you could always rent it rent it to students your streets half full of them as it is this was true you saw the migration in the morning down towards the meadows carrying their satchels and ringbinders and supermarket carriers back in the late afternoon or late night laden with books and ideas the notion appealed if he rented out his flat he could pay patience something towards living here with her youre on he said he was back at work one full day when great london road police station caught fire the building was razed to the ground ian rankin bestselling crimewriter
