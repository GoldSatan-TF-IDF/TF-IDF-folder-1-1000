alex scarrow day of the predator chapter mumbai india theyd heard the rumbling coming towards them down the echoing stairwell like a locomotive train then all of a sudden it was pitch black the air thick with dust and smoke sal vikram thought she was going to choke on the grit and particles of brick plaster she was sucking in through her nose clogging her throat and the back of her mouth with a thick chalky paste it felt like an eternity before it was clear enough to see the emergency wall light in the stairwell once more by its dim amber light she could see the lower flight of stairs was completely blocked by rubble and twisted metal spars above them the stairwell theyd been clambering down only moments earlier was crushed by the collapsed floors above she saw an extended arm emerging from the tangle of beams and crumbling breezeblocks an arm chalkwhite perfectly still reaching down to her as if pleading to be held or shaken were trapped whispered her mother sal looked to her then to her father he shook his head vigorously dust cascading off his thin hair no we are not we dig he looked at sal thats what we do we dig right saleena she nodded mutely he turned to the others trapped on the emergency stairwell along with them yes he said we must dig we cant wait for rescue her father could have said more could have completed that sentence could have said what they were all thinking that if the skyscraper had collapsed down to this floor there was no reason why it wasnt soon to fold in on itself all the way down sal looked around she recognized faces despite them all being painted ghostwhite with dust mr and mrs kumar from two apartments along the chaudhrys with their three young sons mr joshipura a business man like her father but single enjoyed a string of girlfriends tonight presumably hed been on his own and another man standing at the back of the stairwell beneath the wall light she didnt recognize him if we move things we may cause more of it to collapse said mrs kumar sals mother placed a hand on her husband she is right hari hari vikram turned to look at them all some of you are old enough to remember yes remember what happened to the americans in new york their twin towers sal remembered the footage something theyd been shown in history class both of those tall magnificent buildings sliding down into the earth and disappearing among billowing dark grey clouds heads nodded everyone old enough remembered but none of them stepped forward as if to press the issue a metal spar above creaked and slid releasing a small avalanche of dust and debris down on to them if we just wait here we die shouted her father they will come replied mr joshipura the firemen will soon no im afraid they wont she turned towards the voice the old man she hadnt recognized had finally said something im afraid they wont come for you he repeated his voice softer this time he sounded like a westerner english or american and unlike everyone else he wasnt coated in dust they wont have time this building has less than three minutes before the support struts on the floor beneath us give way combined with the weight of the collapsed floors above itll be enough for palace tower to go all the way down he looked around at them the wide eyes of the adults the wider eyes of the children im truly sorry but none of you are going to survive the heat in the stairwell was increasing a floor below the flames had taken a firm hold their heat softening the steel girders of the skyscraper deep groans rippled and echoed around them hari vikram studied the stranger for a moment the fact that he was the only one not coated in a thick layer of chalky dust wasnt wasted on him wait you are clean how did you get in here is there another way through the man shook his head no but you were not with us before the floor collapsed there must be some way i have only just arrived replied the man and i must leave soon we really dont have much time sals mother stepped towards him leave how can you can you help us i can help only one of you his eyes rested on sal you saleena vikram sal felt every pair of eyes in the stairwell settle on her take my hand said the man who are you asked her father im your daughters only way out if she takes my hand she lives if she doesnt she will die along with the rest of you one of the young boys began to cry sal knew him shed babysat the chaudhry boys he was nine and terrified clutching his favourite soft toy a oneeyed bear tightly in both hands as if the bear was his ticket out another deep moan from one of the skyscrapers structural support bars echoed through the small space on the stairwell like the mournful call of a dying whale or the stress vibration of a sinking ship the stale air around them already hot was becoming almost too painful to inhale we have just over two minutes said the man the heat of the fire is causing the buildings framework to deform palace tower will collapse directly in on itself at first then sideways into the mall below five thousand people will be dead a hundred and twenty seconds from now and tomorrow the news will be all about the terrorists who caused this who who are you asked her father again the man he looked old perhaps in his fifties or sixties stepped forward through the crowd his hand extended towards saleena we dont have time you have to take my hand he said her father blocked his path who are you hhow did you get through to us the old man turned to him im sorry there is no time just know that i arrived here and i can leave just as easily how how is unimportant i simply can and i can take just your daughter only your daughter with me the old man looked down at a watch on his wrist now there really is little time left a minute and a half sal watched her fathers taut face his mind working with businesslike efficiency no time for hows and whys the flicker of fire was coming up from the blocked stairwell below them sending dancing shadows through the dustfilled air hari vikram stepped aside take her then you must take her sal looked up at the old man frightened at his strangeness reluctant to offer her hand to him not that she believed in anything beyond this world not hindu gods not angels or demons but he seemed not of this world somehow an apparition a ghost her father angrily snatched at her hand saleena you must go with him she looked at her father her mother why ccant we all go the old man shook his head only you saleena im sorry why she realized tears were streaming down her cheeks tracing dark tracks on her chalky face youre special said the old man that is why please you must take my boys too called out mrs chaudhry the old man turned to her i cant i wish i could but i cant pleeease theyre so young younger than this girl they have their whole lives im sorry its not my choice i can only take saleena sal felt her fathers hands on her shoulders he pushed her roughly forward towards the stranger you take her you take her now dadda no you take her now no not they heard a deep rumble and felt the floor trembling beneath their feet we have only seconds said the old man hurry saleena her father screamed you go dadda she cried she turned to her mum please i cant the old man stretched forward and grasped hold of her hand he pulled her towards him but she found herself instinctively squirming and twisting her hand to escape his tight grip no she screamed the deep rumbling increased in volume the floor shuddering and cascades of dust and grit filled the air around them tumbling down from above this is it the old man said time has come saleena i can save your life if you come with me she looked at him it seemed madness that he could but somehow she believed him your parents want this too his eyes so intense so old yes yelled her father above the growing roar please take her now beside his small frame her mother was screaming stretching out her hands to hold her one last time her father grabbed her held her back no my love she must go mrs chaudhry pushed her boys at the old man please take their hands too take their hands the floor shook beneath their feet lurching to one side sal suddenly felt lightheaded as if she was free falling this is it its falling then the floor suddenly fractured beneath their feet revealing an ocean of churning roiling flames like gazing down into hell itself and the last thing she recalled was seeing that oneeyed bear tumbling down through a large split in the stairwells floor into the fire below chapter new york sal sat upright in her bunk gasping for breath feeling her cheeks wet with tears the nightmare again it was quiet and still in the archway she could hear maddy snoring on the bunk below and liam whimpering nonsensical words in his soft irish accent as he stirred restlessly on the bunk opposite a muted lamp glowed softly from across the archway lighting their wooden dinner table and the odd assortment of old armchairs around it leds blinked among the bank of computer equipment across the way hard drives whirring one of the monitors remained on she could see the computer system was doing a routine defrag and datafile tidying it never slept not it not any more the computer wasnt it any more it was bob unable to go back to sleep she clambered off the top bunk maddy twitched in her sleep and liam also seemed to be unsettled maybe they too were reliving their last moments liams sinking titanic maddys doomed airliner the nightmares came all too often she tiptoed across the archway barefoot on the cold concrete floor and sat down in one of the swivel chairs tucking her feet under her and sitting on them for warmth she grabbed the mouse and opened a dialogue box her fingernails clacked softly on the keyboard hey bob is this maddy no its sal it is am you cannot sleep sal nightmares are you recalling your recruitment recruitment thats what the old man foster had called it like shed had any real choice in the matter life or death take my hand or be mashed to pulp amid a crumbling skyscraper she shuddered great fragging choice yeah my recruitment you have my sympathy sal thanks she spoke softly into the desk mic too lazy to tap out any more anyway the clicketyclick of the keyboard echoing through the archway was far more likely to disturb the others than her speaking quietly i miss them so much bob you miss your family mum and dad she sighed it seems like years ago you have been in the team time cycles days precisely sal time cycles the twoday time bubble that played out and reset for them constantly keeping them and their field office in and september while the world outside moved on as normal outside outside was new york brooklyn to be more precise streets she was now getting to know so well even the people she had conversations with people who were never going to remember her the chinese laundromat lady the iranian man running the grocery store on the corner every time they spoke it was for them the first time a new face a new customer to greet cheerily but she already knew them knew what they were about to say how proud the chinese lady was of her son how angry the iranian man was with the terrorists for bombing his city this morning was the tuesday september the second day of the everresetting time cycle in just under six hours the first airliner was going to crash into the twin towers and new york and all her inhabitants were going to change forever so whatre you doing bob data collation harddrive maintenance and reading a book oh cool whatre you reading a page of text appeared on the screen she could see individual words momentarily highlight one after the other in rapid blinking succession as bob read while they talked harry potter sal remembered seeing the old films from the first decade of the century they didnt do much for her but her parents had liked them as children are you enjoying it bob didnt answer immediately she noticed the flickering of highlighted words on the open page of text on the screen grind to a sudden halt and the soft whirring sound of hard drives being spun momentarily ceased forming an opinion that was something bob struggled with it required the computer systems entire capacity for him to actually formulate or rather simulate something as simple as a human emotion a preference a like or dislike finally after a few seconds she heard the hard drives whirring gently once again i like the magic very much sal smiled as she acknowledged how many terabytes of computing power had gone into that simple statement if she had a mean streak in her she could have asked him what colour he thought went best with violet or what was tastier chocolate or vanilla it would probably lock the system for hours as bob laboured through infinite decision loops to finally come up with the answer that he was unable to compute a valid response bless him great at data retrieval crossreferencing and processing but dont ask him to pick dessert off a menu chapter new york monday time cycle most of the damage that happened here in the archway with the last time contamination has been fixed up now the holes in the walls filled again the door to the back room replaced with a new sturdy one and we got a brandnew emergency generator installed some workmen came in to set it up we had to hide the timeportal equipment from them and when they asked about all the computer screens at the desk maddy told them we were a computergame developer i think they believed her its a much more powerful generator and more reliable than the last shaddyah old one i hope we dont have to use it though weve also got an old tv set a dvd player and one of those nintendo machines liam loves the games hes mad about one stupid game with silly characters driving around on gokarts throwing bananas at each other boys eh maddy says we need to grow a new support unit a new bob just in case another time shift comes along that we need to deal with only the new bob wont be entirely new the body will yes but she says we can upload bobs ai back into it and hell be exactly like he was and not the retarded idiot that plopped out of the growth tube last time which is a relief bob was soooo stupid when he was first born we fixed the growth tubes some got damaged by those creature things that broke in but theyre all functioning now and weve got them filled up with that stinking protein solution the foetuses float in we had to steal a load of that gloop from a hospital blood bank its the fake blood they use the plasma stuff but with a witches brew of added vitamins and proteins honestly its like runny snot but worse than that because it smells like vomit what we dont have yet though are the foetuses apparently we cant go and grab any old one theyre specially genetically engineered sometime in the future maddy looked at liam you ready aye he replied shivering as he stood behind her in nothing more than a pair of striped boxer shorts and holding a watertight bag full of clothes she looked down at her own shivering body trembling beneath her tshirt maybe one day we could get around to rigging up something to heat the water before we jump in thats for sure she climbed the steps beside the perspex cylinder looking down into the cold water freshly run from the water mains she settled down on the top step beside the lip of the cylinder and dipped her toes in a wet departure that was the protocol to ensure that nothing but them and the water they were floating in was sent back in time and not any chunks of floor or carpet or concrete or cabling that had no possible reason to exist in the past oh jeeeez its freezing liam squatted down beside her great maddy shuddered then looked up at sal seated at the computer station whats the departure count just over a minute so said liam slowly easing himself into the water gasping as he did so youre sure about this uhhuh no she wasnt not sure about anything the old man foster had left her in charge left her running this team and this field office even though theyd barely survived their first brush with time contamination all she had for help now was computerbob and a data folder on his hard drive entitled things youll probably want to ask how do we grow new support units was the name of one of the first files shed found in the folder when shed delved into it a few weeks ago first order of business had been getting the growtubes up and running and getting one of those clones on the go when shed doubleclicked on it what shed got was an image of fosters face looking out of the monitor as hed addressed the web cam he looked ten perhaps twenty years younger than he had the morning hed told her she was ready wished her luck and walked out of starbucks leaving her to run things the foster onscreen looked no more than fifty so he began adjusting the flex so that the mic was in front of his mouth youve opened this file which means youve been careless and your support unit has been destroyed and now you need to grow a new one foster had proceeded with detailed instructions on maintenance and feeding and how the growth tubes work but finally towards the end of the log entry was the bit theyd been after right so the clones are grown from a store of engineered human foetuses ill presume youve used up the last of the refrigerated ones kept in your field office and now you need more not exactly used up those of them midgrowth had all died in the tubes poisoned by their own waste fluids because the electricpowered pumps hadnt been functioning the bodies pale lifeless hairless jellylike forms that ranged from something that couldve sat in the palm of her hand to the body of a boy of eight or nine had been taken care of taken out weighted down and dumped in the river not an experience she ever wanted to repeat the good news is there are more of them theres a supply of viable candidate foetuses all engineered with the silicon processor chip already housed in the cranial cavity theyre ready to grow to full term and of course come with basic learning ai code preinstalled the foster on the monitor smiled coyly if youve been smart you managed to retrieve your last support units chip and preserved its ai she nodded yup well liam had done that messy business so any new support unit doesnt need to start out from scratch as a complete imbecile and you can upload the ai from the computer system so like i say the good news is theres more of them but the bad news is theyre not going to be delivered to your front door like like some sort of a pizza delivery im afraid youve got to go and get them yourselves sal called out a thirtysecond warning and maddys mind returned to the icy water in the displacement cylinder she eased herself in beside liam her breath chuffing out at the cold uhhh this is ffffreezing how ddo you ccope with it she asked liam her teeth chattering he offered her a lopsided grin its not like i get a choice is it twenty seconds called out sal when did you say were going again asked liam i tttold you san francisco liams eyebrows locked in concentration for a moment hold on now is that not the same year that that yes i remember my dad reading it in the irish times its the year that fifteen seconds maddy let go of the side of the perspex cylinder and began treading water liam youve ggot to go under now i know i know bleedin hate this bit maybe sal and i should tteach you how to swim some time ten seconds oh jayzusnmary why does time travel have to be done this way why did that waldstein fella have to be so stupid as to invent bleedin time travel in the first place you wanna blame someone bblame the chinese whatshisname guy who worked it out in the first place liam nodded aghh well him too five seconds called sal you really need to duck under now maddy held her hand above his head need me to push you under no ill just ill ah all right liam sucked in a lungful of air and clasped his nose with his free hand ssee you on the other side she uttered as she pushed him under the water then sucked in air and submerged as well oh jeez here goes her first time her first time into the past not counting her recruitment from shed been too busy checking the coordinates were set right arranging the return window timestamp checking sal had pulled out the right clothes for them to wear from the old closet in the back room making sure she remembered the details of their mission too busy with all those things to realize how utterly terrified she was at the prospect of being pushed out of spacetime through chaos space and god knows what that was to emerge back into the spacetime of nearly a hundred years ago she opened her eyes under the water and saw the foggy form of liams scrawny body thrashing around in blind panic she saw bubbles zigzagging up around him she could see the dim lamp on the computer desk through the tubes scuffed plastic the faint outline of sal then then they were falling tumbling through darkness chapter texas ok students well be arriving at the institute very shortly so i want you all to be on your very best behaviour said mr whitmore absentmindedly scratching at the scruffy saltandpepper stubble around his mouth he considered it a full beard even if no one else did as im sure you will be he added edward chan sighed and looked out of the coachs broad window at the scrub beside the highway outside the airconditioned comfort of the coach it was another blistering texas day hot and bright two things he hated he much preferred his dark bedroom back in houston drapes drawn an ultraviolet lamp making the manga posters on his black bedroom walls glow like the halogen signs outside some cool nightclub dark and cool and peaceful a place far away from the incessant noise of other kids the shrill laughter of clusters of girls highschool girls always seemed to come in clusters mean spiteful clusters that sniggered and whispered and pointed and the boys if it was possible they were even worse the jocks the alphamale types loud brash great at sports oozing easy confidence gangsta rap hissing out of their ipod earbuds highfiving each other for any reason goldentanned sandyhaired blueeyed boys who you could tell would ease through school ease through college ease through life and never once wonder if someone was whispering behind their back laughing at them pointing at them that was the tribal system at school the girls giggly gaggles of hannah montana clones the jocks in their swaggering gangsta gangs and finally the third category the ones like edward chan the freaks loners emos geeks nerds the cookies that didnt quite fit the cookiecutter machine that was high school his dad was always telling him it was the freaks that ended up doing the great things it was the freaks who became dotcom billionaires famous inventors movie directors rock stars even presidents the jocks on the other hand ended up selling real estate or managing walmart stores and the hannah montanas ended up becoming stayathome moms getting fat bored and lonely ahead of the coach he could see a cluster of pale buildings emerging from the ochre drabness and presently they slowed down and stopped at a security checkpoint the other kids on the coach about thirty of them all a couple of years older than edward began to bob in their seats craning their necks to look at the armed security guards and the lab buildings up ahead please stay seated for the moment guys said mr whitmore over the coachs pa system edward stretched to look over the headrest of the seat in front of him he saw a man climb up the steps on to the coach a smart man in a pale linen suit he shook hands with mr whitmore the school principal who was chaperoning the students right guys im going to hand you over to mr kelly who is from the institute hes going to be showing us around the facilities today mr kelly took the microphone from him good morning boys and girls let me first say welcome to the institute its an honour to have you kids come and visit as i understand it you guys have all been nominated by your various schools to come along today because youre all straighta students whitmore shook his head not quite mr kelly mostimproved performers students whove most clearly demonstrated a willingness to learn we have all levels and abilities here on this coach from schools right across the state but what they all have in common is the spectacular improvement in their yearend sats scores these students are the ones whove worked the hardest to better themselves mr kellys tanned face was split with a broad smile fantastic we like improvers here gogetters i wouldnt be surprised if one or two of you on this coach ended up working for us here one day huh there was a token of polite laughter up and down the rows of seats the coach lurched slowly forward down a long straight driveway flanked by freshly cut lawns wet with the moisture from water sprinklers ok guys well shortly be arriving at the visitors reception area where you can get off we have some refreshments ready for you before we start the tour of this facility i will be your guide for today and as im talking if you have any questions at all please dont be afraid to raise your hands and ask we want you to get the most out of today to understand what our work is here and how very important it is to the environment edward looked out of the window as the coach approached a decorative flowerbed and swung slowly around it in the middle framed by an arrangement of vivid yellow chrysanthemums was a sign welcome to teri texas advanced energy research institute chapter san francisco hey dont turn around yet im not ready snapped maddy irritably liam stayed where he was facing the grubby redbrick wall in front of him the back alley reeked of rotting fish and he wondered if he lingered too much longer here whether the smell was going to be stuck on him for the rest of the day are you not done yet he asked maddy muttered under her breath its all these damned laces and hooks and buttons and things how the heck did women manage to dress themselves back then he turned his head a little to look up the alley it seemed to open on to a busy thoroughfare he saw several horsedrawn carts clatter by and men dressed like him formal grey morning coats buttoned waistcoats highcollared shirts with top hats flat caps and bowler hats very much like the betterdressed men in cork might have worn on a sunday morning the clothes theyd found in the back room appeared to be perfectly authentic thered been another couple of dusty costumes in there sal had said something about them being for the other backup droppoint another time another place oh dammit thisll have to do tutted maddy irritably can i turn round now yes but i look a total doof he turned round his eyes widened what she gasped suspiciously what is it whatve i got wrong nothing its nothing its just maddy scowled at him beneath the widebrimmed sun hat topped with a plume of white ostrich feathers her slim neck was framed by decorative lace that descended down the front of a tightly drawn and intricately embroidered bodice her waist seemed impossibly thin as the gown flared out beneath and tumbled down to the ground modestly covering any sign of her legs she put her hands covered in spotless elbowlength white gloves on her hips liam he shook his head you look so so spit it out like well like a lady so you do for a moment he thought she was going to step forward and punch his arm like she was prone to do instead her cheeks coloured ever so slightly uh really aye liam smiled at her and me what about me maddy grinned well you look like an idiot liam pulled the top hat off his head ah its that isnt it makes me ears stick out like a pair of jug handles she laughed dont worry about it liam obviously its the fashion over here you wont be the only person wearing one it was mostly flat caps and forage caps back home you tried wearing a top hat or a bowler you were asking for some joker to try an knock it off she pointed at him ignoring the quip her smile replaced with her letsgetdowntobusiness frown what time have you got on your clock liam pulled the ornate timepiece out of his waistcoat pocket seven minutes after eleven in the morning ok we should get a move on the return window here is in four hours time right you are how far is it not far i think its on to merrimac street then up fourth street to mission street short walk up that on to second street ten minutes at a guess liam stepped forward away from the brick wall the tumbled crates of rubbish and the stench of rotting fish with a broad cocksided grin he offered his arm shall we maam her face softened and she threaded one white gloved hand around it oh absolutely mr darcy a pleasure im sure they emerged out of the gloom of the alley on to merrimac street and immediately maddy found herself gasping my god the realization finally hit her im actually standing in history merrimac street was busy with midmorning foot and wheeled traffic mostly horsedrawn carts ferrying goods up from the wharf down the far end she could make out steam ships lined up against the docks filling the blue sky with columns of coal smoke and steam and the churning business of freight coming off or being loaded on awesome she giggled with delight this is just like being in a movie just like the beginning of titanic he looked at her disgusted they made a movie about it the smile on her face slipped and became a guilty grimace liam tutted and sighed good people died an all for what so they can become part of a flickering peepshow a hundred years later she shrugged uh spose but it was pretty good though fantastic special eff his sideways scowl silenced her never mind they turned left on to the road heading up it towards fourth street dodging several piles of horse manure along the way fourth street was a little busier but nothing compared to mission street the road was a broad thoroughfare a hundred feet wide thick with carts and pedestrians and a tram line that rattled with trams laden with passengers inside and hanging precariously on the back dinging their bells to clear the track ahead oh my god this is so amazing she gushed liam tugged her arm shhh youre sounding like a tourist mission street was flanked with five and sixstorey brick buildings warehouses offices factories banks and legal firms she caught sight of a tall building dominating the skyline fifteen perhaps twenty storeys high that looked like a small version of the empire state building i didnt know they had skyscrapers back then uhh i mean back now liam nodded nothing like this in ireland he shook his head sadly and youre telling me all this gets totally destroyed uhhuh tomorrow morning april eighteenth the great californian earthquake according to our history database much of the downtown area is destroyed by the quake and then the resulting fire destroys most of what was left in this area the fourth and fifth districts jeeeez thats a real shame so it is liam locked his brows for a moment hang on strikes me as a bit stupid that the agency has picked here and now to store our supplies if its about to be brought crashing down well duh said maddy making a face and rolling her eyes think about it it makes perfect sense she looked at him as if hed just put on a pair of shoes the wrong way round liam i thought foster said youre meant to be smart he pouted his lip feigning hurt well miss smarty pants youre obviously itching to tell me something so get on with it she sighed its perfect because the bank vault where our replacement engineered foetuses are located will be completely destroyed in the fire everything all the safe deposit boxes their contents all the client paperwork everything no paper trail liam grinned ah very clever exactly the hubbub on mission street was added to by the noisy clatter of a sputtering engine its noise blotted out everything as it slowly approached them they finally saw the vehicle rolling down the middle of the street on flimsy spoked wheels following a man on foot waving a red warning flag before him wow i didnt know they had cars then maddy shouted in his ear he shook his head now whos being dumb of course we did he watched the vehicle slowly rattle past steered by a man wearing a cap and goggles beside him sat a woman sporting a cloud of ostrich feathers above her head her gloved hands clasped over her ears at the cacophony now i know thats an oldsmobile model r added liam as the vehicle finally turned right off mission street and the laboured clatter of internal combustion allowed them to talk easily once more there were quite a few of those things dashing about cork yes even cork when i left she shook her head hardly dashing they walked on another few minutes in silence maddy enjoying playing the lady in her own periodpiece hollywood movie and liam feeling like this was something of a trip home for him back to his time back to a place where he could talk easily with anyone and not be made to feel like a complete moron for not knowing what a digicam was or that sevenup wasnt some kind of a ball game or that a snickers bar wasnt some sort of sleazy nightclub this is it maddy finally said pointing to a narrow side street there minna street they crossed the wide thoroughfare dodging a tram clanging its way through the bustle of pedestrian traffic and sidestepping several more steaming hillocks of horse manure they stood in the mouth of the narrow road only two carts wide and relatively quiet and thats the building we want she said pointing to a formallooking frontage of brick and granite union commercial savings company she added according to fosters how to manual this is the banks only premises after the earthquake the fire destroys this building and everything inside it the company was no more as if it never existed she looked at him you see perfect and all our baby bobs are in some sort of safe down in its basement thats what foster says liam frowned so im being dumb again but if theres a whole load of those little foetus things down there in a safe somewhere whats keeping them alive would they not die and sort of go off is there a refrigerating device down there youll see chapter san francisco maddy strode down minna street towards the bank come on liam was struggling to keep up with her so who put them in this bank and when did they do it she reached the front step of the union commercial savings company and stopped ok liam just a second she pulled her glasses and a scrap of paper covered with scribbled notes in her handwriting out of her handbag oh jayzus you brought notes back with you isnt that not allowed you know contamination of time an all maddy looked around the quiet street guiltily i know i know but there was way too much to remember i was worried id forget something foster would throw a fit if he knew youd brought notes back here said liam well he wont will he she muttered impatiently because he bailed out and left us to cope on our own liam shrugged at that she put her glasses on ok so my name is miss emily lassiter youre my brother do i get a name too she sighed yes uhh here it is leonard lassiter all right he nodded she scanned the notes further digesting the information for a few moments before tucking them back in her bag and removing her glasses all right i think ive got it all she looked at him you dont have to say anything ok just go along with whatever i say will do she took a deep breath then pushed the double door to the bank inwards they stepped on to a tiled floor that echoed their footsteps around a hall dark with oak panels ahead of them were half a dozen ornate mahogany desks each with softly glowing green ceramic desk lamps behind each one sat a bank teller all but one busy dealing in hushed respectful tones with customers maddy led the way towards the unoccupied teller a young man with hair slicked down in a rigid centre parting and a carefully clipped and waxed moustache uhh scuse me she said the young man looked up at her and smiled charmingly good morning maam how can i help you id like to speak with a mr uh mr leighton he works here i think oh im certain he works here maam said the young man he tapped a wooden nameholder on the desk im harold leighton you see please will you take a seat maddy smiled and slumped down in the seat a little too casually then did her best to quickly recover her ladylike demeanour much uh much obliged she said as demurely as she could manage now maam how could i assist you she took a breath hoping she was going to get this right and not sound half as nervous as she felt my family has a safe deposit box with your bank and i wish to make a withdrawal certainly maam the account is in the name of joshua waldstein lassiter harold leightons eyebrows raised her heart skipped oh is there a problem not a problem as such maam its just i still have the paperwork here on my desk maddy shook her head paperwork the paperwork setting up the safe deposit account joshua waldstein lassiter i presume he is your uh my uh yes thats right my father well your father was here not more than an hour ago actually i dealt with him myself he brought a very nice jewellery box with him and we carried it down to the safe room and put it in a deposit box together as i say not more than an hour ago oh was all she managed to say after a few moments yes well thats quite right and you wish to withdraw something from the safe deposit box already she nodded yes thats right well that is highly irregular were a funny old family us lassiters said maddy looking back over the chair arent we liam liam stepped forward oh yes that we are dear sister he grinned at the teller she sometimes calls me liam although my name is in fact leonard he said nudging the small of her back maddy mentally kicked herself for being such a dumbnuts you are brother and sister harold leighton looked up at liam and it seems you sir are irish yes but he said looking at maddy it seems maam youre not i uh maddys mouth flapped uselessly oh i was brought up in cork cut in liam my dear sister in california father likes to keep a home either side of the atlantic so he does the young teller cocked an eyebrow so it seems he sighed and spread the bank account details out in front of him well it appears your father did specify his children as fellow signatories on the account so you maam i presume are emily lassiter thats correct she replied for security reasons i have to ask you for the code word your father has put down here on this form to assure us you are in fact who you say you are of course she nodded its its she realized all of a sudden her mind had gone blank and cursed the tellers jaw dropped open at her unladylike language madam liam grinned sheepishly shes spent time at sea picked up all sorts of dreadful language from the sailors so she did father so hates her talking that way just a sec said maddy fumbling in her handbag for her note she quickly scanned her scribbled writing ahh here it is she leaned forward over the desk the code word mr leighton is hemlock leighton stared at her long and hard suspicion clouding his young tellers eyes finally a cautious smile spread across his lips yes it is miss lassiter if youll just sign here i can take you down to the safe room the teller spun a large brass wheel and slowly pulled open the castiron door leading on to a small room lined with numbered deposit boxes on three walls your safe deposit box is number threenineseven he said leading them to a locker with the number on its door he inserted the key and twisted it once it is company policy madam sir that i remain in the safe room while you inspect the contents of your deposit box however i shall remain over there by the door and i shall turn my back to allow you a little privacy maddy nodded and smiled politely ok she waited until mr leighton had crossed the room and was standing by the castiron door casually jangling the keys in one hand and examining his fingernails on the other liam she uttered softly yes i think its best if you go talk to him distract him i dont want him seeing anything he shouldnt he nodded aye youre right he wandered over and easily struck up a conversation with the young man while maddy attended to their business she pulled the deposit boxs door open the faint glow from the safe rooms overhead light showed her little of what was inside maddy pushed her hand into the darkness and almost immediately felt the side of a wooden box she found a small handle and pulled it out it was quite heavy and as she hefted it out of the locker towards an inspection bench in the middle of the room the young man called out let me give you a hand with that madam im fine im fine she grunted strong as an ox so she is liam assured him shell be all right he resumed chatting to leighton something about steam ships from what she could hear she studied the box it certainly looked like a jewellery box about the size of a small travel trunk made of dark wood with silver buckles and ornate swirls along each side she turned the box so that the upright lid would hide what was inside from any prying eyes and then slowly carefully opened it another box she whispered but this one was smooth featureless metal and cold to the touch refrigerated there had to be some kind of small power unit or battery inside her gloved fingers found a catch on the side and gently slid it back something inside the box clicked and the lid slowly raised with a barely audible hiss a shallow fog of nitrogen wafted out of the box revealing a row of eight glass tubes each six inches long and a couple of inches wide she eased one of the glass tubes out of its holder and still shielded by the lid of the jewellery box inspected it closely through the glass she could see the murky pink growth solution and the faint pale outline of a curledup human foetus hello there little baby bobs she cooed softly waggling her fingers down at the frozen embryo auntie maddys here the conversation in the corner was getting quite animated clearly leighton had a passion for newfangled things like steam ships and automobiles and liam was playing along nicely well done liam she placed the glass tube back and closed the lid of the refrigerated case lifting it out of the jewellery box and into her bag she was about to close the lid of the jewellery box when she spotted a scrap of paper at the bottom what she saw on it made her heart lurch her name a note for me she reached in and picked it up just a folded scrap of paper a few words scrawled hurriedly on it maddy look out for pandora were running out of time be safe and tell no one howre you doin my dear sister called out liam im good she replied grabbing the scrap of paper balling it up and tucking it into one of her gloves she closed the box and lifted it back into the locker much lighter now she closed the door im all done here mr leighton ah splendid he came over with his jangling keys and locked the deposit box for her everything all right she glanced at liam making a silly face at her over leightons shoulder yes yes just fine thank you a minute later they were exiting the bank on to minna street once more liam holding the bag for her nice enough chap he said she turned to look at him a dozen hours from now hell be dead dead yes dead thats why the instructions said to ask for him specifically shed figured that out on the way back up the stairs because if anything happened if the young man had caught a glimpse of anything inside the box or heard either of them say anything suspicious well hed hardly have time to do anything with that knowledge would he the agency once again cleverly covering its tracks jaayyzz that seems not right to me uttered liam not to warn him somehow maddy didnt like it either its how it is liam its how it is as they walked up minna street towards the main thoroughfare liam attempted to lift the mood you got our little babies she nodded all in there baby popsicles baby what chapter texas edward chan and the rest of the touring party sat in the visitors reception room munching on doughnuts and breakfast bagels and slurping orange juice from cartons as their tour guide mr kelly gave them an introductory presentation the texas advanced energy research institute or teri as we call it for short was established three years ago in when president obama was reelected as you youngsters have been taught in school the world is entering a new tough and very challenging time the worlds population is nearly eight billion carbon emissions have gone off the chart the worlds traditional energy sources oil and gas are rapidly running out we need to change the way we live or well im sure youve seen enough doom and gloom forecasts on the news he paused the reception room was silent except for the shuffling of one or two feet and the slurping of orange juice through straws so as you no doubt know the institute was set up as part of the presidents advanced energy research programme and over the last three years weve used the billions of dollars of taxpayers money set aside by this initiative to develop the wonderful facility youre visiting today we have some of the finest quantum physicists and mathematicians working here and most of our research work has been to do with a thing called zeropoint energy im sure some of you must have heard that term in the news edward looked around at the other kids a few heads were nodding uncertainly one of them a boy a couple of years older than him short and chubby with curly ginger hair parted at the side and brutally combed so that his hair kinked in waves to one side reminding edward of a mr whippy ice cream raised a hand yes er said mr kelly raising his eyebrows franklyn go ahead franklyn my dad says zeropoint energy is just a bunch of wishful thinking its like getting something for nothing and thats impossible in physics nothings free kelly laughed well franklyn thats a good point but you see thats exactly what it is it is a free lunch and the idea that theres such a thing as a free lunch isnt a new one either remember albert einstein and his theory of relativity well he argued that even in a complete vacuum theres a great deal left there it isnt just empty space theres energy too endless energy waiting to be tapped even the ancient greeks suspected that we walk through an endless soup of energy they called it ether but the trick kids the trick has always been being able to isolate it to measure it since it exists everywhere its homogenous isotropic thats to say its uniformly the same everywhere and in every direction the students stared at him in confused silence trying to measure zeropoint energy is a bit like trying to weigh a glass of water under the ocean you know its the same inside the cup as it is outside and therefore since theres no measurable difference between whats in and outside the cup the logical statement to make would be the cup has nothing in it which would of course be wrong so we have a similar issue with measuring zeropoint energy only by creating a proper vacuum and i dont mean just sucking the air out of a space i mean a proper spacetime vacuum a tiny one can we observe what it is that remains he smiled his polished public relations smile the energy itself and thats what we have here at the teri labs a device that can create a proper spacetime gap a genuinely empty space another hand went up yes keisha jackson go ahead keisha how big a hole have you got asked the girl is it big enough to step inside good lord no no its tiny very small it doesnt need to be big its a pinprick one of the boys at the back giggled shortly well be going through into the main laboratory where youll see the containment shielding that surrounds the area of experimentation i believe the team is due to be opening a pinhole vacuum in the next halfhour he splayed his hands wanna go take a looksee every head in the room wagged enthusiastically chapter san francisco they returned to their alleyway with half an hour to spare having spent an hour on the dockside watching the steam ships being loaded and unloaded maddy relishing every little detail of the past and giggling with unbridled delight as dockside workers knuckled their foreheads and doffed their caps at her politely as they walked past oh my god i feel like some sort of duchess she whispered out of the side of her mouth to liam as they turned into the alley everyones so i dunno so polite and proper back in this time he nodded especially to a lady like yourself he nodded at her dress her flamboyant hat with its ostrich feathers them clothes mark you out as a lady of means you know a really posh lady so you are now if youd found some dowdy dress that made you look common them workers wouldve walked on past without a byyourleave oh right thanks she said liam grimaced ahhh now see that came out all wrongsounding so it did i didnt mean to say it like that no youre probably right she huffed ive always been plainlooking im sure shoving on a frilly dress and some stupid feather hat isnt going to make much of a difference they walked down the alley sidestepping a toppled crate of festering cabbages until they reached the spot where theyd materialized several hours earlier seems harsh that though said liam thoughtfully what that fella back there leighton you sure hell die she nodded yes it makes sense yes it did but it was the feel of the feel of ruthlessness that gnawed away at her the agency seemed to know everything about everyone and exploited that knowledge mercilessly in less than eighteen hours the young man shed been talking to would be nothing more than a twisted black carcass amid the smouldering remains of that bank and i have to learn to deal with that she told herself liam seemed to sense her turmoil well this is the job now mads we dont have much of a choice in the matter do we she looked at him and realized it wasnt just the young bank teller that the agency was ruthlessly using but liam too the side effects werent apparent yet the onset of cellular corruption the onset of premature old age but theyd begin to show at some point wouldnt they the more trips liam was sent on into the past the more damage it was going to do to his body until like foster one day he was going to be an old man before his time his muscles wasted his bones brittle weakened and fragile his organs irretrievably corrupted by the effects of time travel and one by one beginning to fail him she so wanted to tell him to warn him how many more trips liam how many before im looking at you and seeing a dying old man but she couldnt not yet foster had told her it would be unkind for him to know his fate too early let him enjoy the freedom of seeing history for a bit seeing his future his past at least give him that for a while before you tell him hes dying liam smiled his lopsided smile on the face of a grown man it might have been called rakish charming even on him it looked just a little mischievous you all right there maddy yeah she nodded yeah im fine he let go of her arm and checked his timepiece return window any second now almost on cue a gentle breeze whistled up the alley sending the loose debris of rubbish skittering along the cobblestones a moment later the air several yards from them shimmered like a heat haze a ball of air twelve feet in diameter hovering a foot off the ground through the portal she could just make out the twisting undulating shapes of the archway beyond and sal waiting impatiently for them you have to tell him sometime maddy tell him time travel will slowly kill him she didnt like the fact that foster had left the decision to her having secrets like that having something she couldnt share with him or sal and what about that note she could feel the lump of balled paper in her glove something else she was being asked to keep from her friends and why and who was pandora she didnt like that it felt like she was being used what like you just used that young bank teller come on then said liam stepping forward with the jewellery case in his hands liam he stopped what she could tell him about the note she could also tell him about the damage time travel was silently wreaking on him that every time he went back in time subtle corruption was occurring to every cell in his body ageing him long before his time she decided shed want to know to know that every time shed stepped through a portal she was knocking perhaps five or ten years off her natural life shed want to at least be able to choose for herself whether she was prepared to make that sacrifice for the rest of mankind what is it mads or maybe foster was right she should keep the truth from him for as long as possible she pulled her glasses out of her handbag and put them on then took the silly bonnet off her head with its long ridiculous ostrich feathers all of a sudden dressed in her tight corset and billowing lace skirts she felt dishonest a phoney a fake and her eyes meeting liams she felt like a liar a wornthin smile spread across her face nothing liam lets go home eh chapter new york are you sure shouted sal thats what bob says maddys voice echoed from the archway through the open door into the back room the hatchery as they called it now he says to attach the end of the proteinfeed pipe to the growth candidates belly button how do we do that liam replied its not like theres a socket to screw the thing into the small slimy foetus squirmed gently in his hand stirring in its slumber he grimaced as it did feeling small fragile bones shift beneath its paperthin skin it looked as vulnerable as a freshly hatched bird fallen from a nest and yet he knew that this tiny shifting pale creature in the palm of his hand would soon be a sevenfoottall leviathan bulging with genetically enhanced muscles with a deep intimidating voice rumbling from a chest as broad as a beer barrel bob says you need to push the feed pipe through the belly button maddys voice came back sals lip curled you mean like as if were stabbing it she called out well obviously dont stab it with the pipe maddys voice echoed back gently do it liam looked at sal and shook his head i cant do it id be sick here he passed the foetus to sal oh right thanks liam sal cradled the thing in her hand and then gingerly reached into the perspex growth tube beside them to retrieve the feed pipe dangling down inside she grimaced as she fumbled in the slimy growth solution finally pulling out the tip of the feed pipe as the slime dripped like mucus from the end of it she could see the pipe ended with a sharpened tip bob says you shouldnt have to push too hard the belly button skin is very thin and should oh thats just gross maddys voice faded away what called out liam maddy didnt answer immediately maddy chirped sal whats gross he says the skin should pop just like a blister liam looked sheepishly at sal really i cant do it id be ill be sick over the poor little fella shaddyah sal muttered you are hopeless sometimes she took the end of the pipe between her fingers and gently drew it up until it hovered an inch above the foetuss tiny belly translucent skin crisscrossed with a faint spiders web of blue veins and a small inward twist of rubbery skin she took a deep breath ok here goes she gently pressed the sharp end of the feed pipe into the small whirl of flesh the foetus shuddered in her hand fingerlength arms and legs suddenly flailing its walnutsized head slapping against the palm of her hand uh maddy it doesnt like it its struggling bob says thats perfectly normal just push it in until the skin pops she heard liam mutter something about jesus before his legs buckled beneath him and he sat down heavily on the floor then slid over on to his side i think liams just fainted shouted sal never mind him maddy replied we need to get the foetus hooked up before it starts starving ok ok she pushed the tip against the belly button again this time pushing despite the foetuss protests until she felt the skin give way as promised with a soft pop a small trickle of dark blood oozed out on to its belly its in right now put bonding tape round the pipe and its belly to hold it in place sal picked up a roll of tape and wound it round as the thing squirmed indignantly in her hand ok what next just lower it into the growth tube sal stepped towards the plastic cylinder and lifted the foetus up over the open top ok bob junior she uttered see you again in a little while gently she lowered the foetus into the murky gunk and then let it sink it settled down through the pink soup like a descending globule of wax in a lava lamp until the feed pipe drew taut and it came to a rest ok hes in now close the growthtube lid and activate the system pump sal closed the tubes metal lid and clamped it in place she squatted down to inspect the panel at the bottom of the tube there wasnt much to see down there a manufacturers name wg systems and a small touch screen she tapped the screen and it lit up filtration system active set system to growth or stasis its asking me to set it to growth or stasis shall i pick growth maddys answer echoed back from the archway a moment later growth for this one sal tapped growth and confirmed the instruction immediately she heard the soft hum of a motor whirring to life somewhere at the bottom of the tube a light winked on inside making the pink protein glow and lighting the foggy form of the foetus from below she could see its struggling form settle content now that it was getting its feed despite the earlier discomfort of having the tube pushed into its belly all done good now weve got to do the same thing for the others only well be setting those to stasis sal looked down at the open case on the floor and the other vials containing growth candidates then she looked at liam still out for the count his face resting against the cold concrete floor amid a small pool of spittle and vomit great thanks for the help liam blfff ifff wheeeelly gloob said liam his mouth full to bulging both girls looked at him what liam chewed vigorously for a moment then finally swallowed i said this is really good what is it lamb korma replied sal its nothing like how mum used to make it back home you have it much sweeter over here i suppose americans like their food really sweet maddy nodded sweeter the better i could live just on chocolate she reached across their table and pulled a carton of mango chutney out of the brown paper takeaway bag liam hungrily loaded another forkful of korma into his mouth across the archway music streamed from the computer maddy had an internet radio station playing music she remembered her parents listening to the corrs rem counting crows its kind of weird just us three though said sal i miss foster me too said maddy were never going to see him again are we she shrugged probably not he had to go why asked liam she hesitated a moment he was sick yeah said sal thoughtfully he didnt look well what was wrong with him maddy played with the rice on her plate for a moment cancer he was dying of cancer he told me that poor poor fella sighed liam i really liked him reminded me a bit of my grandfather so he did they ate in silence for a moment its strange though said sal were part of this this agency but it doesnt feel like were part of anything if you know what i mean i know what you mean said liam like its just the three of us in this little archway all on our own no contact with anyone else he looked up at maddy did he not say there were other groups like us other field offices she nodded he did but we never ever hear from them theres no information about them or about this agency no one has contacted us right no one sal put down the poppadom shed been holding what if it really is just us just us alone here the other two looked at her what if we are the agency she added liams eyebrows arched and his jaw dropped open god help us all if thats the case maddy shook her head its not just us someone else stashed those foetuses back in right could that not have been foster could be maddy shrugged but then youve got to ask who genetically engineered the foetuses thats gotta need other people some facility somewhere the other two had no answer for that fact is she continued theres more to this agency than just us there are others out there somewhere or some when so how do we talk with them asked sal how can we meet them i think thats exactly the point i think were not supposed to maddy slurped her dr pepper maybe were a bit like some sort of terrorist organization for all of our safety no one group can know where another group is we operate in isolation its just us until her words tailed off and they sat in silence for a while contemplating where that sentence ended not much chance of a big christmas gettogether then muttered liam maddy snorted drink on to the table relieved that hed found a way to break the sombre mood at least said sal well have a brandnew bob to protect us soon aye i miss the big ape maddy pointed to the bank of computer monitors hes just there naw said liam wrinkling his nose its not quite the same him being in there you cant exactly hug a computer monitor said sal liam chuckled quite right i miss his tufty round coconut head and that dumb total bliphead expression on his face added sal aye maddy finished a mouthful of curry well well have him around soon fosters how to manual says the growth cycle should take about one hundred hours she pushed her glasses up her nose lemmesee thats just over four days well need some new clothes for him said sal ill see what i can find for him downtown tomorrow maddy nodded good idea they finished the indian takeaway and bagged up the rubbish liam volunteered to take it out as the girls changed for bed he crossed the archway floor crisscrossed with snaking power cables and lifted the front shutter enough to duck under and step out into their backstreet a flickering blue light dimly lit the street above him bright halogen floodlights illuminated the thick metal spars of the williamsburg bridge arcing across the flat docile water of the hudson river on the far side a sight he was still yet to get used to was manhattan a vibrant inverted crystal chandelier of winking city lights and nudging traffic he dropped the bag into the trash can and sucked in the cool night air tonight all was well with the world tomorrow was the day planes crashed into buildings and the sky was a dark smudge all of the day he hated the tuesdays good night new york he uttered under his breath the city replied with the rumble of a train along the bridge overhead and the echoing distant wail of a police siren racing through a brooklyn street several blocks away as he prepared to duck back inside and wind the shutter down once more he found himself wondering if sal was right if they really were alone if the agency was in fact just them as it happened the answer to that specific question was to arrive the very next morning chapter new york maddy was entirely engrossed in big brother usa when bob interrupted shed been watching nicole and hardy quietly plotting together in the kitchen against the other two it was a rerun of the previous weeks shows on fox and she already knew who was facing imminent eviction shed seen this show at least four times already but for some reason despite knowing the outcome it was still compulsive viewing so it was with mild irritation that she answered the dialogue box that had popped up on the monitor over the top of big brother maddy she sat forward and spoke into the desk mic rather than tap out an answer on the keyboard what is it bob im watching big brother right now i am picking up incoming tachyon particles her mouth dropped open and she dribbled milk and rice krispies on to her tshirt youre kidding me right kidding joking not joking maddy there is a directed communication beam coming in from downtime from downtime you mean the future affirmative maddy dropped her spoon back in the breakfast bowl and sat back in her chair she looked around liam was still fast asleep on his bunk and sal was out clothes shopping for bob oh my god a message from the future she realized then and there that it could only be from the agency their first contact with the rest of the organization and just when they were really beginning to wonder whether the three of them were all on their own whats the message bob just a moment just a moment decoding sal had decided not to bother going uptown over the bridge into manhattan the clothes shops there were all modern chain stores and none of them were likely to have much that would fit a sevenfoot mountain of muscle instead she headed into brooklyn an area she hadnt explored at all thus far foster had been so very keen on her focusing her attentive eyes on manhattan and times square taking in every tiny detail until she knew everything that was meant to be there every tiny event that was meant to happen that shed had no time to explore the city this side of the hudson river away from the bridge and south th street she found myriad quieter backstreets and one in particular lined with odd little boutiques selling secondhand furniture and dusty old books the chaos of goods piled outside the storefronts and cluttering the narrow street reminded her vaguely of the marketplace near her home in mumbai she found herself wiping a solitary tear from her cheek and chided herself for crying for her parents because stupid they werent dead the grim fate that awaited them wasnt going to happen for another twentyfive years at this moment in time her mum and dad were just kids her age enjoying their childhood and not due to meet for another decade yet strange that stood side by side she and her mum could probably pass as sisters her attention was drawn to a shop with a curious mix of antique knickknacks spilling out of its entrance and on to the pavement ancientlooking wooden furniture a rockinghorse and clothes that looked like surplus theatrical costumes but among them bricabrac a secondhand tv set a toaster a dyson vacuum cleaner a little bit of everything it seemed she figured she had as much chance of finding something here that might fit bob as she might anywhere else and anyway everything here appeared to be pretty cheap she stepped inside the boutique and squeezed through the front of the store cluttered with a set of chrome bar stools and several flaking displaywindow mannequins wearing dodgylooking leather corsets and feather boas may i help you young lady the voice seemed to come out of nowhere and she jumped then she spotted a tiny old lady with jetblack hair who was even shorter than she was i uh you made me jump she smiled im sorry my dear i do tend to blend into the store sal laughed she could imagine a customer slapping ten dollars down on the counter for the realistic old lady mannequin tucking her under one arm and walking out with her what are you after my dear you have a clothes section she waved an arm at the back i have racks and racks of old old clothes and party costumes lots of castouts from the broadway theatres and a few antique items too thank you sal weaved her way further into the store her nose tickled and teased by the dust that seemed to be on everything and the faint smell of mothballs and turpentine she found the clothes racks at the back and almost found herself giggling at the bizarre mix of garments on display she flicked through the racks in front of her chuckling at some of the exotic costumes and cooing appreciatively at others eventually she found some things that looked suitable for bob a baggy pair of striped trousers with extralong legs that she suspected might have been part of a clowns outfit at one time and an extralarge bright orange and pink hawaiian shirt that looked like it might just about fit over the top of his broad shoulders and rippling muscles you must have a very big friend said the old lady as she took sals payment and folded the clothes into a plastic bag for her uncle she replied my uncle bob hes a very big man sal was about to add that he was also pretty dumb as well dumb and kind of childlike when she spotted something dangling from a hanger on one wall a white tunic buttoned down the left side with an emblem on the chest that she recognized the white star lines it was a stewards tunic just like liams she pointed at it is that is that a uniform from the titanic the old woman looked round at where she was pointing oh that no it would be worth a lot more if it was genuine i could sell it to a museum or a collector for thousands of dollars unfortunately its not its just a theatre costume not a very wellmade costume either friends of mine they did a production set on the titanic it didnt do very well you want to have a look at it sal shook her head she couldve said something about it being a funny coincidence that her bunkbuddy was a young lad whod actually worked on the ship for real the old lady would think her mad of course or that she was just being cheeky mind you in just over half an hours time when the first plane hit the twin towers whatever odd conversation she might have now would be instantly forgotten sal returned to the archway with bobs clothes and some groceries before the first plane hit and the manhattan sky started to fill with smoke she was about to mention the coincidence to liam the stewards tunic exactly like his when she realized by the expressions on maddys and liams faces that something important had just happened she forgot all about it chapter new york its a message from the agency said liam as sal joined them beside the computer desk from the future so sal looked at them both theres our answer were not alone then yup replied maddy grinning clearly the most encouraged and excited by that news bobs decoding the message right now hes estimated the year of origin to be about thats the time of roald waldstein the inventor of timetravel technology do you think its him the waldstein fella asked liam maddy reached for her inhaler on the desk and took a quick puff on it yes she replied hopefully its the agency checking in with us you know seeing if were ok which would be nice but how started liam frowning but how will we talk back to them these tachyon signal things can only go backwards in time right thats what foster said he said that but he was keeping it simple it takes a lot more energy to project forward plus more importantly in everyones on the lookout for tachyon particles right bob correct a signal aimed at the agency could be detected and reveal its location in international laws against time travel have been established in any case i wouldnt know which direction to point a signal said maddy who knows where in the world theyre based so is there a way to talk back asked liam maddy nodded yup there is there was an entry in fosters how to guide on how to contact the agency a short explanation by foster looking ten years younger as he spoke to the webcam an entry he must have recorded much earlier than the others its the same principle liam that you used actually said maddy the museum guest book remember only its a new york newspaper we place an advert in the lonely hearts section of the brooklyn daily eagle it has to begin with the phrase a soul lost in time liam clicked his fingers he understood the rest and i suppose they have a crinkly old yellowing copy of that paper dated september twelfth thats right sal looked from one to the other her eyes widening and and do you mean the words in the paper change they actually change on the page maddy nodded its a tiny ripple in time nothing that would change anything else after all whos going to be reading the lonely hearts section of the papers tomorrow the papers would be full of that planecrashingintobuilding story will they not said liam exactly our little advert wont be noticed by anyone except of course a bunch of people carefully studying a page of a fiftyfiveyearold newspaper in or thereabouts maddy clucked with excitement i cant tell you how freakin relieved i am that theres somebody else out there liam nodded at the screen in front of her looks like bobs done i have decoded the message maddy what is it it is only a partial message the signal has been interrupted uh ok give us what youve got bob words spooled across the dialogue box contamination event origin time appears to be am august major contamination ripples significant realignment of time stream death of edward chan author of original theory on time travel resulting in failure to write thesis in death may have been deliberate assassination attempt occurred while visiting instit the three of them waited for a moment for bob to print out more of the message that is all i have the partial ends there thats it that is it maddy she turned to look at the others er what the hell are we supposed to make of that they sat in silence for a while digesting the small block of text on the screen finally liam shrugged that theyre in trouble well duh sighed maddy they need our help said sal but can we help though said liam can i go into the future of course you can maddy pinched the tip of her nose thoughtfully think about it every time we bring you back from a mission in the past youre going forward in time arent you this is correct a mission operative can travel forward and backwards however energy expenditure is significantly higher moving forward sal looked at the other two but maybe there are other field offices further in the future than us who will deal with this liam nodded shes right if were not the only team then perhaps somebody else is closer in time maddy gave it a moments thought then why direct the message right at us i mean right here right now she turned back to the desk bob was this a broadspectrum signal beam sent out for everybody to pick up anywhere anywhen negative it was a narrow focused beam meaning it was meant for us that is the logical assumption maddy but surely there are other teams in the future said sal somebody closer in time and maybe there are cut in maddy but any field office based after she looked at the screen after the eighteenth of august is going to be affected by the time wave also right she stared at the other two so maybe were the closest unaffected team maybe were the field office closest before this date liam sighed aw come on why is it us again we only just got ourselves fixed up after the last bleedin mess and a half hello liam i have a question good mornin bob is bleedin a reference to the high body count of the last mission including the extensive damage to my last organic support frame or is it an expression of anger i should add to my language database its liam being all stressy said maddy angry thats right once again they stared in silence at the partial message displayed on the screen all of them silently hoping it would just go away or change into another message simply welcoming them to the agency its for us isnt it said sal after a while weve got to fix this time problem like we did the last one maddy nodded i think so liams jaw set firmly well im not going anywhere less ive got bob coming with me i mean that so i do ok said maddy thats only fair she turned round to face the computer monitors bob can we speed up the growth cycle of the foetus weve started off affirmative increase the nutrient mix of the feed solution introduce a small electrical charge to the suspension fluid to stimulate cell activity how quickly can we have a body ready for you growth cycle can be increased by with acceptable risk to the biological life form half the time said maddy thats still what thirtyeight hours correct could we not birth the clone any earlier added liam he looked at maddy and shrugged i mean does it need to be a fully grown man optimal age for organic support unit is approximately years old muscle tissue and internal healing systems are at their most functional but as liam says could we eject the clone from the tube at a younger age or would that i dunno kill it negative a growth candidate can be functional from approximate age of onwards however the support units effectiveness would be compromised what does that mean asked liam it means bob wont be quite as big a brute as he was last time said sal so what if we birth the clone at say about eighteen years of age asked maddy how useful would he be an eighteenyearold clone would offer approximately of normal operational capacity hed be half as strong said liam maddy nodded and how much time would that save us off the growth cycle hours she looked round at the others what do you reckon we speed up the growing process and then empty him out on to the floor twentyfour hours from now said liam and well have an eighteenyearold bob with half the muscles thats about it but hell still be dangerous to other people right i mean doesnt make any sense me having him by my side if hes just affirmative liam i will be capable of causing death with or without weapons liam managed a weak smile then i guess itd be good to have you back bob thank you i look forward to being fully operational again maddy slapped her hand on the desk right then i guess we have a plan of action since weve got no time to waste sal could you go see to the growth candidate lets get that process sped up ok and i guess i better start gathering all the data i can on this edward chan guy she said pecking at the computers keyboard what about me asked liam maddy tapped her fingers absentmindedly on the desk er hell i dont know i suppose im coffeemaker she smiled if youre doing a run to starbucks can you grab me a chocolatechip muffin as well yeah me too called sal from the back rooms doorway chapter new york so this is what ive got said maddy producing several sheets of computer printout this evening the kentucky fried chicken restaurants eating area was deserted apart from them brooklyns streets were quiet everyone back home now that the last light of the evening had gone all home watching the news on their tv sets todays sky had been divided all day by the thick column of black smoke from the collapsed twin towers and new yorkers were emerging from the fog of shock and dismay at the days events to a mood of contemplation and mourning they were lucky to find even this place open only a couple of staff seemed to be on and they were busy half the time watching the news updates on a small tv set up right on the counter edward chan as you guys will remember foster telling us is this bright young maths kid who went to the university of texas he graduated there then went on to do some postgrad work what is that whats postgrad its just more studying liam the kind of studying where you tell your teachers what specific area you intend researching and they just check in with your work every now and then and help out if they can so anyway she continued looking down at the printouts and reading at the university he sets out to do a research paper on zeropoint energy and whats that jeez liam are you going to keep stopping me to ask what stuff is he looked hurt ive got to learn all these modern words right i mean im still really just a lad from cork whos running to catch up on the last century so i am maddy sighed its sort of like energy thats supposed to exist at a subatomic level it was still just theoretical mumbo jumbo in my time i think they started building something to do with that in india in my time said sal experimental reactor or something because we were running out of oil and stuff maddy scooped up some fries from her box anyway if i can continue liam chan set out to do a paper on zeropoint energy and ended up changing course instead he wrote a paper on the theoretical possibility of time travel the main point he was making in his work was that the theoretical energy that was assumed to be there in normal spacetime the subatomic energysoup that was meant to be everywhere was in fact a form of leakage from other dimensions he writes this science paper and does nothing else notable until his death from cancer a few years later at the age of twentyseven so like foster told us said liam this chan lad is the true inventor of time travel not the waldstein fella well he did the theoretical work that led to waldsteins machine so i guess theyre both responsible for inventing it the message from the agency said hed been assassinated said sal maddy nodded which means what she looked at both of them im guessing it means someone is trying to prevent time travel being invented liam reached for a ketchup sachet so hold on isnt that what the waldstein fella wanted in the first place to make sure time travel never got invented isnt that why this agency thing exists why the three of usre here instead of dead so why would the agency want us to save chan asked sal i mean no chan means no time travel right that means no more time problems sright liam raised a finger the message didnt actually tell us to save him maddy leaned forward it was an incomplete message maybe thats the bit we missed at the end but we dont know that for sure replied sal maybe it was someone from the future letting us know that time up ahead was changing and that there was now no more need for the agency for us maddy shook her head and pointed to the message printed out on paper look it begins with contamination event id say that suggests they considered this to be a bad thing and theyre not too happy about it they were silent for a moment all three of them staring at the printed words on the page trying to determine the intent of the message foster was very very specific about this said maddy after a while history must go a certain way for good or bad even if the history yet to happen features some kid called chan who makes time travel possible thats the way it has to be and if it changes from that the agency has to fix it liam nodded after a few moments i suppose youre right so do we know where his death is going to happen the date in the message is august eighteenth in our database it mentions chan was one of a class of highschool students who were on a field trip to the texas advanced energy research institute on this date this is biographical data on chan taken from if this really is an assassination attempt by somebody the chances are they have access to the same data as us in other words they looked at chans biography and noted he was going to be at a particular place at a particular time and sent themselves back in time to be there waiting with a gun added liam maddy nodded yup well liam bit his lip anxiously you can see now why im so bleedin keen to have big ol bob by my side seems these bad guys have got guns with them and bobs a dab hand at dealing with people like that so he is maddy glanced at her watch we should probably get back to the arch the time bubble is due to flip over in a few hours and we could all do with some rest bobs new body should be ready to birth tomorrow morning and then well be ready to send you guys forward in time to see whats what liam sighed back in that ol bathtub for me chapter new york sal stared at the curledup form in the growth tube in stunned silence for a good minute before she finally gasped oh no by the dim red light of the back room and the peachcoloured glow of the tubes interior uplight she could see theyd really messed up with growing bobs body well actually it looked like she alone had messed things up theyre going to be mad at me maddys voice echoed through the open door into the back room hows he looking sal didnt know what to say so she said nothing everything ok in there theyve got to find out sometime uhh no not really she replied whats the matter maddys head appeared in the doorway squinting into the gloom of the hatchery sal whats up its uh its bob she said oh god what now its not a misgrowth is it we cant afford to start off another one sal had caught a glimpse of the few misgrowths that had been floating in the tubes back here not long after foster had recruited them theyd looked like awful freakshow specimens in some carnival tent contorted with faces like gargoyles and demons and limbs twisted into impossible clawlike stumps she thanked god it wasnt something like that no its grown just fine its just maddy took a cautious step into the hatchery her eyes yet to adjust to the dim red lighting well it looks ok from here two arms two legs nothing weird and gross sticking out she said sal studied the adultsized form floating in the murky pink soup i think i must have put the wrong foetus in or something she uttered maddy took a few steps across the floor careful not to hook her foot in a power cable and pull over one of the other tubes holding the other tiny foetuses in stasis come on sal whats the prob maddys voice tailed away as she stood beside her oh she whispered i see now sal bit her lip i i must have im sorry i didnt check it first i just didnt see maddy looked at her you didnt see they all looked the same sal replied her voice rising in pitch look im sorry oh thats just great sal just great now what are we going to do im sorry ok sorry i didnt see i just sorry is that it sorry doesnt help us theres no time to grow another one liam stepped into the back room hey ladies ladies whatever is the matter well why dont you come and look for yourself snapped maddy irritably liam made his way cautiously forward until he was standing between them meet your new support unit she added sarcastically liam frowned at the dim outline in the tube then suddenly his eyebrows shot up into twin arches its a its a its a girl said sal helpfully oh jayzusnmothermary i never knew we got baby boys and girls maddy reached down to the floor and picked up one of the empty glass containers the foetuses had come in she held it close to the growth tube to take advantage of some of the softly glowing light coming from within there she said after a while her finger pointing at a small marking at the bottom of the glass sal leaned closer screwing her eyes up to see it better in the dim light it says xx thats all whats that supposed to mean maddy tutted and shook her head you dont know no liam shrugged me neither he said his eyes still locked on the naked female form inside the tube it means female and xy means male you guys can be real morons its to do with the chromosomes liam managed to drag his eyes away cromerwhatamajinxie frustrated maddy banged the perspex tube with the palm of her hand doesnt matter ill explain another time the point is what are we gonna do if we start another one off itll be at least another thirtysix hours before we can send someone to investigate the chan thing said sal thats my point replied maddy removing her glasses and rubbing her eyes the message sounded urgent right god knows what damage is happening to the timeline ahead of us right now we dont have much choice replied sal unless maddy nodded unless you go check it out on your own liam liam looked at them both youre joking right neither said anything right he replied well the answer is not on your nelly no way no sir im not going into some spangly future place without a bob he looked again at the female form inside the tube or a roberta by my side its been hard enough for me trying to get my head around and all your crazy modern ways theres no way that im doing all on my own im tellin you maddy sighed all right then she looked at the shape floating in the goo that thing may not have the brute strength of the last one but at least youd have bobs ai and database along with you maddy turned to him and this is just a scouting mission anyway just a quick visit to see what happened to chan liams face hardened thats what foster said to me the last time and look what happened i got stuck in the middle of an invasion for six months maddy reached a hand out and touched his arm well this time well just be more cautious he chewed his lip in thought for a moment then finally nodded jeez all right i suppose if its just a quick looksee maddy gently slapped his shoulder good sal yes lets birth it ok sal squatted down on her haunches to tap the command into the small control panel at the bottom of the cylinder er liam said maddy yes would you mind mind mind what a little privacy uh maddy sighed it may just be a mindless blubbering clone right now but its still a lady liam was still sulking at being kicked out of the back room when the metal door to the hatchery finally slid to one side with a shrill squeak of unoiled rollers maddy and sal emerged through the doorway first beaming like a pair of proud midwives they ushered a pale shuffling form wrapped in a long towel out into the light of the main arch liam studied her she was taller than the other two and of course as bob had first been when hed been dumped out of the bottom of his tube she was completely bald yet despite that he realized she was and he felt a little queasy admitting this to himself quite beautiful uh hello he said awkwardly the clone stared at him curiously as the girls led her across the arch towards the table and armchairs her pale skin glistened wet with the goo shed been floating in only moments ago and the smell like a rancid meat stew wafted across to him turning his stomach hello there said liam again as they sat her down opposite him flug herr gufff slurb the clone replied dark brown slime dribbling out of the side of her mouth and down her chin right said maddy to liam you can get acquainted while i sort out uploading bobs ai he nodded his eyes still locked on the clone she seemed to have little of the bulging musculature of bob athletic though not bulky like hed been last time bob bob liam you idiot he realized that it was stupid to think of that first apelike clone as bob it had merely been the organic vehicle that bobs ai code had first used but still he mused bobs personality if he could actually use that word had been formed inside that big brute it was almost impossible not to think of him as a big clumsy panzer tank of a man with fuzzy coconut hair and a voice as deep and rumbling as one of the trains that regularly rattled over the williamsburg bridge above them during the six months hed been stuck in the past with him hed grown attached to the big lumbering ape not just the code in his head but that expressionless vapid face of his those horribly awkward smiles more like a horse baring its teeth hed even cried when those men had gunned bob down riddling him with enough bullets to ensure that even his robust body had no hope of recovery cried as bob had died in his arms and hed had to perform an act of surgery that since then hed done his very best to blank from his memory cried for bob although hed never admit that to the others because it seemed silly all that made bob bob had survived had come back from the past in his bloodcovered hand a wafer of silicon containing his ai every memory he had all the learning all the adapting all the growing up hed done in those six months in the past that was bob not the tattered bulletriddled corpse hed left behind in the bloodspattered snow of liam looked again at the young woman in front of him lean and athletic a porcelain beauty to her face her her its an it liam it get it not a her just an organic vehicle a meat robot almost as if the clone could read his mind it drooled another long spittle string of gunk out of the side of its mouth and grunted something unintelligible sal giggled so like bob isnt she she could be his twin sister maddy returned from the desk to sit beside the female clone ok bobs preparing the download protocols he needs to handshake with this support units inbuilt operating system before he can upload a copy of his ai into it uh how does bob get into her its head asked liam dont you need some sort of a cable or something bluetooth she replied wearily yes i know that means nothing to you she sighed ok its a broadband wireless data communication protocol designed for lowlatency shortdistance transmission liam was still staring at her slackjawed and bemused maddy sighed again information will fly through the air from the computer and into its head oh right liam smiled why didnt you just say that in the first place they heard a beep coming from the computer desk uploading is starting now said maddy the clone sitting opposite liam suddenly jerked upright and cocked her head like a dog hearing a dogwhistle he watched with fascination as the support units eyes blinked rapidly with the data flooding into the tiny computer system built into the middle of its cranium computer technology that came from the s technology immensely more powerful than their array of linked pcs beneath the computer desk the download of information took about ten minutes then finally the female clone closed her eyes installing explained maddy then it will boot up again after a few moments the clone looked up at them with eyes that now seemed to faintly glint with intelligence bob said maddy you ok the clone nodded awkwardly affirmative the voice was a deep growl almost as deep as bobs old voice had been jayzus liam lurched thats weird sal pulled a face ewww jahulla thats just sooo wrong i will adjust the vocal register bobs barreldeep voice rumbled the support unit cocked its head then spoke again is this better the voice now the smooth upperregister of a teenage girls maddy nodded much better i think we can safely say youre not an it youre a she now liam shook his head as he studied it him her bob i feel very strange about this he finally muttered very strange indeed chapter new york now shes had all the biographical information about edward chan and details of the layout of the texas advanced energy research institute uploaded isnt that right the support unit nodded as she lowered herself into the water beside liam wearing underwear that maddy had selfconsciously pulled out from beneath the sheets of her bunk and donated affirmative i have all the data required for this mission the support unit replied sweetly liam shook his head this is so weird i mean its great to have you back an all bob but youre a youre a his glance flickered involuntarily for a moment towards the clones chest he clasped his eyes shut oh jeez youre a girl so you are recommendation suggest this copy of my ai be given an appropriate unique identifier maddy sitting on the top step and looking down at them in the water nodded thats right you cant go round calling her bob additional information although the ai in my computer is a direct duplication i am now interfaced with a different organic brain and during the operational lifespan of this organic support frame different data will result in a different emergent ai liam looked up at maddy what did she it bob just say that you should think of this support unit as someone brand new as a different team member because shes going to develop a different personality thats right isnt it the support unit nodded affirmative consequently this ai should have its own identifying label she needs a new name to avoid confusion with bob added maddy nodding towards the bank of monitors and computers on the desk remember bobs still in there she grinned youre best thinking of this support unit as i dunno his sister liam looked at the clone treading water beside him she tried one of bobs reassuring horse smiles just as clumsy and illfitting as her brother but somehow more appealing on her slim face liam she said softly please give me a name go on said maddy its your turn he shook his head i dont know ok you think about it she called across the archway to sal whats the countdown fifty seconds she handed them a couple of sealed plastic bags clothes for you in there and a wig for her now youll arrive at the institute just as a class of thirty children are being given a tour of the place ive checked the floor plans and picked out what looks like an equipment storage room near to the institutes main experimental chamber thats where well send you you can dry off and change in there then join the school party liam nodded youll be there to observe how edward chan is assassinated ok not to stop it just watch then well bring you back you can tell us what happened then we can work on what we need to do to prevent it happening thats the plan got it aye and the return window is set for ten minutes after edward chans time of death the usual failedreturn protocols apply if you miss that first window well open again an hour later you know how it goes an hour later a day later a week later thats it thirty seconds called out sal you ok liam said maddy softly he nodded his teeth beginning to chatter with the cold come back safely she said affectionately patting his hand holding the side of the tube she got to her feet and clanked down the steps beside the tube ten seconds liam turned to look at the support unit treading water beside him hey ive got a name for you insufficient time liam she replied we have to go under the water now reluctantly he nodded sucked in a big lungful of air let go of the side and held his nose the support unit gently rested a hand on top of his head and shoved him under with surprising force then ducked beneath the water herself chapter texas he watched edward chan walking ahead of him with the other kids he looked so small among the other highschoolage kids so small and so vulnerable with his highschool rucksack on his back and a yellow tshirt two sizes too big for him yes yes he does but dont forget who this boy is just how dangerous he is howard goodall gritted his teeth with renewed determination ahead of him just a dozen yards away was the legendary edward chan grandfather of timetravel technology his mind reiterated an inescapable mantra the boy has to die the boy has to die too many of his colleagues had been arrested to get him to this place this time close enough to kill chan he could feel the weight in his own rucksack a red one with high school musical stencilled in cheerful pink across it he could feel the weight of responsibility in there and the miniature carbonfibre projectile weapon hidden inside an innocentlooking camping flask the cheap plastic kind you can pick up from walmart for five dollars the institutes guide eased his way through the shuffling trail of students to the front where he stopped turned round and raised his hands to get everyones attention ok now that you guys have all had some refreshments and youve had a little introduction to the theory behind zeropoint energy were going to be heading into the business part of this facility the experimental reactor building before we go inside theres one more security check thirty students moaned in unison sorry kids he laughed im afraid its procedure so if youd all just open your rucksacks and school bags one last time for our security guards to get a quick looksee inside then we can proceed third time howard did his best to look just as casual and irritated at the hassle as all the other kids he unzipped his rucksack and held it open for a cursory glance if the guard bothered to unscrew the drinking cap of the camping flask hed find the small weapon which was roughly the size and shape of a whiteboard marker howard watched the guard work his way down the line of impatient children but he wont unscrew it because howard youre going to look just as bored as all these other kids bored and impatient to get on with the tour and not nervous not scared howard was the one in their group theyd selected to do the job although he was twentythree he looked young young enough to pass as a highschool student a few tufts of downy hair on his upper lip suggested a boy desperate to grow his first moustache his dark wavy hair pulled back into a scruffy ponytail his thrashmetal archnme on tour tshirt took six or seven years off him now he no longer looked like howard goodall a mathematics graduate from the year but leonard baumgardner some grungy highschool kid whod managed to earn a set of top scores in his sats the real lenny was back home in his basement bound and gagged along with his mom howard had briefly considered killing them both worried they might struggle free and raise the alarm but he figured this was all going to be done before that could happen he looked close enough in appearance to the spotty face on lennys old school id card to pass a cursory examination and since this party of students had assembled together in austin earlier this morning and he was the only kid from baumgardners school going there was no one there to not recognize him no one had any reason to believe he wasnt young leonard of course none of the kids knew each other they were from different schools all over the state thirty kids assembling early morning with their parents waiting to be signed on to the coach and into the care of mr whitmore for the day howard glanced around at the others and what if one of the others is not who he says he is he kicked that thought away as quickly as it had arrived he needed to stay very calm needed to look relaxed like these others slightly bored waiting to be shown something interesting something worth crawling out of bed for so early the guard finally reached for howards bag morning he grunted lets take a look son howard casually held out his rucksack anything hazardous in here son what you mean apart from my big bomb sighed howard with a lazy smile the guard scowled at him not even funny kid his hand rummaged quickly through the grubby items inside a sandwich box the flask several rolledup and dogeared comicbooks before he slapped the rucksack closed and waved howard past howard offered the guard a casual wave have a nice day now go on kid scoot said the guard before turning to rummage through another bag ahead he could see chan and the other students gathered around the guide mr kelly and the teacher mr whitmore waiting for the last of them to be checked he sucked in a deep breath as he wandered over to join them settling his nerves his pounding heart inside the zeropoint chamber thats when he was going to do it the chamber would be sealed and this security guard and the others on the outside his best chance to fire several aimed shots at the boy it would take them a while to react to open the door to take me down howard smiled grimly not such a big price to pay to save the future of mankind not really chapter texas they landed with a wet splash on to a hard tiled floor ouch liam whimpered the water sloshed noisily across the floor soaking cardboard boxes of domestic cleaning materials jayzus why cant we ever land on something soft like a pillow he grimaced as he let go of his nose and puffed out the breath hed taken back in insufficient data to identify a soft landing loca liam raised a hand its all right i wasnt after an answer he pulled a wet shock of dark hair out of his eyes and opened them instantly wishing he hadnt ohmotherofgod he clamped his eyes shut and turned away to look at the storeroom wall what is wrong you could have warned me you were taking those wet things off why because because he bit his lip this is so very not right because youre a ah youre a girl now bob liam spotted some towels on the storeroom shelf and began to dry himself off you should assign a new ident to this ai copy i may be bob now she said but this ai will develop new subroutines and characteristics that require a new identifying label liam nodded yes selfconsciously he found himself wrapping the towel round his waist as he hurriedly removed his wet boxers and pulled the clothes hed brought with him out of the bag four seconds before we were transmitted you indicated you had a suitable ident for me oh yes so i did she turned to look at him so what will i be called liam could hear the rustle of clothes being quickly pulled on behind his back good he really didnt need to see that again he found a pair of neon green threequarterlength baggy shorts and a navy blue sweatshirt with the word nike splayed across it and for some reason a large tick beneath the word he felt much better with some clothes on even if they looked quite ridiculous i had a cousin called rebecca he said used to call her becks for short becks replied the support unit her voice rising at the end in a query thats right becks a moment logging ident so are you decent now can i turn round decent you know got clothes on affirmative liam turned round and found his breath caught momentarily blimey becks cocked her head and looked at him are these garments incorrectly deployed his eyes skittered awkwardly up from the combat boots to the black leggings to the black lace miniskirt to a black crop top that displayed a bare midriff up to her perfect face framed by tumbling locks of flaming foxred hair quite clearly sal had decided their support unit needed to look like some sort of gothic valkyrie uh no you are you got it about errrr right i suppose i think liam felt his mouth go dry and a strange jittery lurching sensation in his stomach jayzus get a grip liam thats thats thats just bob wearing a girl suit all right recommendation you should refer to me as becks from this point on she said firmly it will avoid unnecessary confusion between ai versions he nodded all right uh ok so youre becks then thats that settled correct her smile was faltering and clumsy as always just like bob but on those lips strangely quite perfect liam decided to shift his mind to other things i suppose we had better get a move on and find this chan fella becks nodded and blinked retrieving data from her hard drive we are located within the institutes experimental reactor building the reactor is very close to this location liam stepped towards the storerooms door and cracked it open a sliver outside he could see a narrow hallway and opposite double doors with a sign on them authorized visitors and staff only just then he heard muffled voices from the end of the hallway and glass doors swung inwards to reveal a man in a smart linen suit leading a shuffling gaggle of teenagers yes were in the correct place all right whispered liam he watched them coming towards them the man turning to talk to the group gesturing emphatically with his hands liam gently closed the door until it clicked theyre just coming up now we can tag along on the end he whispered he waited until the muted sound of the mans droning voice and the shuffle and slap of trainers on the polished linoleum floor passed them by before he cracked the door open again and peeked out the last kids in the school party were just ahead three blondehaired girls deeply involved in a mumbled conversation clearly too interested in chatting to each other to even pretend to be listening to the guide up front now liam mouthed and stepped out behind them becks swiftly following he fell in step at the back of the group and when one of the girls casually glanced back over her shoulder he quickly managed to mimic the laidback swagger of one of the boys up ahead oh said the girl thought we were like you know the last liam shrugged and smiled guess like not he replied doing his best to bury the irish in his voice her gaze lingered a moment longer a flickering smile for him then she turned back round and was back to gossiping in a conspiratorial murmur with the other two again liam puffed out a silent gasp of relief it looked like theyd jumped the first hurdle successfully sneaking on to the back of the tour party and managing to pass themselves off as yet two more kids who might actually have preferred a trip to disneyland or universal studios than wandering around a bunch of clinically clean corridors he grinned at becks and then almost immediately wished he hadnt the smile she returned gave him that weird flipflopping sensation in his stomach again liam you daft idiot its just bob in a dress for crying out loud he wished sal could have found some other clothes for the support unit something baggy drab and unflattering and why a wig with hair like that why that colour hed always loved that copper red his first crush at school mary odonnell shed had hair that bewitching colour of fiery red oh saints preserve me shes just a meat robot so she is chapter texas and here we are announced mr kelly to the group were about to enter the central reactor containment area the whole experimental chamber is surrounded by an electromagnetic field to filter out possible interference from all manner of electronic devices basically were going to be walking inside a giant electromagnet so if you kids have any ipods laptops iphones or memory cards with data on youd rather not lose may i suggest you place them on the table here before we step through he said indicating a table beside a pair of thick metal doors liam watched with amusement as virtually every student sighed and then proceeded to reach into their rucksacks to pull out all manner of shiny metal and plastic gadgets and gizmos eventually done mr kelly tapped an entry code on to the large metal doors and he smiled expectantly as they swung slowly inwards at last the gaggle of teenagers in his charge seemed to be shaken out of their torpid state of disinterest a shared gasp rippled among them as their eyes swept up to take in the large spherical chamber seemingly constructed entirely out of footballsized ballbearings as you can see the entire chamber is lined with charged magnets which act as a completely impenetrable barrier for any sort of fm radio signals wifi signals electrical currents atmospheric static and so on the sort of things that can affect our readings from the test runs he led them into the spherical chamber along a raised walkway towards a platform thirty feet in diameter mr kelly pointed towards a rather less impressivelooking structure what appeared to be a polished metal witchs cauldron with a lid on six feet across wires and cables and broad cylinders of metal descended through the lid into whatever witches brew was bubbling away inside now that kids thats what this is all about that metal sphere contains tens of billions of dollars worth of investment and quite possibly represents mankinds energy future thats the reactor asked mr whitmore yup thats it the zeropoint energy test reactor kelly smiled and shook his head you know it still amazes me that something so small something the size of a of a small car could in theory provide more than enough energy for every last person on this planet liam found his jaw sagging open just like everyone elses the tests weve run in there have so far produced really quite staggering amounts of energy out of the spacetime vacuum pinholes that weve opened the trick is sustaining and controlling the pinhole and of course containing such huge amounts of energy that sounds a little like a little dangerous said the blonde girl whod glanced back at liam mr kelly looked at her whats your name laura whitely well laura i guess it does sound a little dangerous dr brohm one of our leading scientists working on this likened it to opening a very small peephole and looking on to the face of god himself mr kelly forced a laugh at that comment a little fanciful i think but it gives you an idea of how much energy were talking about howard goodall felt the first bead of sweat trickle down the small of his back as he discreetly eased his rucksack off his shoulder on to the floor he slowly opened the zip just a little and sneaked his hand inside his fingers quickly found the screw cap of his thermos flask and he gently began twisting it off he could see edward chan at the front of the small knot of students gazing in silent awe at the glistening metal container howard wondered how they could all be so incredibly stupid how mankind was happy to play dice with technology it had no way of understanding he remembered a lecture at university his tutor had talked about the americans manhattan project during the second world war their attempt to build the worlds first atom bomb how when they first did a test detonation in the deserts of new mexico the scientists hadnt been certain whether the bomb would destroy several square miles of desert or indeed the entire planet but still the reckless silly fools went ahead and tested it anyway played dice with mankinds future just like time travel a technology mankind was woefully unprepared to be in possession of he stepped forward a little closer to chan his eyes darting to the heavy doorway of the chamber slowly being swung back into place his hand felt the tubeshaped carbonfibre weapon it was small tiny with a magazine containing six toxintipped projectiles he only had to wound chan just get one shot on target and wound the boy the neurotoxin would finish him in minutes this is it howard he told himself this is the end of time travel chapter new york what jealous maddy shook her head emphatically jealous of bob version two sal had a mischievous look on her face just asking oh come on of course not its not even human its just its just a clone its not even a genuine copy of a human it doesnt have a proper human brain but she looks very human and so does a storefront mannequin or a gi joe action figure or a barbie doll sal shrugged and grinned mischievously liam seemed impressed maddy had noticed his eyes had been out on stalks no different to any other boy i guess one thing on their minds all the time sal giggled true she spun in the office chair beside the computer desk so you dont so youre not jealous maddy took off her glasses and wiped them on her tshirt it was decidedly odd having bob looking like that like some athleticfit catwalk model some amazonian beauty and yes having something like that gliding beautifully around was enough to make any female feel inadequate plain in comparison but then maddy was used to it on the other hand if sal was asking in a roundabout way whether she had feelings for liam well the answer was no not those sort of feelings liam was nicelooking charming in an oldfashioned gentlemanly way but what she felt for him more than anything else was pity a choking sadness every time i send him through im killing him just a little bit more she looked at sal no im not jealous im not you know like after him maddy it is time to activate the return window ok she replied turning to face the desk she began to tap the retrieval coordinates into the computer but hes nice said sal sure hes nice said maddy im sure he had girlfriends back in ireland but but im a couple of years older than him anyway and and its more like hes a little brother or a nephew really than you know sort of boyfriend material maddy doublechecked the coordinates anyway my god sal she grimaced at her i cant believe youre being so personal sorry said sal flicking a tress of dark hair out of her eye oh i just remembered youll never guess what i saw in a junk store down just a moment sal i need to concentrate chapter texas liam identified chan among the students it wasnt as obvious as hed thought it would be there were about seven or eight who looked oriental to him and most of them were younger than the other students but he knew edward chan was the youngest here and he zeroed in on a small boy at the front gaping wideeyed at the zeropoint energy reactor seemingly entranced by it becks gently tapped liams arm and leaned towards him information according to the mission data edward chan only has four minutes and seven seconds left to live liam nodded he looked around the chamber trying to identify what or who could possibly pose a threat to the boy if they were down to four minutes then presumably the lads killer was right here right now getting ready to make his move his eyes darted from mr kelly explaining the machinery and instrumentation to mr whitmore stroking his sparsely bearded chin thoughtfully to the two technicians manning a couple of data terminals one of them his gaze shifted to the students all of them still marvelling at the interior of the chamber and some of the incrediblesounding statistics that mr kelly was reeling off equivalent to all of the energy produced by coal oil natural gas over the last one hundred and fifty years one of them one of the students why not it could just as easily be one of the students after all liam was the same age as the oldest of them and an assassin would probably have a better chance smuggling himself in as a student than he would a member of staff after all that had worked for him and becks his gaze wandered from face to face looking for a nervous tic darting eyes lips moving in silent prayer someone clearly agonizing over the precise moment to strike becks gently tapped his arm again what now he hissed i am sensing precursor tachyon particles in the vicinity he looked at her uh their return window wasnt due yet not until ten minutes after chans supposed moment of death that was the arrangement are you sure becks nodded towards the reactor there they are appearing her eyes widened and her lids fluttered and blinked rapidly danger she suddenly barked at the top of her voice howard was almost beside chan his finger on the trigger inside his bag ready to pull the small weapon out and fire it at his back he wanted to be right beside chan right next to him to know as an absolute certainty he wasnt going to miss too much rested on this everything rested on this he was just a couple of yards from him when a tall girl with distinctive red hair at the back of the knot of students suddenly started shouting mr kelly stopped midsentence excuse me danger shouted the girl again her voice loud and urgent excuse me young lady replied mr whitmore this is not the place for some sort of stupid prank howard turned to look at the girl somethings wrong someone knows danger shouted the girl again but her finger pointed directly at the reactor not him tachyon interference with the reactor the reactor will explode howard had no idea what the hell she was on about perhaps it was just a coincidence perhaps she was just some flaky goth girl making some sort of a protest against experimenting with zeropoint energy he was with her on that but now was not the best time he wasnt going to be distracted he pushed his way forward towards chan as the other students began to step back warily from the reactor in response to her outburst at last standing beside the small boy he looked down at him his finger poised on the trigger ready to whip the gun out and fire chan turned to look up at him whats the girl at the back saying howard found himself shrugging i uh i guess shes having some kinda fit now stop it snapped mr whitmore pushing his way through the bemused students towards the girl nothing is going to explode chan grinned up at howard crazy girl huh and howard found himself smiling back at the kid somehow not quite ready not quite ready to pull out the gun and fire at point blank range he really hadnt expected to be looking down into a friendly face at the very moment he pulled the trigger on chan without a warning becks grabbed liam roughly by the shoulders and manhandled him back from the reactor towards the walkway leading to the sealed exit becks what the hell are you doing whats going on imminent threat of explosion she said crisply and calmly and a little too loudly her voice spooked the other students nearby who quickly began to join them backing away from it everybody calm down shouted mr kelly nothing is going to happen liam looked up at becks are you sure its going to becks suddenly stopped dragging him too late to escape she yanked liams arm downwards to the floor and he dropped to his knees ouch what are you doing she knelt down in front of him and wrapped her arms round his shoulders shielding him from the reactor liam peeked over her shoulder and saw the reactors thick metal casing suddenly start to ripple like jelly and a moment later begin to collapse in on itself what the becks reached out one hand and grabbed his nose painfully you must lower your head she ordered yanking him roughly down until he was almost doubled over his head in her lap then all of a sudden he felt the oddest tugging sensation as if he and becks and the world around them was being sucked into a gigantic laundry mangler stretched impossibly thin like elastic strands of spaghetti towards the reactor following the collapsed metal casing into some inconceivable pinpoint of infinity ooooooohhhhh jaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyzzzzzzussssssss chapter new york maddy and sal stared at the shimmering window in the middle of the archway through a curtain of undulating rippling air they could see the dim outlines of the storeroom theyd sent liam and the support unit to somethings definitely wrong whispered sal maddy nodded thats the third backup window theyve missed five minutes ago theyd been cheerfully prepping the scheduled return window assuming that the simple scouting mission had been a success and liam and the support unit would be ready and waiting to come back and tell them what exactly had happened to chan now for the third time both girls were staring at a dark storeroom with no sign of either of them oh boy uttered maddy i dont know what we do now thats it weve tried all the backup windows maddy she stepped towards the desk and leaned over the deck mic yes you should try the sixmonth window yes yes youre right bob was right it was worth a try she clicked the purge button on the screen and the shimmering window in the middle of the archway vanished with a soft pop and a gentle puff of displaced air she entered a new set of time coordinates exactly five months thirty days twentythree hours and fiftyfive minutes after the time theyd been sent into the future exactly five minutes before the support units mission time span was up and it was scheduled to selfdestruct it made sense it would be the last possible chance to rendezvous with a return window with the support unit dead liam would not be able to receive a tachyon signal to instruct him on a new rendezvous timestamp if they werent there in that storeroom six months after arriving and impatient to get back home then maddy had no idea what she could do next she clicked on the screen to confirm the new time coordinates and then activated the displacement machinery once again a twelvefootwide sphere of air began to shift and undulate revealing the storeroom again both girls squinted for a while at the dark space beyond same store cupboard a few things had been shifted around clearly someone had had a springclean in there but no sign of either liam or the support unit oh said sal weve really lost them maddy pinched her chin no let me think there was a way to communicate with the support unit a tachyon signal beam thats what theyd done last time aimed a broad beam of particles in the direction in which theyd guessed liam and bob were and transmitted an encoded signal back through history it had worked bob had picked it up bob she spoke into the mic can we send a tachyon signal beam forward affirmative we have enough power right what if we send it to say five minutes before whatever happened to chan happened what message asked sal i dunno something like abort the mission something is going to go wrong sal nodded yes we should do that maddy sat down in one of the office chairs and purged the open window it puffed out of existence she then opened the message interface and quickly tapped in a message return to the store cupboard immediately well pick you up there something is about to go wrong with your mission something is about to happen to you a return window will be waiting for you bobs dialogue box popped up you wish to send this message yes immediately recommendation a narrow beam transmission a narrow beam meant she needed to know quite precisely where to aim it but she had no idea where the two of them might be they might have been somewhere else in the facility something may have caused a detour a fire alarm perhaps or some malfunction in the lab may have resulted in everyone being evacuated bob lets make the beam broad enough to sweep the whole area make sure the support unit gets the message caution there will be technology in the vicinity that may be unpredictably affected by tachyon particles i really dont care if we mess up somebodys experiments or damage their precious gizmos i want liam to get that damned message she snapped angrily all right affirmative wide beam sweep to cover vicinity sal looked at her are you sure about this she nodded towards the computers bob just sort of cautioned us didnt he maddy spun the chair to face her you got any other suggestions sal shook her head right then she replied her voice brittle we have to make contact stay calm maddy youre the leader so stay calm her face softened as she reached for her inhaler on the desk sorry sal im just a bit stressed and no its ok i dont know what else to do confirm transmission bob you cautioned me because what is there some sort of danger to liam if we throw a whole load of tachyon beams forward information tachyon particles might interfere with zeropoint energy experiments that are being conducted at the institute at this time but does that endanger liam in some way unknown records show zeropoint energy research was abandoned as being potentially hazardous there is very little public domain data on the texas advanced energy research institutes work in this field so what do i do recommendation do nothing nothing correct wait for possible contact from them sending a tachyon signal forward may endanger liam and the support unit and might also present a security risk for the agency maddy stared at the screen in silence you want me to do absolutely nothing when they might be in trouble and need our help youre asking me to do nothing but sit on my hands affirmative a tachyon signal might be detected by sensitive instrumentation at the institute and the message intercepted this would clearly alert them to the existence of time travel and the agency they could know time travel is possible fourteen years before edward chan does his maths paper added sal our message to liam might alter history just as much as someone killing chan sal is correct so youre saying we wait for them to get themselves out of whatevers happened that is my recommendation they are very capable maddy chewed her lip in thought for a moment and this is my call you are team leader i can only offer data and tactical advice right well then i say forget potential contamination forget any of their zeropoint experiments we might be messing up and stuff any security risks for the agency theyve pretty much left us all alone to fend for ourselves so far im damned if im going to sacrifice liam just to keep them happy we warn liam and the support unit to abort the scouting trip we get them back home and then then we can deal with any time changes we may have caused all right sal nodded i suppose its a plan maddy turned to the computer screen all right the cursor blinked thoughtfully on and off in the dialogue box and they heard the computers hard drives whirring softly finally after a few moments the cursor flickered forward affirmative cool said maddy so bob send that message to five minutes before chans recorded time of death affirmative as bob proceeded with beaming the message maddy prepared to open a window yet again in the storeroom for the same moment in time and resolved to keep it open for at least ten minutes that would give them enough time she hoped to receive the message wherever they were in the institute and make their way back to the storeroom she was about to activate the time window when bobs dialogue box appeared centre screen information there is an intense energy feedback loop interfering with the tachyon signal beam meaning probability that this is an explosion her breath caught in her throat an explosion correct oh my god maddy felt the blood drain from her face how big unable to specify it is a large signature reading she looked at sal oh my god you dont think sal swallowed nervously and didnt say anything her wide eyes said it all bob tell me it wasnt us that just caused that to happen our tachyon signal bobs cursor blinked silently for a few seconds the tachyon signal is the most likely cause of the explosion the precursor particles may have caused a reaction oh god what have i done chapter brilliant white floating in a void of perfect featureless white to liam it felt like hours staring out at it hanging motionless in the void as if he was floating in a glass of milk it felt like hours but it could have been minutes seconds even hed begun to wonder if he was actually dead and hanging around in some preafterlife limbo then he saw the faintest flicker of movement in the thick milk world around him an angel coming for him it looked like a cloud of slightly dimmer white and it danced around like a phantom gliding in decreasing circles that brought it ever closer to him it looked familiar ive seen that before then he remembered the day that foster had pulled him from the sinking titanic in the archway as hed woken the three of them from their slumber the seeker there were more out there faint and far off drawn to him as if they could smell his presence like sharks smelling blood perhaps the first seeker had silently called out to them that there was something here for them all to share oh marymotherofgod theyre going to rip me to pieces the nearest seeker swooped still closer to him and the faint cloud of grey began to take form he thought he could make out the head and shoulders of the indeterminate shape almost humanlike and a face that took fleeting form beautiful feminine he almost began to think he was right first time and that this was heaven and those swooping forms were angels coming to escort him to the afterlife then that vaguely familiar feminine face stretched elongated revealing a row of razor fangs and the eyes turned to dark sockets that promised him nothing but death it lunged towards him and then he was staring up at another face framed with hair dangling down towards him tickling his nose with piercing grey eyes staring intently at him liam oconnor are you all right becks affirmative are you all right she asked flatly you appear undamaged by the explosion he felt her strong hands running up and down his arms and legs around his torso no apparent fractures im ok i think just a little dizzy so i am he began to sit up and she helped him you are disorientated she said he looked up at a clear blue sky and a dazzling sun he blinked back the sunlight a curious vaguely violet hue to it and shaded his eyes with a hand jayzus where are we is this another world negative she looked at him then corrected herself no we are where we were she replied but when the spherical chamber and laboratory buildings were gone instead of the institutes watersprinkled lawns and flowerbeds there was nothing but jungle if this was the same place then it had to be some significant time in the future or the past it certainly wasnt the tachyon interference caused an explosive reaction said becks we were pulled through the zeropoint window into what is known as chaos space chaos space i am unable to define chaos space i have no detailed data on it and then what we were dumped out into reality again correct he saw another head suddenly appear above a large lush green fern leaf somebody else dizzily sitting up and wondering where on earth they were it was one of the students a black girl her hair neatly thatched into cornrows a gold hooped earring glinted in the sunlight what the she muttered as her eyes slowly panned round the tall green trees and drooping vines finally her eyes rested on liam and becks hello there said liam waving a hand and smiling goofily she stared at him silently with eyes that still seemed to be trying to work out what she was seeing he noticed another head appearing out of the foliage several dozen yards away he recognized the receding scruffy hair and sparsely bearded jowls of the teacher whod been with the group of students during the tour of the institute other heads appeared all looking confused and frightened spread out across a clearing in the jungle a hundred yards in diameter liam recognized the institutes smartly dressed tour guide one of the technicians whod been in the chamber and the rest of the students whwhat happened called out the teacher the guides carefully groomed silver hair was dishevelled his smart suit rumpled and dirtied with mud i i dont know i just liam looked at becks were going to have to take charge of things arent we she looked at him blankly the mission parameters have changed liam sighed no kidding he was about to ask her if she had any idea at all of when in time they were when he heard a shrill scream echo across the clearing what was that it came again sharp shrill and terrified he got to his feet as did several others and pushed through clusters of kneehigh ferns towards where the sound was coming from becks was instantly by his side striding slightly ahead of him without any trepidation liam realized he felt reassured to have her there despite her diminutive frame despite lacking the intimidating bulk of bob he had a feeling she was a great deal more dangerous than she looked finally a yard ahead of him she stopped liam stepped round her and looked down the blonde girl hed spoken to earlier he remembered her name it was laura wasnt it was screaming her eyes locked on to the thing that was lying in the tall grass beside her it took liam a moment for him to make sense of what he was seeing on the ground then then he got it understood what it was his stomach flopped and lurched and it took every ounce of willpower he had not to double over and vomit the teacher emerged from the tall grass to stand next to liam he followed lauras wideeyed gaze and then sucked in a mouthful of air oh my god thats not thats not what i think it is he whispered and turned to look at liam is it among the tall fronds of vegetation nestled a small twisted mass of muscle and bone at one end liam could see a long braid of blonde hair matted with drying blood and halfway along the contorted form he spotted a solitary pink adidas trainer hanging half on and half off a pale and perfectly normallooking foot it had to be one of the three blonde girls theyd tagged behind on the way into the chamber he could quite understand the girl laura screaming theyd been chatting giggling and exchanging phone numbers only ten minutes ago liam recalled foster saying sometimes it happened sometimes very rarely the energy of a portal could turn a person inside out oh jayzus what a mess half an hour later those of the group that had survived the blast and arrived in one piece had made a rough assessment of their predicament dotted around the jungle clearing theyd made the gruesome discovery of more bodies just like the girls turned inside out and almost unrecognizable as human sixteen of them of the thirtyfive people whod been in the chamber when the explosion or more accurately implosion had occurred only sixteen of them appeared to have made it through alive now gathered together in the middle of the clearing well away from the forbidding edge of thick jungle it was whitmore who first seemed to be stirring from a state of stunned shock he wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his sleeve and narrowed his eyes as he studied becks you he said yes you i remember now you said it was going to explode just just before it actually did beckss face remained impassive that is correct hang on he said again his eyes suddenly narrowing with dawning realization you youre not one of mmy kids youre not liam could see where this was going it was pointless continuing to pretend to be highschool students a moment longer what just happened whatevers just happened blustered whitmore you damn well knew it was going to happen his voice rose in pitch who are you is this some sort of terrorist thing becks shook her head slowly her face impassive negative we are not terrorists whitmore fell silent his lips quivered with more questions he wanted to ask but he was struggling to know what exactly to ask where to begin excuse me their heads all turned towards a boy with kinky ginger hair neatly sideparted into a succession of waves and thick bottletop glasses that made his eyes seem to bulge like a startled frog he pointed to his name tag my names franklyn you can call me that or just frank will do he smiled at them uncertainly uhh i just wanted to say that this is going to sound really weird but i guess ill just come out and say it what snapped whitmore well he pointed up at the sky you see them all eyes drifted towards the top of some trees twenty yards away a long branch leaning out over the clearing with strange dangling willowlike green fronds drooping to the ground in among them a pair of dragonflies danced and zigzagged with a buzz of wings they could hear from where they stood those are huge uttered kelly good grief twofoot threefoot wingspan at a guess uhhuh said franklyn theyre really big and im pretty sure i know what species that is the others looked at him its a petalurid i think yeah im sure thats the right name great said laura so now we know no thats not the important bit said franklyn he looked at her they should be extinct well obviously theyre not she replied oh yes they are weve only ever had fossils of insects that size whitmore stood up oh my god hes right he watched the two dragonflies emerge from the overhanging branch and dart out into the open their wings buzzing noisily like airborne hairdryers insects havent been that size since he swallowed looked at the others well i mean millions and millions of years petalurids uttered franklyn again late cretaceous im pretty sure of that kelly got to his feet and stood beside franklyn what are you saying the boy wiped a fog of moisture from his glasses blinking back the bright day from his small eyes what im saying mr kelly is those things havent existed alive in like well i guess something like sixtyfive million years chapter new york maddy where are you going maddy ignored sals pleading voice as she strode across the archway cranked up the shutter and stepped out into the backstreet i cant do this i cant do this she felt the first tears roll down her cheeks as she picked her way along the rubbishstrewn sidewalk towards south th street at the top her first proper mission in charge and she was already going to pieces an impetuous decision on her part stupid and hotheaded enough to go against bobs reasoned advice and now she might just be responsible for killing liam and the support unit not only that but shed probably also caused the deaths of dozens of others and most importantly edward chan i cant do this she muttered im just not ready for this she stepped out of the backstreet on to the corner and watched the busy intersection for a while traffic turning right to pick up the bridge road left towards the river pedestrians making their way over to their jobs in manhattan all of them oblivious to the commercial jets already in the air and heading towards their doom she wanted foster back needed him back what possessed him to think for one moment she was actually ready to run a field office his prerecorded how to answers stored on the computer just werent enough she needed him to talk to to explain the technology to her more fully to tell her more about the agency and their place in it there were so many gaps in her knowledge she didnt even know enough to have an idea what questions to ask she was floundering damn you foster she hissed under her breath and wiped at her wet cheeks the old man could be anywhere in new york if indeed hed decided to stay on in the city hed walked out on her on one of the monday mornings walked right out of the starbucks with a bag over one shoulder leaving her alone with her coffee it was tuesday today if he was that desperate to see the world before he died then he might just as well be on a greyhound bus to some other state or even on a plane to somewhere exotic face it hes gone for good she just got up and left said sal i sensed emotional stress markers in her voice well duh of course shes upset shes just i mean she may have just killed liam sal realized her own voice sounded shrill and loud oh jahulla is he dead did she kill him insufficient data the residue signal suggests a sudden and violent enlargement of a dimensional pinhole releasing a vast amount of energy like a bomb correct just like a bomb she slumped down in the office chair so dead then she uttered looking down at her lap and suddenly beginning to feel the stab of pain the equivalent in days of almost three months had passed since foster had pulled her from a falling building so much had happened in that time a world almost conquered by nazis and then in the blink of an eye reduced to a radioactive wasteland their trip to the basement of the museum of natural history finding the clues liams message in the guest book and all the cleanup and fixup after that whole nightmare it almost felt like another life mumbai mum and dad the burning building this place this scruffy archway crisscrossed with cables had begun to feel like a home and liam and maddy even bob like an odd new family now in one moment with one simple mistake she wondered if that was all gone she looked up from her hands wrestling each other in her lap to see bobs silent blinking response on the screen not necessarily what what do you mean not necessarily do you mean not necessarily dead affirmative they may have been transported you mean like one of our time windows correct the sudden dilation of a dimensional pinhole being used to extract zeropoint energy may have functioned in a similar way to a portal where do you know where could we find them negative i have no possible way of knowing when they would have been transported to it would be random but but they could be alive right alive somewhere affirmative sal but in the same geographic location is there anything we could do to try to find them negative we are in the same situation as before we sent the tachyon signal if the explosion did not kill them then they are sometime in the past or future the rising hope she was feeling that there might be a way to find them and bring them back in one piece began to falter my ai duplicate and liam may attempt to establish contact with the field office provided it can be done with a minimum of time contamination you mean like liam did with the museum guest book a message in history correct if they have not been transported too far in time it may be possible for them to find a way to communicate without causing a dangerous level of contamination so what we wait we wait and hope for a signal affirmative we must wait and we must observe there is no other viable course of action chapter million years bc jungle excuse me said laura when did you say franklyn finished wiping his glasses dry and put them back on again he took his time savouring the silent rapt attention of the others sitting together in the clearing i said sixtyfive million years ago the others shared a stunned silence eyes meeting eyes and all of them wide the enormity of the fact taking a long while to sink in for all of them it was whitmore who broke the silence sixtyfive million years so that definitely takes us to near the end of the cretaceous period he looked at the boy whose glasses were already beginning to fog up again from the humidity it is the cretaceous isnt it franklyn nodded correct late cretaceous to be precise weve travelled in time uttered kelly thats thats not possible whoa one of the other kids cried whitmore and franklyn were looking at each other warily a gesture not missed by liam what either of you gentlemen going to tell us what a bleedin late crustation is liam studied them suspiciously you two fellas looked at each other all funny just then that means something right whitmore pursed his lips his eyebrows arched as if in disbelief at what he was about to utter if franklyn here is right he said watching the footlong dragonflies hover and drop among a cluster of ferns nearby then this is dinosaur times were in dinosaur times laura gasped oh god she took two or three deep breaths that hooted like a steam train coming down a tunnel like a woman in labour oh my god i was watching jurassic park last night i dont want to be eaten by a rex i dont want to be eaten by a several of the other students not all of them girls began to whimper at the prospect the rest began to talk at once liam watched whitmore struggling with the situation himself shaking his head incredulously and balling his fists in silence kelly meanwhile was gazing up at the blue sky and the slightly oddcoloured sun as if hoping to find an answer up there somebody needs to take charge thought liam or theyre all going to die he was damned if he was going to volunteer though to be responsible for this lot he and becks were probably going to fare much better on their own one of the three men was going to have to step up and take care of these kids but as it happened as liam was beginning to wonder how the pair of them were going to discreetly extract themselves with edward chan in their possession the decision was made for him you said whitmore his lost expression wiped away all of a sudden remembering there was an issue as yet unresolved his voice cut across the clamour of all the others yes you the goth girl he said pointing at becks he looked at liam and you you know what happened dont you the pair of you werent in my party and you knew that explosion was going to happen so youd better start telling us who the heck you are there was an instant silence as all eyes swivelled to him and becks liam grinned selfconsciously uh we thats to say me and becks here were not er students as such were sort of agents from another time fourteen pairs of eyes on him and none of them seemed to have anything close to a grasp on what hed just said see were time travellers and we came along today to try to protect him he said pointing at edward chan who was sitting on the grass arms wrapped round his huddled knees edward chans eyes widened uh am i in trouble you edward we came to find out how we were going to protect you from an attempt on your life the others looked at the small chinese boy then back at liam you better explain about him becks said liam youve got all the facts in your head becks nodded listen carefully she began time travel will become a viable technology in the year when a professor roald waldstein will build the worlds first time machine and successfully transport himself into the past and return safely to his time the practical technology developed by waldstein in is largely based on the theories developed and published in scientific american by the department of physics university of texas in the article is entitled zeropoint energy energy from spacetime vacuum or interdimensional leakage kellys tired face lit up you gotta be kidding whitmore looked at the bewildered young boy hugging his own knees on the ground in front of him so how does this affect this boy beckss cool grey eyes panned smoothly across to chan the article published in scientific american is a reproduction of a maths thesis presented by one edward aaron chan an act of academic plagiarism by his supervising professor edward looked up at her me really correct you will submit your dissertation to the department of physics for evaluation with an almost identical title in the summer of when you are twentysix years of age the department head professor miles jackson will attempt to take credit for your work when it is approved for publication several months later but he will be exposed as a plagiarist shortly after the articles publication but you said youd come to protect him from an attempt on his life why would someone want to kill chan asked whitmore edward chan is the true originator of time travel replied becks in the future timetravel technology becomes forbidden under international law because of the danger it poses to all mankind this law is a result of years of campaigning by roald waldstein the inventor of the first viable time machine to prevent any further development of the technology wald the man who builds this first machine said one of the students a toughlooking hispanic boy liam noticed his name tag was still on his chest juan hernandez beckss gaze panned across to him she waited silently for him to continue why asked juan why build the thing then you know campaign against usin it dont make any sense liam answered waldstein never ever revealed what he saw on his first and only trip into the past never talked to anyone about it it was a big secret what he saw but he was once heard to say that hed looked upon the very bowels of hell itself liam could have added more could have added that maybe hed glimpsed for a few seconds something of that himself becks continued waldsteins campaign gained popular support it is logical to presume that it may be one of his more fanatical supporters who has somehow managed to travel back in time to find chan and attempt to kill him to retroactively prevent him writing his thesis and thus prevent or forestall the invention of time travel a long silence followed filled only with the gentle rustle of the jungles trees and the faroff highpitched squawk of some jungle creature it was whitmore who cut it short well ok thats all very fascinating but what just happened where are we and how do we get back beckss eyelids fluttered for a moment the geopositional coordinates will not have changed we are exactly where we were yeah right man snapped juan there aint no jungle like this not in texas were still in the same place said liam but its when we are thats changed right affirmative liam nudged becks yes becks corrected herself which if franklyn is correct is sixtyfive million years ago said whitmore loosening his tie and unbuttoning the top button of his skyblue shirt already stained with dark underarm patches of sweat liam smiled thinly yup thats about it the technician whod survived and come through with them dipped his head and shook it then we really are totally totally in trouble man liam wanted to say something like hed been in this kind of mess before that there might possibly be a way out of here for them that at the very least they had a genetically enhanced and very lethal combat unit with an embedded supercomputer disguised as an oversized gothic barbie doll here to help them all out but he figured right now that would probably be one detail too many for them to have to cope with kelly removed his linen jacket no longer looking smooth and groomed and like whitmore sweating large dark patches in the hot and humid air so what are we going to do now and once more all eyes rested on liam aw jayzus what im in charge now it looked like he and becks werent going to be able to sidle away that they were lumbered with the others liam sighed survival he said eventually i suppose wed better start thinking about that you know water food weapons some sort of a camp the rest if there is a rest well i suppose that can come later chapter million years bc jungle howard took a break from the work of hacking at the vines and bamboo canes with his improvised machete a jagged strip of metal part of the reactors shell with a handle made of coarse leaves wrapped round one end and secured with shoelaces as a machete it worked surprisingly well and from the other jagged strips of reinforced alloy that had materialized in the past with them theyd managed to produce nine very useful cutting implements like this one the hispanic boy juan was working alongside him while across the clearing shimmering with the heat of the midday sun he could see some of the others fashioning simple spears out of the thicker bamboo canes theyd cut down thats bull man muttered juan following his gaze we aint gonna kill anything with these pointy sticks howard nodded wearily and grunted something back but his eyes were on chan standing next to that weird redhaired girl as he hamfistedly attempted to whittle a sharp end on a threefoot cane she and the odd irish boy theyd given their names as becks and liam but if they were covert agency operatives from the year they were probably aliases which agency though who sent them as far as howard knew no government anywhere was meant to have functioning timetravel technology although obviously the most powerful nations the chinese federation the european bloc the united states must secretly have been developing it and those two presumably must be field operatives working for one of them here to protect chan the irish boy seemed to be calling the shots with whitmore kelly and the technician lam happy for him to do so howard was content to go along with the status quo for now happy to carry on playing the role of timid young lenny baumgardner a highschool student with straight as and a perfect school attendance record it kept things simple for the moment after all the presiding question now was one of survival the basics food water shelter but his focus had to remain whatever happened on the mission on what hed set out to do to end young chans life and absolutely guarantee that the uniquely brilliant theoretical concepts his older twentysixyearold mathematicians mind would one day produce would never see the light of day brilliance like chans was rare the kind of genius and intuition that comes along once in a generation once in a century even chans work was going to end up being as lifechanging as einsteins once was more so in fact without that published thesis the famous waldstein would perhaps never have been anything more than an anonymous hobbyist inventor working in his garage while the world of might be facing a dark time ahead with water food and energy shortages global warming and catastrophic levels of overpopulation at the very least history as it was would still be safe at the very least mankind would not be meddling with dimensions it had no possibility of understanding dimensions that could contain anything just because a door can be opened doesnt mean it should be opened but chan was here now and not in the year sixtyfive million years away from helping mankind make its biggestever mistake howard wondered whether that meant his mission was as good as done did he still need to kill him after all the explosion presumably caused by something to do with those two agents perhaps some side effect of time travel and the fields of energy it radiates had propelled them far back in time surely further back in time than any prototype time machine currently in development could ever reach and how would they know when they were anyway sixtyfive million years to choose from like a needle in a haystack like a needle in a whole barn full of hay in fact go ahead pick a year see if you get lucky he smiled its done the worlds safe now its done which was a relief because now all he had to think about was the business of survival here in this jungle with nothing for company but overlarge dragonflies and whatever other giant creepycrawlies and cretaceous creatures lurked in the jungle and of course a bunch of frightened kids and several men who ought to be showing a little more backbone howard had done his bit for mankind now just surviving in this wilderness for the foreseeable future he wasnt ready yet to be a dino dinner that was for him he looked up at the thick edge of the jungle ahead of him a ribbon of dark green foliage and tall canopy trees that wrapped itself all the way round the clearing and god knows what big hungry things are wandering around in there oh thats just great thats just bloody great liam stared at the swiftly surging river a tumbling torrent of white suds that swirled around and over a bed of worn boulders so it runs all the way around us said kelly his smart linen business suit was smudged with dirt and sweat not the most practical clothing for jungle trekking hed tied off the jacket round his waist and rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt the tie was still on though liam noticed a token that kelly was not quite ready to abandon hope that help might arrive at any moment and hed want to look his best for it i think were on a sort of island kelly continued theyd spent the morning exploring the immediate surroundings beyond the clearing whichever direction theyd taken theyd soon come across the energetic roar of water and glimpsed the glinting fastmoving river through the thinning jungle island was about right approximately three or four acres of jungle with a central clearing shaped roughly like a tear drop the pointed tip of the island was where they stood now staring at the rolling water the river split in two around their spit of land to the right of them it broadened out into a wide slowermoving channel slowermoving but still brisk enough so that liam wouldnt dare chance trying to cross it but then he couldnt swim more than that water scared the bejeezus out of him not that he needed the others to know anything about his pet fears right now to their left the river compressed into a narrower channel thirty feet across lined with boulders and became a violent roaring ribbon of snowwhite froth and energy a fool might try to swim the wider channel but only a completely mad fool would attempt a crossing on this side were trapped on here said laura looking around at the others arent we at least weve got drinking water liam shrugged he gave them all a cheery smile so its not all bad news becks took a couple of steps down the wet shingle towards the raging river and silently appraised their surroundings after a while she turned round the island is a suitable defensive position defensive called out one of the students liam turned round it was a large boy whose cheeks glistened with sweat beneath a mop of dark frizzy hair and he was still wearing his name tag jonah middleton defensible against what dude dinosaurs uttered laura her voice shuddering slightly whitmore nodded yes dinosaurs he turned to franklyn how goods your knowledge of the late cretaceous pretty good he replied you want to know what species we can expect to encounter please tell me we dont get the trex blurted laura not that oh we got those all right franklyn put his hands on his hips but theyre more likely found on open terrain not jungle like this its the velociraptors that scared me said lam his head bobbed energetically as he talked his dark ponytail wagging like a dogs tail as he looked from one person to another seriously scary things those he nodded sombrely i seen all three jurassic movies guys and its those smart little ones you got to watch out for there are no raptors franklyn shook his head theyre asian and died out eightyfive million years ago we should expect to see lemmesee ankylosaurus thats the tankshaped one with a spiky club for a tail pachycephalosaurus thats the upright one with like a cyclists safety helmet on his head triceratops you all know that one right heads nodded parasaurolophus the duckbilled one with that elvisquiff bone sticking out backwards but those are all herbivores arent they said whitmore what about the carnivores franklyn pursed his lips we got rex of course but no raptors thats the good news oh great sighed laura that means theres bad news well im afraid there are several varieties of the smaller therapods he said by way of explanation liam shrugged at him and those are what therapods same genus as the raptor franklyn continued small predators three to six foot tall they walk on their back legs and have poorly developed front arms theyre pack hunters three to six foot said liam that doesnt sound so bad then yo dude said jonah you actually like seen the jurassic park movies liam shook his head no i presume its one of them talkie motion pictures several of the students glanced at each other talkie motion pictures you did say you were from the future didnt you said kelly well not as such not directly no actually im fro caution said becks striding back up the shingle towards them confidential information her glare silenced the stirring murmur of voices that is unnecessary data you do not need to know anything about the operative liam oconnor actually i think id like to know a little more about you as well said whitmore i mean who the h stop barked becks this conversation will now cease laura made a face she stepped forward and planted herself in front of becks both girls about the same height eyes locked in a silent challenge of each other oh and who exactly made you the boss becks silently appraised her you are a contaminant and a mission liability what whats that supposed to mean beckss cold glare remained on the girl for an unsettling moment liam wondered whether she might just reach out and snap lauras neck like a dry twig hed seen bob effortlessly do far worse to countless grown combatfit men becks he called out leave her alone the support unit finally spoke liam oconnor is boss i am just the support unit support unit lauras face creased with a look of bemusement she turned to liam sheesh what exactly is the problem with your sister she got some kind of behavioural problem she talks like some kind of robot said keisha well now since you liam was about to explain but becks cut him off again irrelevant data she took a step away from laura towards him lauras challenge instantly dismissed and forgotten recommendation liam liam nodded go on a bridging device can be constructed she turned her gaze towards the roaring river to their left the narrowest width is precisely thirtytwo feet seven inches her eyes then scanned the tall and straight trunks of the nearest deciduous trees along the riverbank these trees are all of suitable length and just how are we supposed to fell a tree said lam all weve got is mr kellys penknife some bamboo spears and a bunch of freakin useless hatchets liam decided hed better start sounding decisive and leaderlike well now listen me and becksll figure something out so we will right becks sis she looked at him question what are we still pretending to be brother and sister the others stared at them liam sighed not any more chapter new york sal spun round in the chair at the sound of the roller shutter rattling up maddy maddy ducked beneath and into the archway yeah its me she replied in a dull lifeless voice i thought youd left us maybe gone for good maddys face creased with a tired smile as she crossed the floor it did cross my mind you shouldnt blame yourself but look dont please maddy raised a hand to hush her she slumped down in a swivel chair beside sal i screwed up i was hasty and impatient and killed liam in the process ive got to find my own way of dealing with that and its not going to help you trying to tell me that i shouldnt be beating myself up over it she buried her face in her hands pushing up her glasses and rubbing tired eyes no listen to me replied sal sitting forward bob says he might not be dead maddy peered through her fingers in fact bobs been analysing the tachyon signature around the window we opened hes almost certain that we caused a portal not an explosion the screen in front of them flickered to life sal is correct an probability of a random portal sal reached out for her arm hes alive maddy do you see alive she made a face probably slowly maddy lowered her hands from her face oh my god you serious yeah maddy turned towards the screen bob youre sure of this probability the decay signature of the particles while our window was open was very similar in structure to the decay of a closing window can you work out where we sent him where is likely to be nowhere he was unlikely to have been geographically repositioned when then when negative i have no data the momentary look of hope on maddys face quickly slipped away so weve blasted him into history and weve no idea when affirmative she looked at sal and what im supposed to feel better about this this is supposed to be good news hes alive maddy thats something hes lost lost for good might as well be dead but dont you see its worse than that if he and the other support unit and god knows how many other people have been blasted back into history weve really messed up thats a whole load of contamination right there so weve been here before weve fixed time before in fact look if they cause a whole load of contamination thats a good thing right bob that means weve got a chance to negative contamination is to be avoided but if they change things and we get time waves here in itll give us some sort of clue where they are affirmative see we can find them its possible for example if liams any time in the last century he could make his way to new york and use the guest book again maddy shook her head maybe maybe but they could be any time any time sal i mean not just a year ago or a hundred but maybe a thousand ten thousand a million god if hes just five hundred years back what document could he scribble in then there wasnt a written language here in america in those days it was just indians and wilderness sal shrugged and if hes like thousands of years back she turned to look at the screen thats possible right affirmative provided there is enough energy invested in a portal there is no limit to how far back in time a subject can be sent if hes gone back thousands of years sal any attempt to contact us could totally change history i mean really mess things up just look at what happened when those neonazis went back to they turned the present into a nuclear wasteland im just saying saying saying what were totally messed up here god there could already be a freaking time wave on the way and then what new york vanishes more zombies sal reached for her arm again maddy please youve got to stay calm we need you calm youre the strategist you can figure this out i know you can maddy shook her head uhh she muttered fosterd figure it out but me hed know exactly what to do in fact if the old man had been here he would have been smart enough not to have caused this problem in the first place but hes out there right hes out there somewhere in new york what about the starbucks that was a monday morning at about nine if i went there tomorrow morning she quickly realized that wouldnt work foster was gone he wasnt back in the arch when the field office bubble reset foster was gone from their fortyeighthour world gone from monday and tuesday maddys jaw suddenly dropped open what about wednesday sal was looking at her maddy you ok but where would he be on wednesday september twelfth she tried to remember their last conversation in the coffee shop shed asked him where hed go what he planned to do with the time he had left to live hed said hed always wanted to visit new york to see the sights just like a tourist maddy herself had been to new york so many times before her death that she no longer thought like a tourist no longer mentally checked off the places one had to go see sal what places would you visit in new york if this was like a holiday trip uh if you were a tourist what would you most want to go see why are you just tell me she scowled in thought for a moment well i suppose the empire state building the statue of liberty the museum of natural history maddy why whatre you thinking maddy nodded yes the empire state building the statue of liberty she could try those first maddy she looked up at sal im going to go find foster bring him back if i can hell know what to do sal because i sure dont but hes gone for good you said he wasnt here when the bubble reset hes gone gone from our two days yeah but not wednesday not thursday not any other day after that youre going to ride forward maddy considered that but the less time travel she did forward or backwards the better foster had quietly told her timeriding was a bit like smoking like a single cigarette it was impossible to say for sure how much a single smoke might take off your life but if you could ever avoid having a cigarette that could only be a good thing ill miss the reset thats what ill do said maddy ill go into wednesday and hang around those places who knows i might get lucky you cant do that youll be gone for good like foster no well schedule a return window maddy pinched her lip in thought yeah well schedule a window at lets say eight in the evening on wednesday she turned round and pointed towards the shutter door just outside the archway in our side street thatll bring me right back into our time bubble back into monday but what if a time wave happens while youre gone maddy shrugged resigned i cant see you coping any worse than maddy messup carters done so far right oh shaddyah we should be figuring out how to get liam back not messing around visiting tourist attractions yeah but think about it theres nothing we can do is there just wait around wait for a time wave to hit us and hope itll lead us directly to him thats it thats pretty much all we can do right now just wait well at least while were sitting around here doing nothing useful i can try and find foster see what else he can suggest sal clamped her mouth shut make sense sal nodded slowly ok she replied fiddling with a pair of plastic bangles on her wrist do you want me to come with you two pairs of eyes the screen in front of them flickered recommendation sal should remain here as the observer maddy nodded reluctantly bobs right if we get a time ripple preceding a wave we need you here as our early headsup you should stay here and do your midmorning walk around times square just like always and anyway if the poop hits the fan and for some reason i end up being stuck out in wednesday itll be good to know theres someone left holding the fort right sal tried a confident nod uh yeah right thats the plan then maddy looked at her watch it was just gone five in the afternoon outside the sun would be looking ahead for a place to settle beyond the smokefilled sky of manhattan and most of new york was already back at home the normal day of work abandoned hours ago as they silently watched live news feeds from their dinner tables tonight new york was going to be a ghost town just like it always was on the tuesday as the clock ticked down towards their field office time bubble resetting itself chapter million years bc jungle liam wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his hand jayzus its almost as hot as the old ladys boiler room so it is old lady it was mr whitmore liam thought the man had been far enough behind not to hear his badtempered mutterings he shrugged oh just a just an old ship i used to work on he stopped where he was catching his breath for a moment the hot humid air felt heavy on his lungs they stood still for a while trading ragged breaths and listening to the subdued noises of the jungle around them the tap of water dripping on waxy leaves the creak of the tall canopy trees subtly swaying and shifting the echoing chatter and squawk of some flying creatures far above amid the branches further back down the trail hed been hacking out with his improvised machete he heard the others stumbling towards them franklyn their resident dino expert grinning at the prehistoric jungle around him like a kid in a candy store lam behind him squinting up at the bright lances of sunlight piercing down through the cathedrallike vaulted roof of arched branches and thick leaves and jonah middleton whistling something tuneless as he stumbled clumsily after them the rest of the group were back on their island fixing a counterweight to the bridge so it could be raised and constructing a camp under beckss supervision two days and nights theyd been here already and both nights like clockwork rain had come down in a torrential downpour soaking them all and making sleep impossible tonight hopefully with becks hard at work a oneman construction team theyd at least have shelters to huddle beneath you used to work on a ship said whitmore his breath wheezing past each word was that before you became what did you say you were some sort of timetravelling secret agent i didnt really say it like that mr whitmore did i he scratched his beard i think thats exactly what you said oh well even though that does sound a little barmy that pretty much describes me and becks so it does whitmore shook his head im still trying to get my head round this being real you know its just liam grinned oh itll mess with your head all right thats for sure youre really from the future well actually not precisely the future as it happens whitmore looked confused by that liam wondered if he should really say any more becks was right in that the more information they handed out to these people the greater the potential risk to blowing the agencys anonymity but he also figured what the heck they were here and the future was sixtyfive million years away might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb i was born in cork in ireland in if you must know and i shouldve died in he looked at whitmore and his grin spread even wider aboard a ship you might just have heard a little something about the titanic the mans eyes widened lam franklyn and jonah joined them then all five of them filling the quiet jungle with their rasping breath whats up said lam noticing the goggleeyed expression on whitmores face thats surely thats just impossible blustered whitmore well now replied liam looking around at the cretaceous foliage youd think all of this little pickle were in would be impossible right i mean us lot stranded in dinosaur times whitmore ran a hand through his thinning salt and pepper hair but the titanic you were actually on the titanic junior steward deck e so i was jonah pushed his frizzy fringe out of eyes that were filling his face no way dude lam wiped some sweat from his brow this is just getting weirder and weirder i was recruited see the agency plucked me moments from death just as the ships spine snapped and apparently both halves went sliding under made no difference to time do you see it made no difference to history whether my bones ended up at the bottom of the atlantic with everyone elses or not thats how the agency recruits poor fools like me wholl never be missed my god whispered whitmore thats really quite incredible what about the other one asked franklyn jonah nodded appreciatively yeah your foxy goth girlfriend liam assumed he was referring to the support unit becks no shes uh shes certainly not my girlfriend whatever said franklyn where does she come from lam shook his head maybe we should be asking when does she come from franklyns face stiffened at being corrected yes when liam decided a small white lie was better right now telling them she was some kind of a robot killing machine probably wasnt the best thing to be telling them the last thing their little group needed was a reason not to trust becks they all needed each other and they certainly needed her help oh becks is from the future something or other i guess thats why she talks a little funny every now and then she is kind of weird said franklyn like spock or something so liam since it looks like youre the only one who understands whats happened here said whitmore it seems were all going to have to rely on you to get us home i presume you have some sort of a plan of action you know beyond merely exploring our immediate surroundings a plan the closest thing to doing any planning so far had been figuring out how hed use the rubbish machete in his hand if a dinosaur was to suddenly emerge from the undergrowth ahead the plan yes said whitmore i mean i presume theres a way out of this mess for us isnt there liam could see the other three were staring expectantly at him well uh well one things for sure gentlemen we need to stay right where we are on that island why because its the exact same place that we were joseph lam nodded the same geocoordinates as the lab right thats right we havent moved an inch in position just in time if we happened to up sticks and move camp somewhere else it would make it even harder for someone to find us so were best staying put right where we are whitmore dabbed at his damp face with the cuff of his shirt this agency you work for are they like a government agency like the cia like the fbi something like that liam hadnt heard of either of those so he decided to do what he did best bluff sure theyre just like them fellas mr whitmore but you know uhh much bigger and better and of course from the future and theyre going to come for us right theyre going to get us all out of here arent they liam offered him a stern confident nod sure they are weve just got to hold on here itll take them a little time to find us but they will i assure you they will they looked at each other uncertainly until the scraggly beard beneath whitmores stubby round nose stretched with a smile well all right then im sure between us weve got enough knowhow to make do for a few days his smile spread to the others id like to see at least one dinosaur first though said franklyn be real lame not to yeah said jonah pulling out a mobile phone from his pocket that would be like awesome you know i could stick it up on youtube whoa no he pushed his frizzy mop of hair aside better than that dude do it as a payperdownload i could make like millions out of this whitmore shook his head what is it with you kids these days opportunity replied jonah thats what it is my man a golden freakin moneymakin opportunity whitmore sighed chapter million years bc jungle becks stood to one side dispassionately observing the work of the others as they hacked at the slim straight trunks of the smaller trees theyd already felled stripping branches from their sides to produce usable lightweight logs for construction she had them divided into two groups one doing this job the other group lashing the logs together with lengths of twisted vine to form wigwamshaped frames on top of these they could layer the big waxy leaves that drooped from the canopy trees a few layers of those would give them a covering that would almost be waterproof that had been liams instruction make shelters but her cool grey eyes panned uneasily across the clearing observing the area of jungle that had been hacked away the disturbed jungle floor where the smaller trees had been uprooted her eyes picked out the slashes of machete blows on other bigger trees that had proven too difficult to fell or uproot and the compressed tracks of footprints on the ground the distinct oval of signatures of a human presence evaluation time contamination is increasing every movement these people made every footstep every swipe of a blunt blade was adding to a growing count of potential contamination yet liam oconnors instruction to her was a mission priority an override as the mission operative his orders were as final and nonnegotiable as any hardcoded line of programming in her head hed been very specific that she was to organize the completion of the bridge and the building of a camp and for good measure some kind of small enclosure a palisade that they could all hide inside just in case any nasty found its way on to their island and so she had just like their last mission back when her ai software had been assigned the ident bob she was once again obediently following orders there was something vaguely comforting about being in a brandnew functioning body being on a mission once again with liam oconnor they had functioned together very efficiently last time successfully correcting a significant time contamination against exceedingly unfavourable odds but thered been something untidy about the ais learning curve as bob it had discovered that the strict mission parameters could be overwritten with new ones that under extreme circumstances the collection of software routines was actually capable of making a decision that in itself had been a disturbing realization as bob the ai had learned that its core programming could be subtly influenced swayed by something else the tiny nodule of organic intelligence the computer chip was connected to the undeveloped foetal brain of this genetically engineered frame as bob the ai had experienced a fleeting taste of something that these humans must all take for granted emotion the ai had discovered something very very odd that it actually liked liam oconnor since that first clone body had been irreparably damaged in the snowy woods down the hill from adolf hitlers winter berghof retreat and the ai uploaded into the field offices mainframe an entirely nonorganic disembodied existence the ai had had much time to reflect on all that it had learned from those six months in the past conclusions ai is now capable of referring to the newly developed ai routines as i me myself i am now capable of limited decisionmaking within an organic hardware housing i am capable of limited emotional stimulation and most important of all i like liam oconnor becks continued to watch the humans at work and realized that part of her onboard code was insistently whispering a warning to her that a decision needed to be made and made very soon the humans were beginning to cause dangerously unacceptable levels of contamination in this jungle clearing with all that they were doing with every footstep with every log being cut down there was an increased possibility that some fossilized forensic clue would survive sixtyfive million years to be found in the future and quite clearly reveal that humans had visited this time unacceptable liam oconnors instructions to her were at odds with the basic protocols of journeying into the past that contamination must be kept to an absolute minimum even now by simply being here these people could be causing a far greater time wave than the assassination of edward chan in might have caused recommendation terminate all humans including mission operative liam oconnor destroy all traces of human artefacts and habitation in this location selfterminate the recommendation was faultlessly logical and strategically sound but that small nodule of primitive organic matter reminded her software that liam was a friend and friends dont kill friends becks blinked away the thought it was an unwelcome distraction decision options proceed immediately with mission recommendation wait for operative liam oconnor and discuss a decision never easy beckss internal silicon wafer processor began to rapidly warm up as gigabytes of data rattled through software filters her lifeless grey eyes blinked in rapid succession as she desperately struggled to produce an answer and her fingers absentmindedly tightened round the handle of the machete she barely registered the blondehaired female human called laura approaching her hey the girl called out you going to give us a hand or just stand there and watch us do the work huh becks beckss eyes slowly swivelled and locked on the girl but she said nothing her mind was very very busy chapter million years bc jungle liam saw it first amid the relentless green and ochre of the jungle it was an unmissable splash of bright crimson he raised his hand turned round and put a finger to his lips shushing lam and jonah at the back whod been chattering for the last five minutes about comicbooks they hushed immediately whitmore stepped quietly forward and joined him what is it liam pointed through a thin veil of leaves blood lots of it by the look of things whitmore swallowed and looked goggleeyed again oh boy he whispered oh boy oh boy franklyn joined them unlike whitmore his eyes lit up with joy excellent he gasped looks like something made a kill whitmore swallowed thats exactly what im worried about he looked at liam i suggest we quietly back up and but before whitmore could finish franklyn pushed his way forward through low sweeping fern fronds and into a small clearing oh this is so awesome come on he called to them we must have frightened the predator off liam looked at the teacher and shrugged well i suppose if weve scared some dinosaur away the last thing we ought to start doing now is look frightened ourselves wed better brass it out right by the look of whitmores still goggling eyes hed have been much happier with the backing quietly away plan liam left him thinking it over as he stepped forward through the fern leaves and into the clearing franklyn was squatting over the eviscerated ribcage of some large beast wrinkling his nose at the fetid smell of shredded organs pulled out and splayed across the jungle floor liam felt something stir and roll queasily in his empty stomach jayzus thats disgusting a recent kill by the look of it said franklyn prodding the large carcass with his fingers shreds of tattered muscle tissue swayed from the ends of the ribs as the body rocked slightly lam jonah and whitmore emerged behind liam oh man thats totally gross said jonah holding his nose at the pungent smell of death i really think we shouldnt hang about here said whitmore whatever did this might still be close by franklyn nodded and smiled exactly maybe well actually get a chance to see something liam looked around the dense foliage wary that some large creature with very sharp claws and teeth might just be watching them now you know i think mr whitmores got the right idea maybe we should probably back off look at these marks on the hide said franklyn ignoring them the lacerations lots of them small ones not large like a rex might do he studied the ground see liam looked at where he was pointing and saw several threepronged indentations across the ground and then he spotted something long and curved like a fishhook on the ground he stooped down and picked it up whats that asked franklyn liam shrugged looks like some sort of claw franklyn couldnt help himself he snatched it out of liams open palm oh my god thats thats a claw all right look the serrated inner edge he turned it over in his hand but its a weird shape isnt it mr whitmore whitmore seemed more interested in leaving but he quickly leaned over and inspected it more closely its certainly not the crescent shape youd associate with a raptor or some other species of therapod franklyn grinned with excitement maybe this is an unknown species its possible said lam i mean dont they say something about weve only ever discovered the fossils of one per cent of the species that have ever lived on planet earth i really think we should leave said whitmore liam nodded he held out his hand may i have it back franklyn seemed reluctant to let it go but after pulling a face he passed it to liam cool find he uttered liam smiled im sure youll come across another yeah probably whatever that belonged to is small probably pack hunters pack hunters jonah straightened up you know i think mr whitmores right maybe we should go uhhuh said whitmore smiling quickly uncomfortably looking around the clearing well franklyn a fascinating find we can all talk about it on the way back pack hunters said lam like raptors you said there werent raptors these arent look at the footprints thered be indentations from their sickle toe no these are some other species maybe not even therapods something entirely different he stood up this is so cool yes well liam looked at the others so now we know for sure were sharing this place with dinosaurs he looked at the buffalosized carcass and now that we know theres some bigger types we could hunt for food i think mr whitmores right we ought to head back to the camp four heads bobbed enthusiastically franklyn sighed ok right then liam gestured down the path theyd beaten after you gents they filed quickly past him whitmore glancing awkwardly back over his shoulder as he stepped by actually i really wish we hadnt spotted that he said quietly pulling a face liam knew what he meant the poor beast whatever it had once been looked like it hadnt just been killed for meat the organs splayed out on to the jungle floor the intestines dangling from loops of vine it was as if the creatures that had brought it down had frolicked and played with the grisly remains a gory celebration of the kill the idea of an animal species capable of celebrating seemed somewhat disconcerting it hinted at ritual it hinted at intelligence maybe theyre just messy eaters in the gathering stillness he thought he heard the softest click like the tiniest twig snapping beneath impatient shifting weight he glanced back once more at the bloodsplashed clearing and wondered if predators eyes were cautiously eyeing him in turn from the cover of the dense green foliage yellow unblinking eyes studied the curious creatures as they departed just a dozen yards away no more than three or four strides from where the beast crouched there were five of these pale creatures the like of which he had never seen before they made odd noises not a million miles away from the cranial bark he made when calling for the attention of the rest of the pack and these odd creatures moved in a not dissimilar way upright on long developed rear legs but far more slowly sluggishly the creature shifted position slightly bobbing down lower to get a better look between the broad leaves of the fern he was hiding behind these pale upright things these new creatures he wondered if this was the entirety of their pack or whether there were more of them elsewhere they seemed harmless they appeared to have no visible teeth no slashing claws nothing that signalled any danger about them at all nothing that identified them as potential rival predators except except the creature could see this these pale things were clever they appeared to work cooperatively sharing tasks just like his pack did he watched in absolute stillness his olive skin a perfect disguise among the varied greens of the jungle he watched with intense eyes that faced forward capable of binocular vision capable of judging distance range a predators advantage these strange newcomers these new creatures also had eyes that faced forward another reason to be so very wary of them perhaps they too were predators of some kind unlike the docile planteaters whose eyes on either side of their heads were designed to detect potential danger from two directions yes these things had predators eyes and yet they appeared utterly defenceless harmless and pitifully slow and clumsy in the way they moved around the clearing he cocked his head curiously the long fishhookshaped razorsharp claws on its left front paw clacked together carelessly the last of the new creatures suddenly turned and looked back in his direction it must have heard something the snick of his claws incredibly the creatures eyes looked directly at him right at him and yet seemed to see absolutely nothing its eyes panned slowly from left to right then finally it turned and headed off after the others the creature looked down at his claws four of them long and lethal curled from the digits of one arm three and a broken stump from the other damage caused many seasons ago fighting off a young male who had foolishly decided to challenge his leadership the challenger had died of course and in a rage he had torn the body to ragged pieces in front of the rest of the pack as a lesson the claws usually grew back the young female whod lost her claw today during the kill she would have a new one before a new moon but his stump had never regrown a claw a constant reminder that his days as leader were numbered by how long he remained effective slowly and very lightly broken claw stepped backwards away from the fern leaves and further from the welllit small clearing into jungle darkness his powerful rear legs strong and agile capable of incredible speed but also able to move in almost complete silence a simple thought passed through his mind a thought not made up of words but ideas the new creatures must be watched instinctively he sensed there was something terribly dangerous about them until he knew exactly what it was until he knew how weak or dangerous they could be the new creatures should be carefully observed studied until he was sure he had the measure of them and then then when these things were least prepared when they were certain these pale creatures had no concealed powers they would be attacked and feasted upon and the pack could celebrate their dominance once more as the quiet killers of this world decorating the jungle with their organs painting their blood on their hides his sharp teeth snapped together softly and he resolved that patience for the moment was the correct course of action chapter million years bc jungle liam heaved a sigh of relief as he caught a glimpse of the raging river and the long slender trunk that bridged one rocky bank to the other it appeared becks had finished her work on the bridge it could now be raised courtesy of a crudely rigged counterweight of a bundle of logs they were tied together and connected to a stout rope of a dozen twisted vines which ran up and over the thick branch of a canopy tree that stretched a sturdy limb out above the river the other end of the rope was tied round the end of their drawbridge a thirtyfoot trunk as straight as a javelin and a slender foot in diameter it was thick enough to take their weight one at a time but not so heavy the supporting branch above would snap as it was raised one by one they stepped on to the log and cautiously inched their way over the tumbling froth a few feet below liam was the last one over and as he anxiously awaited his turn he scanned the wall of jungle behind him wary that being the last one on this side of the river he might prove a tempting morsel for some hungry beast but his turn came and a few moments later he was on the far side with the others ok lets raise the drawbridge between them they pulled on the counterweight of logs and with the creak of stressed vine rope and the branch above taking the burden the bridge rose up until it was approximately at an angle of fortyfive degrees good enough liam looked up at the sky the sun was beginning to head for the horizon and long dark shadows stretched across the river through the trees and tufts of bamboo thickets on their side of the river from the direction of the clearing they could hear the echoing hack of blades on wood the others working on their camp their home a temporary home liam found himself hoping the sound of activity was reassuring i hope somebodys got the kettle on for us said liam a minute later they were just stepping out into the broad clearing keen to see what the others had managed to construct in their absence when they heard a scream echo across the open space uh uttered lam on the far side liam could see movement someone running it was the girl laura running staggering stumbling to her knees then back up on her feet behind her pursuing with a swift purposeful stride a figure all in black with flaming red hair becks whoa catfight uttered jonah grinning like an idiot hey liam called out whats going on laura glanced his way and changed direction towards him becks was swiftly closing the gap he noticed her holding one of their bamboo spears in one hand the tip bright red with a splash of blood what the he ran forward becks whats going on closer now he could see a long gash down lauras left arm blood splattered across her bright pink sweatshirt oh god oh god shes trying to kill me laura screamed the rest of the group on the far side of the clearing where a row of simple frames of wood had thus far been erected were watching the scene in stunned uncomprehending silence finally laura collapsed in a pile at liams feet clasping at her arm and looking back in panic as becks strode forward she speared me gasped laura just walked up and stabbed me for no reason becks came to a halt several yards away and looked calmly at liam she even smiled her faltering horse smile lips slowly stretching to reveal a row of perfect teeth hello liam she said jayzus becks whyd you go and attack the poor girl mission priority she has to be terminated what becks nodded at the others standing just behind liam all of them as well the others and you liam he thought he detected a hint of regret in her voice as she said that after that i must purge this area of evidence of human occupation then i must selfterminate what thats crazy said lam becks listen said liam spreading his hands slowly this is not necessary all right she took another two strides forward reached down and grabbed laura round the throat and effortlessly lifted her up off the ground her legs kicking in the air laura scrabbled and scratched at her face one hand finally grabbing a fist of beckss red hair becks stop it liams command halted her she looked at him confused it is a mission priority we have already caused unacceptable levels of time contamination put her down becks stared at him but remained poised and perfectly still laura still dangling kicking struggling and slowly choking the sharp ragged point of the spear held in beckss other hand hovered mere inches away from her throat that is an order beckss eyes slowly panned from liam to laura then back again her eyelids fluttered momentarily then finally she said affirmative she released her grip on laura and the girl tumbled heavily to the ground beckss red wig wrenched from her bare head still clasped by lauras bloody fingers now put that spear down snapped liam she obediently released her tight grip and it clattered on the soft ground lauras breath chugged in and out in whooping gasps while the others stared in stunned silence at becks and her bald head already sporting a quarterinch fuzz of dark hair oh my god shes a complete freakin psycho said lam behind him liam heard jonah mutter jeez got that right dude becks was staring at him there was something in those cold grey eyes something that looked like guilt regret possibly even sadness like a scolded baby in that moment that stunned could go either way moment just before the face creases up and the tears and wailing come no said liam no shes not shes not a psycho said lam sure about that liam nodded he could see muscles twitching in beckss face confusion desperation her mind struggling to reconcile conflicting priorities liams direct order versus hardcoded mission protocols shes just doing what she thinks is right shes following her programming franklyn cocked his head programming the fire crackled noisily illuminating their faces as they gathered in a circle round it like so many ambercoloured ghosts in a graveyard the jungle beyond the thrown flickering glow of light was dark and noisy with the faroff echoing cries of creatures calling to each other but how can we be sure that thing wont just freak out on us again asked kelly he cast a glance at becks standing several dozen yards away out in the darkness motionless dutifully keeping watch for any signs of a night predator entering the clearing she just wont said liam yeah well that doesnt exactly fill me with confidence kelly threw a small branch on the fire sending a cascade of sparks up into the pitchblack sky i mean its not like you knew she was going to attack laura earlier liam looked at the girl her arm was bandaged with a strip of cloth torn from her sleeve the black girl keisha had done a good job with the dressing it hadnt been a particularly deep gash but luckily hadnt severed an artery laura must have been incredibly lucky becks had stumbled on the uneven ground as shed lunged with the spear laura had been fortunate becks hadnt managed to get hold of her liam had seen enough of bob in action to know that male or female these support units were lethal killing machines up close and personal she wont said liam again ive discussed the situation with her discussed the situation snorted jonah cant you just pull some sort of plug on her i mean shes a robot right no liam shook his head shes not that sort of a robot not all wires and motors and metal bits shes an organic unit what the agency call a genetically engineered unit he looked around at the pale faces youve heard of that term have you well duh sighed keisha any kid who watches the cartoon channel knows that term liam shrugged apologetically anyway shes what we call a meat robot flesh and blood so she is but she has a real computer up in her head and what you sayin her programmin made her go for laura with the spear said juan thats right she was concerned about all the contamination we were causing and without me being there to discuss it with her she had to make a decision on her own concerned said jonah concerned dude id hate to see what shes like when shes really mad at something liam ignored that liam you said contamination said kelly you mean creating evidence weve been here like our camp and the bridge thats right every cut every scrape every footprint in fact everything we do just our being here could potentially alter history in such a way that the future is totally destroyed liam glanced at the motionless silhouette of the support unit standing guard in the middle of the clearing its a basic command for her like i suppose like one of the ten commandments would be to us thou shalt not mess around with time chuckled a darkskinned boy called ranjit that would be a cool eleventh commandment to have yeah said jonah thy shalt not kill your ancestor for he begets you think its funny cut in howard sharply the others looked at him taken aback at the outburst thus far hed been one of the quieter members of the group you think messing with time is just some sort of a game its the most insane thing man has ever done he stopped himself short took a breath and dialled it back a bit what im saying is its just pretty insane time travel liam nodded sombrely hes quite right it is insane although a man called waldstein is the first man to travel through time he looked at edward the smallest face around the fire it all begins with you its all based on work that you will do one day so theoretically said kelly if edward had for example died in that explosion back in the reactor and not gone on to do his work then this waldstein guy would not have invented a time machine and wed not have been blasted back into dinosaur times said laura liam noticed one or two heads turning towards the young boy giving him a long silent stare that looked like careful deliberation liam could see where this conversation might go there can only be one correct history one correct timeline and whether we like it or not that timeline includes an edward chan who becomes a maths genius and a mr waldstein who makes that first machine so he does thats how it goes thats how it has to go liam stared at them all each in turn and thats why you can trust me why you can trust becks to be sure our primary goal now is to make sure that this young lad gets back home to to do what he has to do and that means the rest of you too so if theres like a primary goal then theres a secondary goal said a darkskinned girl with long black hair and a pierced upper lip that glinted with several metal studs it was the first time hed heard her speak today quiet pensive she reminded him a little of sal she was still wearing her name tag jasmine theres no other goal jasmine i promise said liam me and becks want to get you all back home so we do but thats not strictly true is it liam he and becks had spoken in private earlier hed managed to reason with her calmly to talk her down from proceeding any further with her selfdecided mission objective to kill them all then herself but it was a compromise a perfectly logical compromise that successfully reconciled the conflicting protocols in her head in six months time hed agreed with her if they havent rescued us by then before your six months is up and you have to selfterminate then yes youre right i suppose wed all have to die ill even help you hed smiled at her lets just hope it doesnt come to that eh the campfire crackled noisily so there you go all friends now right said jonah even robogirl he grinned now about a nice singsong a round of kumbayah he added sarcastically ill take the lead kumbayah my lord kumba someone threw a chip of dried dino dung across the fire at him chapter wednesday new york a wednesday maddy realized she hadnt seen one of those in quite a while since shed been on a plane trip back home to her folks in boston in fact since shed become a timerider she looked down the flagpole approach to the statue of libertys starshaped podium and spotted only half a dozen other people shed been here once before on the same school trip that theyd visited the museum of natural history it had been a tedious day full of queuing queuing to get ferry tickets queuing to get on a ferry over to liberty island queuing to get inside the podium building beneath libertys feet and look at the small museums exhibits queuing once again to get a look up inside the statue itself a pretty dull day of standing around being shoved bumped and barged into waiting to look at things she actually had precious little interest in today though there were no queues the island was all but deserted half a dozen ferries had arrived throughout the day each offloading no more than a handful of muted whispering visitors and even then their eyes had been more on the column of smoke coming from across the bay coming from manhattan than they had been on the giant coppergreen statue in front of them maddy took another slurp of the cooling polystyrene cup of coffee in her hands horrible shed lost count of how many shed bought from the stall opposite the embarkation pier she was almost on firstname terms with the bewilderedlooking man behind the counter whod served her every time he certainly should know by now she took it white with three sugars come on foster where the hell are you through the morning shed been hopeful as each ferry had arrived but not now it was nearly four in the afternoon another hour or so and the statue of libertys little museum would be closing the last ferry back across the harbour getting ready to leave she was beginning to realize today had been wasted loitering around like this cluelessly hovering around the podiums entrance in hope that the old man would turn up never mind she told herself now at least she knew that foster hadnt spent the first wednesday of his retirement out here shed head back to their archway today wednesday it would be nothing more than an empty brick archway with a to let sign pasted on the rollershutter door and outside that shutter door shed wait until eight in the evening when a shimmering portal would appear ready to take her back into monday again then shed do this all again try wednesday once more but next time shed loiter outside the empire state building her eyes drifted off the tourists as they passed by her and into the podium pausing as they did to look once again at the pall of smoke in the sky she remembered this day remembered the day after shed been what eight nine mom and dad at home all day sitting in front of the tv watching as dustsmeared emergency workers scrabbled at the edge of the smouldering wreck pulling twisted spars of stillwarm metal away in the hope of finding someone alive shed been playing on the floor of the lounge with her techmeccano set trying to build her version of a transformer half her attention on what she was doing half on her parents mom sobbing and dad cursing and here she was again different place same day an odd urge occurred to her what if she found a way through the security cordon around the ruin of the twin towers and found a tv camera and reporter to be stopped and interviewed by she could wave at her eightyearold self wave at her mom and dad watching the tv she could reassure them that she wasnt going to die along with other people aboard flight in nine years time tell them she was going to be ok she shook her head nice idea but she wasnt going to do that she turned her thoughts towards more pressing matters liam and the support unit bob had assured her that the copy of his ai in the female unit would make the same recommendation to liam as he would to find a discreet way to make contact discreet because a tooobvious message a message that stood out above the background noise of history could significantly affect the timeline but there was the problem a subtle message carefully laid down in whatever historical period they were in laid down for only her and sal to find i mean where the hell are we supposed to start looking for something like that if theyd only been bumped back less than years then perhaps there was a message waiting for them once more in the museum of natural historys guest books that was something sal had decided to try and check out but what if theyd been knocked further back in time five hundred years ago a thousand years ago what was in the middle of texas a thousand years ago a lot of buffalo she guessed and some indians but certainly no visitor guest books for them to discreetly slip a message into a get us out of here scrawled across an ancient navaho tribal history rug was almost certainly something the support unit would not recommend to liam not unless they wanted every historian studying native american history discussing the message at some symposium subtle it could only be subtle but she sighed to herself too subtle and how were they ever going to find it unless its a message thats meant to find us she looked up from her coffee find us my god she whispered to herself maybe thats what theyd try to do a message addressed to its finder whomever that might be a message that perhaps might promise a reward of some kind to the finder provided it was delivered to a certain location on a certain date a message that might promise untold wealth access to an incredible timetravel technology and think about it such a message would be too important too powerful to become public knowledge wouldnt it a message like that would become a closely guarded secret right a secret handed down by the original finder to his offspring like a dark family secret or a horrendous supernatural curse handed down from one to another until finally the message is passed to someone who is able to make their way to a certain backstreet in brooklyn on september and gently knock on their door calling out to see if anyones inside oh my god its possible isnt it and what if that happened while she was standing out here like a complete lemon waiting for foster to turn up when quite probably he was never going to computer bob was right thats what hed said wasnt it just wait oh you freakin idiot maddy she hissed to herself tossing the polystyrene cup into the bin beside her and heading down the walkway towards the pier chapter million years bc jungle you can do what said liam becks hefted the log up in her taut arms and held it steady as liam lashed it in place with a handwoven length of rope made from the species of vine theyd found dangling from virtually every tree around the clearing i believe it is possible for me to calculate when in time we are with a very high degree of accuracy he wrapped the rope tightly round the log tugging it hard so that it shuffled up against its neighbour the palisade wall so far stretched only a dozen feet about twenty logs each just under eight inches in diameter and all roughly about nine feet tall when they were done theyd have a circular enclosure about four yards across large enough for all sixteen of them to huddle inside should something nasty find its way on to their island and they needed somewhere to retreat to how asked liam i have a detailed record of all the variables during the time of the explosion variables data specifically directly after we arrived here the particle decay rate liam cocked an eyebrow i havent a clue what that means becks she walked over to a dwindling pile of logs and effortlessly picked up another they were going to need more across the clearing he could see whitmore and several of the students carrying one between them stumbling across the lumpy ground towards them she slammed one end of the log down into the soft soil with a heavy thud next to the last log and liam began to lash it into their wall i have a detailed record of the explosion the number and density of tachyon particles that we were exposed to in and the number and density of tachyon particles that emerged here alongside ourselves liam looked at her and shrugged assume im a child that knows nothing becks she looked at him and he thought he caught her rolling her eyes at his stupidity a gesture the ai must have learned from sal back when it was computerbound and its visual world was what it picked up from the one webcam tachyon particles decay at a constant rate that is why it takes greater amounts of energy to beam a signal further into the past liam tugged hard on the vine rope cinching the knot tightly i get that so if these particles die out at a steady rate that means i am able to calculate how many particles decayed and from that determine how far in time we were sent he grinned really you can do that becks looked up and tried mimicking his uneven smile i have the processing power to do this and well know exactly when we are to an accuracy level of one thousandth of a per cent liam shook his head in wonder jayzus that metal brain of yours is a bloody marvel so it is she seemed pleased with that is that a compliment liam oconnor he punched her arm lightly of course it is dont know what id do without you her gaze drifted off across the clearing for a moment then back at him thank you he finished lashing the log and waited for her to pick up another and slam it down heavily beside the last one so what well actually know what day we arrived in the past even what time negative i am unable to give that precise a calculation ok well know to the nearest week or something she shook her head the nearest month negative year i can calculate to the nearest thousand years what i can calculate our current time down to the nearest he cut her off i heard you the first time but but thats no good to us is it i mean even if we could somehow get a message to the future and tell them which thousandth year were in finding us here would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack he slumped down against the wall if they tried opening a window at the same time every day for every year for a thousand years thatd be thatd be three hundred and sixtyfive thousand attempts said becks add another two hundred and fifty attempts for leap years right that many jeeeez theyd never find us she squatted down on her haunches beside him you are correct it is extremely unlikely she confirmed so thats it then he said sagging the moment of believing they might have the beginnings of a way out was gone now leaving him feeling even more hopeless than before were stuck here until my sixmonth mission timer reaches yes yes i know then youve got to do what youve got to do a hand reached out and gently grasped his arm i am sorry liam oconnor it does not make me happy to think of terminating these humans particularly you he sighed well i spose that counts for something he muttered thanks they watched as the others finally arrived with the log and between them heaved it on to the ground whitmore wiped sweat from his forehead and recovered his breath good god im beat roughly how many more of these logs do you think youre going to need to finish that becks turned and eyed the wall for a moment seventynine he puffed out his cheeks seventynine you sure she nodded i am sure right whitmore puffed right come on then you lot he said to the others back to work liam and becks watched them go it would be possible for the field office to narrow down the number of candidate windows said becks what they do not need to try opening three hundred and sixtyfive thousand two hundred and fifty windows i am certain the ai back in the field office would make the same recommendation same recommendation what a density probe they could attempt a brief scan of each day any scans that returned a varying density signal warning would indicate movement of some object at that location it is possible they would consider density warning signals as bestcase candidates he looked at her she was right a routine protocol before opening a window to make sure they werent going to get mangled up with somebody else do you remember exactly where we appeared on this clearing she nodded i have the exact geocoordinates logged in my database she pointed across the ground towards a cluster of ferns you appeared there fiftyone feet seven and threequarter inches from this location then liam looked at the spot wed need to stand someone right there flapping their arms around or something right correct but it is unlikely the field office will be making probe sweeps this far back in time liam felt himself sagging again another dashed ray of hope he balled a fist with frustration this timetravel stuff is nonsense would it be so hard for the agency to come up with some beamy signal thing we could send back to them in theory it would be possible but it would require an enormous amount of energy and of course time displacement machinery and a sophisticated enough computer system to target where to aim a he raised a hand to shush her becks her grey eyes locked on him obediently please shut up affirmative he stood stretching an aching back ah sod this then he suddenly snapped slamming his fist against the log wall the palisade vibrated slightly with the soft creak of stretched vinerope ouch he muttered and sucked on grazed knuckles that hurt she tilted her head curious then why did you do that ugh will you not be quiet chapter million years bc jungle several of the new creatures were standing in the shallows of the raging river frothing white water tumbling noisily around their legs they all held long sticks in their hands and seemed to be studying the water intently keeping motionless for long periods then finally inexplicably lashing out with their sticks broken claw turned to the others crouching a few yards away watching these creatures with fascination he snicked his claws to attract their attention they all obediently looked his way broken claw uttered a series of soft throaty barks and snapped his teeth new creatures they are dangerous he couldnt explain why he just knew somehow that they were quite possibly far more dangerous than them his yellow eyes swivelled back to the creatures and across the far side to the curious contraption these things had been fashioning with their pale clawless arms the long trunk of a tree stripped of branches and leaves and hanging at a raised angle over the river just like the longslanted neck of one of the giant leafeaters that lived on the open plain tied round the contraptions top broken claw recognized vines entwined together taut and angling back up towards another tree over a thick branch and dangling straight down to the ground where the vines were wrapped round a cluster of logs he couldnt begin to understand what the contraption did or why these things had laboured so hard on making it but they had and it worried him that he himself couldnt understand what it did worried him he barked again softly new creatures cleverer than us the others seemed to agree they cowered lower among the foliage at the edge of the jungle he could see as many of them wading in the water as the number of claws he possessed he wondered how many more of them were on the island on the far side of this narrow river more than his pack just then one of the new creatures lurched forward pushing the stick into the water a moment later it pulled the stick out on its end one of the grey river creatures thrashed and struggled silver and glistening the stick had somehow captured the creature the stick captures the river creature he watched with fascination as the new creatures carried the large flapping riverdweller between them away from the waters edge and through the trees until they were gone from view only one of them remained behind still poised gazing intently out at the water broken claw recognized this one hed seen him before three sunrises ago back in the jungle their stare had actually met for a moment although the things pale blue eyes had seemed to register nothing of that broken claw sensed this one led the others just like he led his pack a position of loneliness and responsibility for a moment his animal mind processed a thought that a human might have called kinship new creature is like i leads others when the time came to kill them all when he was sure it was safe for them to make their move he decided this creature should be his and his alone perhaps in the moment that he tore this pale things heart out all the wisdom and intelligence inside it would become his then he too would understand the stick that captures and the curious construction raised over the river liam scanned the swirling suds of water in front of him every now and then he could see the dark outline of one of these large prehistoric mudfish darting around the shallows teasing him to make a lunge at it with his spear he was useless at it unable to anticipate which way the dark shape would lurch to avoid being skewered juan was probably the best among them at catching these things the one hed just caught was a whopper four feet of wriggling wet meat enough to feed at least half of them tonight if he could just manage to bag another one himself while the others were carrying it back to the camp then he could at least feel less like a useless jerk some leader franklyn seemed to know everything about dinosaurs whitmore quite a lot too juan seemed to be at home in this survival situation good at hunting building a fire and all keisha seemed to be the groups carer and doctor and despite the unfortunate incident a few days ago the others were beginning to regard becks as their bodyguard even jonah seemed to have a valued role as the groups comedian and then theres me the irish kid who can do nothing more than keep saying helps on the way he wondered if the only reason theyd accepted him as the nominal leader was because hed made the rash promise to get them back home that and of course because becks took her orders only from him he wondered how they were going to feel about him being in charge in a few weeks time or months time when there was still no sign of rescue he felt lonely and worn out with the burden of responsibility at least the last time hed been stuck in the past it had just been himself to worry about he hadnt been asked to lead anyone no that was bobs job he laughed at the memory of bob leading that army of freedom fighters theyd thought he was some sort of warrior angel sent down from heaven by god himself theyd thought he was a superhero just like out of one of those comicbooks superman captain freedom hed certainly looked the part movement he looked up and saw a pack of small dinosaurs little more than lizards standing upright on their hind legs and gazing at him curiously none bigger than his hand they were standing only a couple of yards away and tweeted and twittered among themselves as they idly watched him franklyn had a species name for them although liam was damned if he could remember it what do you fellas want he called out he could guess begging for scraps these little chaps had been hopping and skipping around their campfire last night like excited children drawn by the smell of fish meat being grilled on a spit one of them had even been bold enough to hop up on to the cooking carcass but had slipped on the greasy scales of the fish and fallen into the fire where it had flapped around and screamed for a while before finally succumbing to the flames did you not learn your lesson last night you silly eejits best staying away eh they all cocked their heads to the right in unison at the sound of his voice jayzus you little fellas really are stupid arent you they tweeted and twittered and cooed at that ah go away will you youll spook my fish so you will liam bent down scooped up a rock and tossed it a dozen yards down the silted riverbank the entire pack of minitherapods turned and scooted after it excitedly presumably utterly convinced it was a hunk of juicy meat liam watched them go pattering across the silt leaving a host of tiny trails behind them like the trail of winter birds across virgin snow and thats when the idea struck him oh oh he gasped to himself oh jayzusnmothermary he added for good measure thatll be it he dropped his spear into the water and turned on his heels heading through the trees towards the camp chapter million years bc jungle he stumbled out of the jungle and into the clearing across the way he could see a thin column of smoke from yesterdays campfire still smouldering and clustered around it their dozen wigwam shelters coneshaped frames of wood beneath layers of broad waxy leaves the size of elephants ears to one side their palisade finished now and reinforced with a coating of rustcoloured dried mud packed into the spaces between the logs and almost as hard as concrete around the treetrunk palisade wall a threefootdeep trench had been dug out it effectively added another two or three feet to the height of their defence liam very much doubted it would hold at bay something as large as a rex but it might be enough to dissuade any smaller beasts on the hunt for an easy meal he picked out becks among the figures moving around the camp a figure in black her head no longer a pale round eggshell but dark now with a weeks worth of hair growth becks he called out her head turned sharply towards him and her posture instantly adjusted to one ready for action every other head turned his way as he stumbled awkwardly across the ground towards them he saw juan and leonard scrambling to their feet and reaching for spears he realized his voice must have sounded shrill as if he was shouting a warning kelly reached into his trousers for his penknife whitmore for one of their hatchets by the time liam arrived beside the campfire breathless and sweating from the exertion everybody stood poised with a weapon and ready to run for the safety of the palisade what is it asked kelly something coming liam looked at them all they were wideeyed some of the girls terrified even glances skipped from liam to the far side of the clearing from where hed emerged sprinting as if the devil himself was in hot pursuit whats happened dude asked jonah becks said your voice indicated a threat liam shook his head ah no not really i just had an idea fossils thats what youre talking about said franklyn fossils theyre not even the original print thats left behind but just an imprint of the print sediment that has filled the footprint then hardened over thousands of years to become a layer of rock yes but its still a mark thats survived through all that time an impression of that original mark of course sniffed franklyn yes of course thats exactly what it is kelly shook his head thats it thats how you intend to communicate with your agency leave a mark on the ground in the cretaceous period and hope some lucky fossil hunter finds it he shrugged exasperated oh great he gazed at the fire and there was me thinking you and your robogirl here had some sort of hightech beacon or something to bring them here becks shook her head negative no beacons liam raised a hand to hush her thats just the way it is mr kelly theres nothing i can do about that laura bit her lip that that doesnt sound like much of a chance though a message traced in the ground surviving millions of years in one piece survivin that long added juan and bein found as well man whats the chances of that liam shrugged maybe we can improve our chances he looked at franklyn do we not know where the first fossils were discovered i mean historically thats actually known right whitmore and franklyn exchanged a glance well yes said whitmore its common knowledge where the first american dinosaur fossils were discovered franklyn nodded in texas of course right here in texas behind his bottletop glasses his eyes suddenly widened yes oh hang on yes dinosaur valley right mr whitmore whitmore nodded good god yes youre right franklyn near glen rose texas glen rose liam shrugged would that be far away kellys scornful frozen expression of cynicism looked like it was thawing not that far from where the teri labs were actually about sixty miles away dinosaur valley state park continued whitmore its a protected area now a national landmark at the beginning of the s i think some of the first fossils were found along a riverbed there lots of them the paluxy river said franklyn where the fossils were found was thought to be the shoreline of some cretaceousera sea liam looked from whitmore to franklyn so we could get to this place right you fellas know exactly where it would be both shook their heads not really said whitmore how could we know that he gestured around at the jungle its an entirely different landscape he laughed hell its out there somewhere i know where it is in relation to the teri labs said kelly the others looked at him well i drive in to work from glen rose its where i live i pass the signs for dinosaur valley park every day on the way up to the interstate its just outside glen rose about a mile north of the town i have geocoordinates for the town of glen rose said becks liam looked at her you do of course it was part of the data package maddy carter uploaded prior to departure i have the complete set of us geological survey maps for the state of texas liams eyes glistened by the light of the campfire we could actually do this he looked at them all piecing together on the fly something that was beginning to resemble a plan then in theory becks you could lead us right to this place that will one day become this dinosaur park affirmative and if we know some fossilhunting fellas find a whole load of fossils as you said mr whitmore sometime in the s then could we not place some fossils of our own right there i suppose we negative cut in becks she understood now where liam was going with this that would represent a significant contamination risk liam clenched his teeth in frustration come on becks we have to break a few eggs so we do she cocked her head break eggs you know how does it go to make an omelette we leave a message to be found so all right it causes a new load of contamination problems but then we have a chance at being rescued getting these people back home where they should be and then then we go and fix that little problem this action introduces a third independent source of contamination she looked coolly at the group gathered around the campfire already there are two potential sources of time corruption one in the absence of edward chan the second this time the presence of humans where there should not be any either or both contamination sources have a high probability of already causing significant time waves in the future what if started jonah but he almost stopped when every pair of eyes swung on to him clearly now wasnt the time for some flippant wisecrack but he continued anyway it seemed like a smart idea to him what if like we left a message that was you know like too important to become common knowledge they stared at him in silence no one was telling him to shut up so he elaborated i mean like hushed up like say roswell liam shrugged roswell kelly snorted a dry laugh the supposed sight of a crashed ufo in conspiracy nuts love that story according to them it was a real flying saucer from outer space with real live lgm onboard laura saw liam purse his lips in confusion little green men she said helpfully anyway continued kelly despite the fact it was most probably just a crashed test jet of some kind you still get nutjobs going on about wanting to free the little green men from their years of medical testing and enforced imprisonment jonah made a face yeah but how do we know for sure it aint true mr kelly eh point is it couldve been just a test jet it couldve been an alien spaceship but the world will never know cause the government being like totally paranoid douche bags hushed it all up kept the secret to themselves oh come on kid said kelly thats a load of liam waved him silent hang on no wait jonah has a point i think he scratched his cheek deep in thought for a moment look the point is people like the government your american government right if someone some everyday person discovered a fossil that suggested something as amazing as the invention of time travel and they told the government what would they do you kiddin said juan theyd end up all over it like a rash man secret service homeland stiffs in black suits an dark glasses an stuff ill tell you dude whoever found it would end up having an unfortunate accident said jonah looking at kelly always happens like always in fact anybody who knew about it was related to somebody who knew about it would end up dead or in guantanamo or someplace either way there wouldnt be anyone walking around talking about it thats what i mean said liam it would remain a secret he looked at becks and so nothing major would be changed by it the world wouldnt be talking about it the world wouldnt know about it behind her narrowing eyes he guessed her computer was hard at work processing that notion looking for a percentage probability figure whitmore nodded thats how the intelligence agencies work by putting up a poker face give nothing away you know something you keep it to yourself you know something about the enemy say the russians you dont change a thing about the way you behave you act normal so the enemy dont know youve got something on them liam nodded exactly just like in the second world war i read something about those enigma codes and all and how the americans and british couldnt sometimes react to the german messages theyd intercepted otherwise the germans would have figured out theyd cracked their secret codes he looked down at the muddy ground at his feet subconsciously the toe of his left shoe drew spirals in the dirt so i dont know yet what kind of a message we could write but wed want something we know theyd have to keep secret but more importantly we want a message theyd need to take directly to our field office that will compromise the agencys secrecy warned becks liam shrugged i know but another problem to fix later huh she scowled silently at that it is another protocol conflict so you can blame it on me when we get back he said with a grin the group considered liams plan in silence for a while as the fire crackled and hissed between them i reckon your idea sounds cool said lam im in liam noticed a couple of heads nod all right then he said finally all right then this felt good having something at least halffigured out something for them all to work towards becks wed need for them to know when we are you know as close as you can get it so you do what maths in your head you need to do she nodded slowly affirmative and maybe well need some sort of device erected exactly where we landed right so that if he corrected himself when they get our message and have an approximate time period to start density probing we need something thats constantly moving to and fro in that space creating some sort of a movement a disturbance correct you mean like a windmill or somethin asked ranjit becks nodded affirmative a device of that kind would be suitable and well need to make some preparations for a long hike food water weapons those sorts of things liam looked around at them and well need to leave someone behind to man the camp and lift the bridge after were gone also to maintain the density interference device it must function constantly all the time said becks liam looked over his shoulder out towards the darkness towards the middle of the clearing where theyd landed over a week ago yes youre right itd be bad news for us if a density probe passed through here once found nothing and moved on liams grin was infectious and began to spread among the others he looked at becks is this acceptable she nodded slowly the plan has a low probability of success she smiled quite nicely this time but it is possible liam oconnor chapter new york sal watched the world go by her world thats how she thought about it times square new york eight thirty in the morning tuesday september she knew it so well now she knew everything that existed in this thoroughfare and everything that was meant to happen at this very moment in time for instance she looked around and there they were the old couple in matching jogging pants huffing slowly side by side the fedex guy with an armful of packages dropping one of them on the pavement and looking around to see whether anyone had noticed his hamfistedness two blonde girls sharing headphones and giggling at something they were listening to sal smiled all normal so far and there was the flusteredlooking huddle of japanese tourists standing outside tgi fridays on the corner of west and th street flipping anxiously through their phrase books to work out how to ask for a coffee and saltbeef and mustard bagels times nine her eyes drifted up to the billboards overlooking times square there was shrek and donkey mikey and sully there was the billboard for mamma mia and walking slowly up the pavement towards her favourite bench checking in every bin along the way and pushing a loaded shopping trolley in front of him was the cheerful old tramp she saw this time every morning she sniffed the warm morning air it smelled of car fumes and faintly of sizzling bacon and sausage meat again quite normal the smell of a city in a hurry and on its way to work my world she whispered to herself her world and all was well only that was little consolation if her world was still unaltered if there werent even the tiniest of differences to see here it could only mean that liam and the others had as yet to make any impact on whatever piece of history theyd landed in there were two conclusions to draw from that werent there either they were being incredibly careful and had managed to avoid any kind of contamination at all or or they arrived nowhere she muttered dead torn to pieces by a wall of energy by the explosion theyd caused or perhaps lost in chaos space foster had once ominously told her it was a place youd never ever want not in your wildest nightmares to loiter around in maddy was back from her trip to locate foster shed not managed to find him sal had thought it was a long shot but she seemed to have cheered up a little seemed hopeful that they were going to get them back home yet for some reason shed been gabbling on about expecting when the bubble reset at twelve oclock tonight and they were reset back to monday morning the first thing theyd hear would be a knock on the archways door and somebody standing outside perhaps feeling silly uncertain and holding in their hand some sort of artefact from history with liams scruffy handwriting scrawled across it sal wondered why maddy was so sure that was going to happen that the answer to this little mess they were in was actually going to deliver itself to their front door like the morning post maddy slurped on her third dr pepper and placed it back on the desk beside the other two now forming an orderly queue of crumpled cans she could feel the sugar kick building up inside and the office chair twisted one way then the other as she pulled on the edge of the desk well she said what do you think bob your thinking is logical however my ai duplicate would offer liam caution against this course of action of course you would bob because thats a hardcoded protocol the cursor blinked for a few seconds also because of the danger of revealing the location of this field office but liam would still go and do something like that right hed override your warning i am unable to answer that maddy but come on you know him better than me or sal he has broken protocols before he is capable of impulsive decisions maddy smiled that he is she picked up her can again and tossed another fizzy mouthful down so like if somebody in history does find a message from him i guess were going to have to do a lot of tidying up after ourselves it will depend on who discovers the message and when in history that person comes from well it would be dropped somewhere some time in the state of texas it could be anyone from some apache indian or maybe a cowboy to i dunno maybe a civilwar soldier or an oil driller or some college kids goofing around off the main highway it could be anyone you presume they have only travelled back in time a hundred or two hundred years it is equally possible they exist in what will one day be texas long before the arrival of colonials it is equally possible they exist in a time before the arrival of native americans isnt there a way you could at least bestguess how far back in time theyve gone negative however it might be possible for my ai duplicate to compare the density of tachyon particles in the vicinity of the explosion and the arrival point the decay attrition is constant and this would give a fairly precise indication of when they are she stared at the screen really affirmative it will depend on how accurate the reading was if bob was right if that was true and they had a timestamp then getting some sort of message through time to her was the only course they could take and liam and the version of bobs ai that was with him were smart enough to come to the exact same conclusion ive got a feeling its going to be all right i really do i hope you are correct maddy she nodded wishing she had just a little of liams laidback devilmaycare attitude she tilted her can and swilled another mouthful lets have some music its like a freakin graveyard in here i have an extensive database of music what would you like for your listening pleasure something heavy something rocky clarify heavy rocky bob just give me something lively then i can analyse the audio files in my database for variables such as beatsperminute waveform volume number of times played do that she cut in do that number of times played give me something the previous team liked to listen to affirmative she heard his hard drive whirring softly then a moment later the speakers on the desk either side of the main monitor began to chug with a heavy drum beat is this acceptable she sat back in her chair and put her feet up on the desk it sounded pretty good to her a bit like nine inch nails marilyn manson a bit like chilli peppers yeah cool i like it the music echoed around the archway bouncing off the cool brick walls making the place feel a little more alive chapter million years bc jungle liam watched becks and the men lowering the bridge between them he was surprised at the strength of the vine rope showing no signs yet of fraying and snapping despite the tree trunk having been raised and lowered a dozen times already it thudded down on the boulders on the far side of the river bouncing and flexing as it settled into place all right he shouted over the roar of the river everyone whos not staying lets go the first of those that were going along on the trip began to carefully bumshuffle their way along the log getting damp with spray from below twelve of them in total leaving four behind to man the camp joseph lam and jonah middleton sophia yip and keisha jackson lam as the only adult was in charge and becks had made sure he fully understood how important it was to keep the windmill rotating its arms the contraption was a post with a balanced crossbar like a pair of scales and someones rucksack on one side slowly leaking one at a time pebbles on to the ground as the weight adjusted and the scales slowly tilted it turned a simple windmill a long thin spar of wood that swung through the air with a regular rhythm every few hours the rucksack needed to be topped up again to maintain the blades swinging action it couldnt be allowed to stop lam understood enough of its purpose already maintaining a regular metronomelike signature of movement becks also briefed him on the warning signs that the area in the immediate vicinity was being probed heat a momentary localized jump in temperature of about ten degrees and a slight visual shimmering if a probe actually did occur while they were gone shed continued there would almost certainly be another one directly afterwards to doublecheck the rhythmic interference and provided the windmill was still waving and duplicating the same unnatural pattern he could expect a twoyardwide time window to open and for someone to emerge from it looking for them lam assured them hed set up a rota to keep the contraption turning and then wished them all luck theyd spent a few days preparing to set off on the trip sixty miles heading northeast with no idea at all what sort of terrain they were going to have to cross it could be jungle all the way it could turn to desert for all they knew which was why they each carried in their school rucksacks as many plastic bottles as had come through with them full of drinking water they had some food too parcels of grilled fish meat wrapped in broad waxy leaves and tied up with vine rope enough food and water to last them a few days and hopefully they could forage for more along the way kelly was first across and waited for the next with a helping hand extended everyone also had a weapon now either a spear or metalshard hatchet or both juan had even managed to produce three surprisingly good bows from suitably sturdy branches and a quiver full of arrows from sharpened bamboo canes with fletching made from thin strips of bark the arrows had proved to be rubbish against the hard wood of a tree trunk splintering on impact but tested on the long bulky carcass of one of those huge fish the arrows had gone almost entirely through liam wondered however if a volley of their arrows would do little more than irritate a trex if they met one sixty miles he hoped the terrain ahead of them was as free of lumbering prehistoric monsters as this jungle had so far proved to be other than those ugly mudfish in the river and that bloody carcass theyd encountered over a week ago the only living things hed seen had been dragonflies the size of seagulls and bugs the size of rats although at night the jungle seemed to echo with the curious haunting calls of a host of unknown creatures the others were mostly across now wet from the spray of the river and the sweat of exertion in this hot and humid jungle becks was the last one across she walked nimbly and confidently along the flexing trunk perfect balance and absolutely no fear of falling into the turbulent froth beneath liam pursed his lips jealous of that to know no fear to not have that gnawing sensation of terror in your stomach every time something thudded heavily out there in the dark of the jungle not that he could afford to show it his stupid grin and the casual flick of his hand was all he allowed himself every time something happened that made him want to whimper for example he truly wished theyd not happened across that bloody ribcage that meant something or things was out there sharing the jungle with them something theyd yet to see becks jumped off the end of the log on to the silt riverbank beside liam are you ready to proceed liam oconnor he sucked air through his teeth as he glanced around at the others they all seemed to be looking at him to lead the way northeast you say becks beckss eyelids fluttered once as she consulted onboard data three hundred and eleven degrees magnetic she said pointing her finger towards the thick apron of trees ahead of them we must proceed in that direction right then he said grasping his spear in both hands he looked back over his shoulder at the four theyd left behind on the far side of the river and cupped his mouth ill have a pint of stout to celebrate when we get back they cocked their heads and looked confused so did everyone on this side stout ale he said you know whitmore scratched his beard thoughtfully do you mean beer liam shook his head you americans really have no idea what a good beer is do you whitmore shrugged i had a guinness once becks shook her head earnestly liam oconnor we do not have any alcoholic beverages in the camp you will not be able to have a stout oh doesnt matter he sighed i was only trying to be funny shall we just get on with this affirmative she looked up the sun was breaching the tree tops sending a scattering starburst of rays across the morning sky i calculate we have nine and a quarter hours of daylight before the sun sets again then lets get a wriggle on said liam we got a lot of miles to cover broken claw watched them step off right past him and into the jungle right past him he was amazed at how little the new creatures seemed to see with their small eyes broken claw could quite easily have reached out from the hummock of tall grass he was crouching behind and touched one of them the rest of his pack were there with him dotted around beneath the shelter of ferns behind the slender trunks of the trees that lined the river as many hunting males as he had teeth in his mouth the females and the younger pack members a little further back in the jungle for safety so many of them hiding within a few yards of them and yet none of these curious pale upright creatures seemed to have any idea they were being watched broken claw struggled to make sense of that perhaps these things had spotted them but for some cunning reason were hiding their reactions again another reason to be wary of them that and those sticks they carried those sticks that could easily trap fish from the raging river and new things curved sticks with a taut line of vine stretched from one end to the other he wondered what these new devices did the new creatures stumbled clumsily and noisily past up the gentle incline of the bank and disappeared into the dark canopy of the jungle broken claw turned from them to study the others on the far side of the river they were pulling on another length of vine and he watched in silent awe as the tree trunk across the water slowly jerked and wobbled and raised inches at a time reminding him of one of the large plaindwellers raising its head and long neck after drinking from a pool of water he understood this thing now he understood its purpose a way across the dangerous water a way that could be raised and lowered at will he caught sight of yellow eyes dotted here and there the intent gaze of his extended family pack they too were watching the tree rise apparently under its own power that was good good that they were seeing for themselves how wary they must be of these harmlesslooking new arrivals broken claw offered a soft bark and the yellow eyes vanished and the pack like a ghostly dawn mist dissipating under the warm light of a rising sun was suddenly gone as if theyd evaporated into the jungle chapter million years bc jungle it was gone midafternoon as they neared the crest of the steep jungle mountain theyd been struggling up since dawn through fleeting gaps in the foliage canopy liam had caught glimpses of an ebony ridge of peaks ahead of them to the left and right as far as he could see hed considered suggesting they turn left or right to try finding a way round but that might mean a detour of days better he decided to press on up the sloping jungle hillside and tackle the ridge at least it would be all downhill on the far side up ahead now the jungle was fast thinning giving way to smaller withered trees trying to find a foothold on a ground of shale and gravel dotted with coarse tufts of grass just ahead of him becks emerged into sunlight he noticed that her back taut with muscle was bone dry dont these clones ever sweat liam was drenched every inch of his skin was slick with perspiration the salt running down from his fringe stinging his eyes behind him he could hear franklyn and whitmore talking they hadnt stopped since theyd set out from the camp a relentless jabbering to and fro on all things prehistoric it was certainly reassuring to know their group had what sounded like a fair bit of expertise on this alien environment but liam would happily have paid a ship stewards monthly wage for them to just shut up for five minutes whitmore dabbed at his damp forehead but i want to know why we havent seen any yet this mesozoic era was very favourable to the larger species i mean no need to patronize me mr whitmore franklyn cut in i know all that i know this was the most densely populated era that the cretaceous was really the time of the dinosaurs much more so than the jurassic era whitmore nodded mind you it wouldnt have sounded quite so snappy if theyd called that film cretaceous park would it at least it would have been more accurate said franklyn but its so strange dont you think i mean dinosaur valley state park isnt so far away and the paluxy riverbed there is covered in fossils from all types of species how come this jungle valleys like deserted franklyns voice was laden with disappointment i mean here we are the perfect time in fact to see all the classic species trex ankylosaurus stegosaurus triceratops and yet weve seen nothing it could be the jungle itself is unfavourable terrain for the larger animals thats not true replied franklyn its nutrient heaven for the herbivores and where there are herbivores you should also find carnivores this jungle should be full of them well said whitmore looking up the slope at the thinning vegetation and craggy peak ahead of them no more jungle now they and the rest of the party followed liam and becks out of the lush green into a mostly greybrown world of slate and shingle up ahead the slope rose to a fractured cliff face of sharp slate angles he could see that the robogirl was already climbing up it making swift progress from one treacherous handhold to the next he watched her pulling herself up the sheer cliff face without any apparent difficulty robogirl now they all knew she was some kind of a robot and after seeing her nearly skewer laura like one of those mudfish and lord knows if liam hadnt intervened she would have killed them all one after the other there was no way anyone was going to entirely trust her whitmores feet slid on the shale as he scrambled awkwardly up the last fifty yards to the base of the cliff to join liam we were whitmore gasped like an asthmatic as he wiped the sweat from his brow he looked up at the sheer rock face were climbing that yup said liam i im he was still heaving to catch some air im not sure ill be able to liam shook his head as he peeled the rucksack off his back not a lot of choice mr whitmore its that direction we need to go he swallowed anxiously uh im really not so great with heights dont worry about that mr whitmore she can pull you up if youd like franklyn puffed and wheezed up the last few yards kicking loose shale beneath his trainers that goes for me too im exhausted liam looked up the rock face and saw becks was already at the top and bracing her legs against an outcrop for balance she pulled the heavy coils of vine rope off her shoulder secured one end round her waist and tossed the rest down it clattered on to the shale with several dozen yards in length to spare liam looked at them both and down at the others making their way up the last few dozen yards of the mountainside beyond them he could see the green carpet of the jungle rolling all the way down the steep peak theyd been ascending to the deep valley below he thought he could just make out the hairline silver glint of the river snaking through the lush emerald carpet and there it was a small oval of lighter green no bigger than his fingernail their clearing i am ready to proceed becks called down they all studied the cliff face unhappily sixtyfoot high all razorsharp edges and craggy outcrops that promised to impale or slice anyone unfortunate enough to take a tumble dont all be chickens said becks liam glanced up at her and saw she was smiling did she just try to be funny cluck cluck she added in her monotone voice liam shook his head put his hands on his hips and smiled so i see youve found a sense of humour becks i have been observing and learning humorous dialogue exchanges liam i am now capable of delivering basic humorous responses well done he shouted back you are all little chickens cluck cluck cluck she said again with a hint of pride in her dry voice not exactly hilarious liam decided as he looked around at the concerned expressions on the others but at least her ai was having a go at being more human is she all right asked juan liam shrugged its her attempt at a joke dont worry shes fine he looked up at her becks maybe we should save the joking around for later all right youre scaring the kids her face straightened affirmative ok then he turned back to the others whos first there wasnt exactly a rush liam was the last one up as becks hefted him up on to the ridge and helped him to his feet he could see she looked fatigued in fact he realized it was the first time hed ever seen her looking like that genuinely spent you ok becks recommendation i should now consume protein and then rest for several hours she said her grey eyes met his for a moment and he wondered if there was a hint of gratitude in her expression gratitude that hed bothered to ask if she was ok ok you do that he said slapping her shoulder we could all probably do with a rest maybe we should set up camp here for tonight she considered that for a moment panning her eyes around the immediate surroundings this is an acceptable location right ill tell the others he wandered across the top of the peak towards the rest of them they were clustered together and staring out over the sloping ridge on the far side of the peak from where he stood he could see nothing but a rich blue sky and a faroff topheavy bank of cloud hanging above a flat horizon like a giant floating anvil what is it can you see something he clattered over kicking stones and raising dust until he was standing right beside them oh my his voice fluttered softly theres all the dinosaurs youve ever wanted to see kid said whitmore to franklyn the peak sloped down gently grey shale gradually giving way in patches to an enormous plain of verdant grassland dotted with islands of jungle tall straight deciduous canopy trees draped with the vines theyd come to rely on around the patches of jungle herds of huge beasts liam couldnt begin to name grazed lazily in the lateafternoon sun between the slowly meandering groups of giants smaller packs of fleetfooted beasts flocked and weaved in an endless zigzagging race my god whispered kelly this is really quite incredible whitmore and franklyn were grinning like a pair of children in a toy store beyond the sweeping plain liam noticed the flat horizon changed from a drab olive colour to a rich turquoise laura was frowning at that confused is that an ocean over there i dont recall texas having a freakin ocean in the middle of it franklyn nodded sixtyfive million years ago there was he said adopting the learned air of a college principal an inland ocean that ran northsouth up the middle of america cutting it in two in fact laura you probably wouldnt recognize earth if you were looking at it from orbit right now liam watched in silence for a good minute stunned like everyone else into stillness and quiet as he gazed out on a scene that no human before had ever witnessed nor should ever witness again a moment of incalculable privilege uniqueness once upon a time and it felt like another lifetime now hed been standing in the creaking bowels of a dying ship waist deep in icecold water facing certain death and crying like a small child and there was foster holding his hand out to him uttering a promise that if he joined him there were going to be things hed see wonderful things incredible things well this is certainly one of them liam whispered to himself whats that said kelly liam roused himself and grinned nothing i just said so this is where all you big fellas have been hiding a goodnatured ripple of laughter spread among them were camping up here tonight he announced studying the distant strip of ocean blue on the horizon and tomorrow well be at the seaside so we will chapter million years bc jungle liam savoured the warmth of the fire on his face and hands it had turned out to be surprisingly cool up here on the peak once the sun had gone down and his sweatdamp clothes had begun to feel uncomfortably chilly against his skin in the sky above the dark plain spread out before them the last stain of day spread a warm rich amber light along the flat horizon and the night was beginning to fill with the distant haunting chorus of creatures calling to each other across miles of open plain he heard the scuff of boots and skittering shale approaching out of the dark becks appeared and sat down heavily next to him hello liam hello he replied chewing on the rubbery corner of his reheated grilled mudfish he looked at her eyes glistening as they reflected the campfire in front of them he wondered what went on behind them when she wasnt busy assessing mission priorities or threat factors he wondered if that tiny organic brain linked to her computer could appreciate how beautiful that amber sky was or enjoy the pleasing sensation of warmth from the fire your ais done a bit of growing again hasnt it he said presently your cluck cluck thing earlier was well about as funny as one of my old auntie noreens jokes but the thing is it sounded almost human thank you she nodded it has been useful to me observing these younger humans their social interactions are more heavily nuanced by emotional indicators and less restricted by expected convention his face creased as he digested that you mean theyre more likely to blurt out whatever theyre thinking than adults affirmative well now he said smiling thats probably true laura whitely sitting opposite caught what they were saying over the babble of dinosaur talk going on between kelly whitmore and franklyn i dont blurt she said children do that beckss gaze shifted to her are you not a child she gave liam an is she for real look one eyebrow cocked with incredulity excuse me im fifteen im not a child im a teenager you still have four years of physical and mental growth to undergo before you are technically an adult human being said becks optimum mental and physical functionality is obtained at nineteen years of age this makes you still a child yeah and what about you what are you then beckss jaw dropped open a facial expression liam had not seen her pull before nor an expression he could recall bob ever pulling either for that matter beckss eyes gazed at the fire for a long long time the lids fluttering slightly every now and then shes really giving that some serious thought i will she began after a while i will never be a complete human being lauras face softened ever so slightly a second ago shed looked like she wanted to square up to becks now she almost looked sorry for her you sound sad about that sad becks considered that word sad she said again quietly my developmental ai routines allow me to learn and replicate human behaviour patterns but i am unable to directly experience emotions this would affect my performance as a support unit so let me get this straight said laura shuffling round the fire closer to them so she wasnt being drowned out by franklyns droning voice youre flesh and blood just like a human being but your head is like all robot my body is a genetically enhanced female human body i have multiplethreaded muscle tissue capable of a five hundred and seventysix per cent performance response laura looked at liam that means shes what like six times stronger than she should be liam nodded aye that sounds about right i also have a highdensity calciumbased support chassis strong bones said liam laura nodded it looked like shed figured that out for herself i also have a rapidreaction high whitecellcount fluid repair system becks turned to laura my blood clots quickly right all of this gene technology will be developed by w g systems in the year for military applications genetically engineered combat units wow uttered laura you mean like super soldiers correct i was designed for war specifically subterfuge and covert operations liam smiled but dont let that put you off her shes a sweetie really becks looked at him curiously sweetie liam put an arm round her shoulders and hugged her clumsily we go back a bit becks and me would you believe it she used to be a man so she did big chap just like some muscleman called schwarzenhoffer or something apparently he becomes a president of yours sometime oh my god laura made a face you dont mean arnold schwarzenegger thats the fella anyway becks was called bob back then but well you had a bit of a scrap didnt you and caution said becks it is inadvisable to reveal details of previous missions liam hushed perhaps theyd revealed more than they ought yes youre right sorry laura liam decided to change the subject becks we should consider what message we want to leave in the ground you know becks nodded affirmative this is important kelly overheard that you guys discussing the help message and that shut up everyone around the fire even franklyn yes replied liam ive been giving it some thought becks we would have to actually reveal the exact date and location of our field office she frowned negative the location and timestamp must remain known only to agency operatives but we have to do you not see because sal and maddy arent exactly likely to go fossilhunting in texas any time soon it will be someone else who finds it and the only way it will find its way to them is if we reveal that you know said kelly that kind of information would be mighty powerful stuff the fact that timetravel technology exists the fact that humans have actually been back to dinosaur times thats worldchanging information liam you understand that dont you you mentioned time contamination and time waves and stuff like that wont it oh for sure said liam thats the kind of nightmare we were recruited to prevent contamination of the timeline and yet youll be causing it i know i know but its the only way he looked at chan sitting quietly between leonard and juan the timeline is already badly broken who knows what state the future is in now and yes by deliberately stamping a big ol message into the ground were about to make it a lot worse but and its taken me some time to see this for myself time is like i dunno like liquid its fluid what can be changed can be changed right back so long as you know where to go and what to do and of course as long as youve got a time machine liam nodded at chan we need to get edward back to that fixes part of the problem then once weve done that becks and i will come right back here and undo all that contamination how very simple said liam chapter million years bc jungle liam looked down at the shale by his feet he dragged a finger through it the others watched curiously as his finger inscribed four letters in the gravel he spelled the word help then with his hand he messed it up well erase the message we just left he said and everything that happened as a result of it being discovered well itll all unhappen itll all be erased too if your message includes the location of your base said kelly i assure you it wont be some curious fossilhunter that turns up itll be some secret government agency nsa cia maybe some spooks we dont even know about theyll storm the place kick the door in delta force guys with guns what youve got is too valuable oh liam hadnt considered that you could be endangering your colleagues said laura they wouldnt hurt them would they theyd just want to be asking questions would they not kelly shrugged with something like timetravel technology at stake who knows our secret services have a long history of shooting places up first and asking questions later whitmore cut in oh come on theyre professionals the best in the world several of the others joined in some agreeing with that some of them disagreeing liam looked at becks maybe this is not such a great idea you wish me to proceed with the alternate plan she said softly liam looked at her pleased that shed had the sense to ask that in little more than a whisper not so encouraged though seeing one of her hands flinching and reaching for a hatchet no not yet he said reaching out and grasping her hand in his not yet ok she nodded unless said edward quietly his voice almost lost beneath the to and fro of all the others unless theres a really important reason not to hurt anyone the others stopped and looked at him it was the first thing hed said all evening all day in fact edwards eyes widened as they all stared at him i i was just saying go on said liam well if part of your message was a was in like a code then theres a reason to you know not to want to shoot everyone up because they know theyd need someone to decode it liam pursed his lips in thought thats true a code a secret hinting at still further secrets and revelations what person wouldnt want to know more if a message is going to lead some government spooks right up to the front door of your secret organization said kelly then you can bet the bit of the message they cant make sense of will be driving them nuts edwards right theyll want your colleagues alive all right said liam so then the first bit of the message needs to be the time and place of our field office he turned to becks thats how the message will find its way to maddy and sal the rest the timestamp they need to aim for that bit should be the supersecret coded bit can you come up with a code becks she nodded i can produce a mathematical algorithm and use that as an alphanumeric offset code my duplicate should be able to recognize the pattern of the algorithm and produce a decode key no said edward shaking his head its too easy to break a mathbased code if they you know if they put a big enough computer on it they could crack it simple kelly nodded and you can bet the nsa or the cia or whichever bunch of spooks ends up calling will have no shortage of computing power at their disposal to crunch your code there is no other way to generate a code that can be unlocked at the field office said becks my duplicate needs to have the same library of algorithms every mathbased code can be broken said edward his quiet voice finding a little more confidence you know eventually its just a case of how much computer power you put on it edwards right said howard think about it what if the message is discovered say he turned to whitmore and franklyn when did they first discover fossils in this place were headed to franklyn shrugged early s right so if the american secret services of that time secured that fossil back then theyll have had a whole century of time to crack the algorithm and decode it before they come knocking but computers powerful enough to work on it were only developed in the s said juan don forget that thats more than enough time said howard theyll come knocking knowing the entire contents of the message their only concern will be securing your agencys hq and confiscating all your technology your colleagues will be a secondary consideration your code has to be like a personal thing said edward like a secret something only you and they know howard shook his head im thinking this is a seriously bad idea we could end up really messing with history and i thought you guys are meant to stop that kind of thing happening and staying here young man said whitmore what do you think thats going to do to history homosapiens existing right now sixtyfive million years before theyre due howard shrugged we wont exist for long though will we his words silenced the teacher you actually think the sixteen of us are going to survive and thrive you think were going to breed and produce lots of offspring and establish a cretaceousera human civilization thats going to change the world whitmore shrugged and halfnodded its possible howard laughed no its not well eventually die out here he looked around at them there are six females in the group he looked at becks not counting you im not really sure what you are i am incapable of sexual reproduction she replied flatly six fertile females continued howard we might be able to make a few babies but there are too few of us to sustain ourselves if disease doesnt get us or some hungry carnivore then inbreeding would eventually he managed a wistful smile well die out soon enough months years decades maybe but itll happen and history wont be changed by us having been here maybe we shouldnt do this maybe we should accept were stuck here and you can forget that said laura i want to go home kelly nodded i think we all want that right heads nodded around the fire liam sat forward held his hands out towards the fire and rubbed them were doing the message leonard we have to now ive just got to figure out something that only we and they know how big is your agency asked laura liam smiled and replied hesitantly oh you know its big lots of us so there are you know them well sure were all pretty close friends yes id like to think were then maybe theres something like a song or a film or something you know something like that you could use as a common reference point for liam suddenly felt his hand being crushed by a vicelike grip he looked down and saw becks was holding it and squeezing it ow becks youre hurting me he hissed whats the matter she let go and looked at him her eyes widened with a mixture of surprise and perhaps even elation i have had an idea liam oconnor chapter million years bc jungle from the darkness they watched them beyond the illumination of the dancing yellow flower in the middle broken claw had seen this fascinating dancing creature only once before after a storm when a stab of light from the sky had come down and touched the long dead trunk of a tree the yellow flower had engulfed it consumed it producing such unbearable heat as it did so hed been young then and ever since then the yellow flower had been an occasional monster in his dreams chasing him reaching out for him wanting so much to consume him and now here it was tamed like some sort of a pet by these new creatures they were gathered around it unafraid of it every now and then casually throwing a branch on to it and not even flinching as the creature reared up angrily sending tendrils of light up into the dark sky he looked around at his pack cowering further back down the slope clearly unhappy at being out of the jungle and here in the open this was not their terrain this was not where they were strong open ground made them visible it made them vulnerable larger predators existed in the open large lumbering and stupid predators like the tall upright one with tiny front claws enormous jaws powerful rear legs and a strong sweeping tail his pack called it manyteeth out in the open manyteeth could quite easily kill them all after all broken claws kind were small fragile things compared to this powerful mountain of muscle and energy but between them his family pack had killed quite a few in his living memory and always in the same way luring them into the jungle with the tempting cry of one of their young a pitiful cry that perfectly replicated that of a young helpless planteater a cry that signalled fear and proved an irresistible taunt to one of those large stupid beasts once among the densely packed trees unable to sweep its tail easily unable to turn quickly the pack was always able to leap upon the various manyteeth theyd lured in that way and begin to tear through their thick hides and rubbery bands of tough muscle tissue to the vulnerable soft tissues inside as they thrashed and roared broken claw had led many such attacks in past seasons always the first to gnaw his way through the hide and into the bellies of such creatures slashing and pulling through the vulnerable insides as the creature still stomped and roared pulling himself towards the throbbing red organ in its chest it was slashing at this that usually felled a manyteeth broken claw and the others knew that this organ which seemed to have a life of its own which every species of creature seemed to possess was the source of its very life in the seasons of his youth the jungles had once been full of the larger stupid species so many of them in fact that they often killed many more than they could eat often only bothering to consume their favourite organs and leaving the rest of the carcass to rot but there were fewer now far fewer of the bigger creatures they only existed on the plain these days broken claw understood a simple principle they had hunted too many of them they had been too successful for their own good in the jungle and his family pack had been forced to migrate from one jungle valley to the next several times during his lifespan now too in recent seasons this jungle had become sparsely populated another hunting ground that theyd almost completely exhausted there certainly was not enough food available in the jungle valley for these new creatures as well slowly lightly he glided forward across the loose shale mindful that his agile feet not dislodge anything that might make the slightest noise behind him he heard the soft barking cough of one of his mates warning him not to get too close to these things he ignored her he needed to listen to the noises these things made perhaps their sounds could be learned even mimicked perhaps they could employ the same technique they used on the manyteeth identifying a sound that could be practised and used by their young to lure one of the new creatures away from the others if just one of them could be isolated they could study it understand how dangerous it could be understand its weakness perhaps in the last moments of its life even share some of its intelligence then he could find out if this creature also had the same fluttering red orb in its ribcage the organ that provided life chapter million years bc jungle liam gazed up at the behemoth slowly ambling their way youre sure its a planteater franklyn laughed yes relax of course it is its an alamosaurus liam watched the enormous longnecked creature walk with ponderous deliberation across the open plain towards the patch of jungle behind them he could feel each heavy step through the trembling ground jayzusnmothermary that things the size of a small ship he guessed he could park a doubledecker tram in the space between its fore and its hind legs and still have room to stand on top the creatures tiny head little more than a rounded nub on the end of its long muscular neck swept down close to the ground as it closed the distance between them finally coming to a halt to inspect the small bipedal creatures standing in front of it are you absolutely certain cried liam watching the things head hover at shoulder height just a few yards in front of him yes hes probably more scared of you than you are of oh liam shook his head vigorously i uh i very much doubt that see hes just checking you out said franklyn slowly stepping forward to join liam and becks hey there big man he cooed softly its ok were not carnivores well actually i am said whitmore a little veal and a nice bottle of sancerre on a saturday night small beady black eyes in a rounded head not much bigger than a cider keg studied liam intently its nostrils flared for a moment as it inhaled the curious new smell of humans then curiosity compelled it to take a solitary step forward liam felt the ground beneath his feet shudder oh he likes you man called out juan liam felt a fetid blast of warm air across his face and closed his eyes as the dinosaurs head moved even closer ohh im not happy about this he hissed out of the side of his mouth thick leathery lips the size of an automobile tyre probed his face then moved up to explore the intriguing texture of his dark hair oh he really likes you man want us to leave you two alone chuckled juan hair said whitmore thats an evolutionary step thats millions of years away for this creature the texture of it must be fascinating to him liam felt a sharp tug on his scalp ow well hes bleedin well eating it now so he is he slapped at the creatures mouth hey ouch let go becks help becks reacted swiftly she stepped towards him and swung a fist at the alamosauruss nose the blow smacked heavily against the leathery skin and with a roar of pain and horror the giant let go of liam its thick muscular neck reared up suddenly a treefelling in reverse and it let loose a deafening bellow that reminded liam of the dying groans of the titanic s hull the air vibrated with its startled roar liam clasped his hands over his ears to protect his rattling eardrums as the cry spread across the plain from one giant herbivore to the next the alamosaur stumbled back from them on its treetrunk legs turning in a long cumbersome arc and began to shamble away in a loping slowmotion run that felt through the ground like the early tremors of an earthquake oh great shouted franklyn now you started a stampede the calm scene of moments ago a vista of leviathans grazing peacefully across the open plain had been instantly transformed into a deafening display of motion and panic liam watched the smaller species of planteaters scrambling to avoid being stampeded by the other alamosaurs darting into the islands of trees and ferns for cover whoa juan was doubling up with excited laughter those alamo things are real chickens man look at the suckers go amid the confusion of movement and kickedup dust liam caught sight of something else dark shapes behind them half a mile away smaller than any of the other species out on the plain just a glimpse of them a second no more then they were gone to ground hidden among the kneehigh tufts of olivecoloured grass scattered in threadbare clumps across the open plain liam turned to ask if anyone else had seen them but the others were still marvelling at the sight of an entire food chain on the move a thunderous spectacle of swaying folds of leathery skin and sinews taut with panic he turned back to look again nothing as if the dark shapes had never ever existed what the heck are those vanished like skeins of dark smoke like that ghostly seeker or am i losing me mind now it was fully five minutes before some semblance of calm returned to the area the various species of herbivores gathered in a worriedlooking cluster a mile away tall necks protruded from the pack standing fully erect watching them from afar like impossibly large meerkats oh that was fun said laura can we go do it again liam looked at becks her face was folded with a confused expression becks whats the matter she looked down at her fist still balled up i did not hit it very hard you must have hit a sensitive spot said whitmore they made their way across the plain towards the coastline on the horizon most of the time with franklyn complaining about how becks had ruined his chance to study the creatures up close by noon they were standing among a scattering of boulders and looking at a broad beach of dark coarse sand and a tranquil tropical ocean sending gently lapping waves of surf up the shingle and back down again with a soothing hiss so said liam becks studied the view for a long moment her eyes narrowed twentyone miles northeast of our current location liam grimaced so then its underwater is it negative she replied pointing at the horizon ahead of them this is a large bay observe the horizon liam looked again squinting then he saw it a pale line of low humps on the horizon that hed earlier assumed were clouds following the uneven greyblue line to the left he could see it becoming more distinct as it drew closer the broad beach they were looking along seemed to promise that it was angling gradually towards the distant spur of land and if they were patient enough with it it would link up with the spur eventually recommendation we follow the beach around to the landmass ahead liam nodded at the low hump of land is that the place we need to be she nodded information the distance of the landmass is nine point seven six miles whitmore nodded then that spur has to be it right thats what will one day be the fossil bed becks nodded slowly information a ninetythree per cent probability you are correct my god he said scratching his beard who knows some of the footprints well see along the beach over there might just end up being some of the fossils weve seen in museums in our time his eyes widened and he shook his head incredulously isnt that the craziest idea he slapped liam on the shoulder time travel must drive you insane if you think about it too much liam cocked an eyebrow oh ive had my share of headaches thinking on it so i have they stepped forward down through the boulders and on to the coarse shingle this is good said becks to liam pointing at the beach we are not leaving tracks he looked down she was right the beach wasnt sand it was a coarse gravel that clacked and shifted wetly underfoot but left nothing as clear as a print behind them oh good he nodded so there you go something to put a smile on your face then she gave that some thought this is minimizing our overall contamination liability her gaze shifted from their feet back up to him correct that makes me happy there you go you miserable sod he replied cheerfully things are looking up well be home soon enough they clattered down through the wet shingle until the first warm waves of tropical water hissed up to and around their feet up ahead the others had decided to wade kneedeep into the sea and were splashing each other noisily she pursed her lips in thought as she watched them a curious gesture she must have picked up from one of the girls liam decided a gesture that bobs muscular face would have struggled to reproduce if we successfully complete the mission liam oconnor and we return to the field office do you intend to retire me retire what do you mean terminate this body and replace it with a male support unit i heard sal vikram refer to this organic frame as a mistake hed not given it much thought becks was sals error shed not bothered to check the gender marker on the containment tube and theyd not had time to consider growing another but certainly neither maddy nor sal had mentioned terminating her and disposing of her body why would we want to go and do that becks the male support frame is eightyseven per cent more effective than the female frame as a combat unit all right maybe thats true but whyd the agency give us female babies as well then female support frames can be useful for covert operations where a female cover is required he scratched his head well now i really dont see why we cant have one of each of you you know a bob and a becks therere no agency rules are there you know against us having two support units in a team negative i am not aware of any agency rules on that so well there you are why not well have two of you instead of one they walked in silence for a while liam intrigued by how human her question had sounded have i functioned as efficiently as the bob unit she asked after a while yes of course i dont know what wed have done without you so far but you know its still so very weird arent you actually bob anyway or at least a copy of bob in a different skin negative my ai has adapted enough since being copied to be considered a different ai ident i have experienced data that bob has not also the organic brain that is interfaced with the ai is genetically different between the male and female support frames right but you remember being bob right of course i recall all the incidents of our first mission right up until the moment you removed my chip liam wished he couldnt remember that as well ugghh not something id like to do again in a hurry you successfully preserved the ai it contained six months of adaptive learning she replied both bob and i are six months closer to fully emulating human behaviour we are both grateful he shrugged modestly oh you know its nothing just part of the job i am able to kiss you she said this would be an appropriate gesture of gratitude i have data she began puckering her lips and liam felt that odd conflicted sensation hed felt after theyd first arrived in a tingling excitement offset with a sense of revulsion bob in a girl suit remember uh thats ok becks a thanks is more than good enough affirmative as you wish anyway where the hell did you learn about kissing i have a detailed description from a book i was reading while i was installed in the mainframe eh what sort of books have you been reading the book is entitled harry potter and the deathly hallows whats that a novel the digital file is in early twentyfirst century pdf format the files original replication date is hold on said liam stopping do you have that file in your database still she nodded my reading was interrupted i wished to complete it so i added it to my shortterm cache and would bob also have the exact same file on the computer system of course his mouth hung open theres the code then right there thats the code you could use isnt it her eyelids fluttered as she processed the thought you are talking of a book code thats right a harrywhatevermijingamy book code chapter million years bc jungle howard noticed the young boy walking alongside him sloshing through the warm seawater hey he said edward smiled hey you always called leonard or do your friends call you lenny howard shrugged not a question hed anticipated being asked uh mostly just leonard he replied my mom calls me lenny but i hate that i heard someone say your best subject is math he nodded it was my he stopped inwardly cursing it is my favourite school subject always loved math its like well i dunno i suppose its like a sort of poetry that only a few people get if you know what i mean its like exclusive chan nodded yeah i know what you mean thats why i like it its something i know and other people dont it makes me feel kind of special i guess maybe thats why i dont have any friends at school cos they think im odd howard nodded yeah i guess im the same a loner he squinted up at the bright sun never ever get picked for sports because im the geek he shrugged but thats ok cos i never liked sports anyway edward nodded me neither its for jocks and dittoheads dittoheads howard laughed i like it you never heard that expression not in my time he almost answered but instead he just shook his head hey said edward suddenly and bent down to scoop up a curious twisted ammonite shell from the shingle see there are even bigger ones of those said howard nodding at some of the others wading waist deep in the clear blue water occasionally ducking down to pull shells out of the water to admire them they walked on in silence for a while going a little further into the warm water up ahead leading the way and deep in conversation howard could see the two agents liam and his robogirl he shook his head at the irony of it despite their turning up in to save chan they were all on the same side really all trying to prevent the nightmare of timetravel technology from destroying the world same goal different methods he wondered how hed never come across this agency in all the years of his campaigning all the rallies and protests hed been to and no one no one had ever suggested even as a joke that there might be an agency out there actually using time travel itself to combat the corruptive effects of time travel he wondered who was behind it whod set it up surely not the american government not any government in fact the internationally agreed penalties for that were severe no politician would have the guts to risk having anything to do with time travel because international law was brutal and strict on this matter it was an automatic death penalty for any involved the great roald waldstein had been a powerful speaker on the horrendous dangers of it a great man an influential man howards small campaigning group had achieved far less his group was little more than bunches of students in universities and colleges around the world but this secret agency they were going about matters in the wrong way attempting to repair history that had been damaged by careless travellers that was very much like trying to close the barn door after all the horses have bolted no worse than that it was having to go out and hunt all those horses down then drag them kicking and screaming all the way back to the barn on the other hand his campaign groups approach had been far simpler destroy the possibility of time travel at its very root instead of closing the barn door they were burning the cursed thing down with all the horses still inside he looked at edward chan the boy smiled back at him then looked down at the lustrous pink and purple sheen of the shell in his hand he stroked the smooth surface then held it out you can have it if you want it leonard howard shook his head no its er no thanks he has to die you know that howard burn the barn right burn it long before any horses get out he realized he was delaying the necessary putting it off and putting it off and yet he knew it had to be done in theory the future the future after the year must already be changing must have changed by now it would be a world where this boy vanished in an explosion and never got to fulfil his destiny it was surely a world where a man called roald waldstein would never become the figurehead of an international campaign never become a billionaire from all his other inventions never become a household name and yes this world would still have its problems dwindling supplies of resources global warming rising seas migrating billions and dangerous levels of overpopulation but at least it would no longer have the everpresent threat of complete and utter annihilation dangling over it hed once heard a speaker at a rally ask the audience what must lie beyond the dimension of spacetime we all exist in is it hell and to meddle with dimensions beyond what we know was surely no different from opening a door to the devil himself and inviting him right on in hed spoken of a medieval artist called hieronymus bosch whod claimed hed once caught a glimpse of the devil and the underworld and painted endless nightmarish visions of what hed seen perhaps the speaker had said perhaps what hed glimpsed were dimensions beyond our understanding a momentary rip in space and time howard shuddered at the thought you know the boy has to die howard burn the barn burn the barn what are you waiting for he was so deep in thought he didnt at first register the voices from further up the beach voices crying out a warning screaming a warning back at them edward grabbed his arm and yanked him hard howards thoughts were shaken away what the h run screamed edward pointing his finger at something behind him howard turned round to see an oddlooking dark wave approaching him fast water rolled down either side of an enormous grey hump sliding up the shallows towards him like a gigantic torpedo he spotted a large fin at the top of the large grey hump large very large the size of a car no bigger the size of a bus edward was still pulling him back from the thing trying to get howards leaden fightorflight response to do something howard started to react but far too sluggishly too clumsily he stumbled backwards over something in the thighdeep water and an instant later was flailing on his back his head underwater surfacing a moment later spluttering for air his legs scrambling to find a steady footing below all he could see now was an approaching dark cave riding up out of the shallow water at him like a freight train a cave lined with stalactites and stalagmites of razorsharp teeth and dangling tatters of rotting meat swinging between them oh no was all he could scream as the gliding mass of glistening grey hide finally came to an abrupt rest and the cave easily six foot across snapped shut round one of his feet he felt a vicelike grip on his ankle the tough leather of his combat boots compressed agonizingly tight as something hard and sharp pressed from the outside then the beast began shaking its head vigorously from side to side and he knew bones had to be breaking and splintering in his ankle as he swirled through the water howards head was underwater he felt pebbles rocks and shells grind painfully up his back and knew that meant the creature was now manoeuvring itself back from the shallows into deeper water he was holding his breath amid the tumbling underwater chaos and for a fleeting second wondered why he was bothering to do so im gonna die surely better to breathe out now and drown than experience the agony of being ferociously dismembered by this thing then without warning the incredible pressure round his nowshattered ankle was gone he flailed with his arms to right himself to find solid ground on which to place his feet he caught something with his hand the rounded side of another ammonite shell so thats down he tried to stand up and realized the creature must have pulled him further out than hed thought in those few seconds finally his head broke the surface and he realized the water was chest deep the air was thick with screaming voices and spray and the first thing he saw was chan a few yards away screaming abuse at the giant shark and jabbing his spear repeatedly at the creatures nose its head snapped and swung from side to side trying to get a grip on the fragile spear trying to get past the spear to chan on whom it had decided to vent its frustration howard waded through the water painfully slowly the chesthigh sea in collaboration with the giant predator wanting to slow him down his one good foot kept slipping on the slimy rocks below barely giving him enough purchase to make his way to shallower water behind him he heard chan still hurling abuse and still stabbing and prodding and the hiss and roar of water turned frothy white by the enraged shark thrashing in the shallows then he slipped again and fell under the water he felt a hand under his arm then another lifting him clear again it was the robogirl remain calm she said emotionlessly what about chan he found himself gasping she dragged him back to water shallow enough for him to crawl on his hands and knees then she let him go and headed back into the sea he turned and sat in the gently lapping waves exhausted and vaguely aware of the burning agony of snapped and twisted bones down at the end of his leg he watched becks splashing through the water towards where chan was still managing incredibly to keep the shark at spears length thats a very big fish was the last coherent thought his mind managed to put together before the world seemed to slump over on to its side liam watched the young man as he came round leonard how are you feeling hurts he grunted thickly becks leaned over him there are no broken bones but your achilles tendon has snapped and there is a significant contusion and several abrasions to your lower leg this will hurt but it will also mend on the other hand said liam the bad news is your boot didnt make it howard half smiled half winced a fire crackled brightly high up on the beach throwing dancing skeins of amber light and dark shadows across the shingle down to the softly lapping waterline edward chan joined them hi he said you ok howard looked up at him you you saved my life edward shrugged i just poked my stick at it for a while my god we were lucky said howard wincing again as he adjusted his position no said liam sombrely no we werent ranjits missing liam vaguely recalled hed been at the back of their party wading slowly through the water falling behind the others theyd foolishly allowed themselves to become strung out all along the beach enjoying the tropical sea like holidaymakers theyd allowed themselves to feel a false sense of security with the peaceful flat sea to one side and a wide open beach on the other poor guy whispered howard that shark thing must have got him first liam wondered about that hed been about a hundred yards back surely they would have heard the rush of water as that shark slid out of the surf surely they would have heard ranjit scream he looked out into the dark and wondered whether it had been that shark or perhaps it had been those dark shapes he thought hed seen earlier this afternoon scattering to the ground and disappearing like ghosts as hed turned back to look over his shoulder now was that real did i really see that we were lucky said kelly that it only got the one of us i mean did you see the size of that thing bigger than a killer whale this is the age of the big predators said whitmore big ones the golden age for the giant carnivores he looked ashenfaced shaken still even several hours after the incident and were prey its not the golden age for much longer said franklyn if this is sixtyfive million years ago then were near the end of the cretaceous era something happens soon on earth that wipes out all the big species fossil hunters call it the kt boundary beyond that thin layer of sedimentary rock you dont find dinosaurs any more certainly not the big ones good said laura the big asteroid said juan thats what killed them all right franklyn shrugged its still debated could have been an asteroid or a super volcano or it could simply have been a sudden climatic shift whatever extinction event happened the large species were extremely vulnerable to it it wont happen while were still here will it asked jasmine she looked as unsettled and shaken as whitmore franklyn snorted dismissively unlikely so edward muttered softly now theres only fifteen of us if no one comes for us we wont make it will we the others huddled around the fire heard that and it stilled their quiet murmurings until all that could be heard was the soft draw and hiss of the waves and the crackle of burning wood becks broke the silence leonard i have constructed a pair of crutches for you howard eased himself up on to his elbows were still going on liam nodded yes were nearly there he pointed up the beach another four or five miles around this bay and we should be there its our only hope so were going on whitmore nodded right we cant go back now laura shuffled closer to the fire hugging her shoulders against the cool night air this will work wont it somebody will find your message and theyll come for us liam grinned sure they are theyre already looking for us and hopefully leaving them this message will help them narrow down their search trust me its going to work out all right he looked at becks right she nodded seeming to understand that the others needed to hear something positive and certain from them liam is correct chapter new york sal looked at her how can you be so sure maddy shrugged i cant be a hundred per cent certain but look if liam and the unit survived the jump im pretty sure thats exactly what theyd do i mean thats all they can do sal looked up from the mug of coffee in her hands across the dim archway illuminated by the fizzing ceiling strip light towards the shutter door it was gone eleven now by this time on any normal tuesday the three of them would have been settling in for the evening liam on his bunk with his nose in a history book and a bowl of dry rice krispies on his chest and maddy surfing the internet but tonight she and maddy were both up and sitting at the kitchen table waiting for midnight to come waiting for the reset she could hear the softly growing hum of power being drawn in through the mains building up and being stored in the capacitor come midnight they would feel an odd momentary sensation of falling as the time field reset and took them back fortyeight hours to am monday morning maddy was certain or at least working hard to give that impression that immediately after the reset happened and they appeared in monday one stroke after midnight thered be a welcome party waiting outside in the backstreet and very eager to meet them who though maddy said that secrets have a way of drifting up what she meant by that was that advance knowledge of a time machine appearing in new york in would surely ultimately end up in the hands of some shady government agency men in dark suits something as important something so profoundly monumental as that could only end up in the hands of secret service spooks if that was the case then sal hoped maddy was going to find a way to cooperate with them to get liam back and then what what exactly interrogation for sure because theyd sure as shaddyah want to know every little thing about this place and the machinery inside and how it all worked theyd want to know every little thing thered be endless questions about the rest of this mysterious agency how many others where are they whos in charge sal really wasnt so sure she wanted to jump back to monday and face that there was the other possibility of course that they jumped back and no one was there waiting for them maddys logic was quite black and white about this sal realized shed thought this all through very thoroughly if nobody was waiting for them then that could only mean one thing if there was nobody outside waiting for them then liam and the support unit had never survived the explosion or if they had survived then theyd been unable to get a message to them they were lost in time for good never to be seen again she looked at the digital clock on their kitchen table red numbers that glowed softly and changed all too slowly pm oh jahulla i reaaaally hate waiting chapter million years bc jungle liam stared up at the steep slope in front of them rising up from the turquoise sea and the narrow strip of gravelly beach it was covered in canopy trees dangling vines and the swaying fronds of ferns thick jungle once again hed grown used to the reassuring comfort of being out in the open where he could see anything coming their way from afar its just beyond that becks nodded affirmative one and a half miles northeast of this point the rest of the group were wearily bringing up the rear along the broad beach none though daring to splash through the water this morning leonard was struggling at the back on the shingle with his crutches but there was edward and jasmine helping him along i have the calculation now said becks whats that when in time we are oh liam arched a brow when did you do that i set the routine running thirtythree hours ago identifying and cataloguing each tachyon particle in our vicinity before and after the jump two billion ninetythree million three hundred and twentytwo thousand nine hundred and six particles before and seventythree million one thousand five hundred and seventytwo identified particles after liam rolled his eyes he didnt need a blowbyblow account of the maths thats great so whats the answer with a constant particle attrition rate my calculation is that we are located sixtytwo million seven hundred and thirtynine thousand four hundred and six years into the past she smiled proudly accurate to five hundred years either side of that date well done becks he watched the others slowly staggering across the shifting clattering pebbles so we have a date we can put in the message and we can encode the message with your harry potter book code affirmative and of course the date and location of the field office he drew in breath through his teeth jayzus this does really feel like were meddling with time in a big way we are she replied weve just got to figure out the best way to ensure our get me out of here note lasts sixty million whatever years sixtytwo million seven hundred and thirty he raised a hand to shush her to ensure it lasts a long long time he picked out whitmore and franklyn walking side by side comparing some of the shells theyd collected i just hope those two fossil geniuses know where best to leave our message in the distance four or five miles down the beach he saw several long necks hastily emerging from a cluster of jungle and out on to the beach a small herd of those alamosauruses hurrying out into the open something just spooked them over there didnt it he watched as they thundered along the beach kicking up a trail of dust in their wake his gaze rested on edward and jasmine supporting a limping leonard up the shingle they finally caught up with the rest of them gathered at the foot of the steep slope of jungle weve just got to hike over that ladies and gents said liam and were there franklyn was exhausted out of breath and dripping with sweat he was pretty sure the climb up this steep slope of jungle was one or two degrees short of fullon vertical rock climbing he wondered how the huge canopy trees with their mushroomlike roof of leaves were managing to keep a purchase on the craggy rock sides the others seemed to be faring better than him even that poor kid leonard who was hopping and clattering up awkwardly his bad leg dangling behind him but then franklyn was carrying twenty more pounds in weight than them most of it round his middle puppy fat he preferred to call it in a vain hope that come college it was all going to magically disappear and the trim athletic body of sports jock was going to emerge hed still be a geek on the inside though but a cool jock on the outside a smart sports jock now theres something you dont see every day he was so pleased with that observation that he misplaced his step and stumbled to the ground barking his shin on a rock ow he hissed you ok man asked juan six yards ahead and above yeah im f his rucksack slid off his shoulder as he picked himself up and started sliding down the slope oh no he muttered watching it bounce off a tree trunk and continue its rolling bouncing tumbling descent just great he sighed now i gotta go down get it and climb this bit all over again ill tell the others to hold up while you get your bag kay franklyn nodded a thanks and began his descent he could see his yellow rucksack down there swinging from a low branch good it wasnt going any further then several minutes later he was nearly there pushing his way through the large fronds of a fern on to a small level clearing of dried cones and needles and soft soil across the clearing on little more than a wide ledge was his bag still swinging from a shoulder strap tangled round the broken stump of a branch if it hadnt caught there it would have rolled over the edge and hed be backtracking another tiresome ten minutes worth of climbing all the way to the bottom he stepped across unwound it from the stump and put the straps over both shoulders this time determined not to lose it again he turned round to begin his ascent once more when his eyes picked out something on the ground the familiar shape of a human footprint in the dry soil one of theirs but either side of it he saw three small dents the distinctive marks of a threetoed creature he stooped a little lower to get a closer look my god it looked just like the tracks hed seen all around that carcass theyd discovered a while back the dawning realization came suddenly and his mouth all of a sudden felt tacky and dry weve been followed he knelt down and traced another threepronged footprint in the ground with his finger and another and another weve been followed all the way from the camp it was then that he heard the soft rustle of dislodged leaves something emerging from the foliage on to the ledge behind him oh boy he whispered chapter million years bc jungle broken claw could sense the new creature knew they were there his nasal cavity picked out the faint smell of fear coming from it a chemical cocktail of sweat and adrenaline not so different from the large planteaters the new creature had cleverly spotted their tracks the new creature had finally realized it was being stalked maybe now was the time to know a little more about these strange pale beasts his soft bark ordered the others to remain where they were for now out of sight the new creature was holding one of those sticksthatcatch in one of its puffy pale hands hed watched one of these creatures fend off a giant seadweller yesterday with one of those sticks so he eyed it warily as he stepped low under the sweeping fronds of a fern under the branch from which the new creature had moments ago retrieved something bright and colourful and emerged over the rocky lip of ground to the small level clearing that salty smell of fear grew suddenly much more powerful as the new creature turned slowly round to face him broken claw rose from his crouching posture on all fours up on to his hind legs to stand fully erect it fears so close now he could see the new creature more clearly the eyes curiously large behind rounded shiny transparent discs its face all loose pale flesh unsculpted by muscle or sinew or bone carapace it made noises with its mouth noises that sounded so unlike all the other beasts in the river valley they called home noises in fact that didnt sound too unlike the simple language of coughs grunts and barks broken claws pack used franklyn in turn studied the creature that had just emerged it had a body shape he could best describe as halfway between one of the smaller therapod species and well and a human but incredibly thin almost birdlike in its agility a pair of long thin legs hinged backwards like a dogs legs meeting at a bony very femininelooking pelvis thrust acutely forward a tiny waist beneath a protruding rib cage a curved knobbly spine that hunched over and ended with a delicate tapering neck supporting an elongated skull apart from the distinctive head seen from a distance and if one squinted a little it could almost pass as a hominid humanlike oh my mmy god he whispered it cocked its head a head that fleetingly reminded franklyn of a hotdog sausage long and bonesmooth at one end a lipless mouth full of rows of lethallooking teeth above the mouth were two holes that suggested a nasal cavity around which flesh puckered and pulled as it silently breathed and above that two reptilian yellow eyes that seemed to sparkle with a keen intelligence the things skin was a dark olive green that seemed to pale to an almost human pink colour around the vulnerable belly and pelvis the creatures jaws snapped shut and opened again and it made a whining noise that reminded him vaguely of the contented murmuring a baby made after a feed it sounded almost human and those curious intelligent eyes studying him as intently as he was studying it it made another noise grating slightly deeper this time beyond the teeth he could see a black tongue twitching and fluttering and curling like a restless animal in a cage experimenting with different shapes to produce different sounds did it did it just mimic me hi said franklyn the long head tilted to one side like a dog listening for its masters voice the mouth opened again and the tongue rolled and curled aheeeee was the noise that came out lower in pitch now lower than a baby and almost matching the timbre of franklyns as yet unbroken voice he felt some of the terror replaced with the slightest flush of excitement its trying to communicate hi my names franklyn he said again louder bolder slower that long head tilted over to the other side now the gesture almost comical one of its long arms muscular lean and ending with three digits that curled into lethallooking long curved serrated blades flexed in front of it is that a hand signal franklyn attempted to duplicate the gesture bringing his short pudgy hand up before his face and curling his fingers in the same way the creature snorted air out of its nostrils and clacked its teeth he wondered if that was the creature laughing at his attempt suddenly he heard the crack of twigs and the clatter of dislodged rocks something coming down the slope above becks leaped out of the foliage on to the ground between them landing in a fightready and perfectly balanced stance she spun round to face the reptilian hominid run she said calmly as she crouched ready for action one of their crude jagged metal hatchets in one hand a spear in the other franklyn was frozen in place unsure what to do the creature had dropped down low on to all fours its elongated bananalike skull tilted back and resting flush in the spinal dip between two protruding shoulder blades it hissed and barked and a swarm of others began to emerge over the lip of ground that sloped steeply down to the bay below run screamed liam tumbling out of the foliage clumsily on to the ground beside becks run for jayzus sakes run he shouted getting up and readying his spear franklyns moment of indecision passed as he took in the crawling carpet of dark olive bodies slowly warily gliding on all fours across the clearing towards them like a deadly lava flow he turned grabbed a branch and pulled himself up the slope and into the jungle panting with panic and effort as he and his yellow rucksack quickly disappeared through the thick green fronds what hissed liam oh sod this i thought it was just the one of them the creatures were spreading out around the clearing attempting to flank them encircle them recommendation becks said turning to look at him leave liam could hear the sound of footfalls from above the others he couldnt tell if it was the sound of them coming down to help or scrambling up the slope to get further away uh right ok you going to be er all right becks ignored his stammered question as she swivelled the hatchet in her right hand with the grace of a martial arts master the yelloweyed creatures had moved too quickly encircling them so that liam already had no choice but to stay he backed up against her until their shoulders were touching oh boy oh bboy im really nnot uh oh god stay close to me becks uttered over her shoulder ssure and wwhat are yyou going to becks was already in motion he glanced round to see her leap forward swinging the spear like a baton the sharp end punctured the flank of one of the hominids and with it still lodged between two ribs she effortlessly flicked it off its feet liam backed up keeping his spear aimed at the creatures closing the gap in front of him becks stepped forward again with the grace of a ballet dancer the jagged hatchet flickering and flashing in the blur of movement it caught the long clawed digits of one of the creatures and they spun in the air spraying droplets of blood in messy arcs in front of him one of the creatures made a sudden lunge for liam hoping to catch him off guard as he backed up in beckss wake he caught the movement in his peripheral vision and had only the time to swing the spear tip round towards it before he felt the impact rattle down the frail bamboo shaft he turned to see the creatures deadly sickleshaped claws flailing inches from his face and the teeth in its long skull snapping and grating and dripping spittlestrings of saliva it was impaled on the bamboo but so very far from incapacitated and quite enraged oh jayzus i got one skewered becks was busy he held on to the rattling spear as the creature thrashed and drummed and swung and slowly eagerly pulled itself further down the shaft thick gouts of its dark blood running on to his hands help he screamed he could see one of the other hominids lowering coiling ready to leap on to him when the air was split with a childlike shriek from one of them in an instant the beat of a heart the dark olivecoloured bodies snaked scrambled and swarmed with incredible speed towards the lip of rocky ground and out of sight into the jungle slope below gone just like that except for the creature still struggling halfway down his spear a sickle claw swiped across his upper arm cutting through the material of his shirt and digging into his muscle with the ease of a butchers blade through tenderized beef gah liam bellowed help me becks was there in the blink of an eye and with a blur of movement swiped the hatchet across the creatures elegant neck it froze in shocked realization of its fate the long head tilted for a moment like a cocked gesture of curiosity then swung backwards on to its hunched spine almost completely decapitated yet still attached to the body by a frayed strip of exposed pale pink tendon it collapsed a second later pulling the spear out of liams trembling hands they both stared down at the tangle of lean greygreen limbs and bony protrusions and the rhythmic jet of almost black spurting gobbets of blood across the floor of dried pine cones and needles one of its legs still twitched and flexed a postmortem response liam looked up at becks she had a spatter pattern of blood across her pale face and chest and her normally expressionless cool grey eyes were wide and wild but that passed in an instant as artificial intelligence regained control of her face she regarded him calmly are you unharmed liam liam looked down at his bloody arm cut deep but nothing arterial going on there he was vaguely aware that he was in a state of shock as he said can i be put back on the titanic please chapter million years bc jungle liam and becks emerged at the top of the steep hill twenty minutes later a bald outcrop of rock with a view down all three sides to the tropical sea far below liam collapsed on to the rocky ground wwhere are they asked franklyn looking past liam towards the edge of the sloping jungle are they coming they are no longer pursuing answered becks my god youre wounded cried laura dropping down beside him and ripping a strip of cloth from his shirt to use as a bandage what the hell happened back there asked kelly undoing his loose tie and passing it to laura to use as a tourniquet he looked at franklyn still gasping from the exertion of climbing up the last half a mile of jungle hes just been jabbering to us something about a load of creatures jumping him liam nodded yeah he pulled a plastic bottle out of his backpack and chugged the last of his water he pumped air in and out of his lungs for a few moments gathering enough puff to be able to say something more yeah we got attacked all right lots of them dozens of em dozens of what asked whitmore a species of pack hunter said becks whitmore went pale oh god dont tell me there are raptors worse said franklyn much worse he sat down next to liam took off his glasses and wiped the fogged lenses of his spectacles one of the lenses was laced with a spiders web of cracks theyre not like anything weve ever seen he began carefully rubbing dry the fractured glass no ones ever come across fossils of this come across anything like this species whitmore squatted down opposite the boy tell me whats back down there what did you see franklyn shook his head i i really dont know theyre theyre humanlike and raptorlike he looked up at the teacher theyre unlike anything anything you know not a subspecies of therapod the boy shook his head vigorously no no definitely not maybe millions of years ago theres some kind of shared ancestry but these things theyre just theyre he was fumbling for words for some way to describe them unique said liam he winced as laura pulled the dressing tight one last time and finished a knot yes franklyn nodded putting his cracked glasses back on unique thats it they must be some kind of evolutionary dead end a form of superintelligent predator kelly stepped forward that doesnt make sense franklyn if theyre as you say superintelligent theyd have thrived wed have found their fossils everywhere surely how intelligent what level of intelligent are we talking about asked laura oh theyre smart said liam very smart he looked up at the others i think i saw them back on the big plain at the same time becks punched that dinosaur on the nose i looked back behind us just as that stampede was happening and i think i saw them like a whole pack of monkeys in fact thats what i thought i saw thats ridiculous said whitmore the only mammals alive now are the size of shrews theyre not mammals said franklyn theyre reptilian all right like i say continued liam i thought they were monkeylike but then i wasnt sure what i saw because they were gone in a flash just went to ground when they saw me looking at them theyve been following us all the way from our camp said franklyn did you see their tracks liam shook his head three prominent depressions at the end of a long foot liam recalled the sickle claws four on each hand three on each foot yes thats right those same tracks were around that carcass im sure of it that was their kill liam looked down the jungle slope at the broad curve of the long bay glimmering in the daylight and far off the broad expanse of the open plain beyond that lost beyond the shimmering air and the fogging of twenty miles distance would be the low hummock of a slope and a cliff edge and their jungle valley beyond they must have been watching us he said feeling his skin cool and the hairs on his arm stir watching us and following us ever since then but that was like over a week ago said juan nine days becks added juan made a face all that time theyve been studying us said liam learning about us so they have working out how much of a threat we are to them yes i think youre right franklyn pulled himself up and studied the fringe of jungle several dozen yards down the slope from them theyre curious that makes them intelligent maybe almost as intelligent as us a species of dinosaur as intelligent as us come on franklyn thats theyve got a language i heard them communicate liam nodded hes right when they were surrounding me and becks there was some sort of talking going on among them and one of them tried to communicate with me before you and robogirl arrived it was trying to speak like me this is just crazy said whitmore theres no record of any species or any similar species with the cranial capacity for a brain big enough to develop a spoken language or able to make humanlike vocal sounds but thats the thing mr whitmore just because no fossil of these things has survived doesnt mean they didnt exist the lads right said kelly dont palaeontologists say weve only got an incomplete record of prehistoric times that there are large gaps in our knowledge whitmore rubbed his beard and stared down at the fringe of jungle well then thats one huge goddamn gap out there isnt it they were quiet for a while all staring at the nearby canopy trees and the dark forbidding undergrowth beneath imagining eyes staring out from the gloom back at them what do we do now liam asked laura he pulled on his bottom lip in thought we carry on with the plan he turned away from the jungle hed emerged from minutes ago and looked down the slope on the other side of the peak below he could see the pale apron of a small sheltered sandy cove nestling at the bottom of the ridge and another equally high ridge on the far side like the protective embracing arms of a rocky giant he could see the twinkle of a small stream meandering down through thickets of bamboo and reeds and spilling out on to the cove it was an inviting secret bay of turquoisegreen water that lapped along the crescent of a pale creamcoloured beach in another time another place a secluded tropical paradise a picturebook pirates cove is it down there he asked becks the place we need to be affirmative that is it yes he said nodding his head firmly hoping he looked every bit the decisive leader we can be down there in less than half an hour well make a camp on the beach and be sure to have a huge fire going hopefully thatll keep those things at bay and well have half of us sleeping and half watching and well do that in shifts he looked at becks again well make this message so we will and tomorrow well plant it how are we going to do that asked kelly liam was about to answer that he wasnt sure yet when jasmine replied clay the others looked at her clay she said again if we could find some we can make a tablet you can write your message on it then we can bake it hard in the fire liam stroked his cheek thoughtfully right yes good idea thats what well do so any questions before we get moving what about them things back down there asked juan with another pointed glance towards the jungle well i suppose theyve learned something about us right the others looked at each other not quite sure what liam meant by that theyve learned we can kill them he gestured at becks and theyve learned our robogirl is not to be messed around with so they have becks frowned indignantly at that my ident is becks he shrugged too tired and winded to apologize right then i suggest we get going chapter new york the alarm clock on the table between them was showing pm maddy noticed sals eyes nervously glancing at it fifteen minutes to go im a bit scared whispered sal if maddy was being honest she would have admitted she was a little jittery too instead she smiled reached across the table and grasped sals arm its going to be fine sal i promise maybe i should go get fosters gun from the back you know just in case somebody unfriendly turns up really maddy cocked an eyebrow do you think thats going to be sensible we might be answering the door to a backstreet full of very excitable armed men in suits and dark glasses you think itll be like that maddy shrugged i really dont know whats going to happen sal if anything at all but she continued if a whole bunch of secret service types turn up were not going to achieve much standing there with one gun between us are we im sure theyll come prepared if you know what i mean i guess so muttered sal her head drooping down to the table a fold of her dark hair flopping over darker eyes how come youre so calm about this calm am i but then she realized she actually did feel calm no not calm resigned resigned to whatever history was rolling up through the aeons to meet them in a few minutes when the archways bubble reset shed figured this out yesterday while she was out there anxiously looking for foster there really was nothing much they could do other than wait and react to whatever turned up wait thats it wait until a ripple or a time wave arrived or as she hoped a message then and only then could they do anything at all useful im calm sal because i dunno because its not in our hands now because we have to just wait and see no point worrying about whats out of our hands that sounded lame but it was all she had right now but if its bad guys maddy if its bad guys who want to get their hands on the time machine what are we going to do we cant just let them ive got that covered how maddy smiled there was something shed managed to get right ive instructed bob to lock down the computer system if he hears me say a codeword out loud right sal nodded silent for a moment but but wont they have computer experts who could hack their way in and i dunno deactivate that command or something maybe eventually that kind of hacking takes a lot of time and they wont have enough time to do that why because hes under orders to trash absolutely everything if he doesnt hear from me again huh if he doesnt get a second password from me within six hours hes under instructions to go completely mad and wipe the hard drives clean and send a power surge through the displacement machinerys circuits and fry them therell be nothing left but frazzled silicon and garbagefilled drives if they try anything funny with us sal sal nodded regarding maddy with renewed respect oh jahulla thats clever maddy maddy shrugged i saw it in a film once it worked in that dont see why it shouldnt work for us youre a good planner said sal i know you think youre a bit rubbish and i know you blame yourself for the explosion but i dont know anyone else who could have picked up all that you have so quickly she glanced away from maddy selfconscious flicking her fringe behind one ear im just saying thats all youre pretty good at this thanks sal they watched another minute vanish on the clock well see soon enough if its bad guys out there and they really want to get their grubby paws on our tech then theyre going to need us arent they maddy took a deep breath feeling the tickling sensation of growing anxiety claw its way up her spine as the clock flickered to pm and theyre freakin well going to have to be real nice about it too chapter million years bc jungle broken claw cradled the organ in his hands still cold and lifeless now its colour had drained from a vibrant red to a dull purple as the sun slowly sank in the sky now the sky was dark a half moon bathing the dark jungle with a quicksilver light he stood where the new creatures had been just hours ago evidence of their presence was everywhere in the form of footprints in the soil droplets of dried blood on the rocks and boulders and the smell their unique smell of fear thick on every surface they had waited here for a while and they had been so very frightened the new creatures fear us and yet broken claw had been so certain up until now that it was his pack that needed to be afraid of them the others were looking at him waiting for him he looked down at the organ in his hand all that remained of his packmate the mother of many of the young males before him she would have led them all if broken claw was to die before her the wisdom of age was more than enough to make up for her smaller frame and no young buck would have challenged her unlike the other simpleminded animals in these lands with their crude pack hierarchies that relied on the brute strength of an alpha male broken claws extended family understood the power of wisdom but now she was dead her slim neck had been almost completely severed and shed had a wound through the chest cavity that would almost certainly have been fatal anyway they had returned to the ledge to find her body still warm but her life gone and so theyd consumed her torn the flesh from her bones in ragged strips skin muscle tissue organs all of her stripped down to bloodied bones none of her to be wasted she was loved too much to leave her flesh for smaller scavengers to gnaw at her heart was his though and his alone broken claw had cradled it now for hours unwilling to let go of the last thing of her but now was the time now as he stared down through the dark night to the cove far below and the flickering orange flower on the beach surrounded by those pale creatures his serrated teeth tore a chunk from the purple organ and he vowed as he chewed on the fibrous tissue that every last one of those new creatures would die he would be sure to stare closely into their eyes as his claws dug deep into their chests and pulled the pumping source of their life out the others began to wail and mew softly young males grieving at the loss of their mother as broken claw placed the rest of the organ in his mouth and bade farewell to his lifelong partner he turned to the others and silenced them with a soft bark we do not need to fear new creatures the others understood this too they are as planteaters harmless without their sticksthatcatch and they were careless foolish creatures that often placed these lethal tools on the ground and walked away from them unaware that without them their clawless hands and small even white teeth made them as vulnerable as freshly born cubs broken claw watched their distant movements on the beach illuminated by the yellow flower of course they all had to die to avenge her but also to be sure his kind were the only intelligent pack hunters in these lands to allow these pale things a chance to breed and increase their number would be foolish he opened his mouth and his black tongue curled and twisted as he softly tried to reproduce again the strange sound the short fat creature with ginger hair and those strange eyes had made broken claws throat gargled and whinnied and his tongue shaped the sound into something that sounded to his recollection to be a very passable facsimile aye ammmm fanck leeeennn chapter million years bc jungle the morning sun was already warm on his back and shoulders as liam poked at the smouldering remains of their campfire with his spear carefully probing the flaking ash remains of branches for what he was looking for do be careful said jasmine standing beside him theyre brittle when theyre still hot all right he said going about it more carefully presently the blunt end of thick bamboo cane hit something hard a dull thunk i got one he carefully pushed the ash out of the way and traced a rough rectangle outline something approximating the size of a brick it looks like it survived the cooking without cracking using a fistful of waxy fern leaves as an oven glove he reached down and pulled it out then quickly dropped it on the soft sand ouch still bleedin hot he squatted down beside it gingerly wiping ash away from the rustcoloured surface of firecooked clay the fine lines of letters and numbers were clogged with ash the others gathered round and stared down at the small oblong tablet lying on the beach my god look it totally worked uttered laura the lettering was there to see clear unmistakable of course it did replied jasmine i know what im talking about me and my mom make ceramic jewellery all the time we sell it on ebay liam leaned over and blew at it the ash fluttering out of the inscribed lines and curls of his handwriting in little clouds take this to archway wythe street brooklyn new york on monday september message key is magic whitmore was reading it over liams shoulder you think that book code of yours is going to work i mean i dont know what book youve used but i know every book has different editions you know that dont you and the page layouts and numbers change from edition to edition are you using some kind of internal agency manual or something becks answered it will work my duplicate ai is working from the same database magic said juan is that some kinda clue for which book it is liam nodded he looked at becks do you think bob will understand that clue she pursed her lips and shrugged yet another teenage gesture she seemed to have picked up in the last fortnight from the students i am unable to give you an accurate answer to that question liam well put it this way would you get it her eyelids flickered i have thirtyone thousand listings in my database against the word magic ah jayzus muttered liam frustrated maybe we should have put more thought into the clue there maybe that one word on its own isnt going to be enough for bob to saleena vikram will understand said becks she looked at liam as bob i discussed the book with her liam snorted youre kidding me you can actually discuss literature i told her i very much enjoyed the magic in harry potter whitmore stood up straight and put his hands on his hips this is a joke right youre not seriously telling me your supersecretultimatetimepolice agency uses a kids book as a code key liam and becks both looked up at him and nodded jesus whitmore shook his head what kind of a mickey mouse outfit are you mickey mouse liam waved at becks to be silent its what works mr whitmore he replied surprised with himself at how angry he sounded its what works thats what counts whitmore was a little taken aback by liams uncharacteristic outburst well its just it just seems so i dont know a bit amateur chimed in franklyn we were thinking you guys had some sort of alreadyorganized code system you know like proper secretagent types do yeah dont mean to be dissin you guys an all said juan but it does look like you makin this stuff up as you go along look said liam ill not lie to you im quite new to this timetravel thing myself and this is certainly the first time ive gone back to dinosaur times so i suppose if it looks to you like me and becks are not working from some from some sort of manual well youd be right he stood up brushing ash from his hands but ill tell you this much for nothing the agency has saved you many times over and the thing is each time it does that for you each time its saved history and the world around you well its happened and you all go on with your lives happily never knowing how close its all come to disaster liam pressed his lips together me and becks here have saved you once before he half smiled a certain hitler chap who won a war instead of losing it now that was a fine bleedin mess so it was but we managed to fix it up again so will you not give us some credit here were not completely useless all right what about your agency asked kelly who are they liam was about to answer when becks grabbed his arm to stop him lemme guess said kelly sarcastically classified data im sorry said liam thats how it is we return you to then the less you know about us the better but ill tell you this though theyre organized and theyve got the best technology out there computers and and robots like becks and oh loads of other stuff so look he smiled youre in good hands they looked at him with an unreadable mixture of expressions come on liam be decisive right then enough prattling like old fishwives we have a job to do so we have these tablets franklyn mr whitmore where exactly do you suggest we go and place them they both looked at each other an exchange of absentminded gestures franklyn pushing his cracked glasses up his nose whitmore scratching at his scruffy beard and a muttered exchange of ideas finally franklyn turned to them i suggest we embed a couple in the beach dig a hole deep as deep as you can and the rest he turned and nodded towards a nearby thicket of bamboos and reeds that freshwater stream theres silt banks and a bunch of marsh either side of it im pretty sure thats how they describe the fossil bed in dinosaur valley that it was once marshy liam looked at jasmine and these clay tablets will last sixtyfive million years she shook her head uh well no i never said theyd last that long franklyn shook his head you really dont know a great deal about fossils liam do you liam hunched his shoulders nope franklyn i dont but you do so why dont you tell me how this works then franklyn sighed theyll most likely break up long before there are even monkeys on planet earth let alone homo sapiens but the impression they leave behind like a cast or a mould on the sand on the silt which eventually will become a layer of sedimentary rock thats the fossil he offered liam a patient if somewhat patronizing smile not those tablets theyll be long gone dust liam nodded thoughtfully all right then so now i know strikes me that it makes no real difference theres still something left behind that a person can read right franklyn nodded good so best we get started the sooner were done the sooner we can leave he turned to address them all i dont know about you but come sundown id rather be camping out on that big very wide beach than down here with those things out there said whitmore looking up the jungle slopes surrounding them sure getting out of here sounds good to me chapter new york three minutes to go said sal three minutes maddy echoed they could both hear the machinery below the desk beginning to hum noisily as it sucked energy greedily from their mains feed not for the first time maddy wondered who paid the electricity bill for their archway it had to be astronomical the amount they used she smiled at her dumbness yes of course no one paid any bills as far as the world outside was concerned as far as their neighbour the car mechanic in the archway near the top of their little backstreet were concerned this archway normally sat vacant with a ripped and graffiticovered sign pasted on the roller shutter outside offering three thousand square feet of commercial floor space at a reasonable rate except of course for a monday and tuesday in september when to anybody who bothered to notice it would appear three young squatters had decided to move in only to vanish again on the wednesday oh said sal i forgot i saw a funny thing the other day yeah yeah in a shop nearby a junk shop well not funny really just a coincidence what a uniform a stewards uniform from the titanic just exactly like liams sal shook her head isnt that weird seriously the lady in the shop said it wasnt a real one though just a costume from a play but still kind of funny i suppose i could buy it for liam as a spare im sure hes in no big hurry to go back to the titanic you know given what hed have to face sals smile quickly faded no she said i suppose he wouldnt none of us really the numbers on the clock flickered and changed two minutes left maddy really could have done with foster sitting right here beside them calm relaxed with a reassuring halfcocked smile on his old wrinkly face skin that looked like weathered parchment skin that looked like it had seen way too much sun i wouldnt mind feeling the sun on my face fosters last words hed said that the morning hed taken her out for coffee to say goodbye sun on my face she uttered under her breath sal cocked an eyebrow uh i guess i wouldnt mind feeling the sun on my face whilst i enjoy a decent hot dog thats exactly what hed said wasnt it one of the last things hed said thats what he fancied doing with whatever time he had left to live sun and a decent hot dog with all these skyscrapers she knew there was only one place you could count on unobscured sunlight in manhattan sun and yes hot dog vendors aplenty one place and one place only i think i just figured out where fosters gone she uttered they watched the clocks red leds flicker to show them pm where maddy stood up and pushed the chair back from the breakfast table with a scrape that echoed across the archway ill uh ill explain another time were about to have guests sal stood up and joined her in the middle of the floor both facing the shutter door and counting down the last sixty seconds as behind them the deep hum of machinery began to build to a final fizzing crescendo the strip light above them began to flicker and dim well here goes nothing said maddy reaching out instinctively to hold sals hand chapter million years bc jungle do you think its deep enough asked liam becks squatted down beside the waistdeep hole in the mud and studied the oozing sides slowly sliding downwards and the bottom already beginning to fill up around liams ankles with cloudy water i do not know she said dont know is it great he wiped at his sweating brow smearing mud across his forehead well who knows how deep is deep enough may i have the tablet she passed it down to him he turned the brick of clay over in his hands and studied the inscribed letters and numbers so my little silent messenger you go get us some help all right he bent down and placed the brick writingside down in the cloudy water and gently pressed it deep into the mud were counting on you mr tablet counting on you to do your very best for us last as long as you can all right and like my auntie loretta used to say you be sure to make a good impression he looked up at becks with a grin plastered on his face amid the mud uh make a good impression see what i did there she stared down at him grey eyes coolly analytical a pun she replied a single word with multiple meanings dependent on contextual framing aye a pun you know its meant to be funny she frowned for a moment and then her face suddenly creased with an insincere mirth and she bellowed a mock laugh he cringed at the sound of it jayzus becks if its not funny just dont laugh im serious its embarrassing she stopped immediately affirmative liam pulled himself out of the hole as the wet sides of it began to slop down into the bottom he and becks scooped up handfuls of mud and silt and helped the selffilling process until all that was left was a barely noticeable mound on the streams bank liam produced a length of bamboo and plunged it into the top and tore a ragged strip of neon green material from the bottom of his shorts he tied it to the bamboo stalk and thats so well find it easy enough when we come back for it becks nodded a part of the plan shed insisted was necessary to return to this timestamp once everything else had been put right and retrieve every single one of the five tablets that were being put into the ground liam looked downstream the small trickling artery of fresh water twisted and curled out of sight beyond a thicket of reeds i wonder how the others are doing kelly stood up straight and placed his hands on his tired back their two tablets were now dug deep into the fine sand of the beach at either side of the small cove both marked with bamboo flags and strips of material ripped from the sleeve of his office shirt done he smiled at the others there was a muted cheer from juan laura jasmine and even akira a girl as shy as edward selfconscious about her thick accent and faltering english he looked up the beach towards the line of reed thickets and clusters of bamboo and the small delta of fresh water and silt that spread out and trickled down a fan of flowworn grooves in the beach down into the warm salty sea the others should be done pretty soon he said then we can head back lauras gaze drifted to the steep peak of jungle they were going to have to ascend i wonder if those things are out there still juan looked up we got our weapons and we got robogirl were going to be all right maybe were safer now than we were said kelly one of them was killed trying to attack us so maybe theyre more wary of us now laura tightened the grip on her spear yeah i guess youre right franklyn finished piling a small cairn of stones around the base of the bamboo stake in the ground and looked up whitmore was leading the other two edward and his seemingly adopted big brother leonard a hundred yards down towards another hump of silty bank theyd identified earlier as a good place for their second tablet you coming franklyn the teacher called out just a sec he replied the bamboo stake kept flopping over to one side and the rocks were very nearly but not quite holding it up ill join you in a second he called back reaching for another large riversmoothed stone he heard it then a soft muted cry like the whimpering of a small child he froze listening for it over the stirring hiss of the reeds and the chuckle of the stream and there it was again a little louder a little clearer it sounded like someone in pain hello he replied whos that one of the girls perhaps maybe slipped on a wet rock and broken something jasmine laura the cry again pitiful wretched and insistent it seemed to be coming from the reeds akira is that you he stepped towards them and fancied he saw someone shifting on the ground at the base of the reeds he pushed his way in what have you slipped hurt your the form slithered back from him through the reeds and out of sight moving in a fast too fast for human way it was then his peripheral vision picked out eyes watching him intently from among the reeds to his right it shifted forward silently revealing itself a mere couple of yards from him distinct yellow forwardfacing eyes at the front of an elongated tapering skull that sloped back over hunched bony shoulders and a hunched spine the curious shape of its skull vaguely reminded him of the aerodynamic helmets worn by speed cyclists or downhill skiers at the winter olympics only much longer like the aliens in those dvds his older brother kept watching over and over it scrutinized him perfectly still perfectly poised and then its scalpelsharp teeth parted and he saw its black tongue coiling and unfurling like a snake aye ammm fanck leeennnnn it hissed softly my god this creature he realized now the very same reptilian hominid he had faced back up the hillside in the jungle yesterday had remembered his name had remembered their fleeting moment of communication the exchange of a spoken word something that wasnt going to happen again on this world for tens of millions of years whats more this thing had actually the voicebox and the oral dexterity to reproduce a human word yes he whispered excitedly yes thats me he gestured to himself my name is franklyn its long tapered head tilted to one side and silently it glided a step forward out of the reeds towards him in his rucksack nestled at the bottom beneath the last couple of parcels of grilled fish meat wrapped in waxy leaves was his phone still with some charge left on it enough he hoped just enough to take a few photographs and maybe a short recording of this thing actually speaking he eased the rucksack off his shoulders im just going to get something he said softly soothingly moving slowly ok the creature remained perfectly still yellow eyes curiously watching his every move he unzipped the bag and reached inside the rank smell of fish spilling out the skin flaps around the hominids nasal cavity began to twitch he can smell the food change of plan franklyn grasped one of the packages pulled it out and unwrapped it here you are look food he held the small hunk of barbecued flesh out in one hand towards the creature further off he could hear the voices of whitmore and the others echoing back over the reeds less than a hundred yards away he was torn between hoping theyd turn up and scare the thing away and hoping they didnt he could call out to them but then what might that trigger an attack or perhaps it would vanish for good never to be encountered again he realized that would be a tragedy because this thing this species like every other species of dinosaur just wasnt going to make it the world of dinosaurs hadnt much time left in geological terms a thousand ten thousand years maybe tomorrow it was going to happen a mass extinction event either an asteroid or a megavolcano was going to choke the world and kill every landbased species larger than a dog and this intelligent species so close in many ways to human closer in some than mans own ape ancestor was going to vanish along with all the other dumb dinosaurs they were going to vanish without leaving a trace would never be known about never leave any fossil markings never have a latin name or be exhibited in a museum or discussed by palaeontologists and that was the cruellest irony because here was something that given just a few more million years could have been us the dominant intelligence a reptilian version of homo sapiens my god you youre incredible he whispered the creature was now just a couple of yards from him yellow eyes on the hunk of meat crouching low its ribandspinelined back looked so human like the back of some sizezero catwalk supermodel or some lean gymnast fankk leeeen it uttered again franklyn realized he had to take a picture the species deserved some evidence at least one shred of visual evidence that it had once upon a time existed he gently placed the meat on the ground in front of him then delved back into his rucksack for his mobile phone the creature advanced another foot and then strained its long neck and curiously elongated head to sniff the meat one slender arm swept forward and a hand with three lethallooking sickleshaped claws tapped it rolled it over then casually pushed it aside its head cocked its nostril flaps puckered and then franklyn realized the creature wasnt the slightest bit interested in the stale odour of the mudfish it was smelling him reading his odours like a witchdoctor reading bones like a medium reading the creased palm of a hand ii mean no harm i just franklyn stuttered nervously its jaw snapped open and the tongue inside twisted and curled no harmmm it mimicked yyes friend ffriend said franklyn tapping his chest it was now so close he could have reached out and stroked the bonehard carapace of the front of its skull he could feel warm fetid puffs of air coming from its nasal cavity franklyn had the mobile phone in his hand now his eyes still on this things reptile eyes he fumbled with the touchscreen menu and finally got it into digicam mode and pressed the record button a species he said softly panning the cells camera up and down the beast ppossibly a remote ancestor of the vvelociraptor or more likely the smarter troodon he hated that his voice was shaking like some nervous girls if this was going to be a few seconds of footage that was going to make him famous he wanted to sound like a pro like a true hardcore adventurer not some kneetrembling geek this species is qquite incredible capable of copying a human vvoice the hominids mouth suddenly snapped shut with a loud clack of teeth and then the cluster of reeds began to rustle with movement all around him franklyn looked up oh god nno chapter million years bc jungle liam heard it a brittle scream long and ragged and then suddenly silenced did you hear that becks nodded affirmative she straightened up the hominid pack hunters may have returned we should rejoin the others immediately liam grabbed his spear come on they splashed across the shallow stream kicking up fans of water and then along the bank on the far side no more than two hundred yards closer to the beach thats where whitmore and the others had been left to place their tablets that seemed to be where the scream had come from liam couldnt tell if that one long cry had been a male or female voice but it had rattled with horror and ended in a way that hadnt sounded good they splashed back across the water again to avoid another thicket of reeds as the stream weaved around a smooth boulder the size of an automobile a minute later up ahead he could make out the others gathered in a group standing closely together and studying something on the ground what happened he called out none of them replied they looked up at him with faces as pale as bed linen kelly and his group had heard the cry too and had come up from the beach they must have arrived there only a minute or so earlier what happened he called out again as he and becks splashed across the stream one last time and finally joined them on the silty bank then he saw it for himself blood blood everywhere and a few tattered shreds of clothing that he recognized as belonging to franklyn but no sign of the boy himself oh no he uttered blessing himself absentmindedly that isnt really whitmore nodded franklyns he was we were just down there he uttered pointing downstream just there just bbeyond those reeds didnt hear anything said howard or see anything just heard him scream we came up here and he was gone just gone it was kelly who decided to say first what they were all thinking those things its those things isnt it theyve damn well come after us we dont know that for sure said liam there are other predators oh we know said laura she passed liam a mobile phone dappled with droplets of congealing blood on the small screen a shaky lowresolution image looped over and over nothing but the bright pale blue sky and then the jerky image of something stepping over just the once but that was all he needed to recognize it lean almost skeletal and that long tapering skull the image was pale sky again occasionally shuddering as the camera was knocked and through the small speaker the sound of growling snapping teeth and the frenzied noise of something being torn to pieces liam swallowed his mouth and throat suddenly dry he felt his face drain of blood and blanch just like theirs now pale as a ghost were leaving he said quietly leaving right now uh i left my bag at the beach said juan forget the bloody bag snapped liam he glanced at becks ready to bark at her to be quiet should she decide to caution him about potential contamination but she seemed to understand instead she pointed out which way they needed to go up the steep slope thick jungle i will lead the way she said recommendation you should all remain close oh dont you worry about that uttered liam under his breath he pulled one of their homemade hatchets out of his bag and hefted his spear in his other hand everyone ready the others nodded all of them with a weapon of one sort or another in their hands none of them keen to step back into the thick canopy of leaves and vines and dense clusters of fern leaves that could quite easily conceal death but even less keen to remain here a moment longer so what about franklyn asked chan in a small voice no one seemed to want to answer that question the boy looked up at howard were not looking for him leonard howard answered hes gone edward hes gone becks nodded correct information approximate calculation at least five pints of blood on the ground franklyn cannot be alive come on said liam resting a hand on edwards shoulder he looked up at the sloping jungle ahead of them we should go chapter clay tablets five of them buried deep in mud and sand silently count the passing of years above as they slumber in their own dark tombs tides rise and fall and individual layers of mud dotted with the decaying bones of generations of creatures accumulate like the rings of a growing tree two hundred and seventysix thousand nine hundred and two years after a group of homo sapiens placed them in the ground the planet earth shudders under the impact of a rock the size of manhattan travelling at forty thousand miles an hour a wave of incinerating energy spirals hundreds of miles out and tidal waves engulf millions of miles of lowlands across the world the sky turns dark for the best part of a decade a tenyear night in which almost all of life on land vanishes except hardy small rodents from which those very same homo sapiens will one day descend the giants of the plains die off quickly first the planteaters then the predators a holocaust followed by a nuclear winter massive extinction on an unimaginable scale yet through this five tablets lie still and dark and oblivious in the aftermath of the asteroid impact the palaeogene period begins a vast stretch of time forty million years in which mountain ranges are born live and die a period in which a vast inland sea riding up a backbone of hills that will one day be called the rockies recedes surrendering ground that has only ever known the darkness of a seabed ground that will one day have names like utah colorado wyoming new mexico the dinosaurs are long gone now nothing more than fossils waiting silently like the tablets for the constant attrition of erosion the movements of ground to finally push them near the surface and sunlight again above in the world of daylight a brandnew ecosystem exists a world utterly rewritten it is a cooler one than the tropical world of the dinosaurs and the small hardy rodents have grown evolved diversified and cover the land with a million different mammal species many of which a traveller from the present might even begin to recognize near the end of this era one of the five tablets now no more than an impression on the surface of a stratum of sandstone is lost forever when a minor earthquake fractures and grinds the strata to loose gravel the subtle etchings of words and numbers imprinted from the longgone clay tablet erased four companions however live on still separated after so many millions of years by the same distance that existed between them the day they were buried mere hundreds of yards apart around twenty million years pass and the palaeogene period becomes the neogene the world grows cooler and for the first time for a long time icecaps begin to form at the polar north and south species of grass colonize the land in a way that prehistoric ferns could only dream of and small fourlegged mammals that will one day look very different and be known as buffaloes graze blissfully upon it around seven million years ago the hardrimmed hoof of one of these small grazing creatures catches the tip of a broken slab of sandstone and pulls it out of the ground it lies there in the darkness of night moonlight picking out strange and subtle patterns of raised markings on one side but the roaring of a night predator spooks the herd as one they surge away from the sound and the night is filled with the rumble of thousands of hooves on hardbaked soil by dawn the curious slab of sedimentary rock is no more than dust and fragments destroyed by thousands of trampling beasts three silent witnesses remain as endless aeons pass in darkness like the soft ticking of an impatient clock above ground one species of rodent that took to the trees during the early palaeogene has finally ventured down to the ground once more to forage for food as the neogene era begins it is larger with a more muscular frame and a head larger in proportion to its treeclimbing ancestors its a species that will one day in another more million years be known as ape in bc early one morning as warm sun spills across a plain a young indian brave carefully scouting the grazing buffalo ahead runs his hand over the coarse grass and dislodges the sharp corner of a stone a chunk of flint emerges from the orange soil a flint he notices with curious markings on it for a moment the markings incite his curiosity they look deliberate but then his mind moves on to the size of the flint itself he can see how three separate tamahaken blades could be struck from it and he thanks great father sun for the find now only two silent messengers remain in a young confederate lieutenant on the run from union forces leading a ragtag band of soldiers unwilling to accept that the civil war is over rests his aching back against a rock with tired eyes too old for such a young face he watches the languid river in front of him as his fingers twist through coarse grass and yes they find the sharp edge of a stone before the war he was a student of history and the faint lines of writing on the stone fascinate him he puts the curious piece of rock in his saddlebag and resolves to take it to a professor of natural history he once knew in charleston when he eventually can but later that same day the union cavalry regiment finally catches up with the lieutenant and his men and before the sun has set they soldiers and officer lie in a shared unmarked grave not far away from the paluxy river and so just one last tablet remains chapter may somervell county texas grady adams watched his brother goofing about in the water below with growing irritation watch it saul you gonna scare off all the fish his brother ignored him and surface dived into the sedate paluxy river grady ground his teeth his younger brother could be a complete ass at times no strike that all the time he settled back on his haunches his toes curled over the lip of tancoloured rock overhanging the river the stone was hot against the bare skin of his feet eggfrying hot thats what pa would say the sun had been beating down on it all morning and the pool of water that had dripped off him from his last swim in the river half an hour ago had long since evaporated he looked up at a nearly cloudless sky and realized there wasnt going to be any momentary respite from the heat of the sun to his left several dozen yards along the ledge of rock a small withered cypress tree was clinging to the side of a large craggy boulder he could see it was casting a small pool of shadow at least big enough for a part of him to keep out of the sun he stood grabbed his fishing rod and walked carefully along the narrow ledge carefully because from time to time right near the edge bits of the sandstone rock broke away and splashed into the river a yard or so below that had happened to grady before scratching up his hips and chest as hed slid into the water saul came up again noisily splashing the surface of the river no doubt scaring any remaining fish well away from the float bobbing nearby saul for crying out loud his brother gave him a toothy grin and paddled across to the far bank deliberately kicking his feet on the surface and making as much of a ruckus as he could grady hunkered down in the shadow his back now against cool rock and to his right a dried earthy wall of orange soil and gnarled roots from the small tree poking out from it he prodded at the loose layers of soil light and dark like the layers of some fancy sponge cake hed once found a paiute tamahaken blade among a bank of earth like this those layers folded away such fascinating things along this river he remembered there was that team of men last summer digging around along portions of the riverbank looking for monster footprints in the rock dinosaur tracks thats what theyd said they were looking for grady and saul had seen a few in their time along here big ones like hed imagined an elephant might leave and small ones too three deeper dents and a shallow one saul even claimed hed once seen a human footprint in the rock just exactly like a shoe silly ass was always coming up with doofus nonsense like that grady knew no cavemen wore shoes back then in dinosaur times the people up in glen rose had started calling this place dinosaur valley on account of the men and women from the museums and stuff who came digging for fossils last year he smiled at that as he tugged at one of the twisted roots it sounded kind of cool dinosaur valley he could imagine some of the gigantic beasts hed seen in picture books striding across their paluxy river walking up and down the riverbanks their long necks craning down to drink from the river grit and dry soil tumbled down on to his arm ouch he let go of the root and it sprang up releasing another small avalanche of loose claylike earth and then he saw it half hanging out and resting on a coil of tree root that looked like a pigs tail a palmsized slate of shale he reached up for it and it fell heavily into his hands for a moment as he stared down at the almost triangular shape he wondered whether it might just be another one of them tamahaken heads but it didnt have the telltale signs of being worked on shaped by some skilled hand it was just a plain ol slice of rock he held it in his throwing hand wondering how many bounces hed get from skimming it across the river it was nice and flat a good spin on the throw and maybe hed count seven perhaps eight before it settled and sank he stood up saw saul on the far bank sunning himself on a dry boulder hey saul his brothers head bobbed up what i got me a skimmer reckon i get an eight with it nah he called back cos you throw like a girl an all grady shook his head and sighed his brother really could be annoying well why dontcha just look and learn you foobat he cupped it in his palm wondering which side was flatter and then turned it over chapter new york on sunday september lester cartwright a small narrowshouldered man facing his last five desk years before his longawaited retirement went to bed with his plump wife a man who if you asked him to be honest would admit to being a little bored with his unchallenging life his job yes it might sound interesting if he was allowed to talk about it was as a projects budget assessor for a lowprofile us intelligence agency but in actual fact despite the intriguing sound of working for a secret service the work simply involved crunching numbers and balancing costs and expenditures he might as well have been doing that for walmart or mcdonalds or some carpet store the job would have been exactly the same not exactly where hed hoped to end his career when hed first joined them back in the s a young man ready to serve his country in the field a young man ready to kill or be killed for uncle sam now he was an old man who rubberstamped expense forms that night he went to bed after walking their dog charlie climbed into his pyjamas and picked up a tom clancy spy novel hoping to enjoy at least a few aimless thrills today before turning the light out on his bedside table later as he slept change arrived in the form of a subtle ripple of reality a wave of reality systematically rewriting itself a wave of change that had started in with a young boys discovery of a strange rock beside a river in texas a boy who turned over a rock and saw something curious lesters boring life in that moment of darkness was replaced in just the blink of an eye with a far far more interesting one sir sir knuckles rapped gently against the cars rear passenger window lester cartwright stirred his mind had been off again considering the incredible the impossible only it isnt impossible is it lester he looked out of the window at agent forby dark glasses a suit crewcut hair and a face that looked like it had never told a joke while on duty lester wound his window down an inch yes sir its time said forby lester looked down at his watch three minutes to midnight dammit he must have been napping again getting too old for something like this forby the areas completely secure forby nodded we have a twoblock cordon set up police and state guard are manning those the williamsburg bridge has been closed and all civilians have been evacuated from the perimeter cartwright nodded the cover story had been an easy nobrainer to come up with a bomb threat american civilians seemed to react very well to that so were certain we have just agency personnel within forby nodded a hundred per cent sir just us guys cartwright looked out of the window past forbys hunched form the williamsburg bridge towered over them the nearby intersection was deserted and there fifty yards away was the entrance to the small backstreet running alongside the bridges brick support arches my god finally this is it this is finally it he felt his chest tickled by butterfly wings and the short hairs on the back of his neck rise very well he opened the car door and stepped out into the warm evening then lets begin cartwright led the way across the quiet road lit by several fizzing street lights and the intermittent sweep of a floodlight from a helicopter holding position high up in the sky apart from the faroff whupwhupwhup of its rotors this threeblockwide area of brooklyn was ghostly quiet there was a barricade across the entrance to the backstreet manned by more of cartwrights men no soldiers or police this close to the target on cartwrights insistence only personnel he trusted within the perimeter only personnel hed recruited himself into this small covert agency an agency he and his men referred to as the club he nodded at them as they raised their guns and let him through he looked down the narrow cobbled street littered with garbage an abandoned skip halfway along good grief i feel like a kid all of his professional life had been leading up to this one moment ever since hed been quietly headhunted from the fbi to come and work for the club forty years of knowing lester cartwright began to make his way down the row of archways past the first one clearly being used by some oneman autorepair business when hed first joined his superior had been prepared to reveal only some of the facts an incredible find in a place called glen rose texas a find that had major national security implications that was all he got for quite a few years but time passed and lester gradually climbed several ranks finally becoming the senior serving officer in the club his departing boss had handed him the complete dossier on his very last day handed it to him with eyes that looked like theyd been staring far too long into an abyss do me a favour lester hed said sit yourself down and drink a finger of bourbon before you open this file all right sir youre about to join a very very small group those that know and it was a small group presidents had been briefed roosevelt when the news of the artefact had first been unearthed then truman then eisenhower but theyd stopped briefing presidents when that silly fool kennedy had threatened to go public on it that was the year after lester had joined the club the year of the dallas incident a very messy business but the club had a responsibility they hadnt bothered to tell presidents since then cartwright passed the third and fourth archways both openfronted and unoccupied he could see needles and bottles back there in the darkness his men had checked in there for vagrants and unearthed only one grubby stinking and utterly bewildered alcoholic he could feel his heart pounding in his chest as his feet slowly brought him up outside the metal rollershutter door of the fifth archway forty years hed known of a thing called the glen rose artefact but only for the last fifteen years had he known exactly what it was figuratively speaking a message in a bottle with a date on it a bottle that couldnt be opened until a certain date he looked down at his watch and saw that that certain date was a mere forty seconds away there hadnt been a single solitary night during the last fifteen years that he hadnt lain in bed and wondered what theyd find inside this address hed been down this street on a number of occasions and looked at that corrugated metal hed even been inside and looked around on several occasions empty unused but now finally there were occupants inside occupants from his heart fluttered and his breath caught as he considered the phrase another time cartwright instinctively reached into his suit jacket for the serviceissue firearm he kept there as he looked at his watch and realized that after forty years of waiting and preparing he was finally down to counting off the last ten seconds so this is it he uttered the second hand of his watch ticked past midnight and all of a sudden he thought he felt the slightest puff of displaced air against his face he leaned forward balled his fist and knuckled the shutter door gently chapter new york maddy looked at sal oh my god you hear that that was a knock wasnt it she hadnt fully expected to be right that come the stroke of midnight and the reset there would actually for real be a knock on their door the roller shutter rattled again and they heard the muffled sound of a mans voice outside so were going to open it right whispered sal i uh yes i guess weve got no choice she stepped forward towards the button at the side and pressed it with a rattling whirr of a winch motor begging for oil the shutter slowly rose both girls looked down at the ground at the gradually widening gap and the soft glow of the street lamp outside creeping across their stained and pitted concrete floor two shoes two darksuited legs finally the person outside ducked down slightly to look in and his wide eyes met theirs hello there said maddy raising a limp hand we were kind of expecting you the shutter rattled to a stop and the man stared at them for a long while in silence i he started his voice croaky with nerves you but youre just kids he narrowed his eyes looking past them at the dim interior are there any others here just us im afraid said maddy he looked at her his old creased face seemed to be struggling to cope with the moment are you two are you ffrom the future he asked sal looked at maddy and she finally nodded her head youve got a million questions you want to ask us im sure maddy addressed the old man and were prepared to answer some of them but you have something right something for us he eyed her cautiously perhaps a message he ignored the question are you time travellers i wont answer anything until you answer me do you have a message for us he took a step forward squinting at the machinery on the far side of the arch he nodded towards it is that some sort of time machine she bit her lip im not saying anything until you answer me it is isnt it he smiled my god this is incredible please called out sal something brought you to us its a message from our friend isnt it the old man turned away from them and barked an order down along their backstreet a moment later maddy could hear the slap of boots on cobblestones she retreated from the entrance and into the arch taking several steps towards the computer desk im sorry said the old man he reached into his suit jacket and pulled a handgun on them please remain perfectly still do not touch anything do not do anything half a dozen men emerged from the backstreet all of them wearing biohazard suits faces hidden behind tinted fascias of plastic all of them armed with what looked like television remote controls oh no maddy felt lightheaded this isnt good were going to talk said the old man gently but were going to talk safely away from this place please he said beckoning for them both to come forward out of the archway and into the street step forward away from the equipment now you have to do it now maddy spun to face the computer desk bob omelette she screamed desperately hoping the desk mic across the archway had managed to pick up her voice the last thing her conscious mind registered was every muscle in her body contracting with a sudden jolt and then keeling over on to the hard floor her forehead smacking heavily against the concrete cartwright watched in silence as the older of the two girls was wheeled away on a hospital gurney and the other one younger asian or indian by the look of her was escorted down the backstreet towards the containment van he ordered the remaining three agency men in containment suits to stand guard outside the shutter door once theyd made a sweep and reported that the archway was clear good men trusted men but still better they knew as little as possible he stood alone now in front of a giant perspex cylinder of water metal steps up the side and what looked like a toddlers swing seat fixed at the top obviously something to do with time travel like the bank of computer equipment the other tall thin perspex tubes in the back room the power generator all these things clearly played some part in the process he wandered back to the long table a pair of scuffed office desks pushed end to end and cluttered with monitors a keyboard a dozen crumpled cans of dr pepper and a few empty pizza boxes he could hear the soft whirr of activity from beneath the desk and ducked down to see the muted glow of blinking green and red leds it looked like there were a dozen or more pcs the kind you could pick up from any walmart or pc world linked together into a network beside the desk was a battered old office filing cabinet he pulled out one drawer after another each filled with nests of tangled cables and bits and pieces of electronic circuits like somebody had ripped off a radioshack store for bits and not yet figured out what to do with it all he felt a small stab of disappointment in his minds eye hed imagined this moment hed conjured up visions of some futuristic arrangement technology from centuries ahead something that looked like the bridge of the uss enterprise set up in this old brick archway instead everything he could see here seemed to have been obtained from the present he sat down in one of the office chairs and it squeaked under his weight the answers to this place why they were here in new york why they were also in the cretaceous past how all this machinery worked and what it could do all of those answers he presumed were on these quietly humming computers he picked up the mouse and slid it across the desk one of the screens flickered out of screensaver mode and lit up to reveal a relaxing desktop image of an alpine valley and right in the middle of the screen a small square dialogue box system lockdown enabled cartwright cursed under his breath the older girl the one with the frizzy reddish hair had barked something out just before hed tasered her hed thought she was calling out to someone else in the arch but he realized now that it must have been a voiceactivated command he tried to remember what shed said oh yeah omelette he said into the desk mic incorrect activation code dammit incorrect activation code he tried a dozen other candidate words and phrases egg broken eggs scrambled eggs boiled eggs easter egg fried egg egg hunt egghead eggnog all of them produced the response on the screen absently he tapped his fingers on the desk if he was being honest this wasnt how he imagined the moment of discovery was going to be two scruffy kids a computer system that looked like some bedroom hackers dream setup and that big plastic cylinder making this place look like some kind of homemade brewery and this lockeddown computer system was obviously not going to tell him anything he decided it was time he had a little chat with the girls he stepped out towards the open door and punched the green button on the side the metal shutter started to clank and rattle slowly down no one goes in or comes out you have permission to shoot to kill anyone who tries understood the three men guarding the entrance nodded chapter million years bc jungle the wideopen plain was alive with the echoing calls of nocturnal life liam had assigned half of them to remain on watch and the other half to try their best to get some sleep although he doubted anyone was managing that a fire was burning in the middle not for the meagre light it provided but for the effect it seemed to have on the creatures roaming around out there keeping them all well away it was bright enough anyway the full moon seemed to illuminate the night enough that it felt little darker than an overcast winters afternoon in cork that moon is actually bigger right or am i going mad becks looked up at it affirmative it is approximately twenty per cent larger liams eyebrows shot up a larger moon so what do you think happened to it did it sort of wear down over time or something whitmore looked at him oddly and tutted and becks he wondered whether shed just rolled her eyes at him or whether that was just a trick of the light negative liam it has not changed size its just a little closer said whitmore oh becks resumed her silent vigil slowly panning her eyes across the plain watching for the dark furtive shapes of the creatures moving beyond the dancing circle of their firelight what do you think of those things asked liam are they really a species of supersmart dinosaur that lad franklyn he paused for a moment realizing the ensuing panicstricken retreat from the cove over the jungle peak and down on to the beach hadnt permitted him a single moment of reflection for the poor boy he could only imagine what those creatures had done to him if that carcass from nearly a fortnight ago was anything to go by the others were waiting for him to finish what hed started saying franklyn said all dinosaurs even the smart ones were pretty stupid whitmore sucked in a breath of warm night air those hominids could well be a deadend evolution a branchoff species that maybe shares a common ancestor with troodon troodon he nodded palaeontologists commonly agree that the troodon was quite possibly the most intelligent species of dinosaur smarter even than their evolutionary cousins the raptors very similar in appearance both therapods saurischian dinosaurs whats that mean bipedal they walk on their hind legs like the trex does liam shook his head those creatures didnt look anything like any dinosaur ive seen big or small i mean their heads whitmore nodded like i say some deadend evolution perhaps if the kt event never happened the asteroid or volcano or whatever it was many more subspecies with similar long skulls might have evolved from them perhaps thats why theyre so smart a greater cranial capacity a larger brain the species exhibits high levels of intelligence said becks her neutral voice seemed to have adopted an ominous tone they appear capable of tactical planning they appear to have a language they do not however appear to have developed tooluse why not if theyre so smart why dont they use spears and bows and arrows becks had no answer whitmore shrugged who knows perhaps theyve never needed to use tools maybe nature already made them so lethal theyve never needed tools or perhaps because they only seem to have four digits and no thumbs toolusing is just something theyre unlikely to ever do but theyre smart enough asked liam is that what youre saying if they had thumbs an all theyd be smart enough to make a spear or a bow or something whitmore scratched his beard absently who knows on the far side of the campfire howard and edward stood watch the robogirl had been standing with them for a while and then gone to rejoin her irish friend and whitmore howard decided now was quite possibly the best time he was going to have to say what he needed to say edward the small boy looked up at him thank you you know for saving me from that shark thing yesterday edward shrugged like hed done nothing more than buy him a coke ok leonard no seriously edward that was something what you did it could just as easily have gotten you but you you stayed right by me you saved my life edward smiled sure lenny youre my best friend he sighed well my only friend like i said i dont do so good back home you know making friends and stuff howard felt a sour twist of guilt churn away in his guts hed come to kill edward thats how hed ended up here and yet this boy seemed like a tenyearsyounger version of himself hed had things the same way when hed been at school lonely because he dared to be different it never changed did it not even in his time the s kids always found a way to single somebody out edward ive got to tell you something he said before he could stop himself what im im not who you think i am edward frowned and smiled at the same time bemused youre lenny no replied howard thats just it im not im not leonard baumgardner im not seventeen he lowered his voice and his eyes flickered across the campfire towards the other three people on guard duty and im not from the year what serious edwards eyes widened youre one of them an agent from the future too howard shook his head not an agent i dont work for the same people i belong to another group a group trying to stop time travel but but in a different way edward stared at him silently not lenny so what is your name howard he heard edward mouth the name quietly but listen edward i i managed to go back in time to find you he hesitated toying with how best to continue when edward spoke the words for him to get to me thats it isnt it howard looked away to stop me going to university stop me doing a degree howard couldnt bear to meet his eyes not to oh no edwards voice dropped hed figured it out no dont say you came to kill me howard nodded im sorry edward but yeah to shortcircuit history to cut out a chunk of the past that should never have happened in the dark he couldnt see how the boy was taking it just the outline of his round head and narrow shoulders gazing out at the dark plain that means youre not really my friend then howard felt that twist of guilt curl and flex like some restless eel making a nest in his belly that mean youre still going to kill me howard shook his head no not any more why because i dont need to were stuck here now edward turned back towards him but were gonna get rescued those messages that we no ones going to find them he replied shaking his head how do you know if theyd ever been found he nodded towards the others and liam and robogirls people were able to come and rescue us then theyd know what happens in wouldnt they theyd know about me and theyd make sure you were never on that field trip to the teri labs theyd make sure you were kept as far away from that assassination attempt as possible edwards face clouded with thought for a moment howard offered him a smile that was probably lost in the dark anyway so ive done what had to be done im truly sorry its landed us here i really am but the world after is a much safer place without you theres no you theres no maths thesis no waldstein and no time machines for good or bad i know the worlds heading for dark times ahead certainly it is where when i came from floods droughts billions starving oil running out wars but the world will get through that eventually it can survive that but it cant survive time travel no weve been messing around with stuff we cant understand cant control were like children playing catch and toss with a neutron bomb but thats finished edward its not going to happen im relieved but im also sorry its landed you and the others here why be sorry said edward flatly mission successful you did it im sorry because i think well i hope you and i have become friends and ive put you in this situation howard could understand if the boy walked away right now and told everything hed just heard to the others then of course theyd confront him and perhaps even exact a brutal revenge on him howard could understand that and was ready to face the music instead he felt edwards small hand on his forearm its ok im not angry with you he laughed you have every right to be no point said edward were stuck here forever then so weve got to work together right leonard leonard it sounded like edward was going to keep this confession to himself howard nodded so so im not telling youre leonard still he smiled ok im leonard right right chapter new york maddys mouth was dry and her head was pounding she slowly opened her eyes and winced them shut against the painful bright glare of the light overhead sorry about that she heard someone say the lights in the room dimmed slightly better she cracked her eyes open again and then nodded she felt something cool pressed into her hands water have a sip its just water i assure you maddy lifted a plastic tumbler and gratefully slurped a mouthful her eyes blinked and she tried to focus on her surroundings a small room with a low ceiling what looked like a medicine cabinet a strip light overhead she was lying on what appeared to be a hospital bed and beside her she saw the old man whod come knocking at their door sitting on a stool hed taken his jacket off rolled up his shirtsleeves and loosened his tie you took a knock on the head when you went down im sorry i had to taser you yes that was it shed felt like every muscle in her body had locked and an unbelievably agonizing sensation had coursed through her whole body where am i she realized she was lying on some sort of a hospital gurney but then this didnt look like a hospital ward or a private ward new york still he smiled and somewhere perfectly safe she sipped the water again who are you the man pulled the stool forward it rattled on castors across a smooth linoleum floor my names lester cartwright he answered warmly and yes if thats your next question i work for a shall we say a quiet little intelligence agency on behalf of the american government maddy nodded and smiled blearily i figured it would be someone like that whod come to our door well who else would it be he asked something like this knowledge of this its far too important for any old joe to have in his possession im sure youd agree maddy shrugged her hand reaching up to her forehead and finding a dressing there i suppose so he said leaning forward i have just about a million goddamn questions ive been wanting to ask someone like you questions ive been waiting for answers to most of my adult life and in return i have a curious message that im sure youre rather keen to see she was encouraged by the old mans directness no beating about the bush no attempting to fool her beguile her just the straightforward declaration of a quid pro quo she nodded a message from a friend yes he said as he got up and reached for his jacket neatly draped on a small storage cabinet in the corner of the room he fumbled for the inside pocket and finally pulled out a folded sheet of paper a friend who apparently decided to take a holiday during the if im not mistaken the late cretaceous period maddys jaw dropped open i uh when did you say the late cretaceous weve tested the rock its definitely from that time her lungs emptied a gasp you mean like dinosaur times cartwright nodded yes i believe it was a popular time for dinosaurs oh my god i didnt think the machine she stopped herself before she blurted out anything else she decided it would be far smarter to keep as much as possible to herself for now yes the mans eyes narrowed curiously yes you do look genuinely surprised at that what were you going to say she shook her head nothing he studied her silently for a few moments this is someone you lost isnt it someone youve been unable to retrieve to find some kind of mistake is that it may i see the message please she replied you didnt think time travel that far back was possible he said fishing for a reaction on her face am i right we lost someone all right now can i see the message where are you from he asked then shook his head comically he gently slapped his forehead stupid stupid me its when are you from i should be asking isnt it maddy couldnt help a smile and a dry laugh it does that to you this business makes you want to slap your head the old man shared the smile i can imagine the smile eased away business again youre american that much ive worked out boston she nodded no point trying to hide that yes when he looked at her tshirt the faded intel logo on the front her jeans her pumps not too far into the future is my guess maybe you want to see this he asked unfolding the message she nodded then can we start having some precise answers from you she shrugged ok your name is maddy maddy carter hello maddy he nodded politely and what year are you from im from she replied the answer seemed to stun him his eyes widened involuntarily and beneath the folds of his wrinkled skin above the crisp white collar of his shirt his jaw worked as teeth ground finally he pursed his lips you said yup you actually know the future the next nine years of it of course his face drained then you youre saying you know for example what this governments foreign policy goals might be longterm strategic plans those kind of things she smiled oh yeah i know whats round the corner that silenced him for a long while she watched the folded paper flutter in his hand do you know just how dangerous that makes you to certain people he said softly i can think of quite a few colleagues in my line of business whod want to put a bullet in your head right now quite a few more whod want to torture every last little fact out of that head of yours oh and then put a bullet in it the message he nodded his head absently and then handed it over it might amuse you to know he said i can recite every word and every last number of the coded section ive known off by heart whats written down on there for the last decade and a half he laughed humourlessly like an old poem drummed into your head at school and you never ever forget maddy reached for it and unfolded the paper she saw handwriting she presumed it was the old mans handwriting take this to archway wythe street brooklyn new york on monday september message key is magic oh my god liam youre alive you made it now the first bit makes sense to me clearly designed to make sure the message finds its way to you she cut him short where did you get the message from he cocked a wiry grey eyebrow a fossil would you believe a fossil discovered by some boys in the second of may to be precise along a river near a town called glen rose in the state of texas it nearly caused a sensation but the wartime secret service worked quickly to hush up the find and of course people were far more concerned about the war then than silly rumours about mysterious fossil finds he smiled the place was taken over by secret service goons and guess what else they found maddy shrugged a few months after the message was discovered they found a human footprint he looked up at her oh yes a genuine human footprint from the same strata of sedimentary rock the print of some sort of a running shoe he was amused by that thats what they called it back then a running shoe they didnt have training shoes back then uh a forensic expert matched the print pattern to the nike brand last year and no one else knows he laughed of course not the boys who originally discovered the artefact well he glanced at her our methods were a little uncivilized back then killed hmmm vanished is the term i think we prefer and of course it turned out a few years later that some other local rockhound had found fossilized human footprints the previous summer so again there was need for some damage limitation vanished too he shook his head news of the human footsteps got to the local newspapers before it could be contained we simply discredited the story easily done the same old boy swore blind his dead mother lived in the attic and came down once a year to bake his birthday cake he snorted complete loon by all accounts anyway go look it up sometime im sure its on some conspiracy website somewhere humans walked with dinosaurs dinosaur valley texas she looked down at the message again so you know exactly how old the fossil is he shook his head no not exactly of course not its identified as coming from a seam of sedimentary rock that predates the end of the cretaceous period what they call the kt boundary thats as precise as we can be im afraid geology works in aeons and ages not months or years he gestured at the piece of paper the numbers i presume the numbers contain specific information that would help you retrieve your friend she could deny that but it was quite obviously the information liam would have put down there i hope so she said but unfortunately its encoded he said now the secret service boys who predated my little clubs involvement in this matter identified this pretty quickly as some sort of book code see the numbers follow the page line word structure and about a decade ago we managed to secure some very expensive time on the defence departments mainframe and ran every single book in the library of congress through it he splayed his hands tiredly we got diddly squat for all our troubles of course which leads me to think as i sit here with you now that that was a big waste of time as this probably is a book that hasnt even been published yet how about that maddy shook her head i i dont know i really dont she glanced at the last words of the message key is magic she looked up at cartwright thats the clue right but i just i just dont know if that really is a clue to a book i wouldnt know which one what about your colleague sal she sat up and groaned with the effort is she ok where is she oh shes just fine he said waving his hands dismissively and shes nearby maybe its time i had a chat with her you wont hurt her he looked sternly at her as he reached for the piece of paper got off the stool and picked his jacket up off the cabinet because see if uh if thats what youre planning to do maddy continued then dont bbother oh let me guess because the pair of you are heroes and neither one of you is going to talk huh because she shook her head and laughed nervously because theres really no need neither of us are heroes well talk ok just promise me you wont hurt us chapter million years bc jungle kelly struggled up the steep incline cursing under his breath as lowhanging thorned vines scratched at his face ahead he could hear the others pushing their way noisily uphill the snapping of branches and vines the clatter of dislodged rocks and soil rolling downhill leonard edward he called out here gasped edward come on you need to pick it up were lagging behind the others their sweatdrenched faces emerged through a curtain of waxy leaves im exhausted gasped howard my leg he failed to finish his words between ragged puffs of air he dropped uncomfortably to his knees on to an uneven bed of dried cones twigs and jagged rocks its slowing him down said edward his ankle i know i know but we cant let the others get too far ahead around their campfire last night the discussion had turned to why those creatures hadnt attacked them again instead choosing to discreetly follow them at a distance the conclusion theyd come to was that they were playing a tactical game waiting for the group to become spread out enough to be able to pick them off one at a time this morning as theyd made their way across the rest of the plain towards the last stretch of the journey down into the jungle valley theyd been almost comically bunched up but now hacking their way through dense foliage the group was getting dangerously strung out come on edward help me get him up it was then that kelly caught a glimpse through a gap in the leaves of some dark form fifty yards below them oh jesus he hissed i saw something back there what just just theres no one else behind us is there edward shook his head kelly saw it again a dark form hurrying between the trunks of two trees then dropping down out of sight oh my god theyre down there howard was on his feet again go go snapped kelly ill watch our backs edward and howard stumbled forward again kelly reversing uphill keeping his eyes on the downhill as he fumbled his way after them again he saw it closer now the flicker of dark olive skin leaping between the gaps in the leaves more than one of them and moving so terrifyingly quietly more worryingly they didnt seem to care that they were being seen oh no now they were in the jungle they were closing the gap im not going to outrun them he realized he stood a far better chance squaring up to them perhaps even skewering one of them on the end of his spear maybe another kill would buy them another day of caution enough time to get back over that river to the camp come on he hissed i know youre down there he heard edward calling down mr kelly go he shouted im just coming the sound of the two boys clumsy staggering slowly receded from him until all he could hear was the occasional snap of a branch echoing off the tall stout trunks of the canopy trees come on he whispered again he was surprised that it wasnt abject terror he was feeling right now but anger rage he wanted to grab one of those scrawny things and rip its ridiculous marrowshaped head off his throat filled with a dry laugh who do you think you are tarzan a far cry from his normal life pr guy meeting and greeting visitors with his cheesy tanned smile and his nice linen suit and expensive polo shirt right now standing legs apart in trousers ripped off at the knees to make shorts barechested revealing a pale torso tufted with silvergrey hair and drooping manboobs that spoke of a lapsed gym membership right now he felt like that commando character in the film his sons liked the one with the alien with a crab face and dreadlocks oh yeah he was ready for them come on you want some of me then come on as if in answer in the stillness of the jungle around him he heard a soft highpitched voice come on then ahead of him as if it had appeared like the cheshire cat only yellow eyes first instead of a big grin there stood one of the creatures a dozen yards downhill of him cocking its head and studying him intently kelly took several steps downhill lunging with the tip of his spear yeah so thats what you things look like up close it recoiled at the sight of the spear ducking back into a patch of waxy leaves only to emerge again a moment later oh yeah i can kill you with this spear muttered kelly triumphantly the spear seemed to be warding off the creature its yellow eyes warily locked on the sharpened tip of bamboo the sound of the others moving through the jungle was all but gone now he couldnt afford to remain like this much longer he needed a kill pretty soon and for the rest of those things to hopefully bolt like rabbits come on he said quietly just you and me man versus ugly lizard thing its jaw snapped open and a dark tongue curled like a serpent inside lizz arrrrd ting a surprisingly close approximation of his own voice so you do impressions huh the creature cocked its head thoughtfully and it was then as the creature was distracted working out how to replicate what hed just said that he decided to make his move he took a quick step and a short leap forward and thrust the spear hard it caught something soft and the creature flapped and flailed on the end of the bamboo howling with a voice that reminded him of the awful noise a dog can make if you step on its tail yes he snarled first blood he pulled the spear back out leaving a large puncture wound in the creatures belly out of which thick dark blood began to sputter as it flailed in screeching agony on the jungle floor he was about to stab the thing again but he felt the spear yanked roughly out of his hands whuh he turned to see a larger hominid standing fully erect maybe a foot taller than him it snarled angrily a rattling croak in the depth of its throat he saw others behind it then became aware of yellow eyes all around him the creature held his spear in both of its clawed hands closely inspecting the long thick shaft and then finally the sharpened tip wet with dark blood it looked at the tip cocked its head and then looked down at kelly who now no longer felt so much like a commando his knees buckled beneath him and he found himself in a helpless squat on the jungle floor oh god oh god run he whimpered why arent you rrunning wwhy arent you running that was what was meant to happen if this was a film thats what would happen right the weedy office guy finally finds his inner hero and saves the day i kkilled one so why wwhy arent you rrunning the creature holding the spear took a step forward and once more inspected the bloodied tip of the bamboo before turning it round so that it pointed towards kelly oh no he found himself whimpering pplease the normal everyday sounds of a cretaceous jungle the distant lowing of large ambling leviathans on the faroff plain the chatter and squeak of small foraging creatures going about their business were punctuated by a peculiar sound the protracted rattling scream of a human being it echoed up through the jungle and out through the tops of the canopy trees startling flocks of small anurognathus from their branches and into the air chapter new york im not saying another thing to you snapped sal cartwright shrugged well ok but then i guess im not going to show you what ive got it was silent in the small interrogation room except for the soft hum of an airconditioner it was warm and stuffy he casually loosened his tie sals narrowed eyes softened piqued with curiosity what what have you got he smiled hmm now there was me thinking we werent going to be talking to each other oh shaddyah please just tell me he pursed his lips giving it some thought and are you going to tell me the things i want to know she clamped her mouth shut said nothing you know i suspect you probably will cartwright relented after all you me and maddy all want the same thing to bring your friend back home safely hes alive liams alive i believe so he nodded and reached into his breast pocket he decided to write home he passed her the folded sheet of paper and she quickly began to scan the handwriting your colleague maddy and i were discussing it just a few minutes ago shes really rather keen to bring him home too and you know im prepared to help you girls do that whatever you want whatever you need but she looked up but he splayed his hands almost apologetically that technology in the arch im afraid thats going to be us government property now and were going to need your help in figuring out how it all works we cant do that she started we cant just let you have it its too dangerous too dangerous for the government but apparently not too dangerous for a pair of kids to mess around with we were recruited specially recruited recruited by sal hesitated i cant really say he shrugged well that can wait until later its not so important the fact is somebody needs to take charge of whats in that archway he cocked a questioning eyebrow i mean somebodys got to be in charge right making sure there arent loads of other time machines and people running around when and where they shouldnt be and what that someones going to be you is it me for now perhaps in time ill brief the current president on what we have but believe you me far better you have someone like myself looking after this on behalf of the american people than some terrorist group or some mad dictator looking for a worldbeating weapon a madman like saddam hussein or osama bin laden hmm she shrugged a whatever at him now he said nodding at the paper in her hands theres a code there maddy seems to think you might know how to decipher it she looked down at the numbers a meaningless jumble of digits that meant absolutely nothing to her at first glance but then very quickly the pattern began to speak to her groups of three numbers the first into the hundreds the second being numbers no greater than thirtyfive and the last seeming to peak at numbers no greater than fifteen sixteen she knew exactly what that was its some kind of a book code clever girl but now heres the sixtyfour thousand dollar question which book she scanned to the bottom of the numbers and saw the last word of the message magic magic what the jahulla sort of a clue was tha she looked up at him a smile slowly spreading across her face of course if bob had it in his database so the duplicate ai in the female support unit would also you know dont you said cartwright uhhuh she was almost tempted to tell him the books title anyway since it wasnt going to be published for another few years yet instead she attempted to suppress an irresistible urge to giggle the old man sighed patiently well you could of course just tell me which would be far more pleasant for the pair of us or we have a medicine cabinet full of interesting drugs i can pump into you some of them with some quite horrific side effects and failing that theres always the oldfashioned way you take us back to the archway she said and ill decode the rest of this message for you he shook his head hmm now see my concern is that we get back into that archway of yours and one of you kidsll shout out something else and pop you and all that machinery vanishes in a puff of twinkly time travel sparkles and smoke she hasnt told you yet has she he frowned told me what sals smile widened a nervous twitchy smile thats actually really funny funny she nodded funny why whats funny shes playing with you how long have i been in here why please tell me how long he looked down at his watch a few hours why exactly please five hours five and a half hours she giggled again you dont have much time left then the last of the congenial expression was lost from his rumpled face stop messing around and tell me what the hell youre talking about sure she said amicably our computer system is locked down for six hours after that its got orders to totally brick itself if maddy doesnt give it another codeword brick fry all the data all the machinery everything his bushy eyebrows both arced and beneath his jowls his jaw began grinding away again you ready to take us back now asked sal politely ill even say please chapter million years bc jungle broken claw looked at the others in his family pack predator eyes meeting predator eyes in his claws he was still holding the bamboo spear the bloodied end of it embedded in what was left of the new creature his mind worked hard trying to understand what hed done trying to comprehend the fact that it wasnt his claws that had ended this pale creatures life but the long device that he was holding something other than him something he controlled something he had used he turned to the others clicked and growled and mewled softly do you see we killed the new creature with this their minds all younger less developed his children stared yellow eyes burning with hatred but not quite understanding not just yet but he did and his older wiser mind stretched a little further this long stick he held he understood now what it was and where it came from they grew along the river in thick clusters but now it was no longer simply a plant the new creatures had fashioned it into something else entirely a deadly weapon something deep in his reptilian mind shifted concepts very simple concepts looking for each other amid a busy crowd of instinctdriven brain signals finally finding each other and embracing his pack had no communicable sound for the concept his mind had no word for the idea but if hed had a wider range of words to construct his thoughts from then his mind would have been full of words like use make build his small mind suddenly produced an image an image of a fastflowing river and a tree trunk lying across it a device the new creatures had built to cross the river he turned to the others clicked his teeth and beckoned them to follow what he had growing in his mind is what any human being would have called a plan chapter new york they approached the archway cartwright nodded at his men still standing guard outside he gestured to forby to join them inside as the shutter cranked noisily up the other men he instructed to continue guarding the entrance allowing no one else inside one by one they all stooped under the shutter as it clattered to a halt as he followed the others in cartwright glanced up at the sky above manhattan beginning to lighten with the first grey stain of dawn another hour and it was going to be daylight new yorkers getting ready to go to work and disgruntled civilians building up around the road blocks either end of the williamsburg bridge traffic police tv film crews and journalists were surely soon going to add to that asking his men and the national guard soldiers where their orders had come from what the hell was going on he and his discreet little undertheradar agency could do without attracting that kind of attention the terroristbomb cover story those men had been given would hold for a little while longer but not forever the last one inside the archway he pressed the button and the shutter rattled down noisily again forby removed his biocontainment hood and then unslung his machine pistol its all right no need to aim it at the girls said cartwright but just have it to hand uh forby nodded and lowered his aim so he continued approaching the desk stacked with monitors the computer before its all fried maddy nodded yes of course dominoes cartwright shook his head of course you idiot lester he looked at the dominos pizza boxes strewn across the desk and would have slapped himself if hed been alone the dialogue box on one of the screens flickered to life as a cursor flashed and scuttled across the screen with new text welcome back maddy hi bob she said im in time arent i no system files have been erased yet you had another seven minutes before i proceeded with your instructions christ muttered lester you werent kidding sal shook her head nope my camera detects unauthorized personnel in the field office yes said maddy we have guests are you under duress no its fine bob these guys are ok for now cartwright tapped maddys arm and spoke quietly to her anything funny i mean it you say anything to that computer that sounds remotely like a warning and itll be the very last thing you do she nodded dont worry im not stupid she sat down in one of the office chairs and faced the computers webcam bob we got a message from liam i am very pleased to hear that yes so are we sal joined her at the table hey bob hello sal she held up the piece of paper lester cartwright had produced earlier this is the message can you see it clearly hold it very still please i will scan it a moment later the scanned image from the webcam appeared on one of the monitors and the image flickered light and dark as bob adjusted the contrast to get a clearer resolution of the handwriting then a highlight box flashed around each handwritten letter in rapid succession until finally a textprocessing application opened itself on yet another monitor with the entire message typed out clearly some of the message is in code thats right said sal its a book code the encryption clue is magic is this correct yes i have more than thirty thousand data strings that include the word magic i think thats referring to the book you were reading the other day do you remember we were discussing it harry potter and the deathly hallows yeah thats the one cartwright and forby leaned forward you have got to be kidding mumbled the old man hey my daughter is reading those books said forby is that the next one its the last one said maddy book seven jeez what my girl wouldnt give to get a look at that cartwright cocked an eyebrow at his man forby please be quiet the man obediently drew back and resumed his wary stance the gun held loosely in his hands sal sat down beside maddy bob you and the duplicate ai will have the same digital book file right affirmative the file was in my shortterm memory cache when we downloaded the duplicate ai into the support unit then this should be pretty much straightforward said maddy yeah sal flicked her hair out of her eyes youve just got to replace each threenumber code with the letter you understand how the code works bob yeah affirmative page number line number letter number thats right just a moment they watched in silence as clusters of numbers were momentarily highlighted on the document while on another screen pages of the book flashed back and forth in a blur the task was completed in less than thirty seconds the complete message is take this to archway wythe street brooklyn new york on monday september message sip two sehjk three npne gour zwro aix key is magic they stared at it in silence for a few moments trying to make sense of it well thats just gibberish isnt it said cartwright are you sure youre working from the same digital book file asked maddy affirmative the original numbers on the fossil said cartwright some of them were indistinct or incomplete i have access to the original piece of rock no its ok said sal if its just numbers its really easy to work out sip is six sehjk must be seven she worked quickly writing the numbers down on a scrap of paper there its not in the usual timestamp format said maddy please show me sal sal held the piece of paper up to the webcam it is a number suggestion it is the ai duplicates best estimation of their current time location oh my god gasped maddy it actually managed to work it out she looked at the cam and smiled well thats you actually isnt it a copy of you bob well done to the exact year said cartwright to the exact year thats thats incredible how could anyone possibly negative the best resolution guess can only be to within years of that year that silenced them all they could be up to years before or after the specified time location oh jahulla whispered sal then thats no good to us the nearest thousand years maddys head drooped how are we supposed to find him in that cartwright looked down at both girls so your machine cant bring back your colleague maddy shook her head it takes time to build up enough charge to open a portal particularly for one that long ago i dont even know how long it would take to accumulate enough to open one then anyway let alone do it thousands and thousands of times over information approximate charge time nine hours so we can do it said sal maddy laughed drily yes we can but a thousand years if we opened one window for each year itll take us nine thousand hours whats that just over a year of constantly opening and closing portals so well do that for liam right maddy sighed thats opening one window per year what are the chances of liam standing right there in the two or three seconds of that year hmm what if he was asleep at that moment taking a leak hunting for food to stand any sort of chance wed need to open one like every day this sounds like a needleinahaystack problem said cartwright unhelpfully oh sal bit her lip but we could try couldnt we three hundred and sixtyfive thousand attempts replied maddy do you want to have a guess how many years that would take us hmm lemmesee she muttered as she gnawed on the nails of one hand oh there three hundred and seventyfive years or something she made a shrewish face growing pink and mottled with frustration and anger so what do you say we get started then then im sorry thats it stepped in cartwright im afraid your friend is stuck where he is this facility will need to be packed up by the end of today and shipped down to a more secure government facility you cant do that snapped sal this is our this is our home its now a us government asset he replied calmly and so are you my dear suggestion you cant do that weve got like human rights and stuff cartwrights smile was humourless and cold the calm and empty gesture of someone who cared not one whit i wonder who exactly is going to miss the pair of you hmm family friends the agency snapped sal and if you mess with us if you hurt us theyll come for you theyre from the future and theyre sal barked maddy shut up she grabbed sals arm dont say anything more about the agency do you understand she clamped her mouth shut and nodded mutely maddy looked at cartwright i think i can guess what you have in mind for us youll keep us under lock and key in some remote area fiftyone facility like freaks like lab rats and thats where well remain until youre sure you know everything about this technology then i guess youll dispose of us right a drive out into the middle of the nevada desert and one shot in the back of the head for each of us is that how you lot work cartwright shook his head nothing so brutal maddy youre worth far too much to us alive even when im sure youve told me all that you know were still going to need guinea pigs to test your time machine on he sighed mind you it would have been good to have your colleague too im not sure im entirely comfortable with the idea of him being out there roaming around history but i suppose if hes sixtytwo million years away i cant see him doing sal cast a glance back at the monitor suggestion rapidsweep density probes she pointed at the screen maddy look maddy spun in her chair to look at the monitor and quickly digested the words oh my god yes probes density probes that could work what said cartwright shaking his head irritably at the distraction whatre you on about tachyon signal probes to check a return location is clear of obstructions and that someone else isnt wandering through it before we open cartwright looked none the wiser its like its like knocking on a door before entering like asking is anyone in there its a lot quicker than actually opening a portal a lot less energy needed she turned back towards the mic on the desk bob what are you suggesting we cant scan every moment over a thousand years can we negative we scan a fixed moment of each day years either side of the calculated year that is a total of density probes but thats going to take you what months years asked cartwright negative small signals no more than a few dozen particles per signal would be enough to identify a transient mass movement yes said maddy thats it and all the signals that came back with some movement detected could become a become our candidate list a shortlist of times we could try to open a portal on bob how long would it take to do that many probes she turned back to cartwright itll take a lot less time i promise you maybe just a few days tops he shook his head unacceptable i want this archway empty by the end of today empty and everything inside in boxes and en route to please begged maddy we cant leave liam out there cartwright silently shook his head he knows the location of all the other field offices cut in sal maddys jaw dropped open whuh he alone knows where they all are locations timestamps she turned to maddy im sorry i was going to tell you but but foster swore me to secrecy cartwright studied her silently there are others then other places like this her face hardened and her dark eyes narrowed im not telling you any more i dont know any more but like i say liam knows hmm he thumbed his chin thoughtfully bob said maddy how many days would it take to do those density scans calculating just a moment just a moment nice try young lady said cartwright eventually you know that was almost convincing but its the sort of nonsense that only happens in movies his croaky voice raised in pitch to that of some damsel in distress oh please dont shoot mister if you let me live ill show you where the loot is hidden cartwright laughed pleased with his impression sal shook her head oh im not lying where do you think the time machine came from she replied what you think me and maddy put it all together by ourselves he had no answer for that maddy could see where sal was going with this a good bluff shes right cartwright where do you think we get spare parts from when the displacement system breaks down who do you think we call to come and fix it some spotty kid from pc world sal nodded you think our people are going to let you walk away with one of their time machines there were questions there that the old man needed time to consider carefully the room remained a motionless tableau while from somewhere overhead came the faint muted sound of a circling helicopter the blink of the cursor running across the dialogue box suddenly caught everyones attention information running at scans a second scans will take approximately nine hours nine hours said maddy see that nine hours she looked at her watch by three this afternoon well have an idea exactly when he is and well be able to bring him back she smiled sarcastically at him then youll have three lab rats to play around with instead of two yes cartwright nodded appreciatively i suppose there is that please whispered sal her hardbargaining face softened to that of a begging puppy all right but if either of you tries anything silly like dialling for help with one of these signals he reached into his jacket and pulled out a handgun in fact if you do anything that isnt explained clearly to me first i will shoot you dead do you understand they both nodded quickly therell be no shouted warnings girls i will simply pick up my gun and i will blow your brains across that messy desk of yours he offered them that cold lifeless smile and believe me youd be in very good company it wont be the first time ive blown a persons brains right out of his head maddy swallowed and puffed out a fluttering breath her eyes resolutely on the wavering muzzle of cartwrights gun sure uh ook nothing silly then i totally promise you that chapter million years bc jungle liam heard the roar of the water through the trees ahead of them becks are we close affirmative the river is a hundred and twentysix yards ahead of us he grinned a mixture of relief and bravado jayzusnmary am i glad to be back by the look on the faces of the others they couldnt agree more with that the thick canopy of leaves above them began to thin out as they approached the jungles edge lances of lateafternoon sunlight stabbing down past loops of vine and dappling the ground with pools of mottled light with a final glance back at the forbidding darkness behind them and an almost complete certainty that those things were still somewhere back there watching them from a distance they hurried forward into the light up ahead the river frothed and tumbled like some endlessly enraged beast on the far side he could see their bridge dangling like a cranes arm above the water he was relieved to see it was raised the four theyd left behind had maintained a wary caution liam stood on the bank and cupped his hands hellooooo the others gathered beside him theyd lost three of their number ranjit franklyn and earlier this morning kelly all of them had heard his cry and it had hastened their efforts down into the jungle valley knowing those things were somewhere behind and theyd grouped together more cautiously realizing now the creatures were looking for stragglers being bunched together seemed to have paid off thered been no sign of them throughout the morning midday and now into the afternoon not even when theyd cleared the bare peak liam had looked back quickly in the hope of catching their pursuers unawares but he saw nothing now they were back job was done liam craned his neck to look into the thin veil of jungle on the far side of the river he could see some slivers of light through the dark tree trunks the clearing beyond but no sign of anyone coming their way to lower the bridge yet try again said laura hellooooo liams voice echoed above the roar of the river and startled a flock of miniature pterodactyls from a nearby tree they waited with growing anticipation for a few minutes theyd have heard that surely said whitmore edward stood on tiptoes to get a look through the jungle opposite unless theyre all sleeping therell be hell to pay if they are muttered liam he cupped his hands again were back still nothing maybe they gone huntin said juan i gave instructions that someone always has to keep an eye on the windmill replied liam irritably laura nodded at the bridge someone would have to stay behind anyway to lift that for them and lower it he nodded true so someone must be home this is not good he muttered under his breath becks had been examining the fastflowing water i am able to cross this she said the currents too strong said liam i do not need to swim across all of it liam she pointed along the bank on which they were standing fifty yards down it rose to a mosscovered hump that was well on its way to being undercut by the river information i calculate i will be able to jump across between thirty and forty per cent of the rivers width from that point he looked at her and you know how to swim affirmative i also know how to walk run jump talk he cocked a sideways glance at her was that actually sarcasm was that another example of beckss emerging sense of humour she returned a smile oh youre so funny becks i am developing several files on humour traits she nodded towards the mossy hump changing subject i will not be long she said turning to walk down the bank towards it wheres she going asked whitmore unhappy to see their robot bodyguard leaving them alone shes going to do her superhero thing said liam they watched in silence as she examined the river for a moment then turned to regard the height of the hump after a few seconds she walked away from the rivers edge and came to a halt just as she was about to enter the shadowy fringe of the jungle she turned round and without a seconds hesitation broke into a sprint towards the river whitmores eyes rounded shes gonna jump it she bounded up the side of the hump and launched herself out across the river subconsciously everyone gasped and rose on their tiptoes as she gracefully sailed a dozen yards out over the water her arms pinwheeling to give her extra momentum then she arced down into the water disappearing beneath the stampeding white horses of the river for a long half a minute liam couldnt see her anywhere then finally he spotted a dark head bobbing among the churning swirls of suds gone again back again then as the river rode over a bed of large boulders and became a chicane of lethallooking rapids it curved round and she was lost from sight she gonna make it asked juan liam nodded id put money on it whitmore nodded with admiration what i wouldnt give to have her on my schools athletics team wed win every cup going they waited an interminable ten minutes before they spotted her again jogging up the riverbank on the far side she reached their juryrigged bridge carefully untied the counterweight of bundled logs and then taking on the weight of the main trunk muscles in her arms bulging from the effort she slowly lowered it the vine ropes creaking and groaning under the strain above the busy rumble of the river they heard the crack of one of the vines snapping its gonna go shouted liam it looked like becks had heard that too she began to pay out the rope more quickly but another vine snapped under the increased burden twanging up to the overhanging branch like a rubber band stand back barked liam to the others its gonna drop and it did the other vines snapped in quick succession and the tree trunk swung down from its fortyfive degree angle and clattered heavily on the boulders on their side everyone heard the crack loud as a gunshot halfway along the trunk jagged splinters of wood protruded from the side and their bridge sagged down in the middle almost into the water oh great shouted laura lemmesee it may be ok said juan before anyone could stop him hed stepped up on to the boulders and then carefully on to the end of the log he inched his way a few yards along it it bowed a little further now dipping into the water itself midway along but it seemed to be holding juan dropped to his hands and knees then straddled it bumshuffling his way across at the midway point he gingerly eased his way over the jagged fracture water catching his dangling legs and threatening to pull him off but he got over and a minute later jumped off on the far side liam nodded all right then it seems like itll hold for us lets go whitmore ushered edward to cross first then had laura akira and jasmine line up to go next meanwhile liam turned round have your spears ready he nodded at the dark jungle behind howard and whitmore they may still be out there waiting until its just the one of us left then what he didnt care to think about that whitmore went after jasmine panting with exertion and fear as he inched his way across the fractured trunk wobbling and creaking with each movement he made finally he made it to the far side and beckoned for whoever was coming next leonard you go the darkhaired boy eyed liam you sure uhhuh replied liam his eyes remaining on the dark jungle just be quick will you he added flashing him a quick nervous smile howard nodded and then was on the trunk and shuffling liam waited until the student was nearly halfway across before taking one wary step on to the end of the log he could feel the vibration of howards movements if theyre gonna come for me its gonna be right now then as if on cue he thought he saw movement some dark shape leaping through the undergrowth moving from one hiding place to the next getting closer but not quite ready to commit to leaping out into the open what is it he grunted under his breath you scared of me is that it that sounded good to him fighting talk for a fleeting moment there he almost didnt feel completely terrified but that soon passed as his eyes assured him something else had just shifted position one tree closer to him he finally felt the trunk under his foot wobble as leonard presumably jumped off at the far side he heard whitmores voice over the din of tumbling water calling him over coming liam shouted over his shoulder keeping his eyes on the jungle he reversed on to the log still not daring to turn his back on what he knew was in there and waiting for him to do just that pull yourself together liam he dropped down to his hands and knees unwilling to turn his back on the jungle he began bumshuffling backwards one hand still holding the spear half ready in case he needed to defend himself at a moments notice after a minutes slow progress he finally felt a sharp splinter of wood scrape the inside of his thigh and realized he was now just before the fractured halfway point cool water rode up his dangling legs soaking him to his thighs as he shuffled to get past the jagged shards of the fractured trunk he heard it crack and felt it lurch as it sagged lower into the river water suddenly rode up over his knees and over his lap pummelling his gut and chest like an enraged boxer sensing the faltering resolve of an opponent oh no please no water drowning suddenly the fear of being snatched and torn apart by some vicious predator was matched by the idea of being snatched away by the river its going to break shouted someone liam could feel the trunk being buffeted and kicked by the strong current it flexed creaked and twisted under the punishing weight of energy slamming into it he realized it wasnt going to hold out much longer and a rising tide of panic compelled him to get off his backside and crawl he struggled on to his hands and knees now finally turning his back on the jungle hed moments ago thought was hiding the most frightening thing in this world no the most bloody frightening thing right now was this churning white monster roaring hungrily at him doing its best to pull him off he could see the others waiting for him at the far end of the bowing log all frantically waving at him to get a move on all right all right im coming he yelped he began to crawl forward on hands and knees one hand carefully placed after the other on the treacherously wet bark come on liam come on youre nearly there he managed to make his way a yard closer to the bank and even managed to flash the others a cavalier im gonna be just fine grin when his hand found a slick patch of moss uhh was all he managed to gasp before his hand slipped round the side of the trunk and the unsupported weight of his body carried him over chapter million years bc jungle suddenly he found himself spinning amid a roaring chaotic swirl of swiftly moving water instinctively hed snatched a lungful of air as hed gone under his body doing the thinking for him while his mind shrieked uselessly with blind panic drown im gonna drown he knew it his lungs were only going to buy him a half minute of life his mind was all of a sudden back in the narrow confines of a corridor groaning with the sound of stressed bulkheads flickering wall lamps and the distant roar of icecold seawater finding its way up from the deck below the certain promise of death a mile down in the cold dark embrace of the ocean oh no no no no not this not like this then his head suddenly broke the surface he flailed in the foam still holding on to the stale breath in his lungs he caught sight of their log bridge thirty or forty yards behind him already and fast disappearing as the swift current carried him away his legs thumped heavily against a boulder and he found himself being rolled over its hard rounded surface his head again under the water his ears filled with the pounding roar of the river he felt himself being sucked down deep by a spiralling current pressure compressing his chest panic sheer blinding panic robbed his mind of any useful conscious thought and left him with a curdling mental scream knowing this dark roaring depth was where it was all going to come to an end for him but the rivers mischievous current decided to play one more game with him and shot him to the surface to say goodbye to life and air and trees and the crimson sky of later afternoon once more liam gasped for another lungful of air half aware that perhaps the kindest thing he could do was simply breathe out and prepare his mouth his throat his lungs for an invasion of water but then his shoulder thudded hard against something something he could grasp hold of and fight the incredible pull of the river he opened his eyes and realized it was a fallen tree for a moment he wondered if the river had carried him right the way round their island in some logicdefying looptheloop and he was right back where their crudely constructed bridge was he desperately grappled with the rough bark and the small leafy branches that sprouted from it merciful handholds that their smooth and straight trunk had lacked from branch to branch he managed to pull himself out of the strong current in the middle of the river to some calmer eddies of swirling water finally his foot brushed against the river bottom scattering pebbles and his feet desperately fumbled for firmer footing that promised to stay beneath him his hands followed the fallen tree pulling on thicker more reliable branches until he found himself wading out of the river finally collapsing on hands and knees on wet shingle that shifted and clattered noisily beneath him urgh he spluttered between ragged gasps of breath his breath was still pounding in and out as he finally pulled himself exhausted to his feet he turned to look at the fallen tree trying to get his bearings and work out which side of the river he was now standing on the base of the tree was on the far side he could see a frayed and splintered stump that looked like it had been hacked at by a team of inept carpenters armed with blunt chisels or beavers even not beavers obviously perhaps some species of termite had cannibalized the tree or it had simply rotted and split either way he thanked it for saving his life he noticed a mess of disturbed shingle and footprints around him among the leaves and branches of the felled tree and realized that perhaps lam and the others must have felled the tree for wood but foolishly allowed it to fall across the river and just left it idiots the first thing hed do once he found them was get them to heave the tree back into the water and let it be carried away he turned round and squinted up the riverbank through a hundred yards of jungle he could just about make out crimson slivers of waning sunlight the trees thinning the clearing beyond and their camp hed lost his spear in the river no matter he was on the safe side now he made his way up the shingle and into the narrow apron of jungle up ahead through the dangling loops of vine he could see the sun casting long shadows across the leafy hummocks of their shelters and the wooden wall of their small palisade as it began to make a bed on the horizon but as yet he couldnt make out lam and the other three kids theyd left behind where are they helloooo he called out again his voice ricocheting through the jungle a few moments later he was stepping out from beneath the dark canopy of foliage and into the clearing on the very far side he could see becks and the others emerging he waved at them hey he saw their heads turn his way and their mouths form sudden dark ovals of surprise and relief i made it im all right he called across to them im fine have you seen the others becks led them across the clearing towards liam until finally they converged around the smouldering remains of a campfire the others have not been located said becks liam noticed their small turbine wasnt spinning the crossbar was split and the school bag was on the ground its load of round pebbles spilled the windmills broken whats happened there were no answers we should get that running again first he continued he looked around at the others maybe theyre out looking for us becks strode swiftly towards the contraption to see whether a quick repair could be made liam was about to pass on some instructions to the others to split up and search for the others when he noted jasmines gaze wideeyed and lost on some detail everyone else seemed to have missed jasmine you all right she pointed at the ground that she whispered whats that liam followed her gaze down to the ground nestled amid a cluster of pebbles cones and the dry brown decaying leaves of longdead ferns he saw a pale slender object that looked to him like an impossibly large maggot he took a step towards it and noted the ground was stained dark around it and at one end of it pointed yellowwhite shards poked out like the antennae of a shrimp he felt his stomach lurch and flip in a slow queasy somersault it was someones index finger the antennae shards of bone what is it asked whitmore stooping to get a better look my god is that a finger the conclusion hit liam like a punch theyre here he looked up at them those pack hunters are here on the island whitmores mouth flapped open and shut and produced nothing helpful how asked howard its impossible no way those things can swim across they dont need to he looked at the others they went and copied us learned from us what do you mean i think they made their own bridge chapter new york everything in the archway died leaving them in pitch black whats going on cried cartwright please cried maddy in the dark dont shoot dont shoot its nothing i did stay right where you are snapped cartwright i hear you move or do anything and ill fire ook were not moving are we sal nope sitting still doing nothing just hang on cartwright said maddy just a second the generator should kick in any time now on cue from the back room came the rumbling of the generator firing up a moment later the strip light in the middle of the archway flickered once twice with a dink dink then stayed on they all stared silently at each other as the monitors flickered in unison the computer system rebooting itself what just happened demanded cartwright i dunno yet said maddy that was a time wave said sal a what time wave she repeated something big changed in the past and its just now caught up with us maddy nodded unhappily yeah shes right thats exactly what that was cartwright looked at both the girls then at forby who returned nothing more useful than a calm professional stare well said the old man what does that mean it means outside this archway outside the perimeter of our fieldoffice time shield things have changed explained maddy changed a lot if we lost power so whats out there now he asked maddy splayed her hands i dont know another version of new york i guess cartwrights eyes widened to rheumy bloodshot pools forby go take a look yes sir he stepped across the archway and hit the green button nothing happened wont open the doorways not on the generator circuit said maddy just crank it up with the handle there she said pointing forby saw the small metal handle nodded and started turning it round the computer had finished rebooting and bobs dialogue box popped up we are running on auxiliary power resume density probing maddy turned in her chair back towards the monitors how much more probing have you got to do information candidate density soundings made she made a face less than half the total number that bob had calculated they needed to make are there any good suspects there are soundings so far in which a density fluctuation occurred can you narrow that down any affirmative i can analyse the interruption signatures returned and identify those that demonstrate a repeat or an artificial rhythm uh lemme think she bit a ragged edge around her fingernail but youre only like halfway through doing the probes less than halfway and if you stop now we might miss them she thought out loud affirmative but now were on generator power have you got enough power to do all those probes and open a window too if we find them i do not have enough data to answer that question maddy can you guess i do not have enough data to answer that question maddy she cursed all right so youre saying its possible well run out of juice if you carry on doing the probes right affirmative the rattling of the cranking shutter door coming from across the archway suddenly ceased ok bob she sighed burying her face in her hands with weary frustration ok ok all right then stop with what youre doing and analyse what weve got already see if weve got a hit affirmative what the that was forby jesus that was cartwright maddy spun round in her chair and saw the pair of them standing in the middle of the opened shutter doorway staring out at a canvas of emeraldgreen jungle she sighed oh no not again last time a time wave had arrived like this one large enough to sever the feed of power into their field office it had left new york a postapocalyptic wilderness of tumbledown ruins under a poisoned rustred sky she and sal hurried over towards the open entrance jahulla gasped sal as they joined the other two and maddy nodded jahulla indeed this time new york was gone not just shattered ruins but gone as in never existed she looked down at her feet their cold and pitted concrete floor simply ended in a straight line where their invisible force fields effect terminated the ground beyond was a rich brown soil carpeted in a mat of tall grass and lush clusters of lowgrowing ferns and other unidentifiable foliage she looked up and saw no williamsburg bridge no horizon of manhattan skyscrapers just a broad sedate river delta of lush rainforest uh how how did we end up in the middle of a jungle sir asked forby a slow understanding smile spread across cartwrights face finally he nodded incredible he whispered his eyes wide like a childs full of wonder a solitary tear rolled down one of his craggy cheeks this is quite incredible sir forby turned to him his calm professional demeanour had vanished and been replaced with barely contained panic sir where the hell are we we havent moved anywhere the old man replied he turned to look at maddy or any when have we were exactly when and where we were thats right she replied but an alternate history has just caught up with us cartwrights ragged features seemed to look ten years younger the face of a child catching a glimpse of the tooth fairy or a glint of santas sleigh disappearing into a distant moonlit cloud bank sir the other men where are they gone forby he replied in a distracted whisper gone theyre dead nope they were just never born said sal i want to see more uttered cartwright stepping off the concrete on to the soft ground beyond he grinned my god this is real isnt it maddy shrugged its another reality how new york might have ended up if if if what asked forby thats just it she replied we dont know yet my guess is its some change caused by our colleague in the past im sure it wasnt intentional forby shook his head youre telling me one person can actually change a whole world cartwright sighed clearly frustrated by the narrowminded thinking of his subordinate of course forby think about it man if if a certain jewish carpenter hadnt made his mark two thousand years ago it wouldnt be in god we trust on a dollar note but gods forby frowned a patriot no one dissed the mighty dollar not on his watch and our friends much much further back in time than jesus added sal small changes in the past quoted maddy remembering the first time foster had spoken to them bringing them that tray of coffees and doughnuts a simple and strangely reassuring gesture in that surreal moment of awakening small changes in the past can make enormous changes in the present cartwright glanced towards the nearby riverbank we should go and explore a little he stopped dead in his tracks look maddy followed his wavering finger pointing across the broad river to the low hump of island that was once manhattan she squinted painfully her eyes not so great without glasses she managed to detect the slightest sense of movement what is it people uttered sal yes its people a settlement of some kind added cartwright she thought she could make out a cluster of circular dwellings down by the waterside and several pale thin plumes of smoke rising up into the sky look said forby theres a boat halfway across the river calm and subdued barely a ripple upon its glasssmooth surface was the long dark outline of some canoe aboard they could see half a dozen figures paddling the vessel across the river towards them they look odd said sal shading her eyes from the sun theyre theyre moving all funny cartwright seemed eager to rush down to the riverside and greet them we should go and make contact no said maddy really i dont think we should why not he asked the things we could learn from each other the knowledge of another maybe the girls right said forby they could be hostile sir he shook his head his face an expression of bemusement this is an incredible moment of history but thats just it this isnt history this isnt meant to happen said maddy those people shouldnt exist this is a what if reality this is a never shoulda happened reality cartwright do you get it the last thing we need to do is go and make friends with it im not so sure theyre people anyway said sal quietly watching the canoe approach the nearby riverbank a hundred and fifty yards away the long canoe rode up gracefully on to the silt the figures aboard the boat put down their paddles in the bottom and began one by one to jump off the front and on to the mud even maddy could now make out that they werent human my god look at their legs whispered forby like just like goats legs dogs legs dinosaur legs added cartwright in fact therapod legs a bit like velociraptors forget their legs said sal check out their heads maddy squinted wondering whether her eyes were playing tricks on her they look like bananas elongated said forby shaking his own head weirdest damned thing i ever seen they look sort of extraterrestrial he turned to the others his voice lowered my god do you think thats what they are a species of alien thats arrived and colonized our world cartwright dismissed the man the legs suggest some possible ancestral link to dinosaurs the heads damned if i know where that shape has come from they watched the creatures spread out along the silt holding spears in their hands and probing the mud with them what are they doing do you think asked maddy as if in answer to her question some unrecognizable pigsized creature emerged from a hole in the mud and scurried across the silt towards another hole the nearest of the bananaheads quickly raised his spear and threw it with practised efficiency it skewered the small creature and left it struggling and squealing on its side hunting said forby a little too loudly one of the creatures suddenly turned to glance their way the four of them instinctively hunkered down behind the gently waving fronds of a large fern think he saw us hissed forby through gritted teeth maddy looked up at the ragged outline of red brickwork around the corrugated shutter door the portion of the bridge support that existed within the archways field luckily most of it was shielded by a giant species of tree she didnt recognize drooping waxy leaves the size of umbrellas hung low over them a perfect camouflage i think were hidden she whispered they watched through gaps in the swaying leaves as the creature still curious slowly paced up the silty bank towards them cocking its long head curiously on to one side closer now they could see a lean hairless body covered with an olive skin an expressionless face of bone and cartilage and a lipless mouth full of razorsharp teeth its really ugly offered sal in a whisper i really dont want to go make friends with it maddy noticed forby raising his gun warily a finger slipping across the trigger she nudged him gently and shook her head dont he nodded its beautiful whispered cartwright what a magnificent creature look at it for a moment it lingered there scanning the rainforest in front of it not seeming to spot them or the squat brick shape of their archway then finally it seemed to shrug turn away and head back towards the others calling something out with a mewling whine and a clack of its sharp teeth ive seen enough we should go back inside said maddy theres work to be done dont you want to learn more asked cartwright she shrugged why if weve managed to get lucky and locate liam then none of this will ever have happened she looked at forby who seemed relieved at the idea of heading back be pointless learning anything about these things really if you think about it they soon will belong to the world of never were cartwright made a face a mixture of disappointment and frustration all right he conceded lets get on with it chapter million years bc jungle did you hear that said laura her eyes round with fear theyd heard it all right although the jungle was soon due to stir with its concert of nocturnal cries and calls the sun had only just slipped from the sky leaving behind thin combed cirrus clouds stained a coral pink from its waning light the jungle was on the turn the stillness between those that lived in the day and those that prowled the night but there it was again a desperate female cry for help it was one of the four theyd left behind either keisha jackson or sophia yip please help me its keisha said jasmine she turned to the others it is its keisha which direction did it come from asked liam it wasnt far off somewhere within the apron of jungle around their clearing could be coming from any direction the mischievous way voices seemed to bounce around help it hurts we have to go help her said edward negative said becks the hominids could still be on the island lauras eyes darted back to the finger on the ground the light was getting dim enough for it to be almost mercifully easy to overlook could be she exclaimed theyre hhere all right or theyve been and gone added whitmore he looked at liam weve got to go help the poor girl she could be dying please whitmore nodded across the clearing it came from over there he grabbed a spear and turned to the others ill need help lifting her edward grabbed a spear and joined him howard and juan did likewise ok said liam go get her he turned to laura akira and jasmine we need this fire going again can you see to that big fire all right big as you can make it they both nodded and becks we need that windmill contraption running she nodded affirmative and all of you he called out particularly to whitmore and the others already jogging in the direction they hoped to find keisha all of you stay close together no one goes on their own he watched them go four of them all armed with spears in the jungle on their way back from laying down their clay tablets theyd been infinitely more vulnerable to ambush and yet the creatures had warily held back only jumping kelly he presumed because hed been entirely on his own he looked anxiously around the clearing the girls were just a dozen yards away working on the fire and becks merely thirty yards from him busy trying to rejig the windmill liam tried to think quickly he wasnt exactly alone here in the middle of the clearing but hed have felt happier having another one or two people standing right beside him his eyes darted to the dark entrances of a couple of the nearby leantos the small gateway to their palisade possible hiding places possibly containing one or two of them liam stay calm liam stay calm broken claw watched the new creatures approach four of them armed with their killing sticks he turned to the others crouched nearby and softly hissed for them to make ready he turned towards the younger one crouched next to him the youngest ones of the pack were best at this particular skill mimicking the calls of wounded prey their voiceboxes being smaller allowing them a much higher pitch the shrill pitch of fear and desperation he clacked his claws gently instructing the young one to do it once again the young females jaw opened and her tongue and voice skilfully reproduced the cries the female new creature had been making earlier today as she lay dying from a fatal stomach wound help me please they changed direction veering directly towards broken claw and the others just a few dozen yards away now stepping out of the clearing and into the darkness of the jungle the new creatures seemed to have absolutely no sense of how close to danger they were their small seemingly ineffective noses unable to detect the smells that filled broken claws nasal cavity the smell of excitement from his pack the smell of anticipation of a fine kill the smell of their darkskinned female brethren lying dead amid the ferns nearby bled out hours ago how could they not smell any of this these creatures were either foolish or incapable of sensing all the warning signals in the air around them stumbling blindly certainly he understood this now nothing for his pack to be wary of any more hed learned enough about them that they were as vulnerable as the larger planteaters they usually hunted more vulnerable in fact since they had neither their weight or strength to throw around and now broken claw and several of the stronger males in his pack now possessed sticksthatkill the four long digits on each of his hands tightened round the thick bamboo shaft broken claw was determined to use his stickthatkills on one of them as he had that older male earlier this morning up in the hills a fascinating way of delivering death an intriguing tool of death juan stopped and pointed at a splotch of drying blood on the back of a broad waxy leaf keisha he called out you here the four of them stood perfectly still listening to the gentle hiss of shifting leaves above them and the fading echo of juans voice keisha he called out again then very softly not a cryingout voice trying to be heard across acres of jungle but a soft whimpering closeby murmur please help me where are you asked whitmore we cant see you help me where are you keisha can you see us please please juan cocked his head that dont sound like her man edward nodded she sounds kind of funny sophia run whitmores eyes narrowed keisha they killed jonah juan looked silently at the others his face spoke for him that really isnt her whitmore nodded and then slowly placed a finger to his lips he waved his hands at them to back up the way theyd come fifteen twenty yards of jungle thats all then theyd be out in the clearing again theyd just begun to carefully retrace their steps when juan suddenly convulsed burping a trickle of blood down the front of his varsity sweatshirt he looked slowly down at the six inches of sharpened bamboo tip that protruded from his belly oh oh man was about all he could say before his eyes rolled and his legs buckled beneath him crouching behind juans collapsed form was one of the bipedal creatures its long head cocked with curiosity and its yellow eyes marvelling at the spear in its hands run screamed whitmore to the other two its a trap howard and edward turned on their heels to head back towards the clearing only to face another pair of those creatures springing seemingly out of nowhere howard lunged quickly with his spear catching one of them in the thigh the creature recoiled with a scream go screamed howard pushing edward away from the creatures meanwhile whitmore found himself trapped by a closing circle of four of them you rreally are cclever arent you he found himself babbling through trembling lips a couple of them were holding spears just like he was holding his my ggod youve learned ffast havent you the creature that had speared juan stepped over his body and approached whitmore with an unsettling raptorlike bobbing movement the creature barked an order to some more of its kind hiding in the undergrowth and whitmore heard the thud of feet and the swish of branches flicked aside as several set off in pursuit of the other two boys now it cocked its head its yellow eyes drinking him in eyes that burned with intelligence and curiosity and a thousand questions it probably wanted to ask but hadnt yet developed a sophisticated enough language to know how to ask i i know you can ccommunicate whitmore babbled his mans voice broken and mewling now like a childs ssso can wwe wwere the ssame yyou he said slowly pointing a shaking finger towards the creature mme me he said gesturing to himself were the ssame its long head protruded forward on the end of a fragile almost feminine neck ththe same the same whimpered whitmore intelliintelligent whitmore was only vaguely aware of his bladder letting loose a warm trickle running down his left leg and soaking his sock a small detail a faraway detail right in front of his own face only inches away his world was this bony carapace of another face and yellow piercing reptile eyes that seemed to grow ever larger its jaw snapped open revealing rows of needlesharp teeth and a twisting leathery black tongue that furled and unfurled like an angry snake in a cage whitmore let go of his spear and it clattered to the ground between them do ddo you ssee no nno harm i mmean yyou no hharm the tongue twisted and coiled and whitmore heard an odd facsimile of his own voice coming right back at him no hharm the ssame he nodded yyes yyes wwewere intelli whitmore felt a punch to his chest it winded him like a medicine ball launched at his thorax he gasped spattering a fine spray of blood on to the creatures expressionless face he would have doubled over from the blow but claws from behind were holding him up on his feet the yellow eyes inches in front of him looked down at something all of a sudden feeling oddly dizzy and lightheaded he decided the polite thing was to do the same and there it was in the palm of the creatures hand his own heart still dutifully beating away chapter million years bc jungle howard and edward stumbled through the jungle skirting the clearing but unable to get to it because one of the creatures was deliberately blocking them clever wheezed howard keeping them bottled up here amid tree trunks and dangling loops of vine it prevented them making big sweeping strikes with their spear and hatchet the blade or shaft was bound to get tangled or caught on something one beast was behind them and another to their left preventing them from making their way to the encircling river not that theyd be able to go anywhere the pursuer behind them could easily have caught up but he remained a steadfast dozen yards behind he realized then that they were just wearing them out pursuing the pair of them through the tangled undergrowth until they were certain they were spent and unable to offer much of a fight howard stopped edward whod been supporting his weight on the right leg gasped uh we got to run howard shook his head finding his breath no theyre playing with us herding us all three of the hominids pursuing them came to a halt a dozen yards away on each side and waited patiently for their next move yellow eyes peering at them through thin veils of dangling looping vines howard nodded to the clearing the edge of it fifty yards to their right the creature blocking that way had ducked down out of sight thats the way we should be heading edward swallowed nervously but one of ththose i know he sucked in breath again hes in there somewhere but you have to make a break for it run for the palisade what about you he shook his head i wont make it i cant run ill buy you time you yyoull die howard nodded smiled even sure i figured that edward grabbed his arm we ccan both run dont argue there isnt time for this listen he grabbed the boys shoulder run save your life make it back home but promise me something he glanced over edwards shoulder one of the creatures was shifting position impatient for a kill and stepping closer promise me to dedicate your talent to something else not time travel edward anything but time travel edwards eyes were on the other two creatures promise me he nodded yes yyes ok no time travel edward itll kill us all itll destroy the world god help us perhaps even the universe do you understand he said shaking the boys shoulder the creatures inched warily closer long athletic legs gracefully stepping over the uneven jungle floor towards them their lean bodies bobbing with coiled energy please he hissed please tell me you understand edwards eyes met his he was crying yes i ppromise i promise howard ruffled his hair good he took the hatchet in one hand and grasped the spear in the other now when i say he said softly you run ed you run for all its worth you understand the boy nodded howard could see the creature between them and the clearing now its head bobbed up and ducked behind a large fern no longer trying to hide but clearly still very wary of them good then hed take advantage of that ready he whispered edward nodded silently his cheeks shone with tears his lips clamped shut trembling without any warning howard roared waaarrghhhh and charged forward towards the creature cowering behind the fern the creature leaped back an almost comical bunny hop of surprise as howard crashed through the undergrowth towards it he stumbled through a cluster of ferns swinging his hatchet at the creature as it recoiled still off balance the jagged blade caught something and the creature screamed howard spun round and reached for edward go he shouted grabbing the scruff of his collar and pulling him forward go go go he pushed the boy forward with a rough punch to the small of his back edward scrambled past the writhing creature across a dozen yards of stunted plants and thinning saplings ducking loops of thorny vines that promised to snarl his throat like barbed wire the boy was fast and agile and small enough to make a better job of dodging the jungle obstacles howard turned his attention to the creature beside him snapping and clacking teeth as it got to its feet and warily circled him leaking dark blood from the gash on its leg im ready for this he told himself im ready for this im ready im ready im ready to die his mantra back in the lab back when he was approaching edward chan and fingering the gun in his bag hed been ready to die then for a cause only a few seemed to truly understand he was just as ready to die now just as long as the boy keeps his promise there was no knowing but instinct hope told howard that edward had seen enough of the nightmare of time travel for himself to know that his unique talent could never be allowed to find its voice and thats all that matters right howard stared down the creature in front of him mission completed he uttered to himself with a growing smile spread across his boyish face come on then ugly he said advancing on the thing just as the leaves behind him shuffled and swayed with the arrival of the other two ready to finish him off chapter new york they returned to the archway and forby wound the shutter down again so said the man as he shouldered his assault rifle and cranked the handle what i dont get is if this is still a version of the year how come those dinohumans out there arent a lot more advanced maddy and sal looked at each other i dunno said maddy im no anthropologist its a good question forby said cartwright he turned round and crouched to get one last look out at the rainforest version of the hudson river delta and the faroff cluster of rounded huts on the muddy banks of manhattan island a good question and ill hazard a guess theyre a deadend branch of evolution forby looked at him sir those things out there he flicked a finger out at the narrowing window of alternative world outside if they really are the direct descendants of some species that survived the end of the cretaceous era a species that somehow survived as a result of something thats been changed he looked at the girls by your friend then theyve been around for tens of millions of years well thats exactly my point sir how come they arent lightyears more advanced than humans how come there isnt some gigantic lizard version of futurama out there forby finished cranking the shutter down the archway was dim once more lit by the sterile fizzing glow of the ceiling tube light they plateaued said cartwright perhaps their species evolved to the best it could possibly be and then just stopped sal made a face i thought evolution never stopped i thought it always changed always like adapting oh but it does and can stop he replied there are species alive today that are virtually identical to their distant prehistoric ancestors sharks for example nature had evolved them to be perfect for their environment perfect killing machines why bother adapting any further he shrugged perhaps in this world those reptilian hominids out there are the dominant predator with nothing to compete against and have been that way for millions of years evolution is natures way of problem solving if something changes that challenges a species ability to survive then that stimulates an adaptive response if theres nothing to challenge a species existence then why would it ever need to change cartwright shrugged a deadend of evolution a deadend world echoed forby they made their way across the dim archway on the other hand maybe theres some practical limit to how much smarter that species outside can get maybe those long heads are already too heavy to develop any greater cranial capacity so their brains will never get any bigger thats right and theyll never do any better than spears mud huts and dugout canoes well said maddy approaching the desk whatever well never know because those creepylooking things werent meant to happen she sat down at the computer desk bob howre you doing with those candidate signals analysis completed the last density soundings before you ordered me to cease the sweep indicated the immediate location was occupied by a permanent physical obstruction this could be a natural intrusion for example a fallen tree or a geological event so before that maddy asked impatiently the others joined her at the desk a total of transient density warnings cartwright squatted down beside her and studied the dialogue box that means what so now youre down to two hundred and twentyseven possible locations for your friend maddy nodded can we filter that any further affirmative were singleincursion events of the remaining eight density signatures that demonstrated a repeated incursion only one demonstrated a regularly timed signature sal bit her lip with excitement thats it surely thats got to be it affirmative sal there is a high probability that this is the correct timestamp yes said maddy spinning round in her chair her hand raised for a highfive sal obliged with a hearty slap and a shriek of excitement cartwright smiled i presume that means youve found your friend yes see maddy grinned proudly i told you we could do it so then what happens now she spun back to face the monitors in front of her bob were good to begin charging up to open a portal information we have a hour time period identified in which to open a window hmm maddy pulled absently on her top lip twentyfour hours but when exactly do we open it cartwright looked vexed and impatient we have to be sure theyre there right said sal on maddys behalf you know before we commit to opening a portal if we spend the stored charge and theyre not there weve gone and wasted it maddy nodded well only have enough stored energy to open one maybe two windows how do we make sure theyre actually right there and ready and waiting to come through though hang on cut in cartwright you just said they are you telling me theres more than just your friend stuck back there sal nodded yes liam and some others children that were caught up in an accident good god the old man whispered accident this was an accident what the heck have you people been up to it was a training incident cut in sal thats all it went wrong these things happen from time to time information it will be possible to open a series of pinhole windows and obtain a smallresolution image of the target location right maddy nodded right then we could see exactly when during the day theres somebody standing around yes yes good idea bob lets proceed with that affirmative cartwright sighed so whats happening now clearly impatient to see the displacement machine actually finally running maddy turned to look over her shoulder were taking some images of the portal location to make sure that when we open the window theyre ready and waiting to come through why dont you just open your portal and see for yourself sal just explained that we could be wasting a full powerup and we cant risk doing that maddy shrugged anyway wouldnt you want to check first this is the cretaceous era right that means dinosaurs id want to know the coast is clear of trexes first dont you the old man glanced at forby and the man shook his head quickly taking a few photos first sounds like a pretty good move to me sir cartwright laughed nervously uh i guess youre right ok well do it your way just get a move on before those hunters down the beach find a railway arch in the middle of their jungle chapter million years bc jungle the three girls had revived the smouldering fire the dried brittle moss that seemed to carpet every boulder and rock made perfect kindling and already a thick column of smoke was drifting up into the evening sky liam felt a little happier now fire had seemed to keep those creatures at bay during the last few nights that theyd been out on their errand they seemed to have a healthy respect for it actually to be more precise a morbid fear of it he looked up across the twilit clearing it had got dark very quickly he wondered how the others were doing with keisha surely they must have found her by now if those pack hunters really had felled that tree and made their way across then he was surprised theyd allowed her to live he was considering that point when he heard two sounds at the same time one a faroff scream shrill and terrifying that rattled around the clearing like a gunshot and the other the sound of approaching trainers slapping the hard ground he exchanged a hurried glance with the girls and with becks as she stopped fiddling with their damaged windmill and snapped erect like a spooked meerkat help he heard edwards voice through the gathering gloom and then a moment later picked out of that gloom the dancing outline of his pale tshirt edward whats up the boy joined him gasping and looking anxiously back over his shoulder theyre hhere theyre here liam followed his gaze and saw nothing across the clearing just the dark outline of the apron of jungle where are the others the boy ignored his question his eyes wide with terror ththeyre hhere theyre hhere liam grasped his arm firmly edward what about the others the boy looked at him dead he replied all dead oh god look gasped laura she was pointing across the clearing where a mere second ago hed seen only jungle now he saw a line of the creatures approaching them cautiously spreading out like beaters for a hunting party he quickly estimated thirty maybe forty of them all sizes the whole pack jayzus in the middle of the line he thought he recognized one of them in particular the one hed seen in the jungle barking orders to the others their leader liam said becks stepping back from the windmill to join him and the others near the smoking fire now beginning to take hold and crackle and spark do you see the middle one he knew what she was referring to the one in the middle the pack leader was holding one of their spears in its claws he nodded like my adaptive ai she continued the species has observed our behaviour and learned from it he swallowed nervously back to the palisade we need to go now negative i must stay what he looked at her this location has been probed in the last twentyfour hours she nodded towards their broken windmill there are decaying particles in the vicinity of the interference device they may scan again at any moment she was right of course utterly barking mad but quite right all right all right he uttered watching the approaching hominids closing the gap slowly you four he said to the others get inside the wall and wait there what are you going to do asked edward he really had no idea just then some notion of holding out beside the campfire back to back with becks until until what until theyve finally worn her down and jump her then turn on me but there was a slight chance wasnt there a slight chance maddy and sal were going to sweep this place again at any moment and if they did this might be their last chance to flag the signal to tell them they were right here the alternative hiding inside their flimsy palisade until these creatures finally managed to gnaw their way through the twine pull aside a couple of the logs from the wall and get in he shuddered theres a return window coming he said its coming soon becks and me need to be out here waiting for it you four will be safer inside ill call for you when it opens now just go i want to stay said edward picking up one of their hatchets from a pile of cut wood beside the fire the other three nodded well ffight them ttogether whispered laura her teeth chattering noisily jasmine looked across at the palisade twenty yards away beyond the flickering pool of light from the fire theyll find a way in anyway liam looked at the creatures now almost entirely encircling them maintaining their cautious distance all right perhaps youre right he uttered becks howre we gonna do this recommendation i need to be in the vicinity of the interference device in order to detect any precursor particles arriving liam nodded yes yes rright we should hold the ground over there he reached down towards the fire and pulled out a branch the end of it flickered with flames everyone grab a torch they dont like fire the others followed suit then moved together in a tight huddle away from the reassuring glow of the campfire towards their contraption a dozen yards beyond the growing pall of amber firelight the creatures followed them silently padding across the soft ground watching them and ever so subtly closing the distance around them you back off screamed laura at them waving her flaming stick the creatures hissed warbled and mewed at that one of the smaller ones attempting a copy of her shaking voice yoo bak offfff becks turned to liam this location has just been scanned again there are several hundred new particles liam felt a surge of hope oh cmon why dont they just get on with it and open a bleedin window becks cocked her head she had no answer all of a sudden the creature holding the spear barked in a croaky voice and as one the creatures surged forward towards them oh my god oh my god screamed laura recommendation use your spears to chapter new york the best part of an hour passed in silence with maddy sal and cartwright gathered around the monitors watching a progress bar slowly inch across one of the screens and an empty directory slowly fill with lowresolution jpg files forby meanwhile stood beside the doorway cranked up a couple of feet gazing at the jungle world outside theyre still hunting those beach pigs or whatever those things are he called out softly good replied cartwright absently how much longer maddy shrugged you can see the progress bar yourself cant you its nearly there the old man made a face if its anything like the windows i got at home nearly there can mean another five minutes or another five hours this is an operating system from sometime in the s said maddy it sure aint gonna be windows the progress bar suddenly lurched forward to a hundred per cent and bobs dialogue box appeared process complete bob can you do some sort of slideshow affirmative images are taken one every five minutes a monitor to the left of them flickered to life revealing a small pixelated image of green and blue maddy squinted at the image what is that jungle said sal thats what it is jungle and some sky forby joined them around the desk yeah thats a jungle i think a second image appeared almost identical to the first a couple of pixel blocks had changed tone slightly is this as clear as the images get asked cartwright affirmative the pinhole and image data size has been kept to a minimum to conserve on energy consumption all we need is to see enough pixels change to indicate something moving around the area right said sal correct sal can you play through these slides a little faster please bob affirmative maddy increasing display rate times ten the next slide came up just the same as the last and another an undecipherable flicker show of green and blue pixels they watched in silence until approximately midway through the complexion of the image suddenly changed with a mass of dark pixels whoa stop said maddy she studied the shape onscreen whats that that looks like a person said forby see thats a shoulder and an arm sal cocked her head and frowned it doesnt look right what time in their day is this image bob half past two in the afternoon said sal give us the next image bob another dark image appeared onscreen the blue pixels of sky and green of jungle almost entirely gone somebody standing right in the middle of the portal location for about five minutes mumbled maddy to herself she looked at sal thats got to be the support unit shes sensed a tachyon particle and shes hanging around for another sal shook her head maybe but the shape of the body looks all kind of funny to me oh come on its a one hundred by one hundred pixel image everythings going to look all funny she shook her head again im not sure it could be anything it could be some animal bob next image another image flickered up and this time the dark mass of pixels was gone leaving the image the same even mix of blue and green squares maddy grabbed a pen from the desk and scribbled the time of on a scrap of paper well ok we know someone was hanging around then weve got one possible window lets get on with the slideshow and see what else we get once more the images began to flicker onscreen one after another a second apart the blue pixels of the sky slowly changing hue from bright blue to a rose colour its evening said cartwright helpfully the sequence continued with the sky pixels slowly reddening in colour and the jungles light green becoming a deeper darker green until all of a sudden in the middle of the image they saw a single dot of bright orange stop all four of them craned forward to get a better look thats fire isnt it said forby a flame sal nodded yeah someone starting a campfire maybe fire right uttered cartwright and the only thing that can make a fire back then is going to be human maddy tapped her chin thoughtfully yup so maybe this is a more reliable candidate than the other what time is this image bob give me the next image the orange pixel became a dozen pixels and half the screen was filled by a vertical block of black pixels in the top left corner they could just make out the sky the pink evening becoming a deep purple with the onset of dusk someones standing right there again and that thing doesnt look as weird as the earlier one said sal maddy looked at her how can you tell screw up your eyes a bit maddy it sort of blurs the pixels slightly you can make out shapes more easily a campfire and someone standing right there said cartwright looks like the best time so far yes she replied absently what do you think bob this image looks most probable quickly run through the rest the slideshow flickered through the last sixtyeight images one image per second a juddering animation of time the fire slowly dwindling dying and vanishing the sky darkening until the final few dozen images were simply a sequence of black pixels sequence complete looks like we have a winner said cartwright can we now proceed he looked up at forby you know before those hunters come knocking on our door ok lets begin powering up bob affirmative cartwright stood up straight his arms caressing a stiff back so what happens next he glanced at the large perspex tube theyre going to appear inside that she shook her head and pointed to a circle of chalk scrawled across the concrete floor there you and forby need to stand well clear of that cartwrights man stepped away from the table and faced the circle unslinging his assualt rifle in readiness maddy turned to regard both men id be happier if mr forby could take his finger off the trigger cartwright smiled of course he nodded at his man you can stand down forby but just stay alert all right forby nodded slackening his grip and lowering the barrel of his gun chapter million years bc jungle liam lashed out with his hatchet swinging the serrated metal blade in one hand and probing and prodding with his bamboo spear in the other but the creatures dodged back with graceful agility keeping their eyes on the weapons the fire nearby had taken a firm hold of the branches that had been thrown on top of it occasional tongues of flame lashed up into the almost dark sky and upward cascades of sparks danced like fireflies the flickering light the warmth from the campfire and the dancing flames on the ends of their torches were causing the hominids probing attack to falter go away screamed laura prodding the flaming end of her branch towards the nearest of them becks meanwhile had managed to kill one of them and severely wound another she could move forward with the same sudden speed as these things catching them off balance the wounded creature now thrashing around on the ground had lost a limb to one vicious roundhouse sweep of her hatchet the creature shed managed to grasp hold of moments ago had had its fragile spine snapped over her knee for her efforts shed received a deep gash down one thigh her left leg was red with her own blood soaking the sock rolled over the edge of her combat boot almost black the wound was already clotting but liam couldnt help notice how much blood shed lost in that one sudden crimson gush and worried whether her engineered body was capable of replacing that blood with the same efficiency as it could staunch a wound the creatures probed and circled clacking teeth and claws and mewling like foxes occasionally testing them with a lunge and snap of jaws so far the six of them were doing better than liam could have hoped holding them back but then he realized there was patient thinking going on behind what these creatures were up to wearing us down thats all theyre doing wearing us down his eyes picked through the lean olivecoloured hides the flickering chitinous teeth until he found the pack leader holding that spear and looking strangely human because of that if we got him yes if becks could somehow be fast enough to reach out past the others and grab him and snap his neck in her hands then the others would surely panic and run he had a spear in his hand he realized he could at least have a go the pack leader was only fourteen or fifteen feet away and unlike the others circling in that strange bobbing way he stood perfectly still watching them with keen studious eyes liam dropped his hatchet at his feet what are you doing yelled jasmine gonna get that one there he said nodding towards broken claw he steadied his balance on his back leg lined up the creature staring at him with cockedhead curiosity down the length of the bamboo shaft and then hurled it like a javelin a straight pointtopoint throw instead of an arced trajectory he surprised even himself with his accuracy and would probably have caught the thing square in its narrow chest had not another smaller one bobbed in the way unintentionally the sharp tip of the bamboo punched into its long bony skull and the creature crumpled to the ground with a short brittle scream that sounded almost like the wail of a human child liam winced and cursed that hed not got the leader and now they were down to one spear out of the black one of the smaller hominids suddenly ducked down low and swiped with a claw knocking akira off balance her leg buckled and with a thin yelp she dropped heavily into the dirt winded and worn out she struggled to get up yet more spindlethin arms emerged from the gloom and clawed digits wrapped tightly round her ankles and wrists no she screamed her pale face just two wide eyes and her mouth an o of horror within a second two beats of a pounding heart theyd dragged her struggling form out of the pall of flickering light her screaming voice smothered muffled and then brutally silenced becks took advantage of a careless incursion and lunged forward again sweeping her blade and missing as the creatures leaped once more back out of her range we cant keep this up said laura not all not all nnight i know replied liam just then something whistled past his cheek whuh he looked down and saw the shaft of a bamboo spear rattling and flexing on the ground he looked up at the emptyhanded pack leader and understood oh no he gasped you see that it threw it threw it back good going liam you just taught them how to toss a javelin ah jayzus if they start throwin missiles at us well be in trouble llike were not already muttered laura lashing out at one of the smaller creatures bobbing too close liam watched the leader moving around the rear of his pack those yellow eyes no longer on him but flitting across the ground looking for something looking for another spear to throw information beckss voice suddenly cut across the clacking and mewling i am detecting a burst of precursor particles is is that good asked jasmine liam nodded yes oh jayzus yes he turned to becks thats a window right tell me its a window and not another probe affirmative the configuration suggests an imminent window yes oh yes he grinned breathlessly we must move out of this space said becks they will not open the window until it is completely clear right together said liam keep together back to back move towards the fire the five of them backed up towards each other until they were almost bumping together then becks stepped a little ahead swiping and spinning a hatchet in each hand with balletlike precision at the creatures they wisely backed away from her creating a path for them to shuffle along in her wake enough barked becks after theyd moved half a dozen yards across the clearing towards the increasing heat and flickering light of the campfire she turned round to face them the extraction area is now unobstruct it was then a sharpened tip of bamboo erupted through her abdomen ripping through her flesh and the tattered material of her black crop top becks glanced casually down at the bloody tip becks gasped liam with a blur of movement she reached round and grabbed the creature that had skewered her from behind she flipped it over her shoulder on to the ground in front of her its claws viciously flailed at her shredding the skin on her forearm into tatty red ribbons with a savage jerk she twisted its long head the creatures yellow eyes and leathery black tongue bulged under the sudden tension in its slender neck they heard a crackling sound and then the thing stopped squirming becks you ok cried liam negative the damage is significant she replied looking down at the point of the spear still protruding from her waist one of her legs wobbled beneath her and she dropped to her knees becks hang in there yelled liam then they all felt it the solid push of displaced air liam looked behind him and saw a shimmering sphere the faint dancing pattern of a reassuringly familiar place the archway look thats it thats the window right now in this instant there were no creatures between them and their way home go liam yelled for a moment the two remaining girls and edward stared at him unsure what he meant by that now he screamed his voice breaking there run for it go go go laura nodded more than happy to obey she turned on her heels and sprinted for the window jasmine followed suit edward lingered what about now screamed liam edward turned and sprinted after the girls liam turned to becks come on she struggled to her feet unsteadily information i have lost significant levels of blood just shuddup he snapped sliding his hands under her armpits and hefting her up she staggered to her feet leave liam she ordered him protect edward chan liam shot a glance over his shoulder he could see laura hovering just outside the spherical boundary of the window hesitating to step in between her and them edward and jasmine sprinting goddammit go through he shouted go thr aghhhhhh he suddenly felt a searing pain through his leg and saw that one of the smaller creatures had grasped his shin the razorsharp edge of its claws sliced through his shorts through his skin and now grated against his shin bone becks swiped with the hatchet still in her left hand and cut through the creatures thin wrist its claws and its hand were still attached to liams lower leg like the jaws of some tenacious decapitated soldier ant despite the grating agony in his leg he dragged becks with him she barely able to drunkenly stagger and yet still swinging her blade in powerfully vicious yet groggy illaimed arcs that thwacked and cracked against the hungrily grasping reach of those creatures determined enough to reach out for them around him liam could hear a mixture of frustrated snarls and startled whimpers and a sudden highpitched scream that sounded unmistakably human his mind solely on dragging becks heavy despite her slight frame he could only fleetingly hope that it wasnt edward chans voice hed just heard mission priority becks began to chastise him just keep hitting the bloody things he bellowed back at her she shut up and obliged swinging a booted foot out at a long bony jaw getting ready to snap down on her bloodcaked thigh her boot made heavy contact and the skull spun on its turtle neck like a skittle a handful of toothpicksized teeth whizzing out into the dark ten seconds later ten seconds that to liam could easily have been a minute or an hour ten seconds of dragging hacking swinging kicking and screaming and all of a sudden he felt the hair on his head lift in response to the warm soup of energy and excited particles around him over his shoulder he could see sal actually see her shape dancing and undulating as if seen through a thin veil of oil and other shapes edward laura standing beside her he could see the flickering blue fizzing archway light that normally irritated him so much as he read on his bunk we did it he found himself yelling as his foot seemed to lose touch with solid ground and he felt that all too familiar nauseating sensation of falling chapter new york he felt his face smack against a hard concrete floor the dead weight of becks landing heavily on the top of his back knocking the air out of his lungs good god he heard from somewhere nearby a male voice he didnt recognize while his eyes were still seeing stars he could feel becks struggling to lift herself off his back he heard the pounding rasp of laboured breath nearby presumably hopefully edward and the other two he could hear the faint muted chug of the generator in the back room and through the stillopen portal hovering a couple of feet above the tangled pile of himself and becks the faroff sounds of a jungle night stirring to life and the clickclacking and mewling of those things getting louder closer ummpph closhhhh the ortal he mumbled into the floor his bloodied lips still mushed against the hard concrete as becks struggled to lift her dead weight off him liam is that you under there maddys voice umpph umm yeshhh he mumbled closhhh the leedin ortal then all of a sudden he felt another heavy load land on his back and the excruciating pain of three sharp blades digging deep into his left shoulderblade what on earth is that another unfamiliar voice another mans voice the weight was gone as quickly as it had arrived and he heard the skittering of claws across the concrete floor and the startled bark of one or two of those creatures echoing off the arched brick ceiling my god forby shoot it shoot it the piercing scream of a girl he couldnt be sure who then with a rattling sigh becks finally flopped off the side of his back her pale face spattered with dark dots of drying blood thudding to the floor beside his her grey eyes stared lifelessly back at him as if looking at something far far away he managed to lift himself up on to his elbows grimacing at the sharp pain in his shoulder and his head still spinning from the impact of the heavy landing he attempted to get his first glance at what was going on around him two of the creatures had managed to follow them through and were now darting in confusion and panic one way and then the other across the archway floor he spotted two men he didnt recognize one old in a rumpled suit with a loosened tie dangling round his throat like a hangmans noose the other man was younger with buzzcut sandy hair and an armyfit physique beneath what looked like a baggy lightgreen boiler suit he raised a gun where did they go snapped maddy they heard something fall off a shelf in a dark corner of the archway and roll noisily across the floor over there with trained quick precision forby squinted down the weapons barrel and flipped the nightsight of his scope on a soft green glow poured across his face as he slowly panned the weapon around the archway then up towards the curved brick ceiling ahh i see one liam followed the direction of his gaze and thought he could just about make out some dark shape moving among a crisscross of old rusting pipes and loops of electrical flex ageold dust and the grit from crumbling bricks and mortar trickled down past the softly fizzing glow of the ceiling light giving the hapless creatures position away the man fired two aimed shots in quick succession the creature screamed then plummeted to the floor bringing down a small flurry of dust and grit with it it squirmed and screamed and drummed arms and legs against the floor until the young man put a third shot into its long skull as the echo of the last shot rattled around the brick walls liam looked around him he could see edward and laura huddled together by the displacement machines perspex tube and sal and maddy beside the computer desk all of them looking from one dark recess to another listening intently for the sounds of movement wheres the other one whispered sal the man with the gun placed a finger to his lips to hush her hiding he whispered well for christs sake find him forby hissed the older man liam watched as forby stepped across the floor into the middle of the archway continuing to slowly pan his gun studying every nook and cranny around until finally he came to a halt aiming at the arched recess where their bunk beds were uhhuh i think hes skulking under there he squatted down low and pumped his finger a single shot danced and ricocheted under liams cot sparking against the metal frame it was then that something dropped down from above past the ceiling light on to forbys back a blur of movement and flashing of claws and teeth a bright arc of crimson heellp m his voice was cut off as the creatures claws flailed at his neck he dropped the gun as he staggered and struggled to wrestle the thing off his back liam picked himself up and scrambled across the floor reaching out for the heavy assault rifle as forbys legs buckled and he dropped to his knees blood spraying from the multiple ragged wounds across his face and head the creature leaped off his shoulders and darted towards the shutter door as forby flopped the rest of the way to the ground quite dead liam raised the gun and pulled the trigger the gun kicked his shoulder as he emptied the clip with a protracted and unaimed volley that produced a dozen showers of sparks and brickred plumes of dust with the gun angrily clicking in his hands he finally eased his finger off the trigger and peered through the gunsmoke at the inert body of the other creature now a shredded mess jesus whispered the old man his croaky voice shaking chapter new york they stared at the naked body floating amid the pinkred soup of liquid in the plastic cylinder will the support unit survive asked sal becks said liam quietly his voice little more than a gentle croak her name is becks the soft glow of red light coming from the base of the birthing tube was the only illumination in the back room it was enough for maddy to see the lost expression of posttraumatic stress on liams face shell live said maddy with the hesitant smile of someone not really sure bob said their combat frames can sustain roughly a seventyfive per cent blood loss and still be able to recover from that given enough time she glanced at the shredded remnants of the female units left lower arm almost all the soft tissue had been clawed away leaving a skeletal forearm surrounded by tatters of skin and tendon that floated and swayed in the gloop like so many ends of frayed rope unlike forby said cartwright sombrely im sorry said maddy he seemed like you know like a good guy the old man nodded thoughtfully the best the very best he sighed family man too the only sound in the back room was the gentle purring of the tubes filtration system maddy had shut down the generator to conserve the half a tank of fuel they had left there was no need for the generator to be chugging away right now a row of steady green leds showed the displacement machinery was fully charged and ready to use again shed shut everything else down the computer systems the lights the other birthing tubes and the fridge containing the other embryos theyd keep in their cryotubes for a few more hours without refrigeration so how long asked laura wiping her nose on the back of her hand you know until shes all better again maddy looked up at the girl she could imagine her in another time confident and popular in her high school a batontwiddling cheerleader everyones favourite always invited to parties always surrounded by friends and acolytes that texan accent the confident bray of someone whod never need to question her place in the world well she didnt look quite so much like a future homecoming queen now even in this muted light maddy could see how badly affected she was by the portals corrosion effect her face looked ghostly pale the flesh around her eyes dark and it seemed her nose was still leaking a steady trickle of blood a ruptured blood vessel somewhere inside that quite possibly might never heal the boy edward chan seemed to have fared only slightly better apparently according to chan thered been another girl with them but shed been jumped by one of those things just before she could reach the portal if shed suffered the same fate as forby then maddy could only hope her death had been as mercifully quick although after what shed witnessed only half an hour ago merciful felt entirely like the wrong word to use she watched chans large round eyes staring at the mush of organic soup at the foggy figure of the support unit inside both these two chan and the girl seemed to be in a deep state of shock well beyond grieving for a lost classmate liam said thered been others sixteen of them had survived the blast back in time only these two plus liam and becks had made it god knows what theyve been through how long asked chan again about four and a half hours maddy replied four and a half hours and her condition should be stable shell have replenished enough blood to function again what about her arm maddy shrugged i dont know whether this healing thing actually regrows limbs and stuff bob our computer system just told me shed be able to repopulate blood cells well see i guess liams eyes came back from far away and met hers you said function again she nodded she has to go back liam you know that there are loose ends that need fixing the others looked at her it was clear to her that she was the only one doing any strategic thinking here thinking beyond the moment thats your job maddy team strategist remember she has to go back and correct what happened what it is thats made the present the way it is its those creatures isnt it said cartwright the ones that came through your portal theyre the thing thats different maddy turned to liam liam is that oh my god she hadnt noticed it before in fact she had but shed thought it was a streak of dust or perhaps a dusting of some exotic jungle pollen looking at liam right now even in the dim crimson glow of the birthing tube she could see a shock of white hair on his left temple and his left eye the white of it mottled with the weblike blur of a burst blood vessel yes he said after a few moments not registering the look on her face yes those things they learned a few tricks from us theres more asked sal he nodded yeah thirty or forty i suppose a pack of them his eyes remained on the outline of beckss form curled up like a foetus in her sleep vulnerablelooking just a teenage girl she managed to kill some of them but the rest are back there maddy looked at sal and cartwright then those hunters across the river they must be distant ancestors theyre somehow linked right the long heads cartwright nodded its an unusual configuration he stroked his chin no its a unique configuration maddy had lifted the shutter door briefly after theyd seen to becks and shown liam and the other two the jungle that now replaced new york the hunters were no longer probing the riverbank for mud creatures and had returned to the settlement on the far side of the broad river theyre descendants liam she said distant very distant descendants and their ancestors cut in cartwright must have learned something from you something that enabled them to survive and prosper something some sort of skill that helped them survive the kt event whatever wiped out the dinosaurs liam nodded slowly she could see hed worked that much out already so someone has to go back and kill the whole pack yes said maddy reaching a hand out and holding his arm gently they cant be allowed to live and develop any sort of intelligence that could save them they should have died out with all the other dinosaurs ok he took a deep breath ok ill go no she said a little too quickly she tried not to let her stare at his bloodshot eye linger not you liam you need rest if not me then who no one else the support unit becks he shook his head no shell take days to recover surely and shell not be able to face them all on her own theyll kill her to be sure her she she held his arm listen to me liam she nodded at the birthing tube i know youve been through a lot together but remember its just a support unit in there a meat robot a tool for the job thats all it is its expendable ill go with her he said no maddy shook her head firmly no you cant go back there again why he doesnt know does he he hasnt looked into a mirror he hasnt realized how much damage going so far back in time has already done to him she wondered why he hadnt yet noted the condition of the girl and chan both looked like people suffering from advanced radiation sickness but then from his time liam wouldnt know anything about radiation sickness perhaps he attributed the bleeding noses the pallid complexion to shock perhaps he was too much in shock himself to have noticed because youre too valuable to lose liam we need you here we need you added sal and her face dipped out of range of the soft peach glow and in the darkness they heard movement a scrape the heavy thud of something metallic and the rattle and tinkle of a buckle her face returned and she held up something that glinted in the dull light and shed have this gun liam not just a bamboo stick maddy nodded you saw how good it was earlier highcalibre mp assault rifle said cartwright itll mince those monsters up no problem well give her a few hours to rebuild herself ok ill uhh ill go and see how many clips of ammo forby has had said cartwright maddy pressed out a smile and nodded you do that she turned back to liam watching the floating body of becks she could see he felt something for the support unit that theyd bonded in the past that this time unlike last time if the support unit fell thered be no one to retrieve its ai no one to dig the computer out of its cranium and bring it back be the leader maddy theres no discussion here its decided sorry liam she has to go she said forcefully thats how it is she has to do this we need new york back we need our power feed back before we run out of fuel anyway she glanced at the silhouette of cartwright shuffling cautiously out through the doorway by the light of a windup torch she lowered her voice anyway theres going to be one more job for you to do before weve dug ourselves out of this whole freakin hole chapter new york liam watched the sun setting across the river picking out thin skeins of smoke from the settlement perched on the muddy banks on the far side he saw several pinpricks of light in the middle of the round huts fire one of the earliest markers of intelligence he wondered how many aeons ago this descendant species had learned they could control it use it a far cry from the primitive animal fear for it demonstrated by their ancestors he heard the shutter rattle as maddy stooped under it and joined him outside hi she said how are you feeling tired squatting against the outside brick wall of their archway watching the jungle turn dark and the skys rich palette change from crimson to violet he realized how utterly spent he felt finally after two weeks of nervous tension two weeks of fearing something primal savage and hungry could snatch him away at any time here he was somewhere safe at last somewhere he could close his eyes for a moment and actually properly rest shes nearly ready said maddy were prepping the portal to take her back to one minute after we closed the last one those creatures should still all be gathered there scratching their heads and wondering where you went how is she the arm looks like its begun repairing itself i noticed theres some new muscle tissue no skin yet i presume that regrows at some point anyway sals bound her arm and hand in bandages to protect it how is she he asked again can she do it she says she can operate to fortyseven per cent functional capacity maddy smirked and shes really rather pleased about the weapon liam laughed softly just like bob they could be brother and sister well they are i suppose true liam nodded towards the village it feels wrong in a way what what were doing killing the rest of that pack i mean look what they became he shook his head and laughed whats so funny im almost proud of them so i am theyre like i suppose i feel like theyre sort of my creation we showed them how to build a bridge how to use a spear and after lord knows how many thousands of years millions actually millions of years theyve become this a brandnew intelligent race and here we are going to wipe them all out whats that word for it genocide aye thats it like that hitler tried to do to the jews and were going to do it to those things theyre not just dumb animals maddy they were clever back in the jungle you could see that very clever and now here they are just as smart as us humans no liam theyre not something that old man cartwright said what ask yourself this just how long have they been at this stage of development hmm they could have got this far canoes spear huts an all millions of years ago and yet and yet this is as far as they ever got she gazed at the distant village otherwise why arent they walking around in smart suits and talking on cell phones he shrugged maybe they did once maybe millions of years ago they were that smart and this place was a big city like new york and what they chose to become savages again who knows maybe they had some sort of war maybe they once had an incredible civilization that eventually collapsed into ruins or some doomsday weapon wiped them out but for a few poor bloody survivors maddy nodded its possible i guess a lot can happen in sixtyfive million years aye and whos to say it doesnt one day happen to us too eh and soon she looked at him kramers time fosters time perhaps you remember the things he told us about the future the dark times ahead all that global warming the flooding pollution and the poisoned seas the starving billions she did it was a future shed thought she was beginning to see in her lifetime that big meeting in copenhagen that was supposed to be the last best chance for the world to agree on how to stop global warming it had failed miserably she wondered whether historians from midway through the twentyfirst century would point to that day as the very beginning of the end well thats the future whether we like it or not liam and its our job to fight to keep it that way he nodded hmm but do you ever wonder maddy wonder what he looked at her with his bloodshot eye and thin shock of snowwhite hair and for a moment he looked both old and young at the same time do you wonder whether that future the one foster told us all about whether thats the right future to fight for i dunno i suppose we just have to trust him that it is the sun dipped behind the far horizon of trees behind the thin lines of campfire smoke from inside the arch they could hear the voices of the others sal helping the support unit becks get ready shes been given orders to kill them all then destroy your camp burn everything so theres nothing left behind to leave fossil traces well know if shes successful maddy nodded out at the jungle when this all goes and we get new york back and she lowered her voice a little and the tricky situation we were stuck right in the middle of just before jungleland arrived cartwright she nodded so he cocked a brow im presuming he and the poor fella with the gun are the chaps who found our message not exactly it was found a lot lot earlier in the s apparently but cartwright runs this little government agency she snorted an agency a bit like ours i guess small and secret its job for the last sixty years has been to be a custodian of your message and to finally make contact with us in and he came knocking oh he came knocking all right just before the last time wave we had men with guns standing guard outside in the backstreet in fact they had several areas of the neighbourhood sealed up with roadblocks and soldiers and stuff helicopters overhead and everything quite a big deal youd have loved it my fault liam looked guilty sorry about that she shook her head dont be you had to send the message there was no other way we would have found you sal was calling out for her it was time thing is liam she said hurriedly we have to be ready to move and move quickly if becks is successful well get all of that situation right back in our faces well be right where we were so im going to need to send you back to make sure they dont get your message dinosaur times oh no not that far she managed to stop herself saying because that would probably finish you off no itll be the second of may you need to prevent some kids from finding a particular chunk of rock he smiled and cartwright and his agency will never have existed she was ducking down under the shutter when she paused well his agency might not exist or maybe it will but it will be busy with some other secret its trying to keep from the american people right when that time wave comes liam well need cartwright standing outside when i turn on our time field his life will be rewritten along with the rest of the corrected reality hell have no memory of all of this liam bent down and looked under the shutter and into the archway he could see forbys dark boots poking out of the end of the blanket theyd wrapped his body in and what about him forby not sure if his body is outside the field i suppose he gets to live again doing whatever job he was doing before cartwright and his agency suddenly winked into existence the point is whatever that means for him and the old man we wont have a backstreet full of spooks with guns well be back to normal she grinned up at him which would really be quite nice true but do we not still have to get edward chan back home one thing at a time she sighed come on lets send becks on her way liam followed her under the shutter and then cranked it down after him he rejoined maddy and the others gathered around the computer desk he saw becks standing in the middle of them the assault rifle cradled in her arms one of them swathed in bandages up to her elbow how are you feeling he asked over the hubbub of other voices questions from cartwright and the kids that maddy was busy trying to field as she configured the return timestamp i am fine liam what about that spear wound that looked pretty bad so it did are you sure youre fit enough to go my organic diagnostic systems indicate my kidney was ruptured and is no longer functioning the organ can be repaired later she added it will not affect my performance your arm my arm is operable ok said maddy ive set it to one minute after the other window therell still be background tachyon particles around from the previous window but ive moved the location thirty feet away so there shouldnt be any disruptive effect on your arrival portal ok affirmative you understand the mission parameters kill all the reptile hominids destroy all evidence of our camp return window set for two hours after arrival maddy nodded you got it and of course remember to bring the gun back with you one of beckss dark eyebrows arched slowly well duh she said flatly sal giggled thats cool maddy grinned at liam looks like shes been doing some learning of her own he nodded all right we havent got time to fill the tube shes going back dry stand clear of that circle on the ground she pointed to the circle of chalk and within it a patch of concrete floor darker than the rest she sighed were gonna need to fill in the floor once again after all this is finished the others pulled warily back and becks wandered over and planted her feet inside the circle her knees bent ready to react at a moments notice the gun loaded cocked and raised the assault rifles butt pressed firmly against her shoulder and ready to fire be careful becks said liam we want you back safely she nodded hesitantly affirmative liam oconnor i will be careful are we all set asked maddy affirmative all right bob maddy turned back to the desk mic on my countdown ten nine eight the archway filled with the sound of power surging into the displacement machine the green leds winking off one after another as they indicated the drain of stored energy a threeyarddiameter sphere of shimmering air suddenly enveloped becks the ceiling fluorescent light dimmed and flickered seven six five her cool grey eyes turned to rest on liam and she smiled uncertainly four three two good luck he mouthed unsure whether she could read that in the flickering fizzing light one and then she was gone air whistled past them all to fill the sudden vacuum created wow whispered edward now we wait said maddy she shot a glance at liam and we make sure were ready chapter million years bc jungle becks emerged from the surrounding sphere of undulating air and dropped the last few inches with a soft thud of boots on hard mud crouched ready for action her eyes panned across the firelit clearing a dancing flickering impression of hell the creatures had converged in the centre of the area picking through the shelters the palisade watching the campfire hungrily consuming the last of the branches that had been stacked on it a knot of them were gathered around the space where only a minute ago the return window had opened they were examining the ground a cluster of low ferns nearby their heads cocked with confusion and bewilderment like curious crows studying road kill none of them had yet noticed her standing there she had a thirtyround ammo clip and in the blink of an eye had organized the order in which she was going to drop the targets larger male creatures first the first rapidly fired halfdozen shots echoed across the clearing like so many dried and brittle branches snapping and five out of six of her targets dropped like leather sacks of bone and meat the one shed missed had bobbed unpredictably the shot skimming across the top of his head the other creatures froze where they were uncertain as to what the rapid cracks of gunfire actually meant becks took advantage of the moment of stillness and confusion and selected another six targets all the larger males again but this time the muzzle flash of her gun had attracted their attention and they began to bound towards her she killed four and wounded another before their shortlived charge faltered they drew up a dozen yards away and fanned out snapping and snarling beyond them she could see the others females and cubs being herded away from harm by a large male she recognized it as the packs leader a claw from one of its four digits missing on its left arm it was holding one of their spears waving it around and using it to prod and cajole the pack away into the darkness assessment primary target the pack leader the alpha male logic and observation dictated that that particular creature was the one whod been learning from them the shrewd one the clever one whose genes and unique acquired knowledge were going to pass onwards to its offspring in only a few nanoseconds of siliconbased analysis she realized that the one creature she had to be absolutely certain of killing was the one with the missing claw she was striding forward like an automaton as she fired another rapid succession of single shots killing half of the creatures bobbing and snarling in front of her those still standing turned and fled the noise and the muzzle flash were as startling to them as the sudden inexplicable death it seemed to deal out the entire pack was in motion now scattering like birds startled by a handclap but her eyes remained on the back of the alpha male she swung the assault rifle towards it aimed and fired the shot spun the creature off its feet chapter new york maddy looked over at cartwright he was with the two children and sal standing beside the halfraised shutter entrance staring out at the jungle and eagerly waiting to see the spectacular sight of a new reality arriving from a distant past sal was doing a great job keeping them all over there telling them all about time ripples and waves and her job as an observer you understand what youve got to do she asked liam quietly he nodded but are you sure its the right date well i hope so he said your fossilized message was discovered on that day i presume hes not lying ive got the glen rose national park entered in as the location im sure he mentioned a river called the paluxy river so thats what ive put in and youre looking for the two boys that found it boys how old i dont know you know boys she shrugged boy age i guess liam glanced furtively over her shoulder at the others well then what do they look like she ran her hand tiredly through her frizzy hair jeez how the hell am i supposed to know she muttered irritably then immediately felt guilty and angry with herself she looked at liam his bloodshot eye the streak of white hair and felt like a snappy cow im sorry she sighed i guess theyll look all excited and very pleased with themselves ok she turned towards the desk bob are we ready for a portal affirmative there is sufficient charge for this displacement ok she nodded all right she looked at liams face again pale like the other two but not as bad no nosebleeds no apparent nausea or any other apparent haemorrhaging you sure youre ok to go liam he nodded im fine so i am tired i could sleep for a year but im all right why not go in his place maddy look at him look at the damage that last portal did to him and now youre sending him through again she stilled that guilty voice in her head quickly she needed to be right here coordinating beckss and liams bringbacks it was all going to be rather tricky she wanted to tell him what she knew what foster had told her she wanted to tell him so that at least he could decide for himself if it was worth it killing himself slowly one corruption at a time shall we he said she pressed a digital watch into his hand six hours she said softly then glanced at the chalk circle and the concrete already gouged out of the floor in the middle liam understood he had six hours back in and then shed open the return window he casually ambled across the floor towards the circle as maddy silently initiated the countdown sequence the machinery began to hum there was no way to avoid that and the ceiling light flickered and dimmed she was hoping cartwright would be too engrossed in listening to sal and watching for the time wave to immediately notice something was going on but the wily old man spun round and looked back into the arch whats going on liam stepped smartly into the chalk circle just as a sphere of air began to twitch and fidget around him whats happ hang on whats his eyes widened where the hell is he going maddy ignored him cartwright reached into his jacket pocket no dont shoot shouted maddy realizing what he was going to do please cartwright pulled out his pistol straightened his arm and aimed stop it now i cant please i cant stop it dont sh he fired a single shot at liam just as the sphere wobbled and collapsed in on itself with a puff somervell county texas at the very same moment that liam landed on a riverbank of pebbles something whistled past his ear and off into the sky jayzusss he ducked and then looked around wondering what the hell that was he saw nothing just a narrow river rolling sedately along a shallow creek of sandycoloured rock small and meanlooking yew trees and arid tufts of sunbleached grass that hissed softly alongside the soothing gurgle of water perhaps a bird a bee a fly it could have been a fast one though his mind turned to more pressing matters which way to go he had no idea no idea at all other than to look out for a pair of boys he looked at the digital watch maddys shed set a countdown on it five hours and fiftynine minutes right he muttered to himself where do i start a midday sun beat down on his head as he stood there unsure which way to turn he decided before walking anywhere that he was going to mark the window location with a small cairn of rocks a dozen fistsized worn and rounded rocks stacked in a small pyramid big enough so that he wasnt going to walk right on past and miss it then caught on a lazy midday breeze that had the nearby yew trees stirring and hissing he heard the faint call of a voice and what sounded like a splash of water that way downstream he set off walking along the riverbank shingle and pebbles clattering underfoot for a moment he recalled an image of that huge sweeping bay and the calm prehistoric green sea spreading out to an infinite horizon on his right it was here right here an incredible tropical sea quite a breathtaking notion that in the vast dimensions of geological time even seas and oceans just like any other living creature had lifespans that came and went he heard voices again echoing up the creek the sound of children playing larking about chapter million years bc jungle becks followed the spatters of dark blood into the jungle by moonlight the streaks of blood were black and glistened wetly the trail didnt lead too far into the jungle fortunately if it had she suspected shed have been unable to follow it the moonlight was beginning to fail her blocked by the drooping leaves from the canopy trees above she heard them before she saw them the rattling breath of one snorting like a winded buffalo and a chorus of mewling voices that sounded like a pitiful choir of simpering children her eyes picked them out the creature shed managed to hit was curled up on the jungle floor around it an array of the smaller creatures females and cubs all pawed and stroked the wounded one as if somehow that would magically heal their pack leader she stepped forward until she was looking directly down at the creature with the broken claw the pack perhaps twenty of them here became quiet a forest of yellow eyes that glowed with soft fluorescence and narrowed with fear looked up at her help me the facsimile of a human voice came from one of the females becks recognized it as an attempt to duplicate the cries of the human called keisha a part of her computer mind calmly informed her that a mission parameter remained outstanding and could not be successfully flagged as completed until at the very least the wounded creature was confirmed dead but another part of her mind a very much smaller part a part that contributed thoughts as foggy sensations rather than runtime commands spoke to her just like me she remembered being born released from growth amid a cascading soup of warm liquid lying like this creature curled like a foetus on a hard floor feeling bewildered frightened confused an animal mind of sensations feelings but no words she squatted down to get a closer look at the creature the wound was in the middle of the creatures narrow chest and from the pulsing of inkblack blood down its olive skin was almost certainly going to prove to be fatal you will die she announced coldly and then realized talking to them was illogical and pointless these wild things were no more intelligent than monkeys but on the other hand it felt like another way of processing filtering her own thoughts giving words to that part of her mind that wasnt highdensity silicon wafer i am here to kill you she said this is a mission requirement the yellow eyes studied her silently perhaps those eyes were trying to communicate something pleading for mercy she stood up again and changed the clip in the assault rifle for a fresh one the mission voice had no time for such an irrational sentiment and gently cajoled her to proceed with the task complete mission terminate alpha male of species terminate remaining hominids optional retrieve all evidence of human habitation i am sorry she said she cocked her head curious thered been a strange effect on her voice it had fluttered ever so slightly it had actually made her sound more convincingly human shed sounded almost indistinguishable from the school students she and liam had spent the last fourteen days in the jungle with those three words really had sounded so very human for a moment she was almost tempted to say them once again instead she raised the rifle swiftly to her shoulder her bandaged finger slipped on to the trigger and beneath the dressing the recently vatgrown muscle tissue tightened and pulled a shot rang out her finger muscles released and pulled again and again and again by the time the last of the creatures flopped lifelessly across the body of broken claw the clip was empty and the barrel warm the jungle was still every nocturnal species stunned into silence by the rapid crack of gunfire for a few moments she listened to the shifting breeze the muted rumble of the nearby river i am sorry she said again and realized this time her voice sounded flat and emotionless as it always did she turned on her heels and headed back towards the remains of their abandoned camp new york where did you send him barked cartwright swinging the aim of his gun on to maddy i i jjust sent him back to help becks kill the youre lying he snapped honestly i he fired a shot past her head behind her one of the computer monitors exploded amid a shower of sparks and granules of glass really he said i wouldnt advise lying young lady i can put a bullet through your stomach right now and believe me when i say thats one of the most painful ways to go slow and very very painful he took a dozen steps towards her now ill try again where did you send him maddy swallowed nervously her eyes on the gun i just i maddy yelped sal somethings coming cartwright stopped where he was whats that he shouted back over his shoulder keeping his eyes firmly on the older girl did you feel it a tremor no he replied his eyes and aim still on maddy i didnt feel anything i felt something said edward oh my god the jungles changed said laura something different i dont know what something sal nodded the settlements gone its an early ripple the big change will follow cartwright cursed he desperately wanted to see this you he snapped at maddy waving his gun over there by the entrance now maddy nodded meekly and hurried across the archway to join the others standing in the entrance and looking out at the jungle cartwright joined them keeping a cautious few yards distance and holding his gun on them as he watched the evening jungle what happens next the big wave said sal youll feel dizzy just as it she looked at him her eyes round do you feel it now his eyes widened my god yes like an earth tremor on the horizon the orange stain of dusk was blotted out by what appeared to be a rolling bank of raincloud a storm front rushing in from the atlantic at an impossible speed what is that he gasped the wave whispered edward maddy nodded another reality it crossed over the island beyond the broad river and amid a churning soup of thick shimmering air realities mixed and became fleeting impossibilities amid the churning reality soup they saw the winking flickering outline of tall buildings warping and twisting and maddy thought she saw for a fleeting moment a swarm of creatures in the sky like gargoyles dragons a possible reality a possible species that in this correcting reality had no place existing for a mere heartbeat then erased then the wave was over the river and upon them the archway flexed and warped around them the ground beneath their feet momentarily dropping away becoming void then just like that they were staring at a brick wall ten feet opposite across a cobbled stone backstreet the rolledup tarpaulin with forbys corpse inside that theyd placed just outside the entrance was gone instead he was standing to one side of the entrance talking in hushed tones with two other armed men a spotlight flickered across the backstreet as overhead they heard the whupwhupwhup of a circling helicopter cartwrights jaw hung slack and open his gun arm lowered down to his side this is incredible isnt it said maddy forby looked up from his conversation whuh oh sir he looked perplexed as did the other two men i uh didnt hear the door opening you ok sir cartwrights face was still immobile still frozen with incredulity sir everything ok he looked at his man uh yes yes just fine alive once more a faint smile of relief stretched across his thin lips good to er its good to see you again forby forby frowned and nodded sir then he noticed edward and laura who are these cartwright shook his head gathering his confused wits ill ill explain later he turned to maddy and the others inside you lot lets close this door forby stepped forward but cartwright waved him back you best stay outside for now forby all right he flicked his gun at laura close the shutter she began to crank the handle but sal stepped in and pressed the green button its ok weve got power now the shutters clattered down as a small motor beside the door whined the old man took a moment to compose himself to try to make sense of what hed seen and what he may yet see before the night was through the shutters clattered down and the whining motor was silent all right he said presently all right so this means your friend and the cloned girl theyve been successful theyve killed those freaks in the past so that means no reptile hominids he nodded as he talked all right i get that i understand that cartwright interrupted maddy and and forbys alive now because because his eyes narrowed as he tried to make sense of things because what happened didnt happen no reptile monsters means he couldnt have been attacked but then thats just crazy that doesnt make any i mean i actually saw that thing rip his he was rambling cartwright said maddy again listen to me you need to hear something and he was dead he turned to look at the floor halfway across a pool of blood had congealed forbys blood i mean there look its his blood he was cartwright the old mans confused eyes darted from the blood back to maddy this new reality is still wrong she said this reality with you and forby and men outside and a helicopter buzzing overhead and your secret agency its all wrong too this is something else that should never have happened what his face creased with confusion your life said sal should be a very different one in our timeline in the correct timeline youve lived a different life to this maddy tried appealing to him with a friendly smile perhaps even a much better life i dunno with children grandchildren im not married he snapped i dont have children but see thats what im saying this agency is my wife this secret this secret time travel its my secret i know things that even our president doesnt i know time travels already happening thats what im married to this this knowledge thats my life he raised his gun again and aimed at the frown between maddys eyes and youre not going to take that away do you hear no one is going to take that from me chapter somervell county texas liam spotted them further up the river two boys one splashing around in the water the other perched on a shelf of rock sheltering from the scorching hot sun in a cool nook of shade neither had seen him yet his first instinct had been to call out to them to find out what theyd been doing so far today to ask them if theyd found anything interesting but then if they hadnt yet his intrusion on their day might alter what they did change the sequence of events for today and they might not make their discovery so he decided to lie low and watch he hunkered down in the shade of a yew tree and waited an hour passed another and another the sun was well past midday the shadows slowly shifting and lengthening he checked his watch again the countdown was telling him he had less than two hours to go he was beginning to wonder whether he was watching the wrong two boys and perhaps another several hundred yards up the river two different lads were right now cooing and marvelling over some incredible fossil writing theyd just discovered then the boy on the rock ledge called out something saul what he couldnt quite make out what the lad on the ledge said next but from where he was he could see the boy was turning something over and over in his hand the boy in the water saul didnt seem particularly interested content to continue paddling around in aimless circles the other frustrated at his companions lack of interest suddenly leaped off the ledge and into the river swimming across to join him in the shallows he showed saul what he had in his hands and among a garble of exchanged words liam made out two distinct ones look and message thats it then he pulled himself up grimacing at the stab of pins and needles in his feet and made his way towards them hey there lads he called out both of them turned to look at him hey there he said again trying to sound as friendly as possible and not frighten them off but as he drew closer he could see both of them regarded him warily hey its all right now im not going to eat you just saying hello is all im doing ma says we caint talk to no strangers mister said the boy holding the rock liam drew up a few yards short of them he hunkered down on his haunches and offered them a friendly smile well now my names liam liam oconnor so i suppose im no longer a stranger both boys nodded at the unfailing logic of that im saul this heres m brother grady saul looked at him you sound funny he said an you got strange clothes where you from ireland said liam the boy looked at his face curiously whats wrong with you mister liam shrugged bemused by the odd question nothings wrong with me you sick or something he really didnt have the time for this no im perfectly fine he gestured at the rock grady was trying to keep from his prying eyes whats that you got there lad grady hid the rock behind his back defensively aint nothin oh come on he inched a little closer is it money did you find some money up there no grady shook his head warily didnt find no money its just some words on a stupid stone said saul somebody made a message on a stone liam offered them a look of mild interest really how interesting can i see grady shook his head its mine if hed been a bit smarter about this if hed thought ahead hed have brought something to trade a cool toy a pack of baseball cards a bag of sweets or something even some of course he suddenly remembered he had on him something way better than any of those something either boy couldnt fail to be entranced by hang on he said digging into the thigh pocket of his tattered shorts it was in there somewhere still hed ah his fingers found the sharp edge a moment later he pulled out a fourinchlong fishhookshaped object he held it out in front of him and their eyes widened its a claw said liam a real dinosaur claw sauls and gradys jaws dropped open synchronously as four young eyes admired the viciouslooking nicks along the curved edge of the claw see i just found it this morning up the river so i did i heard you can find all sorts of fascinating old things along this river want to hold it both their heads nodded vigorously we could swap said liam you can take a look at my claw and ill look at that message stone of yours sure said grady quickly the passing fascination with his curious find more than trumped by the fourinch glistening claw dangling from liams fingers he passed his rock over without another look at it message dont make no sense to me anyways he reached out for the claw careful its quite sharp said liam grady took it off liam and then hunched over turning his back on his brother hey grady lemmesee too grady shook his head my stone my first looksee aw come on lemmesee lemmesee liam found a boulder nearby and let himself stiffly down on to it ignoring their squabbling as he turned the flat nugget of dark slate over in the palm of his hand his heart silently skipped a beat jayzus there you are again after all this time my silent messenger there it was his own handwriting reversed and faintly embossed with webthin ridges and grooves of rock compressed and preserved by time youre right he said looking up from the rock the words make no sense at all do they but grady wasnt listening he was entranced by the viciouslooking claw and too busy fending off sauls grabbing hands its just a load of gibberish he said a knowing halfsmile spread across his face wanna swap mister asked grady my stone for your claw liam shrugged as casually as he dared i dunno my claws a pretty good find an all please the boy dug deep into the pockets of his own trousers and produced a wooden yoyo ill throw this in for extra liam made a show of interest in the toy hed had one just like it back in cork large cumbersome and one hed never managed to get on with well all right then i suppose yoyo as well youve got yourself a deal they exchanged a solemn nod in silence a deal officially sealed and then liam picked himself wearily up for some reason feeling as old as the hills and politely bade farewell but both boys were already stuck back in a heated debate about the rights of access to the claw and who was going to hold it all the way home he picked his way back along the shingle of the riverbank through sliding clacking wet pebbles running his fingers across those faint embossed lines and his eyes looking for that small cairn of stones chapter new york sal felt it again the early ripples the faintest sensation of dizziness but it looked like no one else had felt it cartwright still had his gun on maddy this this is my life this world this reality yyou have to step outside now rejoin your men replied maddy firmly sal was impressed with her calm her cool in the face of his wavering gun the old man shook his head and laughed what youre expecting me to just walk away from this the greatest discovery in the history of mankind and what i just walk out into that backstreet and try to forget about it sal glanced at the other two kids they met her gaze eyes exchanging a shared imperative weve got to do something listen cut in maddy if the wave comes and goes while youre in here yyoull be left behind itll rewrite the present without you he smiled oh i think i could live with that maddy in fact ive been waiting a long long time for something like her eyes narrowed this isnt about state security any more is it he shrugged all right yes and why not this thing this time machine its a boys dream its a mans dream mankinds dream goddammit to travel anywhere to any time to see it all to see things no other human will ever see its not a toy cartwright you know you you just cant think of it that wway oh right you some snotnosed teenager and her buddies youre to be entrusted instead are you youre the guardians of time huh sal glanced at the others again then took a hesitant step towards the old man she looked to see if the other two were going to do likewise laura remained where she was trembling face ashen she shook her head too frightened edward however took a silent step forward along with sal she had no idea what she intended to do make a grab for the gun oh god the thought made her knees wobble i was selected replied maddy i didnt freakin want this cartwright jesus in fact i didnt have much of a freakin choice at all the old man shrugged guess what i dont really care he stepped towards her across snaking cables this is what i want and ive spent my life waiting for it preparing for it sal noticed something blinking on one of the monitors im an old man he continued stepping on to concrete floor in the middle of the archway clear of any cables that could trip him up all the while the aim of his gun remained resolutely on maddy my whole life my whole adult life has been leading towards this moment and ive known for so many years that a time machine was going to arrive under this bridge in this archway on september tenth he sighed can you imagine what knowing about something like that does to you knowing that near the end of your natural life something truly wonderful is going to happen he shook his head and what he laughed drily youre telling me to just forget about it just walk away and forget about it over maddys shoulder sal could see the blinking cursor in bobs dialogue box he was trying to tell maddy something a warning of the impending time wave the things ive wanted to see maddy carter the things ive dreamed of seeing over the last fifteen years the destruction of pompeii the fall of atlantis the crucifixion of christ the battle of bunker hill george washington crossing the delaware lincoln giving his gettysburg address the arrival of columbus his rheumy old eyes were alive with naive wonder my god the impact of the kt asteroid that ended the time of the dinosaurs can you imagine actually seeing that impact for yourself he shook his head how far back can i go do you know maddy spread her hands i i dont know i the beginning of life on earth the first division of cells cartwright seemed lost in his reverie of the things he could see the places he could go all his now for the taking sal suddenly felt the hairs on her forearms stand on end and knew it was here the time wave a moment later the ceiling light dimmed and flickered and they all felt it a moment of imbalance the floor dropping away beneath their feet the monitors over maddys shoulder all flickered and went dead laura cried in alarm and edward gasped as the ceiling light flickered off leaving them for a moment in complete darkness then the monitors flickered back on and the ceiling light fizzed blinked and bathed the archway in its cold blue glare once more cartwright giggled joyously good god that was it wasnt it maddy nodded slowly yeah i think it was she looked at him accusingly you shouldve been outside our field you should have been out there with your people this messes things up this but i wasnt outside he said calmly so why dont you just get over it you dont understand youve been written out of the present ive got no idea what that means to you or that suits me fine he smiled sal noticed the blinking cursor was back onscreen and all of a sudden it occurred to her what bob was desperately trying to tell maddy maddy she cried pointing at the monitors you need to look maddy turned to glance over her shoulder oh no she turned back to cartwright get out of there his wiry brow furrowed uh whats up move she screamed the displacement machines hum changed in tone as storedup energy prepared to be released look shouted maddy pointing to the ground at cartwrights feet he looked down wondering what was so special about a chalk circle and within a small irregular section of the grubby concrete floor scooped out and oh god cartwright get out it happened in nanoseconds the instant appearance of a sphere of energy around the old man most of him was inside all but his left hand sal thought she saw in that fleeting moment dark shapes swirling around him like demons or ghosts a window on to some world that an uneducated person a superstitious person someone from the dark ages might have called hell then he was swept away gone the sphere pulsed and shimmered and now she could see what appeared to be an undulating texasblue sky and an arid and drab landscape and the wavering outline of a shape stepping through liam staggered into view with a distinct look of nausea on his face and a moment later the sphere of supercharged tachyon particles vanished with a soft pop of rushing air jeez that was an odd one he said queasily bending over nauseous and heaving liam yelped maddy oh my god i thought you were going to get all mushed up with cartwright i he raised a hand to hush her just a second just a second im gonna he threw up on the floor and on to the stilltwitching hand cartwright had left behind sal rushed over to him liam you ok he wiped his mouth and looked up at her with his bloodshot eye i i just im all right now he straightened up and looked down in disgust at the hand and the acridsmelling puddle at his feet that wasnt like im used to that one felt really odd so it did maddy shook her head im not sure what happened cartwright was standing in the circle i forgot the countdown was due there were tears in her eyes running down her cheeks oh god liam i thought you were going to end up a twisted mess with him and well liam rubbed his mouth dry and grinned im all right now arent i he spread his hands and looked down at himself or have i got an extra arm or something stuck on the back of me head she nodded wiped her eyes and laughed no no youre just fine as you are did it work asked liam has anyone looked outside i think a time wave came said laura looking at sal for confirmation thats right sal nodded ill go see she turned back to the entrance hit the button and the shutter slowly began to crank up they gathered around the rising corrugated shutter and as it lurched to a halt they stepped outside into the dark night manhattan glistened brightly across the hudson a towering wedding cake of lights a commuter train rumbled overhead along the williamsburg bridge and the evening was filled with the soothing white noise of faroff traffic and the echoing wail of a police siren normal new york said liam he puffed out a weary sigh that was a bleedin mess and a half we got out of so it was sal reached out and hugged him tightly embarrassed by the tears rolling down her cheeks she squeezed him in a selfconscious way just like anyone might a big brother and then let him go but here we are again she whispered they watched new york in silence each of them lost in their own thoughts for a long while maddy stirred i better go and sort out the return window for the support she corrected herself for becks she turned and headed back inside the rest of them savoured the evening panorama watching beads of car headlights edging forward along fdr drive across the river and a ferry cutting the mirrored reflection of manhattan with its wake finally it was edward who stated the obvious asyetunfinished business me and laura we got to go back dont we to get things back to the way they were yes liam nodded but i dont suppose it has to be tonight good whispered laura im not feeling so good weve got some beds back inside said sal she looked at the girl and the chinese boy both looked pale and ill their faces smudged with a fortnights worth of grime and liam she realized he looked disconcertingly old and young at the same time with that streak of white hair at his temple ill go make some coffee she said chapter million years bc jungle becks watched the pyre of logs and branches burn amid curling tongues of flame she could just about make out the outline of the several dozen bodies shed stacked on top the log bridge was gone now its counterweight device dismantled like their windmill and tossed on the fire as kindling the palisade the leantos all gone as well the assorted rucksacks baseball caps jackets mobile phones that had flown back into the past all of them tossed on the fire by morning those things would be nothing more than soot or contorted puddles of plastic that would eventually break down over tens of thousands of years into minute untraceable contaminants her computer mind took a moment to make a detailed audit of all the other items of forensic evidence that marked their twoweek stay here the human bodies shed been unable to retrieve franklyn ranjit and kelly of those only franklyn had died in a location that would one day yield fossils and even then it was statistically unlikely that his body was going to be preserved in a way that would produce anything a corpse needed to be almost immediately covered by a layer of sediment to stand a chance of that those three bodies wherever they lay were exposed to the elements to scavengers bullets and casings littered the clearing but they too would soon become unidentifiable nuggets of rust in this humid jungle perhaps a hundred years from now no more than stains of oxidized soil on the jungle floor she was satisfied that the sheer weight of time and natural processes would wipe their presence clean there was always the remote possibility that a footprint or the unnatural scar of an axe blade on a tree trunk might just somehow become an immortalized impression on a fragment of rock but the probability factors she crunched yielded an acceptable contamination risk her partially healed stomach wound had ripped open as shed laboured on the funeral pyre but a dark plug of congealing scab prevented any further valuable blood leaking out of her the dressing on her arm had also unwound earlier revealing redraw muscle tissue and bone a layer of skin over the top of that would have offered her damaged limb some protection instead the fragile workings of her arm were now clogged with dirt and twigs and leaves and all manner of bugs an infection advisory flashed quietly in the background of her mind along with several others that warned her that her biological combat chassis had suffered enough damage to warrant immediate medical attention as she watched tongues of orange lash up into the cretaceous night sky towards a moon a hat size too big she detected the first precursor particles of the scheduled window and stepped towards the open ground where it was due to open she looked back one last time at the fire and picked out the dark twisted limbs of the hominid species amid the flames for a moment she felt something she couldnt identify sadness was it guilt all she knew was that it came from a part of her mind that didnt organize thoughts into mission priorities and strategic options a sphere of churning air suddenly winked into existence in front of her and calmly impassively she stepped forward through sixtyfive million years into a dimly lit brick archway the first face her eyes registered through the shimmering was liam oconnors he smiled tiredly and she momentarily wondered if his mind was flashing the human equivalent set of damage advisory warnings welcome home becks he said softly and then without any warning he clasped his arms around her we did it he muttered into her ear she processed the curious gesture and her silicon swiftly came back with the recommendation that returning the demonstration of affection would be an acceptably appropriate response her good arm closed around his narrow shoulders affirmative liam we did it chapter new york monday time cycle they stayed for a few days edward and laura maddy said they were probably suffering some sort of radiation sickness from the lab explosion and needed some rest and recuperation it was nice to have some new faces around here for a while anyway but maddy said they had to go she was right of course they had things to do lives to go and lead but not long lives not edward anyway i read his file on our computer this is so sad he will write his great maths paper in that will change the world and hell be just twentytwo when he does that but then hell be dead from cancer before his twentyseventh birthday cancer at twentyseven that seems so unfair twentyseven years isnt a life its just a taster of life isnt it i know i couldnt have told him that and even if i could would it have been fair to tell him would anyone want to know the exact day they were going to die i know i wouldnt we were going to send them back to that was the original plan but maddy figured that wasnt going to work theyve both seen too much they both know too much maybe thats not so important for the girl laura maybe her life isnt ever going to affect the world that much but chan hes everything the futures going to be it all kind of starts with what hes going to one day write in a paper so what did we do we left them outside when the field reset we watched with the shutter open we watched time come and take them away reality just erased them like someone deleting files off a computer maddy says shes pretty sure thats going to make things all right again reality will bring them back theyll be born once more like all the other kids who died theyll be born be babies toddlers kids teenagers a second time only this time theyll visit some energy lab in and then get to go home and tell their mums and dads what a totally boring day trip they had well at least thats what were hoping and what about the person whoever that was who tried to kill edward i suppose well know whether historys been changed enough that he or she makes some different choices if we get the same message again from the future then well well have to deal with this all over again wont we hopefully not we just have to wait and see if this fixes everything nothings certain nothings final everythings fluid thats maddys phrase what does that really mean so the female support unit becks still trying to get used to that name is still healing those creatures really messed her arm up by the look of it bob says the regrown skin will probably show a lot of scarring and the muscles and tendons may never be fully functional again which led to an argument between maddy and liam maddy suggested flushing the body and growing a new support unit one of the big tough male ones but liam got angry he said she deserves better i dont know what i think after all theyre just organic robots arent they and whatever knowledge her ai picked up would be saved right but liam says theres more to them than just the computer theres something else in there something humanlike in their heads so maybe hes right it does seem unfair to do that to her after all it seems she did really well anyway shes got a name i mean how can you just flush something away thats got like a name its wrong isnt it seems like the arguments all settled now though looks like were keeping her but also growing another bob maddy said there seemed to be nothing in the how to manual that says we cant have two support units so why not chapter new york the old man was sitting on the park bench and throwing nuggets of dough from the crusty end of a hotdog bun to a strutting pack of impatient pigeons i knew id find you here said maddy he looked up at her and smiled a greeting she closed her eyes and turned her face up towards the clear blue september sky and for a moment savoured the warmth of the sun on her pallid cheeks unobscured sun and a good hot dog thats what you said she added and where else in manhattans forest of skyscrapers are you going to get that foster laughed drily clever girl she flopped down on the park bench next to him weve really missed you ive missed you its only been a few hours he said tossing another doughy nugget out among the birds what its been months yes but for me he said just a few hours he looked at her remember im out of the loop now im out of the time bubble i said goodbye to you on a monday morning he looked down at his watch and now its nearly one oclock on the very same monday she shook her head yes of course stupid of me i knew that they sat in silence for a while and watched a toddler on reins attempt to scare away the pigeons by stamping her little feet the birds merely gave her a wide berth as she ambled through and then returned to hungrily resume pecking at the crumbs of bread on the ground in her wake you hinted youd be here didnt you when we parted foster nodded i suppose i felt a little guilty leaving you so soon he puffed out his sallow cheeks but im dying maddy i wont last very much longer the tachyon corruption yes it plays merry havoc at a genetic level its like a computer virus rewriting lines of code with gibberish out here he sighed outside the time bubble i might get a little longer to live i might get a week or two more maybe a month if im lucky that would be nice she thought about that for a moment but youll always be thats right madelaine from your point of view ill always be found here in central park at twelve fiftytwo am on monday the tenth of september like all these other people he said gesturing at the busy park the queue of people standing beside the hotdog vendor across the grass like them ive become part of the furniture of here and now part of the wallpaper thats the other reason why i left she frowned not getting that if id stayed with you and the others id be long gone by now this way i can still help you someone to talk to ah she nodded but each time you come and find me madelaine remember each time you come and find me itll be the first time for me do you see what i mean of course it would she realized for the old man monday had been a coffee and a bagel and a goodbye and now three hours later a momentary reunion in central park each time the field office reset itself any conversation he had with her never happened for foster thered be no memory of it he laughed itll be like visiting some senile old fogey in a madhouse youll have to get used to repeating yourself she shared his chuckle i had a boyfriend like that once he never listened to me he sniffed you came here i presume because you need help well we did have a problem but its all fixed now i think he patted her arm see i knew you lot were ready hardly we scraped through this one foster it was a closerun thing she gave him the bare bones of their story foster shook his head dinosaur times he whispered i i never thought the machine could take us so far back you never did that no never that far hows liam well thats just it i dont know how much damage that did to him its definitely done something to him aged him in some ways he has she looked at foster and for the first time she noticed the rheumy whites of his eyes were faintly laced with the scars of old burst blood vessels like you haemorrhaging and a streak of white hair who knows whats been damaged inside him i mean thats just what i can see foster how long can he take this kind of punishment how long do you think he will live he sucked in air through his teeth well hes a tough old soul i can tell you that but you see it all depends on where and when he goes madelaine who knows how long hes got that didnt help much do i tell him or not foster you know hes not blind hes seen his bad eye hes seen his hair he jokes about it but hes not stupid he must know this isnt good for him he shook his head i know hell cope but whether you tell him has to be your call youre the one in charge now i can give you what advice i can but command decisions are yours thats how it is he tossed the last of his bun in among the birds i cant run the field office from out here on a park bench youre the boss now but what about the agency is there someone else i can talk to someone in charge i im sorry madelaine thats thats off limits you have to treat this like youre entirely on your own do you understand youre on your own she cursed what sort of useless freakin agency is this he pursed his lips sympathetically im afraid thats just how it is she ground her teeth in silent frustration for a while knowing there was nothing more foster could offer her on the subject of liam in any case there was a new pair of glasses she was due to pick up from the opticians theyd promised her theyd be ready in a couple of hours and another day of squinting at monitors and getting a migraine for her troubles was something she could live without she stood up id better go things to do he stood up slowly achingly polite like a true gentleman youll be here again asked maddy for sure every monday at this time of course he grinned i do charge by the hour though she laughed then hugged him awkward and faltering enjoy your day foster oh i have a funpacked afternoon planned she squeezed his arm take care ill drop by and see you again soon she turned to walk down the path leading to the southwest gate but a thought suddenly occurred to her she stopped turned and saw him standing there among his pigeons watching her go almost as if hed been expecting her to stop and turn foster how can you be so sure liam will cope what if he works out hes dying whats he gonna do he might choose to leave us hell do the right thing he replied youll always be able to rely on that the right thing hes a good lad he turned away and began to wade through a parting sea of ruffling grey feathers and curious beady eyes foster how can you be so sure he stopped in his tracks and looked back over his shoulder how can i be so sure she nodded i mean come on who the hell would be stupid enough to keep doing something they knows killing them what makes you think you know him so well oh i know he cocked an eyebrow because hes me
