london bridge museum of london cartography on pages xxvixxix by pamela talese while the publishers have made every effort to trace the owners of copyright they will be happy to rectify any errors or omissions in further editions the city as body the image of london as a human body is striking and singular we may trace it from the pictorial emblems of the city of god the mystical body in which jesus christ represents its head and the citizens its other members london has also been envisaged in the form of a young man with his arms outstretched in a gesture of liberation the figure is taken from a roman bronze but it embodies the energy and exultation of a city continually expanding in great waves of progress and of confidence here might be found the heart of london beating warm the byways of the city resemble thin veins and its parks are like lungs in the mist and rain of an urban autumn the shining stones and cobbles of the older thoroughfares look as if they are bleeding when william harvey practising as a surgeon in st bartholomews hospital walked through the streets he noticed that the hoses of the fire engines spouted water like blood from a cut artery metaphorical images of the cockney body have circulated for many hundreds of years gob was first recorded in paws in mug in and kisser in the mideighteenth century harveys seventeenthcentury hospital was beside the shambles of smithfield and that conjunction may suggest another image of the city it is fleshy and voracious grown fat upon its appetite for people and for food for goods and for drink it consumes and it excretes maintained within a continual state of greed and desire for daniel defoe london was a great body which circulates all exports all and at last pays for all that is why it has commonly been portrayed in monstrous form a swollen and dropsical giant which kills more than it breeds its head is too large out of proportion to the other members its face and hands have also grown monstrous irregular and out of all shape it is a spleen or a great wen a body racked with fever and choked by ashes it proceeds from plague to fire whether we consider london as a young man refreshed and risen from sleep therefore or whether we lament its condition as a deformed giant we must regard it as a human shape with its own laws of life and growth here then is its biography some will object that such a biography can form no part of a true history i admit the fault and plead in my defence that i have subdued the style of my enquiry to the nature of the subject london is a labyrinth half of stone and half of flesh it cannot be conceived in its entirety but can be experienced only as a wilderness of alleys and passages courts and thoroughfares in which even the most experienced citizen may lose the way it is curious too that this labyrinth is in a continual state of change and expansion the biography of london also defies chronology contemporary theorists have suggested that linear time is itself a figment of the human imagination but london has already anticipated their conclusions there are many different forms of time in the city and it would be foolish of me to change its character for the sake of creating a conventional narrative that is why this book moves quixotically through time itself forming a labyrinth if the history of london poverty is beside a history of london madness then the connections may provide more significant information than any orthodox historiographical survey chapters of history resemble john bunyans little wicketgates while all around lie sloughs of despond and valleys of humiliation so i will sometimes stray from the narrow path in search of those heights and depths of urban experience that know no history and are rarely susceptible to rational analysis i understand a little and i trust that it will prove enough i am not a virgil prepared to guide aspiring dantes around a defined and circular kingdom i am only one stumbling londoner who wishes to lead others in the directions which i have pursued over a lifetime the readers of this book must wander and wonder they may become lost upon the way they may experience moments of uncertainty and on occasions strange fantasies or theories may bewilder them on certain streets various eccentric or vulnerable people will pause beside them pleading for attention there will be anomalies and contradictionslondon is so large and so wild that it contains no less than everythingjust as there will be irresolutions and ambiguities but there will also be moments of revelation when the city will be seen to harbour the secrets of the human world then it is wise to bow down before the immensity so we set off in anticipation with the milestone pointing ahead of us to london peter ackroyd london march from prehistory to the relics of past ages have been found beneath many areas of london they are the foundations upon which it rests chapter the sea if you were to touch the plinth upon which the equestrian statue of king charles i is placed at charing cross your fingers might rest upon the projecting fossils of sea lilies starfish or sea urchins there is a photograph of that statue taken in with its images of hackney cabs and small boys in stovepipe hats the scene already seems remote and yet how unimaginably distant lies the life of those tiny marine creatures in the beginning was the sea there was once a musichall song entitled why cant we have the sea in london but the question is redundant the site of the capital fifty million years before was covered by great waters the waters have not wholly departed even yet and there is evidence of their life in the weathered stones of london the portland stone of the customs house and st pancras old church has a diagonal bedding which reflects the currents of the ocean there are ancient oyster shells within the texture of mansion house and the british museum seaweed can still be seen in the greyish marble of waterloo station and the force of hurricanes may be detected in the chattermarked stone of pedestrian subways in the fabric of waterloo bridge the bed of the upper jurassic sea can also be observed the tides and storms are still all around us therefore and as shelley wrote of london that great sea still howls on for more london has always been a vast ocean in which survival is not certain the dome of st pauls has been seen trembling upon a vague troubled sea of fog while dark streams of people flow over london bridge or waterloo bridge and emerge as torrents in the narrow thoroughfares of london the social workers of the midnineteenth century spoke of rescuing drowning people in whitechapel or shoreditch and arthur morrison a novelist of the same period invokes a howling sea of human wreckage crying out to be saved henry peacham the seventeenthcentury author of the art of living in london considered the city as a vast sea full of gusts fearfuldangerous shelves and rocks while in louis simond was content to listen to the roar of its waves breaking around us in measured time if you look from a distance you observe a sea of roofs and have no more knowledge of the dark streams of people than of the denizens of some unknown ocean but the city is always a heaving and restless place with its own torrents and billows its foam and spray the sound of its streets is like the murmur from a sea shell and in the great fogs of the past the citizens believed themselves to be lying on the floor of the ocean even amid all the lights it may simply be what george orwell described as the ocean bottom among the luminous gliding fishes this is a constant vision of the london world particularly in the novels of the twentieth century where feelings of hopelessness and despondency turn the city into a place of silence and mysterious depths yet like the sea and the gallows london refuses nobody those who venture upon its currents look for prosperity or fame even if they often founder in its depths jonathan swift depicted the jobbers of the exchange as traders waiting for shipwrecks in order to strip the dead while the commercial houses of the city often used a ship or boat as a weathervane and as a sign of good fortune three of the most common emblems in urban cemeteries are the shell the ship and the anchor the starlings of trafalgar square are also the starlings who nest in the cliff faces of northern scotland the pigeons of london are descended from the wild rockdoves who lived among the steep cliffs of the northern and western shores of this island for them the buildings of the city are cliffs still and the streets are the endless sea stretching beyond them but the real confluence lies in thisthat london for so long the arbiter of trade and of the sea should have upon its fabric the silent signature of the tides and waves and when the waters parted the london earth was revealed in in a characteristically grand example of victorian engineering a vast well was taken down feet at the southern end of tottenham court road it travelled hundreds of millions of years touching the primeval landscapes of this city site and from its evidence we can list the layers beneath our feet from the devonian to the jurassic and the cretaceous above these strata lie feet of chalk outcrops of which can be seen upon the downs or the chilterns as the rim of the london basin that shallow saucerlike declivity in which the city rests on top of the chalk itself lies the thick london clay which is in turn covered by deposits of gravel and brickearth here then is the making of the city in more than one sense the clay and the chalk and the brickearth have for almost two thousand years been employed to construct the houses and public buildings of london it is almost as if the city raised itself from its primeval origin creating a human settlement from the senseless material of past time this clay is burned and compressed into london stock the particular yellowbrown or red brick that has furnished the material of london housing it truly represents the genius loci and christopher wren suggested that the earth around london rightly managed will yield as good brick as were the roman bricks and will endure in our air beyond any stone our island affords william blake called the bricks of london wellwrought affections by which he meant that the turning of clay and chalk into the fabric of the streets was a civilising process which knit the city with its primeval past the houses of the seventeenth century are made out of dust that drifted over the london region in a glacial era years before the london clay can yield more tangible evidence also the skeletons of sharks in the east end it was popularly believed that sharks teeth might cure cramp the skull of a wolf in cheapside and crocodiles in the clay of islington in dryden recognised this now forgotten and invisible landscape of london yet monsters from thy large increase we find engenderd on the slyme thou leavst behind eight years later in the remains of a mammoth were found beside what has since become kings cross london clay can by the alchemy of weather become mud and in charles dickens noted that there was so much mud in the streets that it would not be wonderful to meet a megalosaurus forty feet long or so waddling like an elephantine lizard up holborn hill in the s louisferdinand céline took the motor buses of piccadilly circus to be a herd of mastodons returning to the territory they had left behind in mother london michael moorcocks late twentiethcentury hero sees monsters by mud and giant ferns while crossing the footbridge alongside the hungerford railway bridge the mammoth of was only the first primeval relic to be discovered in the london region hippopotami and elephants lay beneath trafalgar square lions at charing cross and buffaloes beside st martininthefields a brown bear was discovered in north woolwich mackerel in the old brickfields of holloway and sharks in brentford the wild animals of london include reindeer giant beavers hyenas and rhinoceri which once grazed by the swamps and lagoons of the thames and that landscape has not entirely faded within recent memory the mist from the ancient marshes of westminster destroyed the frescoes of st stephens it is still possible beside the national gallery to detect the rise of ground between the middle and upper terraces of the thames in the pleistocene era this was not even then an unpeopled region within the bones of the kings cross mammoth were also found pieces of a flint handaxe which can be dated to the palaeolithic period we can say with some certainty that for half a million years there has been in london a pattern of habitation and hunting if not of settlement the first great fire of london was started a quarter of a million years ago in the forests south of the thames that river had by then taken its appointed course but not its later appearance it was very broad fed by many streams occluded by forests bordered by swamps and marshes the prehistory of london invites endless speculation and there is a certain pleasure to be derived from the prospect of human settlement in areas where many thousands of years later streets would be laid out and houses erected there is no doubt that the region has been continually occupied for at least fifteen thousand years a great gathering of flint tools excavated in southwark is assumed to mark the remains of a mesolithic manufactory a hunting camp of the same period has been discovered upon hampstead heath a pottery bowl from the neolithic period was unearthed in clapham on these ancient sites have been found pits and postholes together with human remains and evidence of feasting these early people drank a potion similar to mead or beer like their london descendants they left vast quantities of rubbish everywhere like them too they met for the purposes of worship for many thousands of years these ancient peoples treated the great river as a divine being to be placated and surrendered to its depths the bodies of their illustrious dead in the late neolithic period there appeared from the generally marshy soil on the northern bank of the thames twin hills covered by gravel and brickearth surrounded by sedge and willow they were forty to fifty feet in height and were divided by a valley through which flowed a stream we know them as cornhill and ludgate hill with the now buried walbrook running between thus emerged london the name is assumed to be of celtic origin awkward for those who believe that there was no human settlement here before the romans built their city its actual meaning however is disputed it might be derived from llyndon the town or stronghold don by the lake or stream llyn but this owes more to medieval welsh than ancient celtic its provenance might be laindon long hill or the gaelic lunnd marsh one of the more intriguing speculations given the reputation for violence which londoners were later to acquire is that the name is derived from the celtic adjective londos meaning fierce there is a more speculative etymology which gives the honour of naming to king lud who is supposed to have reigned in the century of the roman invasion he laid out the citys streets and rebuilt its walls upon his death he was buried beside the gate which bore his name and the city became known as kaerlud or kaerlundein luds city those of sceptical cast of mind may be inclined to dismiss such narratives but the legends of a thousand years may contain profound and particular truths the origin of the name however remains mysterious it is curious perhaps that the name of the mineral most associated with the citycoalalso has no certain derivation with its syllabic power so much suggesting force or thunder it has continually echoed through historycaer ludd lundunes lindonion lundene lundone ludenberk longidinium and a score of other variants there have even been suggestions that the name is more ancient than the celts themselves and that it springs from some neolithic past we must not necessarily assume that there were settlements or defended enclosures upon ludgate hill or cornhill or that there were wooden trackways where there are now great avenues but the attractions of the site might have been as obvious in the third and fourth millennia bc as they were to the later celts and romans the hills were well defended forming a natural plateau with the river to the south fens to the north marshes to the east and another river later known as the fleet to the west it was fertile ground well watered by springs bubbling up through the gravel the thames was easily navigable at this point with the fleet and the walbrook providing natural harbours the ancients trackways of england were also close at hand so from earliest time london was the most appropriate site for trade for markets and for barter the city has for much of its history been the centre of world commerce it is perhaps instructive to note that it may have begun with the transactions of stone age people in their own markets all this is speculation not altogether uninformed but evidence of a more substantial kind has been discovered in later levels of london earth in those long stretches of time designated as the late bronze age and the early iron agea period spanning almost a thousand yearsshards and fragments of bowls and pots and tools were left all over london there are signs of prehistoric activity in the areas now known as st mary axe and gresham street austin friars and finsbury circus bishopsgate and seething lane with altogether some finds clustered in the area of the twin hills together with tower hill and southwark from the thames itself many hundreds of metal objects have been retrieved while along its banks is to be found frequent evidence of metalworking this is the period from which the great early legends of london spring it is also in its latter phase the age of the celts in the first century bc julius caesars description of the region around london suggests the presence of an elaborate rich and wellorganised tribal civilisation its population was exceedingly large and the ground thickly studded with homesteads the nature and role of the twin hills throughout this period cannot with certainty be given perhaps these were sacred places or perhaps their welldefined position allowed them to be used as hillforts in order to protect the trade carried along the river there is every reason to suppose that this area of the thames was a centre of commerce and of industry with a market in iron products as well as elaborate workings in bronze with merchants from gaul rome and spain bringing samian ware wine and spices in exchange for corn metals and slaves in the history of this period completed by geoffrey of monmouth in the principal city in the island of britain is undoubtedly london but according to modern scholars his work is established upon lost texts apocryphal embellishments and uninformed conjecture where geoffrey speaks of kings for example they prefer the nomenclature of tribes he dates events by means of biblical parallel while they provide indicators such as late iron age he elucidates patterns of conflict and social change in terms of individual human passion where more recent accounts of prehistory rely upon more abstract principles of trade and technology the approaches may be contradictory but they are not necessarily incompatible it is believed by historians of early britain for example that a people known as the trinovantes settled on territory to the north of the london region curiously enough geoffrey states that the first name of the city was trinovantum he also mentions the presence of temples within london itself even if they had existed these palisades and wooden enclosures would since have been lost beneath the stone of the roman city as well as the brick and cement of succeeding generations but nothing is wholly lost in the first four decades of the twentieth century there was a particular effort by prehistorians to discover something of londons supposedly hidden past in books such as the lost language of london legendary london prehistoric london and the earlier inhabitants of london tokens and traces of a celtic or druidic london were thoroughly examined and were found significant these studies were effectively killed off by the second world war after which urban planning and regeneration became more important than urban speculation but the original works survive and still repay close study the fact that existing street names may betray a celtic origincolin deep lane pancras lane maiden lane ingal road among themis for example as instructive as any of the material finds recorded on the site of the ancient city longforgotten trackways have guided the course of modern thoroughfares the crossroads at the angel islington for example marks the point where two prehistoric british roads intersected we know of old street leading to old ford of maiden lane crossing through pentonville and battle bridge to highgate of the route from upper street to highbury all following the same ancient tracks and buried paths yet there is no more suspect or difficult subject in the context of this period than druidism that it was well established in celtic settlements is not in doubt julius caesar who was in a position to speak with some authority on the subject stated that the druid religion was founded inventa in britain and that its celtic adherents came to this island in order to be educated in its mysteries it represented a highly advanced if somewhat insular religious culture of course we might speculate that the oak woodland to the north of the twin hills provided a suitable site for sacrifice and worship one antiquary sir laurence gomme has envisaged a temple or sacred space upon ludgate hill itself but there are many false trails it was once generally agreed that parliament hill near highgate was a place for religious assembly but in fact the remnants which have been discovered there do not date from prehistory the chislehurst caves in south london once reputed to be of druid origin connected in some fashion with the observation of the heavens are almost certainly of medieval construction it has been suggested that the london area was controlled from three sacred mounds they are named as penton hill tothill and the white mound otherwise known as tower hill any such theory can readily be dismissed as nonsense but there are curious parallels and coincidences which render it more interesting than the usual fantasies of latterday psychogeographers it is known that in prehistoric worship a holy place was marked by a spring a grove and a well or ritual shaft there is a reference to a shrubby maze in the pleasure gardens of white conduit house situated on the high ground of pentonville and a mazes avatar was a sacred hill or grove close at hand is the famous well of sadlers wells in recent days the water of this well flowed under the orchestra pit of the theatre but from medieval times it was considered holy and was tended by the priests of clerkenwell the site of the high ground in pentonville was also once a reservoir it was until recently the headquarters of the london water board another maze was to be found in the area once known as tothill fields in westminster it is depicted in hollars view of the area in the midseventeenth century here also is a sacred spring deriving from the holy well in deans yard westminster a fair similar to the pleasure gardens upon white conduit fields was established here at an early date the first extant reference is dated the sites are therefore comparable there are other suggestive coincidences on old maps st hermits hill is a noticeable feature of the area beside tothill fields to this day there is a hermes street at the top of the pentonville road it is perhaps also interesting that in a house on this site dwelled a physician who promoted a medicine known as the balsam of life the house was later turned into an observatory on tower hill there was a spring of clear bubbling water reputed to possess curative properties a medieval well exists there and traces of a late iron age burial have been uncovered there is no maze but the place has its own share of celtic legends according to the welsh triads the guardian head of bran the blessed is interred within the white hill to safeguard the kingdom from its enemies londons legendary founder brutus also was supposed to have been buried on tower hill in sacred ground that was used as an observatory until the seventeenth century the etymology of penton hill and tothill is reasonably certain pen is the celtic signifier for head or hill while ton is a variant of tortot twttoo which means spring or rising ground wycliffe applies the words tot or tote for example to mount zion those of a more romantic disposition have suggested that tot is derived from the egyptian god thoth who is of course reincarnated in hermes the greek personification of the wind or the music of the lyre here then is the hypothesis london mounds which bear so many similar characteristics are in fact the holy sites of druid ritual the maze is the sacred equivalent of the oak grove while the wells and springs represent the worship of the god of the water the london water board was then well situated pleasure gardens and fairs are more recent versions of those prehistoric festivals or meetings which were held upon the same ground so antiquaries have named tothill penton and tower hill as the holy places of london it is generally assumed of course that pentonville is named after an eighteenthcentury speculator henry penton who developed the area can one place assume different identities existing in different times and in different visions of reality is it possible that both explanations of pentonville are true simultaneously might billingsgate be named after the celtic king belinus or belin as the great sixteenthcentury antiquary john stow would have it or after a mr beling who once owned the land can ludgate really bear the name of lud a celtic god of the waters certainly there is room for contemplation here it is equally important to look for evidence of continuity it is likely that there was antiquity of worship among the britons long before the druids emerged as the high priests of their culture and in turn celtic forms of ritual seem to have survived the roman occupation and subsequent invasions by the saxon tribes in the records of st pauls cathedral the adjacent buildings are known as camera dianae a fifteenthcentury chronicler recalled a time when london worships diana the goddess of the hunt which is at least one explanation for the strange annual ceremony that took place at st pauls as late as the sixteenth century there in the christian temple erected on the sacred site of ludgate hill a stags head was impaled upon a spear and carried about the church it was then received upon the steps of the church by priests wearing garlands of flowers upon their heads so the pagan customs of london survived into recorded history just as a latent paganism survived among the citizens themselves one other inheritance from prehistoric worship may also be considered the sense of certain places as being powerful or venerable was taken over by the christians in the recognition of holy wells and in such ceremonies of territorial piety as beating the bounds yet the same sensibility is to be found in the writings of the great london visionaries from william blake to arthur machen writings in which the city itself is considered to be a sacred place with its own joyful and sorrowful mysteries in this celtic period which lurks like some chimera in the shadows of the known world the great legends of london find their origin the historical record knows only of warring tribes within a highly organised culture of some sophistication they were not necessarily savage in other words and the greek geographer strabo describes one briton an ambassador as well dressed intelligent and agreeable he spoke greek with such fluency that you would have thought he had been bred up in the lyceum this is the proper context for those narratives in which london is accorded the status of a principal city brutus in legend the founder of the city was buried within londons walls locrinus kept his lover estrildis in a secret chamber beneath the ground bladud who practised sorcery constructed a pair of wings with which to fly through the air of london yet he fell against the roof of the temple of apollo situated in the very heart of the city perhaps on ludgate hill itself another king dunvallo who formulated the ancient laws of sanctuary was buried beside a london temple from this period too came the narratives of lear and of cymbeline more powerful still is the legend of the giant gremagot who by some strange alchemy was transformed into the twins gog and magog who became tutelary spirits of london it has often been suggested that each of this characteristically ferocious pair whose statues have stood for many centuries within the guildhall guards one of the twin hills of london such stories are recorded by john milton in the history of britain published a little more than three hundred years ago after this brutus in a chosen place builds troia nova changd in time to trinovantum now london and began to enact laws heli beeing then high priest in judaea and having governd the whole ile years dyd and was buried in his new troy brutus was the greatgrandson of aeneas who some years after the fall of troy led the exodus of trojans from greece in the course of his exilic wanderings he was granted a dream in which the goddess diana spoke words of prophecy to him an island far to the west beyond the realm of gaul fitts thy people you are to sail there brutus and establish a city which will become another troy and kings be born of thee whose dredded might shall aw the world and conquer nations bold london is to maintain a world empire but like ancient troy it may suffer some perilous burning it is interesting that paintings of londons great fire in make specific allusion to the fall of troy this is indeed the central myth of londons origin which can be found in the sixthcentury verses of tallisen where the british are celebrated as the living remnant of troy as well as in the later poetry of edmund spenser and of alexander pope pope born in plough court beside lombard street was of course invoking a visionary urban civilisation yet it is one highly appropriate for a city first vouchsafed to brutus in a dream the narrative of brutus has been dismissed as mere fable and fanciful legend but as milton wrote in the judicious introduction to his own history ofttimes relations heertofore accounted fabulous have bin after found to contain in them many footsteps and reliques of something true some scholars believe that we can date the wanderings of the apparently legendary brutus to the period around bc in contemporary historiographical terms this marks the period of the late bronze age when new bands or tribes of settlers occupied the area around london they constructed large defensive enclosures and maintained an heroic life of meadhalls ringgiving and furious fighting which found expression in later legends segmented glass beads like those of troy have been discovered in england in the waters of the thames was found a black twohandled cup its provenance lies in asia minor with an approximate date of bc so there is some indication of trade between western europe and the eastern mediterranean and there is every reason to suppose that phrygian or later phoenician merchants reached the shores of albion and sailed into the market of london material evidence of an association with troy itself and with the region of asia minor in which that ancient doomed city resided can be found elsewhere diogenes laertius identified the celts with the chaldees of assyria indeed the famous british motif comprising the lion and the unicorn may be of chaldean origin caesar noted with some surprise that the druids made use of greek letters in the welsh triads there is a description of an invading tribe who have travelled to the shores of albion or england from the region of constantinople it is suggestive perhaps that the franks and gauls also claimed trojan ancestry although it is not altogether out of the question that a tribe from the region of fallen troy migrated to western europe it is more likely perhaps that the celtic people themselves had their origins in the eastern mediterranean the legend of london as a new troy is therefore still able to claim some adherents at the beginning of any civilisation there are fables and legends only at the end are they proved to be accurate one token of brutus and his trojan fleet may still remain if you walk east down cannon street on the other side from the railway station you will find an iron grille set within the bank of china it protects a niche upon which has been placed a stone roughly two feet in height bearing a faint groove mark upon its top this is london stone for many centuries it was popularly believed to be the stone of brutus brought by him as a deity so long as the stone of brutus is safe ran one city proverb so long shall london flourish certainly the stone is of great antiquity the first reference to it was discovered by john stow in a fair written gospel book once belonging to ethelstone an early tenthcentury king of the west saxons where certain lands and rents are described to lie near unto london stone according to the victorian county history it originally marked the very centre of the old city but in was taken from the middle of cannon street and placed within the fabric of st swithins church opposite there it remained until the second world war although a german bomb entirely destroyed the church in london stone remained intact it is constructed of oolite which as a perishable stone cannot be assumed to have survived since prehistoric times yet it has been granted a charmed life there is a verse by the fifteenthcentury poet fabyan which celebrates the religious significance of a stone so pure that though some have it thrette yet hurte had none its actual significance however remains unclear some antiquaries have considered it to be a token of civic assembly connected with the repayment of debts while others believe it to be a roman milliarium or milestone christopher wren argued however that it possessed too large a foundation for the latter purpose a judicial role is more likely in a now forgotten play of pasquill and marfarius a character remarks set up this bill at london stone let it be doone sollemly with drom and trumpet and then again if it please them these dark winter nights to stikke uppe their papers uppon london stone that it became a highly venerated object is not in doubt william blake was convinced that it marked the site of druid executions whose sacrificial victims groand aloud on london stone but its uses were perhaps less melancholy when the popular rebel jack cade stormed london in he and his followers made their way to the stone he touched it with his sword and then exclaimed now is mortimerthis was the name he had assumedlord of this city the first mayor of london in the late twelfth century was henry fitzailwin de londonestone it seems likely therefore that this ancient object came somehow to represent the power and authority of the city it sits now blackened and disregarded by the side of a busy thoroughfare over and around it have flowed wooden carts carriages sedan chairs hansom cabs cabriolets hackney cabs omnibuses bicycles trams and cars it was once londons guardian spirit and perhaps it is still it is at least a material remnant from all the ancient legends of london and of its foundation for the celtic people these narratives comprised the glory of a city once known as cockaigne in this place of wealth and delight the traveller might find riches and blessed happiness this is the myth that established the context for later legends such as those of dick whittington as well as those unattributable proverbs which describe londons streets as paved with gold yet london gold has proved more perishable than london stone chapter the stones a section of the original london wall with medieval additions can still be seen by trinity place just north of the tower of london part of the tower itself was incorporated within the fabric of the wall demonstrating in material form william dunbars claim that stony be thy wallys that about thee standis it was almost ten feet wide at its base and more than twenty feet in height besides these relics of the wall by trinity place can be seen the stone outline of an inner tower which contained a wooden staircase leading to a parapet which looked east across the marshes from here the spectral wall the wall as once it was can be traversed in the imagination it proceeds north to coopers row where a section can still be seen in the courtyard of an empty building it rises from a car park in the basement it goes through the concrete and marble of the building then on through the brick and iron of the fenchurch street station viaduct until an extant section rises again in america square it is concealed within the basement of a modern building which itself has parapets turrets and square towers a strip of glazed red tiling bears more than a passing resemblance to the courses of flat red tiles placed in the ancient roman structure for a moment it is known as crosswall and passes through the headquarters of a company named equitas it moves through vine street in the car park at no is a security camera on the ancient line of the now invisible wall towards jewry street which itself follows the line of the wall almost exactly until it meets aldgate all the buildings here can be said to comprise a new wall separating west from east we find centurion house and boots the chemist the steps of the subway at aldgate lead down to a level which was once that of late medieval london but we follow the wall down dukes place and into bevis marks near the intersection of these two thoroughfares there is now part of that ring of steel which is designed once more to protect the city on a sixteenthcentury map bevis marks was aligned to the course of the wall and it is so still the pattern of the streets here has been unchanged for many hundreds of years even the lanes such as heneage lane remain at the corner of bevis marks and st mary axe rises a building of white marble with massive vertical windows a great golden eagle can be seen above its entrance as if it were part of some imperial standard security cameras once more trace the line of the wall as it leads down camomile street towards bishopsgate and wormwood street it drops beneath the churchyard of st botolphs behind a building faced with white stone and curtainwalling of dark glass but then fragments of it arise beside the church of all hallowsonthewall which has been built in the ancient fashion to protect and bless these defences the modern thoroughfare here becomes known at last as london wall a tower like a postern of brown stone rises above london wall very close to the spot where a fourthcentury bastion was only recently found but the line of the wall from blomfield street to moorgate largely comprises late nineteenthcentury office accommodation bethlehem hospital or bedlam was once built against the north side of the wall but that too has disappeared yet it is impossible not to feel the presence or force of the wall as you walk down this straightened thoroughfare which can be dated to the later period of the roman occupation a new london wall then opens up after moorgate built over the ruins of the second world war the bombs themselves effectively uncovered longburied remnants of the ancient wall and stretches both of roman and medieval origin can still be seen covered with grass and moss but these old stones are flanked by the glittering marble and polished stone of the new buildings that dominate the city around the site of the great roman fort at the northwest angle of the wall there now arise these new fortresses and towers roman house britannic tower city tower alban gate which by the slightest substitution might be renamed albion gate and the concrete and granite towers of the barbican which have once more brought a sublime bareness and brutality to that area where the roman legions were sequestered even the walkways of this great expanse are approximately the same height as the parapets of the old city wall the wall then turns south and long sections of it can still be seen on the western side sloping down towards aldersgate for most of its course from aldersgate to newgate and then to ludgate it remains invisible but there are suggestive tokens of its progress the great beast of classical antiquity the minotaur has been sculpted just to its north in postmans park the mottled and darkened blocks of the sessions house beside the old bailey still mark the outer perimeter of the walls defences and in amen court a later wall looking on the back of the old bailey is like some revenant of brick and mortar from the rear of st martins ludgate we cross ludgate hill enter pilgrim street and walk beside pageantmaster court where now the lines of the city thames link parallel those once made by the swiftly moving river fleet until we reach the edge of the water where the wall once abruptly stopped the wall enclosed an area of some acres to walk its perimeter would have taken approximately one hour and the modern pedestrian will be able to cover the route in the same time the streets beside it are still navigable and in fact the larger part of the wall itself was not demolished until until that time the city had the appearance of a fortress and in the sagas of iceland it was known as lundunaborg london fort it was continually being rebuilt as if the integrity and identity of the city itself depended upon the survival of this ancient stone fabric churches were erected beside it and hermits guarded its gates those with more secular preoccupations built houses or wooden huts against it so that everywhere you could see and perhaps smell the peculiar combination of rotten wood and mildewed stone a contemporary equivalent may be seen in the old brick arches of nineteenthcentury railways being used as shops and garages even after its demolition the wall still lived its stone sides were incorporated into churches or other public buildings one section in coopers row was used to line the vaults of a bonded warehouse while above ground its course was used as a foundation for houses the late eighteenthcentury crescent by america square designed by george dance the younger in the s for example is established upon the ancient line of the wall so later houses dance upon the ruins of the old city fragments and remnants of the wall were continually being rediscovered in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when the succeeding phases of its existence were first seen steadily and as a whole on the eastern side of the wall were found in for example eight skeletons of late roman date turned in different directions there were also unearthed the skeletons of several dogs this is the area known as houndsditch it is often believed that the roman wall first defined roman london but the invaders were in command of london for years before walls were built and during that long stretch of time the city itself evolved in particular sometimes bloody sometimes fierystages in bc a military force under the command of caesar invaded britain and within a short time compelled the tribes around london to accept roman hegemony almost a hundred years later the romans returned with a more settled policy of invasion and conquest the troops may have crossed the river at westminster or southwark or wallingford temporary encampments may have been established in mayfair or at the elephant and castle it is important for this account only that the administrators and commanders finally chose london as their principal place of settlement because of the strategic advantages of the terrain and the commercial benefits of this riverine location whether the romans occupied an abandoned settlement its tribal occupants having fled on wooden trackways into the swamps and forests is not known it seems likely in any event that the invaders understood the significance of the site from the beginning of their occupation here was an estuary served by a double tide so it became the central point for seaborne trade in the south of britain and the focus for a network of roads which have survived for almost two thousand years the outlines of that first city have been revealed by excavation with two principal streets of gravel running parallel to the river on the eastern hill one of these streets skirted the bank of the thames and can still be traced in the alignment of cannon street and eastcheap the second road some hundred yards to the north comprises the eastern stretch of lombard street as it approaches fenchurch street here are the true origins of the modern city and then there was the bridge the wooden roman bridge was located approximately one hundred yards east of the first stone london bridge spanning the area west of st olavs church in southwark and the foot of rederes pudding lane upon the northern bank the exact date of its foundation cannot now be known but it would have seemed a majestic and even miraculous construction not least to the native peoples who had settled under the romans half the legends of london arose upon its foundations miracles were performed and visions seen upon the new wooden thoroughfare since its sole purpose was to tame the river it may then have harnessed the power of a god yet that god may have been enraged at the stripping of its riverine authority thus all the intimations of vengeance and destruction invoked by the famous rhyme london bridge is broken down it is not clear whether londinium was first used as a roman military camp certainly it soon became a centre of supplies in its first stages we must imagine a cluster of small dwellings with clay walls thatched roofs and earthen floors narrow alleys ran between them with a series of streets connecting the two main thoroughfares filled with the smells and noises of a busy community there were workshops taverns shops and smithies crowded together while beside the river warehouses and workshops were grouped around a square timber harbour evidence for such a harbour has been found in billingsgate along the thoroughfares which every traveller to london used there were taverns and tradesmen just beyond the city were round huts in the old british style which were used as places for storage while on the perimeter of the city were wooden enclosures for cattle only a few years after its foundation which can be approximately dated between ad and the roman historian tacitus could already write of london as filled with negotiatores and as a place well known for its commercial prosperity so in less than a decade it had progressed from a supply base into a flourishing town negotiatores are not necessarily merchants but men of negotium business and negotiation they can be described as traders and brokers thus the line of continuityit might almost be called the line of harmonycan still be traced the shining buildings which now stand upon the roman wall contain brokers and dealers who are the descendants direct or indirect of those who came to london in the first century the city has always been established upon the imperatives of money and of trade that is why the headquarters of the procurator the high roman official who controlled the finances of the province were erected here london is based upon power therefore it is a place of execution and oppression where the poor have always outnumbered the rich many terrible judgements of fire and death have visited it barely a decade after its foundation a great fire of london utterly destroyed its buildings in ad boudicca and her tribal army laid waste the city with flame and sword wreaking vengeance upon those who were trying to sell the women and children of the iceni as slaves it is the first token of the citys appetite for human lives the evidence of boudiccas destruction is to be found in a red level of oxidised iron among a layer of burnt clay wood and ash red is londons colour a sign of fire and devastation there was at least one other tribal attack upon the roman city at the end of the third century but by that time the city and its defences were strong immediately after the boudiccan assault the work of rebuilding was begun if you were to stand now at the great crossroads in the city where gracechurch street divides lombard street from fenchurch street you would be facing the main entrance of the romans public forum with shops and stalls and workshops on either side the new forum was constructed of ragstone from kent carried by boat up the medway and with its plastered surfaces and its roofs of red tiles was a small fragment of rome placed upon an alien soil yet the influence of roman civilisation was enduring in more than one respect the chief cashiers office in the eighteenthcentury bank of england was based upon the design of a roman temple very like the basilica situated to the left of the early forum throughout the centuries london has been celebrated or denounced as a new romecorrupt or mighty according to tasteand it can safely be said that part of its identity was created by its first builders london began to grow and flourish a greater forum and a greater basilica were built upon the same site in the late first century the basilica itself was larger than st pauls wrens seventeenthcentury cathedral on ludgate hill a great fort was built to the northwest where the barbican now stands there were public baths and temples and shops and stalls there was an amphitheatre where the guildhall now rests and just south of st pauls a racing arena by the strange alchemy of the city a name knightrider street has survived for almost two thousand years we can find evidence of further survival in the line if not the name of other streets at the corner of ironmonger lane and prudent passage traces of a roman road passing from east to west have been uncovered together with the alignment of structures against it at least seven successive buildings all apparently engaged in the same kind of industrial activity were erected upon that same alignment there was an interval of destruction caused by fire and then a gap of some five hundred years until new buildings were erected upon the base of the old roman road in the early ninth century by the twelfth century when the name of ironmonger lane enters recorded history the buildings still followed the northern edge of the street laid out more than a thousand years before the same buildings were in use until the seventeenth century providing evidence of perhaps unequalled continuity in the life of the city we can cite many of the ancient streets in this vicinitymilk street wood street aldermanbury among themas the visible remnants of a roman street horizon it is suggestive also that the great markets of london at cheapside and east cheap lay until recent years on the thoroughfares established by the romans on their first arrival in the space of fifty years by the end of the first century london had acquired its destiny it became the administrative and political capital of the country as well as its trading centre the focus of communication and commercial activity it was governed by imperial laws concerning trade marriage and defence laws that survived the passing of the romans themselves it was in all essentials a citystate with its own independent government albeit in direct relationship to rome that independence and autonomy will be found to mark much of its subsequent history during the strongest period of its growth at the end of the first century the city would have possessed some thirty thousand inhabitants there were soldiers and merchants and businessmen artisans and artists celts and romans all mingled together there were grand houses for the wealthier merchants and administrators but the standard house of most londoners was a form of cubicle or bedsittingroom its walls painted or decorated with mosaic sometimes we can even hear the people speak there are surviving letters dealing with matters of finance and of trade as might be expected but there are also less formal communications primus has made ten tiles enough austalis has been taking off on his own every day for the last fortnight for shame london next door to the temple of isis clementinus fashioned this tile these are the earliest known words of a londoner scratched upon pieces of tile or pottery and fortuitously preserved among all the ruins that have been heaped over the citys earth more pious memorials have also been found with inscriptions for the dead and invocations to the gods the stamps for the labels of an optician have been uncovered proffering remedies for running eyes for inflammation and for dim sight our own sight of the past may be cleared a little if we are able to reconstruct the scattered evidence of the remains a great hand of bronze thirteen inches long was found beneath thames street a head of the emperor hadrian again more than lifesize in the waters of the thames itself so we may imagine a city adorned with great statues fragments of a triumphal arch have been recovered together with stone frescoes of goddesses and gods this is a city of temples and monumental architecture there were public baths also and one lay in north audley street quite a long way outside the city when workmen of the late nineteenth century discovered it in an underground arched chamber it was still halffilled with water votive statues and daggers sacred urns and silver ingots swords and coins and altars all express the spirit of a city in which trade and violence were not divorced from a genuine religious spirit but there is significance also in the smallest detail more than a hundred styli have been found at the bottom of the walbrook river where countless busy clerks simply threw used pens out of the window it is an image of bustling life which would not be inappropriate in any period of londons history yet the security and prosperity of london are not at this early date so certain like an organic being london grew and developed outwards always seeking to incorporate new territory but it also suffered periods of weariness and enervation when the spirit of the place hid its head we may find tokens of just such a change by those same eastern banks of the walbrook where the clerks of the empire tossed their pens into the water here was discovered in the remains of a temple devoted to mithras and subsequently to other pagan deities it was not uncommon for roman londoners to embrace a variety of faiths there is good evidence for example that the beliefs of the original celtic tribes were incorporated into a peculiar romanoceltic form of worship but the mithraic mystery cult with its rites of initiation and the secrets of its arcane ritual seems at least in theory to presage a more disturbed and anxious city the most resourceful period of roman london lay in the years spanning the first and second centuries but these were followed by an uneven period combining development and decline that decline was in part associated with the two great titular spirits of london fire and plague but there was also a steady alteration of imperial rule as the empire itself weakened and decayed in approximately ad some fifty years before the temple of mithras was erected the great wall was constructed around london it speaks of an age of anxiety but the very fact of its erection suggests that the city still had formidable resources of its own large areas within the wall were unoccupied or used for pasture but there were fine temples and houses in the more fashionable district close to the river the first london mint was established in the third century testifying once again to the citys true nature in that century too a riverine wall was constructed to complete the citys defences what then was the nature and activity of the citizens themselves in the last decades of roman london they would be largely of romanobritish descent and there were occasions when they were ruled by a british king but london has from its inception always been a mixed city and the streets would have been filled with the inhabitants of many nations including the native celtic tribes who over three hundred years had naturally grown accustomed to the new order this roman city spanned a period as long as that from the late tudors to the present day but we have in general only the silent evidence of scattered cups and dice bath scrapers and bells writing tablets and millstones brooches and sandals how can we make these objects live again there were of course in the passages of this long history periods of turbulence and warfare many have gone unrecorded but one or two powerful incidents survive the darkness breaks and a scene presents itself frozen for a moment throwing into further confusion and mystery the historical process of which it is a part a roman leader named allectus sailed to britain in order to put down a local rebellion having defeated the rebels he set up his headquarters in london a celtic chieftain asclepiodotus in turn marched against the imperial victor outside the city there was a great battle in which the british were successful the remaining roman troops fearing massacre fled within the walls and closed the gates siege engines were brought and a breach was made in the defences the celts poured in and the leader of the last legion begged for mercy it was agreed that the romans could withdraw and take to their ships but one tribe or group of tribesmen reneged on the agreement they fell upon the roman soldiers decapitated them in ritual celtic style and according to the narrative of geoffrey of monmouth threw their heads into a brook in the city in saxon galobroc many skulls were in the s found in the bed of the longburied walbrook river the rest is silence but we cannot from the evidence of this single anecdote assume that the history of london is one of warring tribes against a common roman enemy all the evidence suggests otherwise and instead intimates a degree of mingling maintained by mutual trade that encouraged an almost unbroken continuity of commerce and administration there would by now be something of a london type perhaps with that particular muddy complexion which became characteristic in later years no doubt the citizens spoke a latin patois which included native elements and their religious beliefs would have been equally mixed and idiosyncratic the mithraic temple is only one example of a mystery religionpredominantly the reserve of merchants and professional administratorsbut the christian faith was not unknown in ad a certain restitus attended the council of arles in his capacity as bishop of london the citys economic activity was equally mixed and practical the commercial and military quarters were still in active operation but the archaeological evidence suggests that many public buildings were allowed to fall into disuse and earth was laid over once inhabited sites for the purposes of farming it may seem odd to have farms and vineyards within the walls of the city but even as late as the time of henry ii half of london was open ground with fields orchards and gardens adorning it there is also evidence in the third and fourth centuries of quite large stone buildings which were conceivably farmhouses we might then have the paradox of rural landowners within the city itself certainly the city was still formidable enough to withstand the attentions of marauding tribes in ad the attacotti laid waste to much of kent without daring to make an onslaught upon london itself but in rome withdrew its protecting hand like the hand found beneath thames street it was of bronze rather than of gold there are reports of raids against the city by angles and saxons but there is no record of any great collapse or transition there is however some evidence of decay there was once a bathhouse in lower thames street which in the early fifth century was abandoned the glass was shattered and the wind destroyed the roof then at a later date after the collapse of the roof the walls of the eastern range of buildings were systematically demolished found among the debris was a saxon brooch dropped by a woman while clambering over these alien ruins the arrival of the saxons has been dated to the beginning of the fifth century when according to the historian gildas the land of britain was licked by a red and savage tongue within certain cities in the midst of the streets lay the tops of lofty towers tumbled to the ground stones of high walls holy altars fragments of human bodies but in fact the angles and the saxons were already living in the london region and it is clear from the archaeological evidence that by the late fourth century troops of germanic origin were guarding london as legionnaires under the imperial banner it was once assumed however that the arrival of the saxons resulted in the destruction and desertion of the city itself in fact there was no fiery carnage in the london area from which rome retreated on several sites has been found a layer of dark earth which was believed to indicate dereliction and decay but contemporary experts have suggested that levels of dark soil may point to occupation rather than destruction there is other evidence of the continuous habitation of london during that period once known as the dark ages in one of those extraordinary instances of historical survival it has been shown that the provisions of london law in the roman period particularly in terms of testamentary provisions and property rightswere still being applied throughout the medieval period there was in other words a continuous administrative tradition which no saxon occupation had interrupted the old chronicles assert that london remained the principal city and stronghold of the britons in the histories of nennius and gildas geoffrey of monmouth and bede it is regularly cited as an independent town which is also the home of the british kings it is the place where sovereigns were made and acclaimed and it is the site where the citizens were called together in public assembly it is also the chief place of defence when on various occasions the britons fled within the safety of the walls it is the seat of the british and roman nobility as well as representing one of the great sees of the christian realm the ancient british kingsvortigern vortimer and uther among themare depicted as reigning and living in london yet in these early chronicles the distance between factual interpretation and fanciful reconstruction is short in these accounts for example merlin makes many prophecies concerning the future of the city another great figure who exists somewhere within the interstices of myth and history is also to be found in london king arthur according to matthew of westminster arthur was crowned by the archbishop of london layamon adds that he entered london after his investiture the mark of this urban civilisation was its sophistication geoffrey of monmouth for example celebrates the affluence and courtesy of arthurs subjects as well as the richness of decorative art everywhere apparent in malorys great prose epic derived from several original sources known as le morte darthur there are many references to london as the principal city of the realm at a time of foreboding after the death of uther pendragon merlyn wente to the archebisshop of caunterbury and counceilled hym for to sende for all the lordes of the reame and alle the gentilmen of armes that they shold to london come and gather in the grettest chirch of londonwhether it were powlis or not the frensshe booke maketh no mencyon in later books the feir maiden of astolat is laid beside the thames sir launcelot rides from westminster to lambeth across the same river and guenevere cam to london and toke the towre of london the less controversial documents of historians and chroniclers add detail to this picture of legendary munificence ecclesiastical records reveal that a synod was held either in london or verulamium in since the assembly was called to denounce the heresies of a british monk pelagius it is clear that there was still a thriving religious culture in the regions bordering upon london some twelve years later according to a contemporaneous chronicle the provinces of britain accepted saxon domination although that source is silent on the fate of london it seems to have retained its independence as a citystate by the middle of the sixth century however the city can be assumed to have accepted saxon rule large parts of the walled area were employed as pasture and the great public buildings were no doubt used as marketplaces or stockades for cattle or as open spaces for the wooden houses and shops of a population living among the monumental ruins of what was already a distant age there is a wonderful saxon poem on the material remnants of just such a british city they are enta geweorc the works of giants the shattered memorials to a great race which passed away hund cnecta hundred generations ago in the description of broken towers and empty halls of fallen roofs and deserted bathhouses there is a combination of sorrow and wonder there are intimations here also of another truth the stone fabric of this ancient city has been dissolved by wyrde or destiny and age it has not been violently attacked or pillaged by marauders the saxons were not necessarily destroyers therefore and this poem displays a genuine reverence for antiquity and for a beohrtan burg bright city where heroes once dwelled we can infer in turn the lineaments of saxon london a cathedral church was built here and the palace of the king was maintained on a site now claimed by wood street and aldermanbury seventhcentury records mention a kings hall in london and two centuries later it was still known as that illustrious place and royal city the location of the royal palace beside the old roman fort in the northwest of the city suggests that its fortifications had also been maintained but there is even more striking evidence of continuity one of the most important archaeological discoveries of recent years has been that of a roman amphitheatre upon the site of the present guildhall this is exactly the location where the saxons were known to hold their folkmoots in an area always specified as being to the northeast of the cathedral it seems certain therefore that the saxon citizens used the ancient roman amphitheatre for their own deliberations it throws a suggestive and curious light upon their relationship to a remote past that they should sit and argue upon stone rows erected more than two centuries before it is no less suggestive of course that the modern guildhall is erected upon the same site there is evidence at the least for administrative permanence it seems very likely in turn that the great walled city was known as the centre of authority and of power this would help to explain the location of the thriving saxon town lundenwicwic meaning marketplacein the area now known as covent garden a typical saxon community in other words had grown up just beyond the walls of the powerful city we may imagine several hundred people living and working in an area from covent garden to the thames their kilns and pottery have lately been found together with dress pins and glass beakers combs stone tools and weights for their looms a butchery site has been excavated in exeter street off the strand and farm buildings in trafalgar square all the evidence suggests that a flourishing commercial area was therefore surrounded by small settlements of farmers and labourers the names and sites of saxon villages are still to be heard within the districts of a much greater london kensington paddington islington fulham lambeth and stepney among them the very shape and irregular street line of park lane are determined by the old acre strips of the saxon farmers long acre too reflects that pastoral tradition it was an extended community therefore and it may have been of lundenwicrather than of londonthat bede spoke when he described it as situated on the banks of the thames a trading centre for many nations who visit it by land and sea documents dated are concerned with the trade regulations to be observed by the men of kent when they barter in lundenwic gold coins stamped londuniu were being used in the same period so that there was no necessary disparity between administrative london and commercial lundenwic similarly a continual process of assimilation and absorption was maintained between erstwhile britons and saxon settlers achieved by intermarriage and peaceful commerce the evidence for this lies in the most reliable of sources language itself since many old british words are to be found in saxon english among them are basket button coat gown wicket and wire so it can be surmised that skill in textile and wickerwork can best be attributed to the britons another english word testifies to the mixed nature of london the name walbrook is derived from weala broc brook of the welsh which suggests that there was still a defined quarter for the old britons in their ancient city bede had said that londuniu was the capital of the east saxons but over the period of middle saxon rule the city seems to have accepted the authority of any king who was dominant within the regionamong them kings of kent wessex and mercia it might almost be regarded as the commercial reward for any successful leader together with the fact that the walled city was also the traditional seat of authority given this changing pattern of sovereignty however it is not perhaps surprising that the main source of continuity lay within the christian church in four years after the arrival of augustine pope gregory proclaimed london to be the principal bishopric in all britain three years later ethelbert of kent erected the cathedral church of st pauls there follows a bare chronicle of ecclesiastical administration in the year when st pauls was erected augustine archbishop of britain consecrated mellitus as bishop of london the citizens then formally became christian but thirteen years later mellitus was expelled after a change of royal rule the innate paganism of london for a while reasserted itself before being eventually restored to the roman communion and then came the danes they had plundered lindisfarne and jarrow before turning their attention to the south the anglosaxon chronicle records that in there was great slaughter in london a battle in which the vikings were beaten back nine years later they returned and having pillaged canterbury sailed up the thames and with a fleet of ships fell upon london the city wall along the river may well have been already in ruinous condition but even if the saxons had been able to mend it the defences were not enough to withstand the army of invaders london was entered and pillaged many of the citizens may already have fled those who remained were put to the sword if viking custom was followed and their huts or shops consigned to the flame some historians have considered that the events of marked a decisive moment in londons history but this is perhaps to misunderstand the nature of a city which is perpetually rising from flame and ruin indeed it has been defined throughout its history by such resurrections the invaders returned sixteen years later their great army moved through mercia and east anglia intent upon capturing wessex in they built a camp near london no doubt to protect their warships along the river and it seems likely that their purpose was to control london and the thames basin in order to exact tribute from neighbouring kingdoms certainly they occupied the city itself which was used as a military garrison and storage base here they remained for fourteen years this was not a bare ruined city therefore as some have suggested but once more a busy centre of administration and supply the norse commander halfdere minted his own silver coinage which interestingly enough is based upon roman originals the tradition of literal moneymaking in london had been preserved since that distant period testifying once again to the organic continuity of its financial life coins were minted in london for alfred in his role as client king of wessex the native inhabitants may not have been as fortunate as alfred from the evidence of coin hoards buried in the first year of norse occupation the richer citizens ran for their lives along with every other englishman who was able to flee then in alfred engaged in some form of siege mustering an english army outside the walls of the city london was the great prize and three years later alfred obtained it it was in fact in the city itself that his sovereignty over the whole region was formally advertised when all the english people that were not under subjection to the danes submitted to him london was still the emblem of power in other words even after its occupation by the norsemen the danes sued for peace and were allocated territory to the east of the river lea london became a frontier town therefore and alfred initiated a scheme of resettlement and fortification the walls were restored the quays rebuilt and all the activities of lundenwic brought within the defences of the revived city it is at this point that lundenwic passes into history as aldwych or old markettown london had once more become new since alfred instituted a scheme of works which might qualify as an early attempt at city planning he built a road just within the walls from aldgate to ludgate the outline of it still exists in the streets of the modern city the alignments of new streets were plotted close to the wharves of queenhithe and billingsgate he reestablished london and rendered it habitable certainly the city was powerful and formidable enough to withstand viking assaults in succeeding years the burgwara or citizens even marched out against them in and on that later occasion londoners sallied forth to destroy or plunder the enemy ships the fact that the vikings were unable to retaliate against london suggests the effectiveness of its defences the restoration of londons life and power might not have been all of alfreds doing although his native genius as a planner of cities suggests that he played a prominent role he had given lordship of london to his soninlaw ethelred and had granted lands within the walls to religious and secular magnates there then grew up that curious division or subdivision of land which is manifest today in the various wards and parishes of the city an area of london ground might have been defined by streams or by the course of roman remains but once apportioned to an english lord or bishop it became his especial soke or territory churches of wood or of limestone and sandstone were erected to bless and protect each welldefined area of londons earth these sacred edifices in turn became the focal point for small communities of tradesmen artificers and others the early tenth century was a period of peace although the citizen army of london assisted alfred in his efforts to free those british regions still held under the danelaw the historical records describe only the succession of mercian kings to the overlordship of london in there was a great fire succeeded by an outbreak of plague fever the cathedral church of st pauls was destroyed in the conflagration and once more we witness the periodic fate and fatality of the city there was another great fire twentyone years later and in the same year three viking ships attacked the coast of dorset the succeeding years were marked by a series of viking attacks upon the prosperous city no doubt the london mint with its reserves of silver was a particular attraction but the defences restored by alfred were strong enough to withstand a number of incursions in the danes sent a force of ninetyfive ships into the thames in order to blockade and assault the city but they were driven back by londons army according to the anglosaxon chronicle these citizens visited upon the danes more slaughter and harm than they ever supposed that townsmen could inflict it is important to recognise in the course of these battles and sieges that london itself had acquired its own army and therefore a measure of independent power it possessed the characteristics of a kingdom or a sovereign state which for many centuries it never wholly lost so the soldiers of london continually resisted the danes and there are records of them seizing the alien ships and rowing them back to the city they marched to oxford to assist their countrymen and although the viking raids occasionally swept within the vicinity of their walls the city stood firm indeed london still maintained its position as a flourishing port and in an icelandic poet recorded his impressions of the quayside where merchants from rouen flanders normandy liège and other regions paid a fixed toll upon their goods they brought in wool and cloth and planks and fish and melted fat a small ship paid a toll of one halfpenny and in turn the mariners bought pigs and sheep for their journey homewards in the danish leader sweyn commanded a full invasion force of scandinavian warriors and marched upon london because therein was king aethelred the citizens would not yield according to the anglosaxon chronicle but resisted with full battle it was not enough however and after a long siege they surrendered their city to the danes the reigning monarch fled but in the following year he returned with a most unlikely ally olaf of norway olafs norsemen manoeuvred their ships close to london bridge tied them to its wooden piles with ropes and cables then assisted by the tide strained at the wooden supports until they were dislodged and the bridge itself fell into the thames a notorious episode in the history of that great thoroughfare in recent years iron axes and swords have been found at this point in the river an icelandic saga suggests that the citizens seeing their river occupied by the enemys navy so as to cut off all intercourse that way with the interior provinces were seized with fear since they were being relieved of a temporary and alien king this is perhaps open to debate but the loss of the bridge was indeed a serious impediment to commerce and communications yet the saga ends happily or at least with an encomiumand thou hast overthrown their bridges oh thou storm of the sons of odin skilful and foremost in the battle for thee it was happily reserved to possess the land of londons winding city olaf himself was eventually beatified and in london were erected six churches to venerate his memory one by the southeastern corner of the bridge which he had once destroyed st olave in hart street where samuel pepys worshipped still stands during the next three years the english and the norse were engaged in a series of sieges and battles and assaults in this protracted warfare london remained the single most important site of power and authority after the death of aethelred in all the councillors who were in london and the citizens chose edmund as king again according to the anglosaxon chronicle which suggests that there was some kind of folkmoot where the king was chosen and saluted when cnut eventually won the crown in he extracted tribute from the whole nation but london was obliged to render oneeighth of the entire amount meanwhile a danish population trading peacefully settled outside the walls in the area once occupied by the saxons the church of st clement danes at the mouth of the strand marks the site of their occupation it is even possible that a tribal community of danes had lived and worked here for several generations but it was in the time of cnut that the wooden church was turned to stone it is also believed to be the burial place of harold harefoot the son of cnut and there is a runic monument which proclaims the fact that three danish leaders also lie in luntunum so once more we have evidence of a flourishing marketcentre dependent upon the walled city william of malmesbury suggests that the citizens of london after long familiarity with the danes had almost entirely adopted their customs this suggests a renewed history of assimilation one custom was thoroughly absorbed there was once a stone cross close by the church of st clement danes which marked a place of power and ritual here an open court assembled and it was at the stone cross that manorial dues were paid for one piece of land in the vicinity payment was given in horseshoes and iron nails it is sometimes believed that this is an obscure remembrance of a pagan rite but it has also become a modern one in the early twentyfirst century there is still a ritual of presenting six horseshoes and sixtyone hobnails in the court of exchequer within the law courts close to the site of the old cross itself as part of rent due to the crown so the danes and the londoners flourished during a period in which the historical narratives record only the actions of the citizens of london or the army of london as an independent and effectively selfgoverning community when the paleskinned and devout edward afterwards the confessor was anointed the anglosaxon chronicle records that all men chose him for king in london a legal statute in fact defined london qui caput est regni et legum semper curia domini regis as the source of law and royal rule chapter holy holy holy edward the confessor left a memorial more enduring than his familys fortunes he retired to a palace and established a monastery in westminster there had been a church there since the second century but london antiquarians have suggested that there was once a pagan shrine to apollo on the same site certainly a roman sarcophagus and a section of floor mosaic have been found in the immediate vicinity it was an area of great importance in any case since westminsteror more particularly thorney island upon which parliament and the abbey now restmarked the spot where the road from dover was united with watling street which proceeded northward at low tide it was possible to cross the river here and to ride along the great roman ways yet topography is not simply a matter of road alignments tothill fields beside westminster was part of a ritualised area of power and worship a document of describes it as that terrible place which is known as westminster terrible in this context meaning sacred or holy terror it is not inappropriate therefore that the founding of westminster abbey is enwrapped in dreams and visions the night before the hallowing of the first saxon church here in the seventh century st peter himself appeared to a fisherman and was ferried across the river from lambeth the venerable figure crossed the threshold of the new church and all at once it was illuminated by a light brighter than a thousand candles so began the history of the church of st peter edward the confessor was in turn granted a dream or vision which persuaded him to build a great abbey it became the repository of sand from mount sinai and earth from calvary a beam from the holy manger of jesus and pieces of his cross blood from christs side and milk from the virgin mary a finger from st paul and hair from st peter almost a thousand years later in this place william blake was granted a vision of monks chanting and proceeding down the central aisle a century before the poets sighting edward the confessor also reappeared a chorister came upon the broken coffin of the venerable king and drew from it a skull so the sainted king had turned into a deaths head it is perhaps an appropriate story for an abbey which has become londons city of the dead where the generations of kings and leaders and poets lie in silent communion as a token of that great mystery where past and present are mingled together it is the mystery and history of london west smithfield after the foundation of st bartholomewthegreat in the early twelfth century witnessed as many miracles as any similar plot in rome or jerusalem edward the confessor in a prophetic dream was informed that smithfield had already been chosen by god as a place for his worship edward journeyed there the next morning and foretold that the ground should be a witness to god in the same period three men from greece came on pilgrimage to london for already it had the renown of a sacred city they approached smithfield and falling prostrate upon the ground prophesied that there would be constructed a temple which shall reach from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof the book of the foundation of that great church of st bartholomew from which these words are taken was written in the twelfth century it has much material for contemplation but it also contains evidence relating to the piety of london and of londoners the founder of the church rahere was on a journey in italy when in a dream he was taken up by a beast with four feet and two wings to a high place where st bartholomew appeared to him and addressed him i by the will and command of all the high trinity and with the common favour and counsel of the court of heaven have chosen a spot in the suburb of london at smithfield rahere was to erect there a tabernacle of the lamb so he journeyed to the city where in conversation with some barons of london it was explained that the place divinely shown to him was contained within the kings market on which it was lawful neither for the princes themselves nor for the wardens of their own authority to encroach to any extent whatever so rahere sought an audience of henry i in order to explain his divine mission to the city the king graciously gave rahere title to the spot which was at that time a very small cemetery rahere then made himself a fool in order to recruit assistants in the great work of building he won to himself bands of children and servants and by their help he easily began to collect together stones these stones came from many parts of london and in that sense the narrative of construction is a true representation of the fact that st bartholomews was a collective work and vision of the city it became in literal form its microcosm so the church rose and many priests gathered to live under regular rule with the founder as prior beginning with its first foundation when a light sent from heaven gleamed over the church and remained over it for the space of an hour there were so many miraculous events within its walls that the chronicler declares that he will mention only those which he himself has witnessed wolmer a cripple who supported himself on two little stools he dragged behind him was carried to st bartholomews in a basket and falling before the altar was healed a certain woman of the parish of st john had her enfeebled limbs cured and wymonde that was dumb began to speak many of these miracles occurred on the day of the feast of st bartholomew so there was a continual awareness of sacred time in the city as well as sacred place miraculous cures were also performed in the hospital of the church now st bartholomews hospital so st bartholomews is a temple of the holy spirit which has endured for almost nine hundred years when some citizens of london were on a long voyage to the remote ends of the world they were threatened with shipwreck but they comforted each other with the words what do we with little faith fear who have the good bartholomew the accomplisher of so many great marvels set nigh to us in london he will not hide the bowels of his mercy from his fellow citizens in the oratory of the church was an altar hallowed to the honour of the most blessed and perpetual virgin mary here the virgin appeared to one lay brother and declared i will receive their prayers and vows and will grant them mercy and blessing for ever that oratory survives still but it is by no means an object of pilgrimage st bartholomews church is now largely ignored set back from the circular road which connects the meat market to the hospital and which forms the perimeter of the old bartholomew fair yet bartholomew himself might still be considered as one of the sacred guardians of the city and even at the beginning of the twentyfirst century there are ten streets or roads which bear his name london was once a holy city therefore and of smithfield we read awful therefore is this place to him that understands here is nothing else but the house of god and the gate of heaven to him that believes this invocation is echoed by other visionaries and mystics of london here in the very grimy and malodorous streets of the city the gate of heaven can be opened there are in london many holy wells of healing although most were long ago filled in or demolished the ancient well of st clement lies beneath the law courts chads well is buried beneath st chads street the well of barnet was covered first by a workhouse and then by a hospital so its air of healing was not thoroughly dispelled in the same spirit the curiously named but efficacious perilous pond lay beside st lukes hospital in old street a healing well that was guarded by monks near cripplegate is still recalled by the name of monkwell street while black marys well has been transformed into the area still known as bagnigge wells beside farringdon road the only ancient well still to be seen is the clerks well now protected by a glass window a few yards north of clerkenwell green here for many centuries were staged miracle plays as well as more secular bouts of wrestling and jousting the holy well of shoreditchcommemorated by holy well row and holy well lanemarks the site of one of the first english theatres erected in by james burbage more than twenty years before the globe sadlers well was also a pleasure garden and later a theatre so the holy spirit of the wells in a fashion appropriate to london turned into theatre hermits were often chosen to be the guardians of the wells but their principal stewardship was of the gates and crossroads of the city they collected the tolls and dwelt in the very bastions of london wall in a sense then they were the protectors of london itself professing by their vocation that this was a city of god as well as a city of men this was the theory at least but it is clear that many were hermits by device rather than by profession the author of piers the plowman william langland condemned them as grete lobyes and longe that loth were to swynke or impostors who were simply unwilling to work in for example william blakeney was convicted at the guildhall for going about barefooted and with long hair under the guise of sanctity nevertheless the picture of london surrounded as it were with hermits who lived in their small stone oratories keeping vigils and reciting orisons is an arresting one the figure of the hermit has another significance also the stories of the city throughout the centuries have been filled with lonely and isolated people who feel their solitude more intensely within the busy life of the streets they are what george gissing called the anchorites of daily life who return unhappy to their solitary rooms the early city hermits may therefore be regarded as an apt symbol for the way of life of many londoners an extension of that hermitic spirit can be traced in the four churches of st botolph which guarded four of the citys gates botolph was a seventhcentury saxon hermit who was especially associated with travellers so the wanderer and the interior exile are seen as part of the same short pilgrimage among the streets of london but those streets can also be filled with prayer there was in marylebone before the redevelopment of lisson grove a paradise street approached by grotto passage in the immediate vicinity were vigil place and chapel street perhaps here we have evidence of an ancient hermitage or sacred spot linking the city to eternity in the immediate vicinity of st pauls are to be found pater noster row ave maria lane amen court and creed lane here we may usefully imagine a procession through various streets in which particular prayers or responses were chanted so the old churches of london maintain their ancient presence and seem periodically to relive their histories that is why the area around st pancras old church for example still remains desolate and dreary it has always been an isolated and somewhat mysterious placewalk not there too late counselled one elizabethan topographer it is the traditional terminus for murderers suicides and those who were killed while fighting duels at chalk farm but no true resting place the corpses are continually being dug up and reburied the last great removal occurred in when the railway lines of st pancras station were laid through the site the tombstones were placed against a great tree the roots of which curl among them from a distance it would seem that the headstones are indeed the fruit of that tree ripe and ready to be gathered among these ancient memorials will be some to the catholic dead it was for them a holy place st pancras is believed to be the first christian church in england established by augustine himself and is reported to contain the last bell which was able to toll during the mass pancras has therefore been construed as pangrace a more likely derivation associated with the saintly boy named pancras is pan crucis or pan crossthe monogram or symbol of christ himself so we have a vatican historian maximilian misson asserting that st pancras under highgate near london is the head and mother of all christian churches who could imagine the source of such power in the wasteland north of kings cross station it has its bells like the other london churches the bells of st stephen rochester row were named blessing glory wisdom thanksgiving honour power might and be unto our god for ever and ever amen alleluiah we do not necessarily need the evidence of the famous nursery rhyme to realise that the bells were a familiar and friendly presence in the life of londoners you owe me five farthings say the bells of st martins when will you pay me say the bells at old bailey in the meteorological office reported that before the sound of motorcars entered the already crowded streets the bells of st marylebow in cheapside would have been audible all over london in a true sense then every londoner was a cockney yet the east end may lay an especial claim to that honorific perhaps since the oldest business in that area is the whitechapel bell foundry which was established in the fifteenth century citizens used to bet which parish could make its bells heard at the greatest distance and it was said that bellringing was a salutary way of keeping warm in winter it was sometimes surmised that at the last judgement the angels would peal the bells of london rather than sound their trumpets in order to convince the citizens that the day of doom had truly arrived the bells were part of the sound and texture of its life when the protagonist of george orwells recalls the famous song with its mention of st clements and st martins bow and shoreditch he seems to hear the bells of a lost london that still existed somewhere or other disguised and forgotten some of the bells of that lost london can still be heard the early middle ages a map of london drawn by chronicler and illuminator matthew paris in it shows the tower st pauls and westminster chapter you be all law worthy in the last month of william duke of normandy marched down st giles high street before turning south to westminster he had already savaged southwark and now intended to lay siege to london wall by ludgate which was then the principal entrance to the city it was commonly said at the time that london neither fears enemies nor dreads being taken by storm because of its defences but in fact after some form of secret treaty or negotiations certain saxon nobles opened the gate williams troops made their way to st pauls and cheapside but then in platea urbisan open space or wide streetthey were attacked by a group or perhaps even an army of citizens who refused to countenance the entry of the foreign leader a late eleventhcentury chronicler william of jumieges records that the norman forces at once engaged them in battle causing no little mourning to the city because of the very many deaths of her own sons and citizens eventually the londoners capitulated but their action demonstrates that they considered themselves to dwell in an independent city which could withstand foreign invasion on this occasion they were mistaken but for the next three hundred years londoners would assert their sovereignty as members of a citystate the battle of london however was over eleven bodies have recently been recovered just southwest of ludgate with some suggestion that they had been dismembered while a hoard of several thousand coins of that period was found by the walbrook the new monarchs primary task was to subjugate the city work began on three military stockades at various points on the perimeter wallmontfichet tower baynards castle and against the southeast section of the wall a structure that has since become known as the tower of london but the tower never belonged to london and was considered by the citizens to be an affront or threat to their liberty in the making of london sir laurence gomme contemplates their displeasure when they heard the taunts of the people who said that these walls had been built as an insult to them and that if any one of them should dare to contend for the liberty of the city he would be shut up in them and consigned to imprisonment after a great fire in which like its predecessors seems to have devastated much of the city a stone tower was built in place of the original fortification it took more than twenty years to complete and pressed labour from the neighbouring shires was used in its construction it was called the white tower and rose some ninety feet in the air to emphasise its power over the city elaborate rituals were drawn up in order to formalise the presence of londons leaders in the tower for judicial or administrative purposes but it remained outside their jurisdiction built of alien material creamcoloured caen stone from normandy it was a visible token of foreign rule william was also graciously pleased to grant a charter to london on a tiny parchment less than six inches in length it is written in anglosaxon and french addressed to the chiefs of the city it granted to london rights that the city already possessed and had had since the days of roman domination i do you to know that i will that you be all law worthy that were in king edwards day runs the translation and i will that every child be his fathers heir after his fathers day and i will not endure that any man offer any wrong to you god keep you it may seem innocuous but as gomme suggests in the governance of london it represents an entirely new constitutional factor in the history of london londoners were to be allowed to live under the rule of law that the city itself had established the king was asserting his sovereignty over the ancient governance of london william had however recognised the one central factthat this city was the key both to his own fortunes and to those of the country he had conquered that is why he had inaugurated the transition of london from the status of an independent citystate to that nations capital in the domesday survey left london uninspected no doubt on the ground that the complex financial and commercial activity within the city could not usefully be considered as part of the kings revenue at the same time the norman king and his successors initiated an inspired plan of public works in order to emphasise the central place of london in the new politics the cathedral of st paul was rebuilt and williams successor his son william rufus began the construction of westminster hall a number of monastic houses and nunneries together with priories and hospitals were also erected in this period so that london and its environs were the site of prolonged and continual construction the building and rebuilding have been maintained ever since the area around the roman amphitheatre for example was cleared in the early twelfth century in the same area the first guildhall was completed by and a second built in the early fifteenth century the earliest form of public administration was the folkmoot which met three times a year in the roman amphitheatre and then latterly by st pauls cross there was also a more formal court known as the hustings these institutions were of the greatest antiquity dating to saxon and danish times when the city was autonomous and selfgoverning the territorial divisions of london still in existence were also of very early date by the eleventh century the principal unit of territory had become the ward which was led and represented by an alderman the ward was more than a collection of citizens administering their own streets and shops it was also a unit of defence and attack with a midsummer inspection when according to an official document dating from the reign of henry viii evy alderman by hymself musteryd hys owne warde yn the fields vewyng theym in harnes and sawe that evy man had a sworde and a dagger and suche as were not meate to be archars were turnyd to pykes as late as the fourteenth century a clerk could term london a respublica and in this account of a carefully marshalled citizen army it is possible to trace the force and antiquity of the republican ideal but if the ward boundaries were the most significant within the city they were not necessarily the most distinctive beneath the ward were the precincts with their own assemblies and below them the individual parishes with their selfgoverning vestries the city embodied a series of intricately related authorities and that network of affiliations and interests has materially affected its life throughout the nineteenth century for example there were continual complaints about the rigidity and stubbornness of the city authorities this resistance to change was the legacy of a thousand years affecting and obscuring the capital as powerfully as its coalsmoke and its fog it is also the setting in which succeeding events are best understood william the conquerors successor william rufus was characterised by his attempt to impose ever more extortionate taxes and dues and tolls on the citizens in his struggles with the norman barons ensconced in england it was also rufuss custom to send prisoners to be executed in london it was a token of its role as capital perhaps but also of the kings authority after the death of rufus in his brother henry i hastened to the city in order to be acclaimed as the new sovereign the records of his reign include a list of aldermen from which displays so comprehensive a mixture of english and french names that a thoroughly ordered and working association between citizens who were now properly londoners can be assumed in fact the study of the names of londoners becomes of extreme interest and significance in this period as old english names are gradually supplanted by those of french origin surnames were by no means universal but were attached to a person because of locality or occupationgodwinus baker was thus distinguished from godwin ladubur moneyer and godwyn turk fishmonger or godwinne worstede mercer and godwynne sall hatter other citizens were identified by patronymics or more commonly by nicknames edwin atters name meant edwin of the sharp tongue while robert baddings implied an effeminate man hugh fleg was wide awake johannes flocc had woolly hair john godale sold good ale while thomas gotsaul was honest even as they associated with each other in trade and commerce however the relationship of the citizens with the king became more problematic for him the city was predominantly a place to be farmed for revenue the reason why henry rarely interfered in the life of london was simply that he needed it to prosper in order to benefit from its wealth after henrys death in the dynastic struggles of the various claimants to the throne were directly affected by the loyalties and allegiances of londoners henrys nephew stephen count of blois claiming the right of succession promptly came to london and the london folk received him and hallowed him king on midwinter day so says the anglosaxon chronicle and another ancient source adds that the alderman and wise folk gathered together the folkmoot and there providing at their own will for the good of the realm unanimously resolved to choose a king the citizens of london had in other words formally elected a king for the entire country it is not clear what stephen promised or granted the city in return but from this time forward it takes the first place in national affairs with a degree of independence which suggests that london is almost selfgoverning the coronation of stephen however was not in itself enough the landing in of his rival henrys daughter the empress matilda and his own capture at the battle of lincoln in meant that london was forced to choose again a great conference was held at winchester in order to consider the royal claims of matilda and a speech in her favour by stephens own brother was concluded with the following significant remarks we have despatched messengers for the londoners who from the importance of their city in england are almost nobles as it were to meet us on this business and have sent them a safeconduct they arrived on the following day saying that they had been sent a communione quam vocant londoniarumfrom the community or commune of london this testimony from william of malmesbury is the clearest possible evidence of the citys significance as the nation divided in baronial wars london had ceased to be a capital and had once again become a citystate the events of matildas short subsequent reign reinforce this impression she tried to curb the power of london and unwisely demanded money from its richest citizens that is why when stephens own queen maud approached london its inhabitants rushed into the streets according to gesta stephani with weapons like thronging swarms from beehives in order to support her matilda fled from the irate citizenry and never regained the throne a proviso must be entered here if only to dispel the impression of thorough independence when the national policy was disrupted by dynastic struggle then london naturally took the lead but in a peaceful wellordered kingdom the citizens equally naturally accepted the authority of the sovereign so it was that the reign of henry ii matildas son and stephens successor marked a slight diminution of the citys authority in his charter the king granted to londoners all their liberties and free customs which they had in the time of henry my grandfather but the royal sheriffs conducted much of the administration under the kings direct control the murder of thomas à becket in the winter of at canterbury for example ought to have been a matter for londoners the archbishop was known to his contemporaries as thomas of london and for many centuries he was the only londoner to be canonised his theatricality and flamboyance were also characteristic of the city but there is no evidence of any popular support for his cause among londoners perhaps he is one of those striking figures in the citys history who move beyond their immediate context into eternity yet it was beckets own twelfthcentury biographer william fitzstephen who celebrated the more earthly values of the city in that period his account is written in the new style of urban encomia since the formation of flourishing cities and the conduct of their citizens were then at the centre of european debate but fitzstephens depiction is nevertheless remarkable for its enthusiasm it is also highly significant as the first general description of london he describes the sound or clatter of the mills turned by streams in the meadows of finsbury and moorgate as well as the shouts and cries of the market vendors who have each their separate station which they take every morning there were many wine shops close by the thames to accommodate the local artisans as well as traders who came to the docks there was also a large public eatinghouse where servants could purchase bread and meat for their masters or where the local vendors could sit and eat fitzstephen also depicts the high and thick wall which surrounded and protected all this activity with its seven double gates and northern towers there was also a great fortress to the east the mortar used in the building being tempered with the blood of beasts and two strongly fortified castles on the western side beyond the walls were gardens and vineyards the mansions of the noble and the powerful interspersed among them these great houses were generally in the western suburbs where holborn is now situated while to the north were meadows and pastures which bordered upon an immense forest of which hampstead and highgate are the only remnants just beyond the city wall on the northwestern side was a smoothfield now known as smithfield where horses were sold every friday in paddocks close by oxen and pigs were also slaughtered and sold the same activity had taken place in precisely the same area for almost a thousand years fitzstephens account is distinctive for the emphasis he lays upon the energy combativeness and vivacity of the citizens there were games of football every evening in the fields outside the city when the young men were watched and cheered by their teachers parents or fellow apprentices upon each sunday at the same time there were games of combat when they rode against one another with lances and shields even in its sports london had a reputation as a violent city at easter a tree was fixed into the middle of the thames with a target hung upon it a boat was rowed hard against it carrying a young man with a lance if he missed the target he fell into the river to the amusement of the spectators in the coldest days of winter when the marshland of moorfields froze the more sportive citizens would sit upon great blocks of ice which were pulled along by their friends others fashioned skates from the shin bones of animals but again there was an element of competition and violence in their pursuit they skated towards each other until either one or both of them fall not without some bodily hurt and very frequently the leg or arm of the falling party was broken even the lessons and debates of schoolboys were characterised in combative terms with a steady stream of scoffs and sarcasms it was a world of bearbaiting and cockfighting somehow consonant with fitzstephens report that london could raise an army of men a world of violence and laughter mingled with what fitzstephen terms abundant wealth extensive commerce great grandeur and magnificence his is a portrait of a city celebrating its destiny it was a time therefore of prosperity and growth the docks were expanding as the waterfront was continually reclaimed and extended in order to accommodate the flemings and the french and the hanseatics as well as the merchants from brabant and rouen and ponthieu there was trade in fur wool wine cloth grain timber iron salt wax dried fish and a hundred other commodities to feed clothe and support an ever increasing population most of this population was itself busily engaged in commerce the furriers of walbrook the goldsmiths of guthruns lane the butchers of east cheap the shoemakers of cordwainer street the mercers in west chepe the fishmongers in thames street the woodmongers of billingsgate the candlestickmakers of lothbury the ironmongers of old jewry the cutlers of popes head alley the prayerbeadmakers of paternoster row the vintners of vintry all of them involved in perpetual trade the city was indeed a much noisier place than it is now filled with continual cries of porters and waterbearers as well as the general uproar of wagons and bells of blacksmiths and pewterers beating out their wares of porters and apprentices of carpenters and coopers working alongside each other in the same small area of lanes and alleys there was of course the smell as well as the noise concocted from tanneries and breweries slaughterhouses and vinegarmakers cookhouses and dungheaps as well as the ever flowing tide of refuse and water which ran down the middle of the narrower streets all this created a miasma of deep odours which could not be dispersed by even the most violent wind it was further enriched by the increased use of coal by brewers and bakers and metalforgers throughout this period too there was a continual process of building and rebuilding not one part of the city was untouched by this expansion as new shops and sleds or covered markets churches and monasteries houses of stone and timber were constructed when these layers of the city were excavated there lay revealed foundations of chalk and ragstone chalk cesspits arches of reigate stone building rubble beechwood piles oak timbers and threshold beams as well as the various impressions of walls drains floors vaults wells rubbishpits and stake holes they were evidence of protracted and productive activity there was also constant activity in the suburbs or fields just outside the walls in the twelfth century the great priories of clerkenwell and smithfield st john and st bartholomew were established while in the succeeding century the religious houses of austin friars st helen st clare and our lady of bethlehem were also founded the church of st pauls was rebuilt and the monastic hospital of st mary spital erected the white friars and the black friars completed their great religious houses within twenty years of each other in the west of the city this was the part of london in which there was the most heavy investment with vacant land being sold on the promise of immediate development while buildings and tenancies were continually being subdivided into more profitable units yet the grandest work in all the rebuilding was that of london bridge it rose in stone and became the great highway of commerce and communication which has remained upon the same site for almost nine hundred years on either side of the southern entrance to that bridge there now rear two griffins daubed in red and silver they are the totems of the city raised at all its entrances and thresholds and are singularly appropriate the griffin was the monster which protected gold mines and buried treasure it has now flown out of classical mythology in order to guard the city of london the presiding deity of this place has always been money thus did john lydgate write of london in the fifteenth century lacking money i might not spede alexander pope repeated his sentiments in the eighteenth invoking there londons voice get money money still the only inconveniences of london fitzstephen wrote are the immoderate drinking of foolish persons and the frequent fires in this he was prophetic as well as descriptive other observers at a slightly later date in the twelfth century however were more critical one yorkshire writer roger of howden reported that the sons of the wealthier citizens would assemble at night in large gangs in order to threaten or assault anyone who passed by a monk from winchester richard of devizes was more colourful in his condemnation for him london was a place of evil and wrongdoing filled with the worst elements of every race as well as native pimps and braggarts he referred to the crowded eating houses and taverns where dicing and gambling were customary it is perhaps significant that he also mentioned theatrum the theatre which suggests that the london appetite for drama was already being satisfied in forms other than those of the mystery or miracle plays staged at clerkenwell the first theatres of the theatre and the curtain may well descend from lost originals the monk also provided an interesting survey of the citys population comprising in part pretty boys effeminates pederasts they are joined by quacks bellydancers sorceresses extortioners nightwanderers magicians mimes in a panoply of urban life that would be celebrated rather than condemned in other centuries by writers as diverse as johnson and fielding congreve and smollett it is in other words the permanent condition of london william fitzstephen noted that the city is delightful indeed when it has a good governor the word itself might be construed as leader or master and has generally been taken to refer to the king yet in the years immediately succeeding his chronicle the term is susceptible to other interpretations there came a moment in the last decade of the twelfth century when it was shouted abroad that londoners shall have no king but their mayor this shortlived revolution was the direct consequence of a kings absence on crusade in palestine and europe richard i had come to london for his coronation and was anointed on the first sunday in september that was marked unlucky in the calendar indeed it proved very much so to the jews in london who were destroyed that day these cryptic words describe a mass slaughtercalled by richard of devizes a holocaustwhich has generally been scantily treated by historians it has often been said that the principal culprits were those who owed money to the jews but it is hard to overestimate the savagery of the london mob it represented a violent and ruthless society where the metaphor for the native population was that of bees swarming in angry clusters the multitude are busie bees according to the sixteenthcentury author of the singularities of the city of london their clamour according to thomas more in the same period was neyther loude nor distincke but as it were the sounde of a swarme of bees on this occasion the mob of bees stung the jews and their families to death in the absence of the king on his religious wars the leaders of london once more became the ascendant voice of england the animus and will of londoners were materially strengthened by the fact that richards representative william longchamp established himself in the tower and began to erect new fortifications around it it was a symbol of authority which was unwelcome when richards brother john aspired to the crown in the citizens of london assembled at a folkmoot in order to pronounce upon his claims at this significant moment they agreed to accept him as king as long as he in turn recognised the inalienable right of london to form its own commune as a selfgoverning and selfelected citystate to this john agreed it was not a new title but for the first time it was accepted by the reigning monarch as a public organisation to which all the nobles of the kingdom and even the very bishops of that province are compelled to swear these are the words of richard of devizes who considered the new arrangement to be nothing other than a tumor or swellingup of the people which could have no good consequences the connotations of the word commune are from the french example generally considered to be radical or revolutionary but this particular revolution was instigated by the richest and most powerful of the london citizens it was in fact and in effect a civic oligarchy comprising the most influential familiesthe basings and the rokesleys the fitzthedmars and the fitzreinerswho styled themselves aristocrats or optimates they were a governing elite who took advantage of the political situation in order to reassert the power and independence of the city which had been curtailed by the norman kings so we read in the great chronicle of the city liber albus that the barons of the city of london shall choose for themselves each year a mayor from among themselves provided always that when so elected he shall be presented unto his lordship the king or in the kings absence unto his justiciar thus the mayor and his governing council of probi homines the honest men of aldermanic rank attained formal rank and dignity the honour of becoming the first mayor of london goes to henry fitzailwin of londenstone who remained in office for twentyfive years until his death in it was not long after the authority of the mayor and commune was established that a sense of tradition entered the affairs of london it is almost as if it had reacquired its history at the same time that its old powers were restored communal archives and records were deposited in the guildhall together with wills charters and guild documents from this period too issues a great spate of laws and mandates and ordinances london had thereby acquired an administrative identity which animated such later bodies as the metropolitan board of works and the london county council of the nineteenth century as well as the greater london council of the twentieth here is the evidence of organic development which has not faded in time the administration of the city also began to demand the fulltime employment of clerks notaries and lawyers an extraordinarily detailed code of civic legislation was established and courts were instituted to deal with various misdemeanours these courts also exercised general supervision over the condition of the city such as the state of london bridge and the creation of a water supply with the various wards supervising matters of local sanitation paving and lighting the wards were also responsible for public safety as well as health with twentysix separate forces of police who were classified as unpaid constables beadles or bellmen street keepers or watchmen extant records show that this was by no means a sinecure we may estimate the population of london in the late twelfth century at approximately forty thousand many of whom were not disposed to obey the precepts of authority and good order imposed by the optimates when in the citizens of london were asked to provide money for the ransom of the absent king his brothers brief rebellion having been effectively suppressed there were many who resented the imposition when richard himself returned to london in the following year he was greeted with great ceremony but then proceeded to milk the revenues of the city with methods ever more exacting he is once supposed to have stated that he would sell london if he could find a buyer which scarcely endeared him to the already hardpressed citizens it seems likely that those artisans and merchants beneath the level of the optimates carried the heaviest burden and in a revolt of these londoners was led by william fitzosbert of the long beard the beard was long but the rebellion was short he seems to have had the support of a large number of citizens and has been variously described as a demagogue and a defender of the poor these are not in fact incompatible descriptions but his insurrection was put down in a ruthless and violent manner which was entirely characteristic of the city fitzosbert sought sanctuary in st marylebow on cheapside but the city authorities summarily removed him and hanged him with eight others at smithfield in the sight of his erstwhile supporters but the significance of the brief tumult was in the fact that a group of citizens had refused to obey the royal officials and merchant princes who controlled the city it was the harbinger of necessary and inevitable change as the population began to assert its own place in the general polity yet the central area of tension and possible conflict still lay between city and king the death of richard i in and the elevation of john did nothing to alleviate what seems to have been an instinctively antimonarchical trend in london politics it was the familiar story of the citizens being forced to pay increasing taxes or tallage to cover the kings expenditure the mayor and the most powerful citizens attempted to maintain a spirit of cooperation if only because many of them were involved with the kings household and would not necessarily benefit from his eclipse but there was a growing disaffection within the commune it would seem that king john despite earlier promises had abrogated certain rights and properties to himself which prompted the thirteenthcentury chronicler matthew paris to conclude that the citizens had almost turned into slaves yet the elective capacity of the folkmoot could still be asserted in five wealthy londoners gave marks to the french prince louis in order that he might travel to the city and be consecrated as king in place of john the civic ritual of coronation proved unnecessary however when john died in the autumn of that year london sent louis home again with more money and welcomed the young henry iii johns nineyearold son as its rightful sovereign we may walk the streets of london during the long reign of henry iii there were great houses as well as hovels fine stone churches against which were erected wooden stalls for passing trade the contrast of fair and foul can be put in another context with the statistic that out of forty thousand citizens more than two thousand were forced to beg for alms the richer merchants constructed halls and courtyards while the poorest shopkeepers might live and work in two rooms ten feet square the more affluent citizens owned fine furniture and silver while those of straiter means possessed only the simplest pottery and kitchen utensils together with the tools of their trade one examination of a murder when a young man killed his wife with a knife incidentally provides a household inventory of the middling sort the unfortunate pair lived in a house of wooden construction with two rooms one above the other and a thatched roof in the lower room which opened upon the street there were a folding table and two chairs with the walls hung about with kitchen utensils tools and weapons among them were a frying pan an iron spit and eight brass pots the upper room was reached by means of a ladderhere were a bed and mattress with two pillows a wooden chest held six blankets eight linen sheets nine tablecloths and a coverlet their clothes which were laid in chests or hung upon the walls consisted of three surcoats one coat with a hood two robes another hood a suit of leather armour and half a dozen aprons there were a candlestick two plates some cushions a green carpet and curtains hung before the doors to keep out the draughts there would also have been rushes on the floor not included in any inventory it was a small but comfortable residence those in poorer situations lived in rooms built within tenements which could be found down the narrow alleys between wide thoroughfares the upper floor of these small houses was known as the solar which protruded into the street itself so that little of the sky could be seen between two overhanging solars many of the smaller houses had been built of wood with thatched roofs still reflecting the appearance of saxon or early norman building london retained in part the atmosphere of a much earlier city with tribal or territorial connotations yet after the many fires that visited the city particularly a great conflagration in ordinances compelled householders to build their walls of stone and their roofs of tiles broken tiles from this period have been found in cesspits wells cellars rubbish dumps and the foundation stones of roads so there was a general process of transition not perfectly managed in which new stone and old timber stood side by side the condition of the streets themselves can be ascertained from the extant documents of the period in the pleas and memoranda of the guildhall for example we read of the master of ludgate putting dung into the fleet to such an extent that the water was stopped in certain places a common privy is diffectif and the ordur therof rotith the stone wallys the taverners of st brides parish put their empty barrels and slops into the street to nusauns of all folk ther passyng there were complaints about defective paving in hosier lane while in foster lane the fourteen households had the habit of casting from their windows ordure amp vrine the which annoyet alle the pepol of the warde the cooks of bread street were indicted for keeping dung and garbage under their stalls while a great stream of dong and water and other diverse filth was known to pour down trinity lane and cordwainer street by garlickhithe street and descend between the shops of john hatherle and richard whitman before discharging itself into the thames a dunghill in watergate street beside bear lane is noyowse to all the commune people kasting out into this lane ordour of prevees and other orrible sightis there are reports of stinking fish and bad oysters of common steps in disrepair and of thoroughfares being blocked up of areas or pryue places where thieves and money strumpettes congregate but some of the best evidence for the condition of the streets comes in the many regulations which were from the evidence of the courts being continually flouted stallholders were supposed to set up their stands only in the middle of the street between the two kennels or gutters on either side in the narrower thoroughfares the kennel ran down the middle of the street thus effectively forcing pedestrians to take the wall the scavengers and rakers of each ward were ordered to preserve lower and raise the pavements and to remove all nuisances of filth all such filth was taken by horse and cart down to the river where it was carried off in boats built for the purpose special arrangements were made for carting off the noisome stuff from the sites of butcherythe shambles the stocks market and the market at east cheapbut there were always complaints of foul odours in mores utopia the killing of animals takes place outside the city walls his pointed recommendation is evidence of the real disgust which many citizens felt about the proximity of this trade in the liber albus there are also instructions that pigs and dogs be not allowed to wander through the city more curiously perhaps it was decreed that barbers shall not place blood in their windows no citizen was allowed to carry a bow for firing stones and no courtesans were permitted to dwell within the city walls this last ordinance was persistently flouted there were elaborate regulations about the building of houses and walls with special provisions applied for neighbours disputes once again the impression is of a close compacted town in the same spirit of good order it was decreed that the owners of the larger houses should always possess a ladder and a barrel of water in case of fire since it had been ordained that tile rather than thatch should be the standard material of the roofs the aldermen of each ward had the power to come with a pole or hook in order to remove any offending straw it is indicative of the close watch kept upon all citizens that there were also regulations about private and social arrangements every aspect of life was covered by an elaborate network of law ordinance and custom no stranger was allowed to spend more than one day and a night in a citizens house and no one might be harboured within a ward unless he be of good repute no lepers were ever allowed within the city no one was permitted to walk abroad after forbidden hoursthat is after the bells or curfew had been soundedunless he or she wished to be arrested as a nightwalker it was also forbidden that any person shall keep a tavern for wine or for ale after the curfew aforesaid nor shall they have any persons therein sleeping or sitting up nor shall anyone receive persons into his house from out of a common tavern by night or by day the curfew itself was rung at nine oclock in the summer months earlier in the darkness of winter when the bell of st marylebow in cheapside rang curfew followed by the bell of st martins st laurences and st brides the taverns were cleared the apprentices left their work the lights dimmed as rush or candle were put out the gates of the city were locked and bolted some of these apprentices believed that the clerk of st marylebow kept them at work too long by ringing too late and according to john stow a rhyme was issued against clerke of the bow bell with the yellow lockes for thy late ringing thy head shall have knocks to which the offending clerk responded children of cheape hold you all still for you shall have the bow bell rung at your will this exchange testifies to the close relationship between all the members of the city so that everyone for example knew the bellringer with yellow hair but the most striking image is perhaps that of the dark and silent city barricaded against the outer world that silence was sometimes punctuated by screams shouts and cries it was the citizens duty to raise hue and cry against any transgressor of the peace for example and any citizen who comes not on such hue and cry raised was heavily fined london was a city where everyone was watching everyone else for the sake of the spirit of the commune and there are numerous reports of neighbours crying shame at the ill treatment of an apprentice or the abuse of a wife yet it is to be expected that in a mercantile culture the greatest body of law should be concerned with commercial transactions there are many hundreds of regulations in this period controlling every aspect of trading life it was ordered that the vendors of certain products like cheese and poultry shall stand between the kennels in the market of cornhulle so as to be a nuisance to no one with other trades distributed in various sites in the city no vendor could buy any victuals for resale before prime rung at st pauls from the twenty regulations applying to bakers alone it might be noted that a baker of tourte or panbaked bread was not permitted to sell white bread every baker also was commanded to leave the impression of his seal upon each loaf of bread it was decreed that all kinds of fish brought into the city in closed baskets shall be as good at bottom of the basket as at the top and that no stranger ought to buy of a stranger fishermen laboured under hundreds of regulations about what they could catch how they could catch and where they could catch the size and mesh of their nets were carefully measured there was also an elaborate system of tolls and taxes so that every man who brings cheese or poultry if the same amounts to fourpence halfpenny shall pay one halfpenny if a man on foot brings one hundred eggs or more he shall give five eggs if a man or woman brings any manner of poultry by horse and lets it touch the ground he or she will pay more it was an intricate system but its purpose was simply to ensure that the inhabitants of the city were adequately fed and clothed it attempted both to preempt the extortionate demands of those who bought and sold and to protect the rights of the citizens to trade in the city at the expense of aliens or strangers the regulations had a further primary purpose in the efforts to systematise trading so that there was little possibility of false measures adulterated food or shoddy manufactures it is in the context of this thriving colourful and energetic city that we can trace specific events which reveal the dangerous condition of the streets in court records of the period we read of unnamed beggar women collapsing and dying in the street of occasional suicides and constant fatal accidents drowned in a ditch outside aldersgate fell into a tub of hot mash we learn that a poor little woman named alice was found drowned outside the city wall no one is suspected a certain elias le pourtour who was carrying a load of cheese fell dead in bread street a girl of about eight years old was found dead in the churchyard of st mary somerset it was believed that she was thrown there by some prostitute no one is suspected suicide in this age of piety was considered a token only of madness isabel de pampesworth hanged herself in a fit of insanity in her house in bread street alice de wanewyck drowned herself in the port of dowgate being non compos mentis drunkenness was general and there are continual references to citizens falling from their solars to the ground falling down steps into the thames falling off ladders the reports of these and other fatalities are to be found in the london eyre of edited by chew and weinbaum other incidents are redolent of the period a certain man named turrock was found dead but it was found that three men were lying in the deceaseds bed when he died and they are in mercy the last phrase denoting that they had been acquitted of any charge in another instance roger struck maud gilberts wife with a hammer between the shoulders and moses struck her in the face with the hilt of his sword breaking many of her teeth she lingered until the feast of st mary magdalen and then died this litany of death and disaster highlights the crude violence of the city streets tempers are short and life is held very cheap henry de buk killed a certain irishman a tiler with a knife in fleet bridge street and fled to the church of st mary southwark he acknowledged the deed and abjured the realm he had no chattels the quarrel of three men in a tavern by milk street led to a fatality when one was attacked with an irish knife and a misericord a merciful knife which was meant to guarantee a quick exit from this life the fatally wounded man reached the church of st peter in cheapside but none of the bystanders offered to assist him the various trade guilds openly fought against each other in the streets a group of goldsmiths for example fell upon a saddler and proceeded to lay open his head with a sword chop off his leg with an axe and generally belabour him with a staff he died five days later when apprentices of the law rioted by aldersgate a citizen amused himself by shooting into the crowd an arrow which killed an unfortunate bystander a loveday designed to reconcile the coppersmiths and ironsmiths turned into a general and murderous riot when a group of unruly men entered a tavern one of the customers enquired who are these people and was promptly killed with a sword there were continual fights in the street ambushes and arguments over nothingor over goats wool as it was known games of dice or tables frequently ended in drunken fights while it is clear that some of the owners of dicing taverns were engaged in wholesale fraud it is a curious but instructive fact that the officers of the ward or parish were quick to tend to the religious needs of the maimed or dying but there were few attempts to administer any form of medical treatment by physician or barbersurgeon the injured were generally left to recover or die as providence intended there were many assaults upon women in the transcripts there are cases of female londoners being beaten or kicked to death or callously murdered in premeditated fashion lettice accused richard of norton vintner of raping and deflowering her but the case did not proceed to trial wifebeating was common and went largely unremarked but the brutalised women themselves could then in turn become brutal a drunken woman started howling out insults to certain builders who were working on the corner of silver streetshe called them tredekeiles which might be translated as lousy slobs and promptly started a fight in which one man was stabbed in the heart women could also be exponents of justice rough even by london standards when a breton murdered a widow in her bed women of the same parish come owte with stonys and canell dong and there made an ende of hym in the hyghe strete the aldermen and watch of each ward had other duties which cast an intriguing light upon the customs of medieval london they were instructed for example to arrest anyone wearing a visor or false face in the streets to be masked was to be considered a criminal the court rolls suggest that they were also given power to remove the doors and windows from any house of dubious reputation there is a record of their entering the house of william cok butcher in cockes lane and tearing away eleven doors and five windows with hammers and chisels it is significant that the name trade and street of the offender are conflated in characteristic medieval manner it is an indication of how one activity in this case the slaughter of poultry can imbue an entire area of the city other incidents may also be representative although less violent the watch arrested certain apprentices who had filled a barrel with stones and then rolled it downhill from gracechurch street to london bridge to the great terror of the neighbours there were more salacious or intimate events noted in the judicial records of a slightly later date in their striking immediacy we might almost be in the same chamber with these early londoners willm pegden saieth that one morris hore broughte one cicell and the saide colwell had the vse of the bodie of the saide elizabeth and the saide alice daie burned gave a venereal disease to the saide cicell and then the saide alice daie came vppe imediatlie and lepped vppon the bed amp said cicell with hir kissinge together and laying hir legges so broade that a yoked sow might go betwene the crimes could be egregious but the punishments had a distinctively communal aspect it has often been suggested that the officials of the medieval city were more lenient than their successors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and there is a partial truth to this punishments such as amputation were often commuted but the civic spirit could be violent indeed at least when it was threatened and there are many records of hanging or beheading for offences against the citys peace the fatal penalty was almost always imposed upon rebels and upon those offenders who had in some other way touched the kings majesty one man was hanged for example for tampering with the royal seal the heads of rebels and traitors were boiled and placed upon london bridge sometimes adorned with a crown of ivy as a final theatrical touch in the drama of punishment at times of tension or disorder within the city also the mayor and aldermen resorted to capital punishment as the most expeditious way of controlling the populace murder was always a hanging offence except when committed by a woman who could prove herself to be pregnant but in more peaceful time the prison and the pillory were the common remedies for crime walter waldeskef was charged with being addicted to playing knucklebones at night he was described in the report as a night walker well dressed and lavish of his money though no one knew how he got his living in the year after his arrest he was stabbed in lombard street and died in the church of st swithin at walbrook agnes de bury was imprisoned for selling old fur on cornhill while roger wenlock was committed to prison for selling beer at d a gallon john mundy baker was set vpon the pyllery in cornhill for makyng and sellyng of false breed and in the same month agnes deynte was also put in the pillory for selling false mengled buttur many and various frauds were also detected and punished one baker cut a hole upon his moulding board when the customer brought in his dough to be cooked part of it was removed by a member of the bakers family crouched beneath the counter in another instance a former servant of a law officer dismissed travelled to various taverns and pretended to confiscate ale the good tavern wives paid him to leave them alone eventually he was caught and placed in the pillory some of the punishments were more exotic bawds and whoremongers had their hair shaved leaving a twoinch fringe upon the heads of men and a small clump upon the heads of women they were taken to their respective pillories by minstrels the female pillory being known as a thew where they became the target of the honest citizens anger or high spirits if a woman was found to be a prostitute let her be taken from the prison unto aldgate while wearing a hood of striped cloth and carrying a white taper in her hand the minstrels once more led her to the pillory and after the ritual abuse she was marched down cheapside and through newgate to take up guarded lodgings in cock lane by west smithfield those consigned to the pillory for fraudulent manufacture or for selling shoddy goods had the items of their trade burned before them john walter had sold false measures of coal he was condemned to stand in the pillory for an hour with his sakkis brent burnt under him the journey to this place of obloquy was accompanied by other diversions the culprit sometimes was forced to ride backwards on a horse the tail towards him and crowned with a fools cap when one priest was found in flagrante delicto he was paraded through the streets with his breeches down and his clerical robes carried before him sir thomas de turberville traitor was taken through the streets of london dressed in a striped coat and white shoes he was tied to a horse while around him rode six officials dressed all in red as emblems of the devil punishment becomes a form of festivity in a relatively small and enclosed city it turns into a celebration of communal feeling yet harshnessone might almost call it savagerywas never very far from the surface and can best be exemplified by the destination for london criminals who were spared the pillory or the noose newgate during the coroners inquests of sixtytwo of the eightyfive corpses under investigation had been taken from newgate prison that is why there were many desperate attempts to break out of what was essentially a house of death on one occasion the prisoners forced their way on to the roof and faught ageyn the citizens and kept the gate a greate while reinforcing the point that it was londoners themselves who were essentially their guards and captors it is perhaps appropriate then that one of the first extant texts in london english written in the middle of the thirteenth century should be entitled the prisoners prayer there was essentially only one escape from the wrath of the citizens and that was the plea of sanctuary a felon who could avoid capture and take refuge in one of the many churches was safe there for forty days a watch was always placed around the church in case of a sudden escape and a body of citizens would have been encamped there day and night other places of sanctuary were southwark south of the river and the east side of the tower where the power of the city stopped in other words the criminal was free this is another indication of the selfsufficiency of the city even if on such occasions it might have preferred a wider jurisdiction during the course of sanctuary the prisoner often made a confession to the officers of the law and at the end of the forty days he or she was forced to abjure the realm and flee into exile the status of the outcast was then announced at the folkmoot so from ancient deeds and coroners inquests chancery rolls and chancery warrants calendars of inquisitions and court records we can summon up the spirit of medieval london in the streets lanes and alleys that survive even still but if this urban society was often characterised by violent confrontation so too was its political culture for much of the thirteenth century the record is one of riots and massacres and streetfighting during this period london was in almost perpetual conflict with the reigning monarch henry iii while the aspiring leadership of the city was divided between the optimates and the populares the old commercial magnates who had comprised the oligarchical commune of the city as against the representatives of the crafts and trades who were beginning to feel their power the situation was further complicated by the fact that the magnates tended to be royalist in their sympathy while the populares sometimes also known as the mediocres instinctively supported the barons of the realm with whom the king was in open conflict london once more was the key whoever controlled the city was close to controlling the kingdom the periodic baronial wars had this further consequence there were parties and families within the city who maintained different allegiances so that the national struggle was played out in miniature within the streets of london it was truly the epitome of all england london contrasts a traffic lock or jam on ludgate hill sketched by the french artist gustave doré towards the close of the nineteenth century chapter loud and everlasting london has always been characterised by the noise that is an aspect of its noisomeness it is part of its unnaturalness too like the roaring of some monstrous creature but it is also a token of its energy and of its power from its earliest foundation london rang with the hammers of artisans and the cries of tradesmen it produced more noise than any other part of the country and in certain quarters like those of the smiths and the barrelmakers the clamour was almost insupportable but there were other noises in the early medieval city the clatter of manufacturing trades and crafts would have been accompanied by the sound of bells among them secular bells church bells convent bells the bell of the curfew and the bell of the watchman it might be surmised that the effect of the bells ended with the reformation when london ceased to be a notably pious catholic city but all the evidence suggests that the citizens continued to be addicted to them a german duke entered london on the evening of september and was astonished by the unique character of the citys sound on arriving in london we heard a great ringing of bells in almost all the churches going on very late in the evening also on the following days until or oclock in the evening we were informed that the young people do that for the sake of exercise and amusement and sometimes they lay considerable sums of money as a wager who will pull a bell longest or ring it in the most approved fashion parishes spend much money in harmoniouslysounding bells that one being preferred which has the best bells the old queen is said to have been pleased very much by this exercise considering it as a sign of the health of the people this account is taken from the acoustic world of early modern england by bruce r smith which offers an intimate version of londons history there is some suggestion here that the harmony of the bells is in some sense intended to demonstrate the harmony of the city with the attendant health of its citizens but there is also an element of theatricality or bravura intrinsic to london and londoners indeed there is almost a kind of violence attached to their liking of loud sound another german traveller of wrote that londoners are vastly fond of great noises that fill the ear such as the firing of cannon drums and the ringing of bells so that it is common for a number of them to go up into some belfry and ring the bells for hours together for the sake of exercise a chaplain to the venetian ambassador similarly reported that london boys made bets who can make the parish bells be heard at the greatest distance to the element of display are added aggression and competition it is perhaps not surprising therefore that the very definition of the londoner should be adduced in terms of loud noise a cockney was one who was born within the sound of the bell of st marylebow in cheapside which according to john stow was more famous than any other parish church of the whole cittie or suburbs fynes moryson in announced that londiners and all within the sound of bowbell are in reproach called cocknies and eaters of buttered tostes bruce r smith has suggested that cockney in fact derives from the cockshaped weathervane which once surmounted the belfry of st marylebow and that the londoners identification with the sound came from their own loud loquaciousness or boastfulness as the city grew so did its level of noise by the beginning of the fifteenth century according to walter besants london there was no noisier city in the whole world it could be heard from highgate and from the surrey hills dekker in the seven deadly sinnes of london evokes something of the incessant dinhammers are beating in one place tubs hooping in another pots clinking in a third watertankards running at tilt in a fourth here noise itself is associated with energy and specifically with the making of money sound was intrinsic to the trades of the carpenters and the coopers the blacksmiths and the armourers other occupations such as dockers and porters the loaders and unloaders by the wharves actively employed noise as an agent of business it was the only way of affirming or expressing their role within the commercial city certain areas produced particular noises the metal foundries of lothbury for example produced a loathsome noise to the bypassers that hath not been used to the like and the quarter of the blacksmiths was permeated with the noise of and sound of their hammers amp anuiles there was also the general circumambient noise of the london streets where according once more to thomas dekker carts and coaches make such a thundring and where in the open streetes is such walking such talking such running such riding such clapping too of windowes such rapping at chamber doores such crying out for drink such buying vp of meate and such calling vppon shottes that at every such time i verily beleeue i dwell in a towne of warre images of violence and assault spring unimpeded from the experience of london sound in everard guilpin wrote a verse satire upon the peopled streets of london which he depicts as a hotchpotch of so many noyses so many severall voyces here the heterogeneity of london is seen as an aspect of its noise yet without the perpetual hum of traffic and machines which seems to characterise the noise of contemporary london streets individual voices would have been heard more clearly the wooden and plaster houses on either side of the main thoroughfares acted as an echochamber so that one of the characteristics of the sixteenthcentury city would be a continual babble of voices making up one single and insistent conversation it might be termed the conversation of the city with itself there were certain places where the voices reached such a pitch and intensity that they could also be characterised as a london sound the interior of st pauls cathedral was known for its particular timbre to quote once more from bruce smiths account the noyse in it is like that of bees a strange humming or buzze mixt of walking tongues and feet it is a kind of still roare or loud whisper the royal exchange where merchants from all over the world congregated was vaulted and hollow and hath such an eccho as multiplies euery worde that is spoken at the centre of commerce there is a great reverberation as if the conduct of finance could only take place within thunder then in the taverns to which the dealers and merchants retired men come here to make merry but indeed make a noise so in the places of power and speculation the insistent sound is that of raised male voices samuel johnson once remarked upon the subject of taverns sir there is no other place where the more noise you make the more welcome you are it is a suggestive observation with its implications of theatricality and aggression as part of the london experience the more noise you make the more you become a true inhabitant of the city in the theatres too there was unabated noise with the hucksters and the criers and the huddled throng everybody talking together breaking nuts and crying out for ale on the streets outside were the bells the wagons the cries the barking dogs the squeaking of shop signs blowing in the wind but there was another sound relatively unfamiliar to londoners of later generations it was that of rushing water the sixteenthcentury city was crossed by streams and rivers the sound of water from fifteen conduits mingled with the noise of the thames and its lapping tides audible along all the lanes and thoroughfares which led to the river great wheels were used to pump water from the thames into small wooden pipes and their endless grinding and reverberation added materially to the overwhelming noise of the city in it was still the same endless sound like a great shout perpetually renewed i lie down in storms sir john oldham announced in that year in thunders rise he evokes the din of the restless bells as well as huzzas of drunkards bellmens midnight rhimes the noise of shops with hawkers early screams the allusion here is to a city that is always wakeful there is no end to its activity neither at night nor at day and it lives continually in the seventeenth century too london was still a city of animals as well as people samuel pepys was disturbed one night by a damned noise between a sow gelder and a cow and a dog the noise of horses cattle cats dogs pigs sheep and chickens which were kept in the capital was confounded also with the sound of the great herds of beasts being driven towards smithfield and the other open markets london consumed the countryside or so it was said and the noise which accompanied its devouring appetite was everywhere apparent it has often been observed how foreigners or strangers were astonished and perplexed by the noise of london on one level it was regarded as representative of londons license where the boundary between anarchy and freedom remained ambiguous in a city filled with an implicitly egalitarian spirit each inhabitant was free to occupy his or her own space with endless noisy expressiveness in hogarths engraving of the enraged musician a foreign visitor is assailed by the sound of a sowgelder perhaps a descendant of the one who annoyed pepys by howling cats a girls rattle a boys drum a milkmaids cry a balladsellers plaintive call a knifegrinder and a pewterer at their respective trades a carillon of bells a parrot a wandering hautboy or oboe player a shrieking dustman and a barking dog the significance of these heterogeneous images is that they are all striking and familiar london types hogarth is here celebrating the noises of the city as an intrinsic aspect of its life it is the prerogative of londoners to make noise therefore noise is a natural and inevitable part of their existence in the city without that right for example many of the vendors and streetsellers would perish those who came to the city as visitors were not of course necessarily able to share hogarths implicit enthusiasm for this native uproar in tobias smolletts novel of humphry clinker is dismayed by its nocturnal aspects i start every hour from my sleep at the horrid noise of the watchmen bawling the hour through every street and thundering at every door thus illustrating the fact that time itself can be imposed with a shout in the morning too i start out of bed in consequence of the still more dreadful alarm made by the country carts and noisy rustics bellowing green peas under my window commerce as well as time must be understood in raucous terms joseph haydn complained that he might fly to vienna to have more quiet in which to work for the noise that the common people make as they sell their wares in the street is intolerable yet there were others who so wished to enter the spirit of london that they rejoiced in the clamour and embraced it like a lover the noise boswell wrote upon his first arrival in london in the crowd the glare of the shops and signs agreeably confused me he arrived in the capital by way of highgate from which eminence he would already have heard the noise let anyone ride down highgate hill on a summers day laetitia landon wrote in the early nineteenth century see the immense mass of buildings spread like a dark panorama hear the ceaseless and peculiar sound which has been likened to the hollow roar of the ocean but has an utterly different tone then say if ever was witnessed hill or valley that so powerfully impressed the imagination with that sublime and awful feeling which is the epic of poetry so the noise of the city partakes of its greatness this sense of disturbing almost transcendental sound was essentially a discovery of the nineteenth century when london represented the great urban myth of the world its noise became an aspect of its mightiness and horror it became numinous in charles manby smith in the paradoxically entitled the little world of london described it as that indefinable boom of distant but everpresent sound which tells that london is up and doing and which will swell into a deafening roar as the day grows older and now rises faintly but continuously upon the ear the roar here suggests the presence of some great beast but more significant is this sense of a continuous distant sound as if it were a form of meditation or selfcommuning we read in the same narrative of the uninterrupted and crashing roar of deafening sounds which tell of the rush of the current of londons life blood through its thousand channelsa phenomenon however of which the born londoner is no more unpleasantly conscious than is the indian savage cradled at the foot of a cataract of its everlasting voice this is an interesting image which identifies london itself with some kind of natural force at the same time it covertly admits savagery among the citizens in a locale both untamed and untamable from three miles distance in what was then an outlying suburb soon to be drawn within the vortex of the city the sound of london is like the swell of the seasurge beating upon a pebbly shore when it is heard far inland here is a haunting impression of proximity to the great city that perpetual sound was variously compared to niagara in its persistence and remorselessness and to the beating of a human heart it is intimate and yet impersonal like the noise of life itself that same intuition was vouchsafed to shelley who wrote of london that great sea whose ebb and flow at once is deaf and loud and on the shore vomits its wrecks and still howls on for more the adjectives deaf and loud summon up an image of pitiless activity the verb howls one of fear pain and rage in equal measure the noise is one of greed and helplessness as if it were in a perpetually infantile state its noise is ancient but always renewed a celebrated american of the nineteenth century james russell lowell has written i confess that i never think of london which i love without thinking of that palace which david built for bathsheba sitting in hearing of one hundred streamsstreams of thought of intelligence of activity one other thing about london impresses me beyond any other sound i have ever heard and that is the low unceasing roar one hears always in the air it is not a mere accident like a tempest or a cataract but it is impressive because it always indicates human will and impulse and conscious movement and i confess that when i hear it i almost feel as if i were listening to the roaring loom of time here then is a further sense of the numinous london becomes the image of time itself the great streams of thought and intelligence never cease to change the metaphor they resemble cosmic winds but is the sound of the city also the sound of time itself the noise would then be striated by the shuttling of the future into the past that instantaneous and irremediable process that takes place in a present moment that can never really be glimpsed or known the sound is then one of vast loss the howl of which shelley writes in the phrase of ts eliot a poet whose vision of time and eternity sprang directly from his experience of london all time is unredeemable london is unredeemable too and we may also think of its noise as comprising a vast mass of subjective private times continually retreating into nonexistence even in the middle of that maelstrom however it was possible to pick out and to remember specific london sounds which belonged to that place and to no other in the nineteenth century there were the notes of the german band with their horn and trombone and clarionet there was the lament of the barrel organ and the barrel piano there was the cry of lucifers from an old man bearing a tray of matches there was the rumble of the scavengers cart drawn by great horses adorned with tiaras of tinkling bells there was the incessant clatter of horses hooves which when they departed left london bereft i shall miss the orses feet at night somethin shockin one cockney lady put it they was sech compny like there was of course the continual noise of wheels endlessly turning with their own resistless momentum to the strangers ear a journalist wrote in the loud and everlasting rattle of the countless vehicles which ply the streets of london is an intolerable annoyance conversation with a friend whom one chances to meet in midday is out of the question one cannot hear a word the other says jane carlyle having settled in london with her husband thomas asked a correspondent in is it not strange that i should have an everlasting sound in my ears of men women children omnibuses carriages glass coaches street coaches wagons carts dogcarts steeple bells doorbells gentlemenraps twopenny postraps footmenshowersofraps of the whole devil to pay it is as if the whole world had broken in upon her that same sense emerges in a book entitled memories of london in the s where the constant roar of traffic was described as if all the noises of all the wheels of all the carriages in creation were mingled and ground together into one subdued hoarse moaning hum wooden paving was laid upon many of the main thoroughfares in the soxford street and the strand being two particular examplesbut nothing could really withstand the encroaching noise of the city in the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde r l stevenson writes of the low growl of london from all round in a life of tennyson it is remarked that the poet always delighted in the central roar of london this is the mind he told his son that is a mood of it charlotte brontë heard that roar and was deeply excited by it in each instance the presence of a living thing is being registered perhaps with some disquiet it is one great life comprising the sum of individual lives so that at the end of little dorrit the little heroine and her husband went quietly down into the roaring streets inseparable and blessed and as they passed along in sunshine and shade the noisy and the eager and the arrogant and the froward and the vain fretted and chafed and made their usual uproar those who are blessed are silent like strangers in the city but the eager and the restless maintain their uproar or rather the sound of london is transmitted through them it has changed during the course of the twentieth century those at the beginning recall the noise of horsedriven vans and the apoplectic roar of the omnibuses mingled with the strangely peaceful and satisfying sound of horses hooves it is perhaps not surprising that the writers who dwelled in the city in the first decades of the twentieth century should instil an enchantment in those noises it is as if they were aware of their imminent destruction in according to the journal of the london society a deputation from the british medical association had visited the ministry of health to suggest that city noise was a menace to public health instead of the sound of london being celebrated as a token of life itself or at least of the energy of the city it was now being construed as injurious and unwelcome it had become more uniform and monotonous so that two years later a report noted that people are beginning to rebel against this disturbing wearying factor in their lives it had also become more impersonal and in response to its dehumanising potential the measurement of the decibel was introduced various sources of what was now considered a nuisance were reported it offers an odd contrast with hogarths print of the enraged musician surrounded by human sources of sound to note that the new disturbers of the peace in the s included the pneumatic street drill the motor horn building construction and the railway steamwhistle described as harsh and grating much attention was paid to the unnatural quality of london noisea riveter is equal to decibels whereas thunder can register only thus reintroducing the old notion of a city intrinsically opposed to natural laws of growth and development it was also suggested that the sound of london had a wholly deleterious effect upon the brain and nervous system creating fatigue inattention and general weariness dh lawrence had a peculiar intuition of this change in the citys noise he had considered it in the first decade of the twentieth century as an expression of the vast and roaring heart of all adventure with the emphasis upon roar or uproar as a token of exhilaration but then the traffic had become too heavy this was also the gist of official reports so that the novelist can be presumed to have touched upon an authentic alteration the traffic of london used to roar with the mystery of mans adventure on the seas of life but now it booms like monotonous faroff guns in a monotony of crushing something crushing the earth crushing out life crushing everything dead the reiterated note of monotony is entirely characteristic of descriptions of modern london sound virginia woolf described the noise of traffic as churned into one sound steel blue circular which adequately conveys the artificiality or impersonality of the circumambient noise in recent years too there have been reports of a low humming sound which can be discerned everywhere it is an accompaniment of fluorescent light perhaps or of the vast electronic systems working continuously beneath the surface of the city it is now the lowlevel background noise which masks other sounds the noise of cars and cooling systems has changed the air of london in every sense principally by dulling down the variety and heterogeneity of sound the great roar of nineteenthcentury london is today diminished in intensity but more widespread in its effects from a distance it might be recognised as an incessant grinding sound the image would no longer be that of a sea but rather of a machine the beating heart of london can no longer be credited with human or natural attributes the sound of voices once such an intrinsic aspect of the street has now been marginalisedexcept for the individual voice responding to the call of the mobile telephone in a manner louder and more abrupt than that of ordinary conversation yet two aspects of these changing soundscapes have remained constant native londoners have for many centuries been known to talk louder than their contemporaries with a marked tendency towards shouting london has become one unyielding and unending shout there is a second characteristic noise if you stand in lombard street at any time of the day for example that narrow thoroughfare like others in the vicinity echoes to hurrying footfalls it has been a continuous sound for many hundreds of years in the very centre of the city and it may be that the perpetual steady echo of passing footsteps is the true sound of london in its transience and in its permanence chapter silence is golden yet on sundays and public holidays lombard street falls quiet throughout the old city silence returns the history of silence is one of londons secrets it has been said of the city that its most glorious aspects are concealed and that observation is wonderfully well fitted to account for the nature of silence in london it comes upon the pedestrian or traveller suddenly and unexpectedly it momentarily bathes the senses as if going from bright light into a darkened room yet if london sound is that of energy and animation silence must therefore be an ambiguous presence within city life it may offer peace and tranquillity but it may also suggest absence of being it may be a negative force the citys history is striated with moments of silence the silence of the surrounding country when the anonymous poet of london lickpenny leaves cheapside in the silence of the civic assembly when richard iii was first proposed as king in the silence of desolation after the fire in there was the silence of sixteenthcentury london after the days last cry at the stroke of midnight looke well to your locke your fier and your light and so goodnight of course the london night was not wholly quiet what london night ever is or ever will be it is the contrast that is significant in an almost theatrical sense because it marks an interdiction upon the natural ardour of the citizens in that sense the silence of london is indeed unnatural there is a midseventeenthcentury poem by abraham cowley which intimates that on the departure of all the wicked and the foolish the city would become a solitude almost the implied silence suggesting here that noise and bustle are indistinguishable from sinfulness or folly in that sense london could never be a silent city the absence of noise has also been marked as yet another contrast in an endlessly contrasting place an eighteenthcentury traveller observed that in the smaller streets off the strand running down to the thames there was so pleasing a calm that it struck the senses this is a constant refrain when the american connoisseur of antiquity washington irving wandered through the grounds of the temple off fleet street strangely situated in the very centre of sordid traffic he entered the silence of the chapel of the knights templar i do not know a more impressive lesson for the man of the world he wrote than thus suddenly to turn aside from the high way of busy money seeking life and sit down among these shadowy sepulchres where all is twilight dust and forgetfulness here silence becomes an intimation of eternity with the suggestion that london once emerged from a great silence and will one day return to it the great locus solus of silence amid the overbearing noise of nineteenthcentury london acquired therefore an almost sacred status another american writer of that century nathaniel hawthorne entered it having gone astray in holborn he walked through an arched entrance over which was staple inn but in a court opening inwards from this was a surrounding seclusion of quiet dwelling houses there was not a quieter spot in england than this in all the hundreds of years since london was built it has not been able to sweep its roaring tide over that little island of quiet silence has derived its power here by being able to withstand the sound of london and in the process has itself acquired a kind of immensitythere was not a quieter spot in england dickens knew the same courtyard well and employed it in the mystery of edwin drood it is one of those nooks the turning into which out of the clashing street imparts to the relieved pedestrian the sensation of having put cotton in his ears and velvet soles on his boots it is one of those nooks where a few smoky sparrows twitter in smoky trees as though they called to one another lets play at country there is almost a theatrical aspect to this silence therefore as if it had been tainted by the artificiality of london it is not a natural silence but a play one of a series of violent contrasts which the inhabitants of london must endure it is in that sense wholly ambiguous it may provoke peaceful contemplation or it may arouse anxiety when hawthorne continued his pilgrimage to the centres of silencea journey by an antiquarian determined to prove that modern london had not obtained full mastery over the silent pasthe entered the precincts of grays inn it is very strange to find so much of ancient quietude right in the monster citys very jaws he wrote confirming his intuition that noise is a consequence of inattention or ignorance it is silence which partakes of the past and redeems the present nothing else in london is so like the effect of a spell as to pass under one of these archways and find yourself transported from the jumble rush tumult uproar as if an age of weekdays condensed into the present hour into what seems an eternal sabbath so silence is the equivalent of the holy days of rest silence is the sound of not working not making money but this again is ambiguous since the sunday of london was known for its altogether dismal aspect gloomy and generally disheartening so does silence itself partake of this dreariness in london the absence of noise and activity may be peculiarly enervating gabriel mourey a french traveller of the nineteenth century remarked that on a sunday it is like a dead city all trace of life and activity of the past six days has vanished everyone noticed the change it was horrible and manifested a contrast which no other place on earth could afford once more the uniqueness of this sudden transition is being emphasised so that even silence itself reflects the magniloquence of nineteenthcentury london yet there are other forms of silence which seem to presage activity the author of the little world of london recognised and heard them all there was the moment of early dawn a brief period of stillness before the distant noise of horses hooves and grinding wheels marked the awakening of the city into life and then at night a dead sepulchral silence seems to reign in the deserted thoroughfares where but a few hours ago the ear was distracted by every variety of sounds this stillness so sudden and complete has a solemn suggestiveness containing within itself the idea of death as the sudden and complete surcease the nature of the nineteenthcentury city was such that it invited and provoked such solemn contemplation precisely because it included the elements of life and death within itself this is not the silence of the countryside in other words where repose seems natural and unforced the silence of london is an active element it is filled with an obvious absence of people of business and is therefore filled with presence it is a teeming silence that is why it can actually awake the sleeper an inhabitant of cheapside was asked by a london reporter how he knew when it was past two in the morning he will tell you as he has told us that the silence of the city sometimes wakes him at that hour silence can sound like an alarm henry mayhew noted the almost painful silence that everywhere prevailed in certain deserted london alleys as if the absence of sound provoked mental or physical suffering silence can also be associated with what the poet james thomson described as the doom of a city many images abound of silent stone the city at night the city of the dead as it has been called has been seen to resemble a prehistoric forest of stone one writer within the great volumes of london edited by charles knight and published in contemplated the city with its streets silent and every house untenantedhow should we be excited and thrilled by so touching a sight the advent of this silence strangely excites him as if it represents the erasure of all human energy the silence of the nineteenthcentury city can induce an almost spiritual sense of transcendence matthew arnold wrote some lines in kensington gardens where peace and silence prevailed over mens impious roar and the citys hum calm soul of all things make it mine to feel amid the citys jar that there abides a peace of thine man did not make and cannot mar so the soul of all things is to be recognised within this silence charles lamb considered it to be a token of all lost and past things while others believed it to be an emanation or manifestation of that which is secret and hidden the silence then becomes another aspect of what a contemporary critic has described as londons unknowability certainly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries there was an obscure fascination for what julian wolfreys in writing london has called the hidden court the forgotten square the unobserved portico as if the mystery of london exists within its silence it is the mystery which whistler observed in his nocturnes and which generations of londoners have encountered in silent streets and strange byways fountain court in the temple is one such sacred spot that has survived until the beginning of the twentyfirst century its solace seems to be unchanging the silence of tower hamlets cemetery in the middle of the east end is also profound and permanent there is silence in the square by st alban the martyr off busy holborn and there is a sudden silence in keystone crescent off the caledonian road there is the silence of kerry street in kentish town of courtenay square off kennington lane of arnold circus in shoreditch and then there is the silence of the outer suburbs waiting to be born within the encroaching and approaching noise of london perhaps these quarters of silence are necessary for the harmony of the city itself perhaps it needs its antithesis in order properly to define itself it is like the quiet of the dead upon whom london rests the silence as a token of transience and eventual dissolution so oblivion and wakefulness silence and sound will always accompany each other in the life of the city as it is written in that great urban poem of the late nineteenth century the city of dreadful night thus step for step with lonely sounding feet we travelled many a long dim silent street the late medieval city a tudor depiction of the market of east cheap note the number of butchers shops in a city where meat was at a premium chapter this companye the visitation of the death in the last months of destroyed per cent of londons population perhaps people died within the city a decade later onethird of the land within the walls remained uninhabited it was called the great pestilence as well as the death and reoccurred with extraordinary virulence eleven years later london like most other european cities remained under the threat of bubonic plague for the rest of the century it was not an urban disease but it flourished in urban conditions it was transmitted by rats living in the straw and thatch of medieval dwellings as well as by close respiratory proximity yet london seems inured to disaster and there is no evidence of any discontinuity in the history of this period it was said that in the city itself there were not enough living to bury the dead but for those who survived the disease offered an unparalleled opportunity to thrive and flourish many for example became prosperous as a result of unexpected inheritance while for others the demand for labour meant that their worth was greater than they had imagined the late fourteenth century was a time when many families those of labourers and merchants alike moved from the neighbouring provinces to the great city in order to make their fortunes from this period dates the apocryphal history of dick whittington which once more spread the story of london as cockaigne or the realm of gold the real richard whittington was a member of the mercers guild and londons history cannot properly be understood without also understanding the nature of those fraternities which combined the regulation of work with religious observances and parish duties london may not have been recognised as a city of god upon the earth but there were many late medieval theorists who believed that the city itself was the pattern of human existence as well as an emblem of human harmony there seem to have been trading guilds since the time of the saxons gegildan later known as frith guilds which also possessed military or defensive functions in the twelfth century certain traders such as the bakers and the fishmongers were allowed to collect their own taxes without being farmed or tolled by the royal administration as part of a complementary if not directly connected process we find the various trades congregating in separate areas the bakers were ensconced in bread street while the fishmongers might be found in friday street good catholics ate no meat on fridays the growth of craft guilds located in a specific area cannot be distinguished from the parish guilds of the same vicinity the tanners who pursued their noisome craft along the banks of the river fleet for example were accustomed to meet at their own fraternity in the carmelite house in fleet street by the late thirteenth century there were approximately two hundred fraternities in which craft regulation and religious observance were mingled in the church of st stephen coleman street for example three fraternities are recorded while at st james garlickhythe there was a litel companye of joiners it was a typically late medieval arrangement which effectively allowed a selfregulating and selfsustaining community to prosper within the context of a rapidly developing city in the early fourteenth century was issued a royal charter in which it was formally announced that no man might join a specific craft without the recommendation and security of six other members of that craft a further stipulation decreed that only members of a craft might be admitted to the freedom of the city only citizens in other words could belong to a trade guild in this fashion the guilds acquired enormous economic power within the city one ordinance for example required that ale or beer could be bought only from freemen enfranchised in and inhabiting london but in london economic power in turn purchased political and social preeminence so that in and again in the crafts themselves elected the common council of the city it ought to be remembered also that there were many craftes and mochel smale poeple who would simply have met for business in their local church the religious and social constraints of these trading mysteriesthe word has no sacred significance but comes from the french métierare also implicit within the ordinances of the guilds themselves which emphasised the importance of honesty and good reputation the rules of the fraternity of st anne at st laurence jewry for example demanded that yif any of the company be of wikked fame of his body and take othere wyues than his owene or yif he be a sengle man and be holde a comone lechour or contecour or rebell of his tonge then he is to be admonished after three such warnings if unavailing he is to be expelled so that godemen of this companye ne be nat sclaundered bi cause of hym there are other aspects of these guild ordinances which reveal the very condition of the time it is noted in the same rules that anyone who vse hym to lye longe in bedde amp atte risyng of his bed ne wil nat worcke to wynne his sustenaunce amp kepe his house amp go to the tavernne to the wyn to the ale to wrastelynge to schetynge schal be put of for euermore of this companye clearly the enjoyment of drink and what might now be termed spectator sport was not considered compatible with good working practice the same admonitions against urban amusements were made by daniel defoe in his seventeenthcentury manual on london trade in a similar spirit there are injunctions against any who acquire an euel name as theft or commune barettour or comune questmonger or meyntenour of quereles the guilds were here condemning those who breached public peace as if the act of quarrelling or disputing might itself be construed as sinful in a community whose harmony was maintained only with great difficulty the emphasis here is upon good standing and the avoidance of shame among equals it is typical of the regulations which smale poeple devised in order to protect their good name and therefore assist them in the remorseless pressure to move upward in the hierarchy of trades that is why the ordinary workmen or journeymen sometimes tried to combine against their employers but the city authorities were generally able to prevent any union of the lower workers there came a time when the victualling and manufacturing trades were indeed engaged in bitter dispute about precedence and power but it was essentially only a further stage in the continual restless and dissatisfied movement of those lower trades and professions who gradually pushed themselves forward into the social and political life of the city this is the true history of london which lives and moves beneath the incidents and events of public record but no account of medieval london would be complete without an understanding of the elaborate and complicated manner in which the church itself remained the single most disciplined and authoritative director of the citys affairs in the simply material sphere the administrators of the church were the biggest landlords and employers both within and without the walls many thousands of people both secular and spiritual owed their livings to the great abbeys and monastic foundations of the city but these large communities also owned ancient lands and manors beyond the jurisdiction of the city itself the bishop of st pauls for example owned the manor of stepney which stretched to the boundaries of essex on the east and to wimbledon and barnes on the southwest the canons of that establishment possessed thirteen other manors ranging from pancras and islington to hoxton and holborn this territorial power is a direct expression of secular as well as spiritual authority which dates from a very early period indeed during the steady disintegration of romanised england and the dissolution of roman london these magnates of the church had already become the true governing class of the country the bishop of each province had taken on the mantle of the roman consul and in default of other public institutions the parish church and the monastery became the centre of all organised activity that is why the earliest administrative records of london emphasise the power of the church authorities in we read that the bishop and the reeves who belong to london make in the name of citizens laws which were confirmed by the king and it was customary for priors and abbots also to become aldermen there was no distinction between secular and spiritual power because both were seen as intrinsic aspects of the divine order london itself was a city of churches containing a larger number than any other city in europe there were more than a hundred churches within the walls of the old city sixteen alone devoted to st mary and it can reasonably be inferred that many were originally of saxon date and of wooden construction in london walter besant has noted that there was no street without its monastery its convent garden its college of priests its friars its pardoners its sextons and its serving brothers this may seem exaggerated but although not every lane and alley contained a monastery or a convent garden a look at any map will show that the main thoroughfares did indeed harbour religious institutions great and small beside the parish churches there were thirteen conventual churches including st martins le grand and the priory of st john of jerusalem there were seven great friaries including the carthusian friars of hart street there were five priories among them st bartholomew the great in smithfield and st saviours in bermondsey there were four large nunneries and five priests colleges of the hospitals and refuges for the sick and the indigent we have records of seventeen in areas as diverse as bevis marks and aldgate charing cross and st laurence pountney among them a refuge for the insane at barking and thus the phrase barking mad this is not to mention the chantries the church schools and the private chapels it is a further indication of the sanctity of london that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there was continual reconstruction of these sacred edifices the piety of londoners is not in doubt the evidence of medieval wills in london is of some consequence and in the last testaments of john toker vintner of robert ameray cordwainer of richard whyteman waxchandler and roger elmesley waxchandlers servant there are tokens of a simple but profound piety in the details of these testaments there is all the paraphernalia of ordinary london life with bequests of towels and spoons beds and blankets roger elmesley left an iron rack for roasting eggs as well as some peacock feathers and my roller for a towell but his main wish was that he be buried vnder the stone withoute the dore of the porche of st margaret pattens in little tower street he was concerned also with the spiritual destiny of his godson to whom he left a prymmer for to serve god with as well as a litel cofur to putte in his smale thynges all of these wills mention sums of money to be given to the poor or the imprisoned or the sick on condition that these disadvantaged would then pray for the soul of the departed john toker the vintner for example gave various bequests to the priests of st mildreds in bread street forto praie for my soule with other moneys to be paid to the prisoners of ludgate marchalsie kyngesbenche as well as to the pore folk lying sike in the spitell of our lady withoute bisshopesgate oure lady of bedlem oure lady of elsingspitel of seynt bathilmewys in smythfeeld and seint thomas in sowthwerk many of these institutions exist today albeit in altered form while others linger only in the folk memory of london john toker left to his apprentice henry thommissone my mancion that is cleped the mermaid in bredstreet which is the very same tavern where shakespeare and jonson were supposed to have drunk the history of london is a palimpsest of different realities and lingering truths the patron saint of the medieval city was a seventhcentury monk who ruled as the bishop of london erkenwald was the spiritual leader of the east saxons for eighteen years and after his death many miracles were vouchsafed on his behalf the wooden cart or litter upon which bishop erkenwald would travel through the streets of london when age and sickness prevented him from walking through his diocese became the centre of a cult fragments and splinters of this vehicle were credited with curative properties and the litter was enshrined behind the main altar of st pauls with the relics of the saint himself the physical remains of erkenwald were sealed within a leaden casket which was fashioned in the form of a gabled house or church thus rendering in sacred space the physical topography of the city itself the cult of erkenwald survived for many centuries testifying once more to the piety or credulity of the citizens there was a miracle at stratford where now an industrial park is sited by the river lea as well as many other reported wonders in the thoroughfares around st pauls itself it was in fact something of a miracle that the physical remains of st erkenwald survived the various fires that visited the cathedral most notably the great fire of after which the relics were placed in a silver shrine befitting lundoniae maxime sanctus the most holy figure of london we read of the servants of the abbey moving the body of the saint to yet another great shrine clandestinely by night since its exposure during the day would have created hysteria among the crowd assembled this devotion was not of the populace alone even in the early sixteenth century the shrine of st erkenwald was an object of pilgrimage to the most successful lawyers of london who on being nominated as serjeants of law would walk in procession to st pauls in order to venerate the physical presence of the saint legends of dead saints may seem of little relevance but they were part of the very texture of london life the citizens when they first carried erkenwalds body to the cathedral declared we are like strong and vigorous men who will undermine and overturn cities heavily fortified with men and weapons before we will give up the servant of god our protector we ourselves intend that such a glorious city and congregation should be strengthened and honoured by such a patron there is indeed an erconwald street in the western part of the twentyfirstcentury city so we may still name him as the patron saint of london whose cult survived for over eight hundred years before entering the temporary darkness of the last four centuries the medieval city can be understood in a variety of ways therefore whether in terms of its violence or its devotion its commercial imperatives or its spiritual precepts the bells of the church tolled the end of each trading day and the traders weights were tested and measured at the market cross could we say that the administrators of the church in london were thoroughly secularised or that the citizens avid for trade and capable of great savagery were thoroughly spiritualised the question lends absorbing interest to the lives of medieval londoners perhaps the perpetual press of business and of domestic routine was viewed in the terms of eternity perhaps there was so much savagery because life itself in contrast to the immortal soul was considered to be relatively worthless the city then becomes the true home of fallen humankind onward and upward a midsixteenthcentury map of moorfields north of london some women dry linen upon the ground while the citizens engage in archery the line of bishopsgate street marks the accelerating growth of the city chapter rather dark and narrow john stow the great sixteenthcentury antiquarian offered the most vivid and elaborate description of tudor london he wrote of new streets and new buildings continually springing up beyond the walls and within the city itself of encroachments on the highways lanes and common grounds where once there had been sheds or shops in one of which an old woman used to sell seeds roots and herbs there were now houses largely built on both side outward and also upward some three four or five stories high growth is the continual condition of the city but one which stow himself lamented when it encroached upon the ancient topography of the place which he had known as a child in cordwainer lane we can follow john stow down butchers alley beside st nicholas shambles and stinking lane where he discoursed on the rising price of meat in the old days he said a fat ox was sold for s d at the most and a fat lamb for a shilling but what the price is now i need not to set down in such local touches stow stands alone among the chroniclers of the city it was said that he reporteth res in se minutas toys and trifles being such a smellfeast that he cannot pass by guildhall but his pen must taste of the good chear therein but that is what makes him such an excellent london surveyor and such a characteristic londoner in his survey of london he provides a detailed and immediate account of the lanes and alleys which he had known all his life he was born in and came from at least two generations of tallow chandlers who resided in threadneedle or threeneedle street thomas cromwell henry viiis familiar councillor encroached upon his fathers garden there and stow ruefully noted that the sudden rising of some men causeth them in some matters to forget themselves little is known of any formal education which stow may have received although it is likely that he attended one of londons free grammar schools he himself recalled how he used to walk to a farm belonging to the nuns of the minories where i myself have fetched many a halfpenny worth of milk thus indicating that there was grazing land by the very walls of the city but of other juvenile incidents he is silent it is known that he took up the profession of a tailor however and established himself in a house by the well at aldgate close to the farm where he had bought milk as a child but his true labours had not yet begun antiquarian studies seem to be an instinctive london passion and stow remains their greatest exemplar it is appropriate that his first work should be an edition of chaucer that fine london poet was stows original pursuit before he turned to the city which nourished his genius he began the study of london records primarily kept in the guildhall as a feed chronicler we may imagine him among slips of parchment manuscript rolls and brokenbacked volumes trying to decipher the history of his city in one of his first volumes a summarie of englyshe chronicles he wrote that it is now eight years since i seeing the confused order of our late english chronicles and the ignorant handling of ancient affairs leaving mine own peculiar gains consecrated myself to the search of our famous antiquities this might suggest that he had abandoned his trade as a tailor in order to devote himself to historical study but extant documents show that he maintained his business for some time he complained about being called a pricklouse an invidious catchphrase for those who sewed as a profession and he testified that a neighbour threw stones and tiles at his apprentice the antiquities were all around him a few yards from his own house between billiter lane and lime street were buried a wall and gate of stone about two fathoms deep under the ground they had been discovered after demolition work in stow investigated the curiosity and believed the old stonework to date from the reign of king stephen some years before the ground of london was always rising built again and again upon the ash and rubble of its previous incarnations stow walked everywhere and once confessed that his labours cost many a weary miles travel many a hardearned penny and pound and many a cold winter nights study he was tall and lean of a pleasant and cheerful countenance his sight and memory were good very sober mild and courteous to any that required his instructions there was much to instruct since in the early sixteenth century london would indeed have been an antiquarians delight stow often mentions the presence of great houses of old time built upon arched vaults and with gates of stone which date from the eleventh and twelfth centuries there would still have been extant walls pillars and pavements from the roman period much of the brick and masonry of that early time had been pillaged for modern rebuilding but there is no doubt that there would have been evidence of the first century in succeeding periods of londons history yet much also was being destroyed even as stow continued his survey the reformation of faith inaugurated by henry viii wreaked a sudden transformation upon the buildings as well as the beliefs of london the fabric of the roman communion to which the citizens had so fervently attached themselves was shattered the uncertainty and bewilderment of londoners were in turn embodied in the changing fabric of the city itself where monasteries and chantry chapels and lady chapels were vandalised or broken the dissolution of the abbeys churches and monastic hospitals in particular meant that the entire city was in a fevered period of demolition and construction parts of it would have resembled a vast building site while other areas were left to slow neglect and in stows words became sore decayed london was in many respects a place of ruins stow notes the remains of an old court hall in aldermanbury street now employed as a carpenters yard a mayors great house in old jewry became in turn a synagogue a house of friars a noblemans house a merchants house and then a wine tavern known as the windmill a chapel became a warehouse and shops towards the street with lodgings over them bishops houses were turned into tenements and so on other documentary sources reveal that a cistercian house was pulled clean down and in its place were erected storehouses tenements and ovens for making ships biscuit the convent of the poor clares known as the minories was destroyed to make way for storehouses the church of the crutched friars became a carpenters shop and a tennis court the church of the blackfriars was turned into a warehouse for the carts and properties of the pageants it is perhaps appropriate that on this same site rose the blackfriars playhouse st martins le grand was pulled down and a tavern built upon its remains there are many other examples but the salient point remains that after the reformation much of late tudor london was in a ruined condition with walls and gateways and ancient stone windows to be glimpsed among the shops and houses which lined the lanes and thoroughfares even in the area outside the walls where the palaces of the bishops and nobles had led down from the strand towards the river the grand houses were according to the venetian ambassador disfigured by the ruins of a multitude of churches and monasteries yet even in the midst of lamentation there was also renovation in goldsmiths row between bread street and cheapside cross stow extols the shops and dwellingsbuilt just thirtyfive years before his birth which are beautified towards the street with the goldsmiths arms riding on monstrous beasts all of which is cast in lead richly painted over and gilt a fifteenthcentury traveller dominic mancini noted in the same area gold and silver cups dyed stuffs various silks carpets tapestry these are the true tinctures of tudor london an old church may be pulled down but in its place stow remarks that there has been erected a fair strong frame of timber wherein dwell men of divers trades an old cross is removed and on the same site is constructed a glistening waterconduit an aristocratic dwelling is converted into a market for the sale of woollen baize watmols coarse wool flannels and such like a stone building of great antiquity is gradually taken down and in its place are erected divers fair houses this is the trade and energy of tudor london stow himself quintessential londoner as he is cannot prevent himself from enumerating the gardens the mills the houses of stone and timber the taverns the conduits the stables the yards the hostelries the markets the tenements and guild halls which comprise the citys life the older versions of the grand london house established around a separate hall and courtyard were no longer appropriate to the new conditions of the city they were built over or encroached upon by smaller dwellings in streets which were already acquiring a reputation for being rather dark and narrow even the mansions of the wealthy merchants were now more compact with a shop and warehouse on the ground floor a hall and parlour on the first floor and the other living quarters above it was not uncommon for such a house to rise to five or six storeys with two rooms on each level in the customary timber and mortar fashion such was the premium upon space in the bustling city that cellars and garrets were utilised as dwellings for the poor estimates of population can only be approximate but there are figures of by rising to by this does not include those who lived in the liberties or within the bars which would increase the figures by more than it represents to use a perhaps anachronistic phrase a population explosion the price of property had risen so steeply that no one would willingly demolish even the smallest shop or house so the growth of the city meant that the ancient ditches used for both defence and refuse were now filled in and covered over and became the site of more properties the main roads leading to the city gates were improved and paved so that within a very short time shops and houses were erected beside them the road to aldgate for example was according to stow not only fully replenished with buildings outward but also pestered with divers alleys on either side to the bars even the fields beyond the city where once the younger citizens had shot their arrows or walked among the streams had now within a few years made a continual building throughout of garden houses and small cottages and the fields on either side turned into garden plots tenter yards bowling alleys and such like the overcrowding became so serious that in elizabeth i issued a proclamation perceiving the state of the city of london being anciently termed her chamber and the suburbs and confines thereof to increase slowly by access of people to inhabit the same so that there was no chance of sustaining victual food and other like necessaries for mans life upon reasonable prices without which no city can long continue there was further cause for alarm concerning the overpopulation within the city itself where there are such great multitudes of people brought to inhabit in small rooms whereof a great part are seen very poor yea such as must live begging or by worse means and they heaped up together and in a sort smothered with many families of children and servants in one house or small tenement this is one of the earliest accounts of overcrowding in london and can be considered the first extended version of a description which has haunted the city ever since the queens remedy was to prohibit any new buildings of any house or tenement within three miles from any of the gates of the said city of london it has been suggested that this was the first venture at a green belt around london a surmise which would at least have the merit of emphasising the historical continuity within all apparently modern plans for the city but it was more likely to be an attempt to protect the trading and commercial monopoly of the citizens within the walls who did not relish the appearances of trades and shops beyond their jurisdiction another aspect of the proclamation is also of some significance in that passage where the monarch and her city advisers prohibit any more families than one only to be placed or to inhabit from henceforth in any house that hereto fore hath been inhabited the idea of one family occupying one house was indeed the stated purpose behind much of the citys development in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it has even been considered a peculiarly london solution it is peculiar to the city because it is historical in spirit as se rasmussen put it in london the unique city the elizabethan remedy represented a conservative clinging to the medieval form of housing in a similar spirit new building was only allowed if it were raised on old foundations here we have an inkling of that continuity and sense of permanence which london still exemplifies it did not however work within three years of elizabeths proclamations the city authorities were lamenting the continual increase in sheds lodgings and tenements outside the walls there were further edicts and orders issued at regular intervals throughout the reign of her successors none of them was ever obeyed and none of them was in the least successful at controlling the growth of the city the truth is that the growth of london could not and cannot be controlled it spread to the east along the high street of whitechapel and to the west along the strand it spread north to clerkenwell and hoxton to the south southwark and its environs became pestered to use stows word with places of popular resort taverns brothels pleasure grounds and theatres in turn the inns of court clustered in the suburbs of holborn between the city and the royal palaces of westminster were extended and embellished yet the quality of transport from suburb to city was not always of the best in the latter years of the reign of henry viii the high road between the temple and the village of charing now known as the strand was noted in the rolls of parliament to be full of pits and sloughs very perilous very noyous and foul and in many places thereof very jeopardous to all people passing and repassing as well on horseback as on foot more modern forms of transportation however were not necessarily welcomed the introduction of hackney coaches known as chariots or whirlicotes led stow to reflect that the world runs on wheels with many whose parents were glad to go on foot the state of traffic in the capital was a source of constant complaint in the sixteenth century as it has become for each generation stow again noted the number of cars drays carts and coaches more than hath been accustomed the streets and lanes being straitened must needs be dangerous as daily experience provethdangers not tempered when coachmen lashed their horses forward without checking what was behind them and inebriated drivers quarrelled frequently and violently in the street over who had right of passage and there was the noise where even the very earth quakes and trembles the casements shatter tatter and clatter there was however a significant improvement in the conditions of urban living at least for those who could afford the new luxuries of city life there were pillows and bedding where there had once lain a log and a straw pallet even the poorer citizens dined off pewter rather than wood and the middling households might boast of wallcoverings brass soft linen cupboards garnished with plate jars and pots made from green glazed earthenware there was also a fashion for brick and stone chimneys which in turn had an effect both upon the appearance and atmosphere of london the city had forfeited some of its independence to parliament and to the sovereign even to the extent of accepting henry viiis recommendations for the mayoralty but in turn it had become the recognised capital of a unified nation the municipal ideal had been displaced by a national idealand how could it not be so in a city which was now largely populated by immigrants the new arrivals came from every area of england cornwall to cumberland it has been estimated that onesixth of all englishmen became londoners in the second half of the sixteenth century and the number of foreign immigrants rose at an accelerating pace making the city truly cosmopolitan so high was the mortality and so low the birth rate that without this influx of traders and workers the population would in fact have steadily declined yet instead it continued to expand with brewers and bookbinders from the low countries tailors and embroiderers from france gunmakers and dyers from italy weavers from the netherlands and elsewhere there was an african or moor in cheapside who made steel needles without ever imparting the secret of his craft fashion followed population just as the populace followed fashion in the reign of elizabeth i there was a surfeit of silk shops selling everything from gold thread to silk stockings and at the time of her accession it was reported that no country gentleman could be content to have eyther cappe coat doublet hose or shirt but they must have their geare from london if london had become the centre of fashion it had also become the centre of death mortality was higher than in any other part of the country the two great harvesters being the plague and the sweating sickness in poorer parishes life expectancy was only between twenty and twentyfive years while in the richer it rose to thirty or thirtyfive years these fatal infections confirm the evident truth that sixteenthcentury london remained a city of the young the greatest proportion of the citizens were under the age of thirty and it is this actuarial statistic which helps to explain the energy and restlessness of urban life in all its forms the most striking example comes from within the turbulent body of the apprentices a peculiarly london phenomenon of young men who were bound by strict articles of agreement and yet managed to retain a highspiritedness and almost feverish buoyancy which spilled over into the streets they wold ether bee at the taverne filling their heads with wine or at the dagger in cheapeside cramming their bellies with minced pyes but above al other times it was their common costome as london prentises use to follow their maisters upon sundays to the church dore and then to leave them and hie unto the taverne there are reports of various fights and affrays the common victims being foreigners nightwalkers or the servants of noblemen who were considered to take on the airs of their superiors a declaration in warned apprentices not to misuse molest or evil treat any servant page or lackey of any nobleman gentleman or other going in the streets there were often disturbances after football matches and three young men were put in the local prison for outrageously and riotously behaving themselves at a football play in cheapside but drunken high spirits could turn into something more violent and threatening apprentices as well as artisans and children took part in the evil mayday riots of in which the houses of foreigners were ransacked in the last decade of the sixteenth century there were still more outbreaks of riot and disorder but unlike other continental cities london never became unstable or ungovernable the accounts of foreign travellers suggest the unique status of london in this period a greek visitor reported that the treasures in the tower were said to exceed the anciently famed wealth of croesus and midas while a swiss medical student reported that london is not said to be in england but rather england to be in london there was a standard guided tour for visitors who were first taken to the tower and the royal exchange before being escorted to the west with cheapside st pauls ludgate and the strand viewed before a magnificent arrival at westminster and whitehall the roads were unpaved in parts but a journey on horse was still sometimes preferable to that upon the thames giordano bruno spy and magician has left a graphic account of his attempts to hire the services of a wherry he and his companions wishing to travel to westminster spent a great deal of time looking for a boat and vainly crying out oars at last a boat arrived with two elderly boatsmenafter much question and reply as to whence where why how and when they brought the prow to the foot of the stairs the italians believed they were at last on their way to the destination but then after about a third of the journey had been completed the boatsmen began to row towards the shore they had reached their station and would go no further this is a small incident of course but it reveals the rudeness and obstinacy which was seen by strangers to be characteristic of london behaviour just as typical perhaps is brunos arrival on the shore only to find a footpath thick with mud where he was forced to journey through a deep and gloomy hell other reports emphasise both the violence and xenophobia of ordinary londoners a french physician in london between and observed that the common people are proud and seditious these villains hate all sorts of strangers and even spit in our faces gangs of apprentices were also likely to set upon foreigners in the street and one traveller saw a spaniard being forced to take refuge in a shop from a mob after he dared to wear his national costume the swiss medical student was in that respect perhaps too kind when he mentioned that the common people are still somewhat coarse and uncultured and believe that the world beyond england is boarded off yet the city also lives in its details gathered in these foreign accounts one traveller noted that it was remarkable for the number of kites which were quite tame and wandered through the streets as if they owned them they were the citys scavengers and the butchers threw out offal for them to consume the number of butchers shops was matched only by the number of taverns a passion for privacy was also noted with individual dwellings separated from their neighbours by walls of stone the same conditions applied in the taverns themselves where wooden partitions were set up so that one table cannot overlook the next it may be that in a teeming and overcrowded city such attempts at privacy were natural or inevitable yet they also represent a significant and permanent aspect of the london character in other accounts between meals one sees men women and children always munching through the streets the same children when not eating apples and nuts could be seen gathering up the blood which had fallen through the slits in the scaffold after a beheading on tower hill the executioner on this occasion wore a white apron like a butcher we seem to have come full circle in a city dominated by violence blood meat and continual consuming appetite chapter packed to blackness there was once a dark lane in the medieval city a tavern was erected there known as the darkhouse that narrow thoroughfare was then renamed dark house lane and is to be seen on eighteenthcentury maps of london on the same site there now stands dark house wharf which is dominated by the headquarters of the bank of hong kong this building is clad in dark blue steel and dark tinted glass so does the city maintain its dark secret life dust mud soot slime and smut were the objects of continual dissatisfaction though a chamber be never so closely locked up john evelyn complained in the seventeenth century men find at their return all things that are in it evenly covered with a black thin soot in the same century a venetian chaplain described a sort of soft and stinking mud which abounds here at all seasons so that the place more deserves to be called lorda filth than londra london the filth of the city was also depicted as being rich and black as thick ink in the eighteenth century the road outside aldgate resembled a stagnant lake of deep mud while in the strand the puddles of filth were three or four inches deep so that they fill coaches when their windows happen not to be up and bedaub all the lower parts of the houses if they were not strewn with mud the streets were filled with dust even in the midnineteenth century according to the quarterly review there was not a man or woman in london whose skin and clothes and nostrils are not of necessity more or less loaded with a compound of powdered granite soot and still more nauseous substances it was said that st pauls cathedral had a right to be blackened because it was built with a tax upon sea coal but it was hard upon the animals of the city which were similarly affected by the smoke and dirt the feathers of the redstarts and the martins were suffused with soot while the dust of london was believed to clog the breathing and dull the senses of the omnipresent spiders all creatures were affected and as a late twentiethcentury character in iris murdochs novel the black prince puts it i could feel the thick filth and muck of london under my feet under my bottom behind my back yet it is more than material filth there is a drawing of fish street hill by george scharf executed in the late s as accomplished and as detailed as all his work but in the foreground a vast shadow obscures the people and the housefronts it is in fact the outline of the monument otherwise concealed from sight but in that shadow scharf has somehow managed to depict something of the nature of london itself it has always been a shadowy city as james bone the author of the london perambulator remarked in it resides in the appearance of great shadows where there can be no shadows throwing blackness up and down this is also the london vision of verlaine who writes of lodieuse obscurité quel deuil profond quelles ténèbres within la monstrueuse cité much of the slate used in london building is striated by what geologists term pressure shadows but they are inconspicuous beside the blackened surfaces of portland stone one foreign traveller remarked that the streets of london were so dark that the citizenry seemed to delight in playing hide and seek with the light like children in a wood while in the summer of charles moritz noted that the houses in general struck me as if they were dark and gloomy the gloom affected him profoundly at that moment i could not in my own mind compare the external view of london with that of any other city i had ever before seen there were almost a score of dirty alleys dirty hills and dirty lanes in the medieval city there were inkhorn courts and foul lanes and deadmans places lombard street in the city at the centre of capitalist imperialism was a notoriously dark street at the beginning of the nineteenth century its brick was so blackened with smoke that the walls resembled the mud in the road today in the twentyfirst century it is still just as narrow and just as dark its stone walls constantly echoing to the sound of hurried footsteps it is still close to what a century ago nathaniel hawthorne called the black heart of london hawthornes compatriot henry james also noticed the deadly darkness but he revelled in it as if he were a born londoner in the s hippolyte taine simply found the darkness horrible the houses from a distance looked like inkstains on blotting paper while from a closer vantage the tall flat straight façades are of dark brick the darkness of london seems to have entered taines soul with his crepuscular invocations of a boneblack factory which is a london dwelling of porticoes foul with soot every crevice inked in long ranks of blind windows the fluting of the columns full of greasy filth as if sticky mud had been set flowing down there there were others who were intimate with this darkness in his account of nineteenthcentury whitechapel charles booth the sympathetic chronicler of the life and labour of the people of london mentions that the tables of the poor are fairly black with thick swarms of flies congregating on every available surface while in the streets outside at the level of the hip is a broad dirty mark showing where the men and lads are in the constant habit of standing charles booths images of disease and torpor somehow increase the darkness of the capital as the very embodiment of those shadows which the rich and powerful cast upon the dispossessed and the disadvantaged the effect of the industrial revolution although less noticeable in london than in some of the northern manufacturing towns deepened those shadows the growth of factories as well as small workshops and the increasing demand for coal in a city which by the beginning of the eighteenth century was already the manufacturing centre of europe only intensified londons characteristic darkness in another sense its darkness suggests secrecy and the titles of many accounts of the city confirm that sense of concealment among them unknown london its romance and tragedy the london nobody knows and london in shadow and yet that secrecy is of its essence when joseph conrad described the city half lost in night in the secret agent he was echoing charles dickenss remark seventy years before in sketches by boz that the streets of london to be beheld in the very height of their glory should be seen on a dark dull murky winters night the tone is ironic but the meaning is by no means so in his last completed work dickens returned to it in his description of a black shrill city a gritty city a hopeless city with no vent in the leaden canopy of its sky darkness is of the citys essence it partakes of its true identity in a literal sense london is possessed by darkness chapter maps and antiquarians the history of london is represented by the history of its maps they can be seen as symbolic tokens of the city and as attempts to picture its disorder in terms of fluent and harmonious design from the first great copperplate map of the midsixteenth century to the underground map of the late twentieth century the mapping of london represents an attempt to understand the chaos and thereby to mitigate it it is an attempt to know the unknowable that is why the first map from which john stow himself borrowed has always been a source of wonder and curiosity it is inscribed upon copper plates by an unknown hand but all the evidence suggests that this carefully prepared map was commissioned by queen mary i in its complete form only three fragments remain it would have been some eight feet in width and five feet in depth covering the entire area of city and suburbs it is in certain respects extraordinarily detailed the very scales of leadenhall market are depicted together with the dogkennels in some of the gardens the position of a tree or the number of buckets by a well are faithfully recorded shirts and bed linen lie stretched out to dry in moor field while games of musketry and archery are conducted in the neighbouring pastures the churches and monastic remains are also visible many of them rendered in such detail that we may distinguish between wood and stone when shakespeares john of gaunt compared the sea around england with a moat defensive to a house we now know that his audience coming to the theatre by shoreditch had passed just such a moated house on the road out of london through finsbury fields since this copperplate is also the original upon which most other maps of sixteenthand early seventeenthcentury london are based in its lineaments we may find the most lucid and significant outline of the city in certain respects however the map inevitably strays from accuracy the actual warren of passages and alleyways is ignored in order to display the principal lanes and streets the city has in that respect been cleansed the number and variety of houses are also neglected in order to create a more uniform and pleasing appearance the citizens depicted at work or at play are in turn of an unnatural size suggesting that the cartographer wished to emphasise the human dimension of the city nevertheless it is a beautiful feat of engraving and it is no accident that it did become the source and inspiration for maps completed some years later one coloured map of midtudor london for example which is known as the braun and hogenberg is a smaller copy of the great original here the city is given compact form and although it is by no means a spiritualised shape it is in instinctive harmony with its surroundings the skiffs and wherries ply their river trade in graceful formation while the main thoroughfares themselves seem to mimic the natural passage of the water it depicts the fair city of contemporary report but it also has one other significant aspect in the foreground quite out of proportion stand four londoners an older man is dressed in the robes of a merchant with cap and furtrimmed coat while upon his right hand stands his apprentice wearing a short coat like a doublet as well as sword and buckler the merchants wife is dressed in a simple blue gown over a spanish farthingale while her maid is plainly attired in gown and apron these are modest figures but they stand upon a hill above london as the true representatives of the city the map itself can be seen as an advertisement of londons mercantile power with the vessels on the thames behind the four londoners depicting its status as a port in similar spirit the two great panoramas of london before the fire of utterly destroyed its appearance take the river as the leading spirit of their design anthony van den wyngaerdes riverine views of the midseventeenth century have been eclipsed by hollars panorama of but wyngaerdes study has the merit of showing the bustling life of the thames some row while others fish travellers wait at stargate horse ferry while others make their way up southwark high street towards london bridge of course hollars more powerfully executed engraving is perhaps the most beautiful and harmonious of all london panoramas in his work london has become a world city of which the horizons are scarcely visible the artist takes his stand upon the roof of st mary overie by bankside so that in the foreground of the engraving are great clusters of roofs and housefronts by the entrance to london bridge the chimneys and windows the rooftops of tile and wood suggest the massive presence of a city already congregating by its southern mouth on the thames there are almost eighty great vessels as well as innumerable smaller craft the river itself forming a great sheath of light and space which lends london a monumental aspect there are more intimate details on the southern bank where among the throng of roofs and chimneys hollar has opened up two short vistas of the streets a dog can be seen a man on horseback couples wandering here and there a solitary figure all fixed for ever as part of the pattern of london from hollars high vantage a walled garden can be observed and beyond it two circular buildings labelled the globe and beere bayting respectively beyond them lie fields where horses are grazing on the other side of the thames there is a forest of rooftops and church spires although that of st pauls had been destroyed by a thunderstorm some eighty years before the cathedral church still dominates the skyline of the city it rises above the streets and wharves where people can be seen working or waiting for transport there is continuous building eastwards from the tower to shadwell while the line of the city is prolonged westward to whitehall the effect is that of great activity caught in majestic perspective with the city arrayed in glory the panorama is completed by various classical deities who as it were introduce and applaud the scene from the wings the figure of apollo hovers just above st pauls it is perhaps the finest ever representation of london and certainly the greatest image of the city before the great fire of later maps by norden as well as newcourt and faithorne in style and spirit reflect the first great copperplate map similarly the familiar map of the london underground today still completes and complements the one first designed with such clarity of purpose in the original underground map bears only approximate relation to the location of lines and stations but it is so aesthetically pleasing that its lineaments have never been changed in wenceslaus hollar completed a further etching of the western aspect of the city we observe that still more areas of fields and stiles and country lanes have been replaced by squares and piazzas and dwellings some of these houses are several storeys high others on a smaller scale but all reflect a pleasing symmetry which did not in fact exist another theme obtrudes at least in retrospect the streets and open areas are devoid of figures or any depiction of active lifethe city had already grown too large to register even the symbolic presence of its citizensand so it seems like some great empty place waiting silently for its destruction in the great fire the extent of that destruction can be see in another engraving by hollar it was completed in and depicts the razed city as more than four hundred acres of whitened contours the ruins of the churches prisons and main public buildings are sketched in but the rest is empty space encroached upon by dark clusters of building which had escaped the flames within days of that fire however various speculative maps of a new london were being completed these were visionary schemes to a certain extent they resemble the structure of planned cities such as paris and new york which were to be laid out grandly in the nineteenth century many of these seventeenthcentury designs for london incorporated grid systems of intersecting thoroughfares with great avenues linking majestic public edifices wren and evelyn conceived of a humane and civilised city built upon a preordained pattern while some of their contemporaries presented mathematically ingenious systems of roads and squares these noble plans could not work and they did not work the very nature of the city defeated them its ancient foundations lie deeper than the level at which any fire might touch and the spirit of the place remained unscathed london is not a civilised nor a graceful city despite the testimony of the maps it is tortuous inexact and oppressive it could never be laid out again with mathematic precision in any case because the long history of streets and estates meant that there was a bewildering network of owners and landlords with their own especial claims or privileges this is a social and topographical fact but it in turn suggests a no less tangible aspect of london it is a city built upon profit and speculation not upon need and no mayor or sovereign could withstand its essential organic will that is why the map of reconstructed london published ten years after the fire shows the city restored approximately to its original state one new thoroughfare has been built the new king street and the new queen street leading to the guildhall from the river but the congerie of streets around it milk street wood street aldermansbury old jewry and all the resthave sprung up again thoroughfares were widened after more stringent fire precautions and building regulations were applied but the essential topography of the neighbourhood was revived there was one other change the surveyors of this postfire map john ogilby and william morgan had declared that they would chart all byestreets and lanes all courts and allies all churches and churchyards by scientific principles of mesuration and plotting with theodolites and circumferentors so for the first time the city became susceptible to scientific measurement with the result that it could no longer be depicted as an aesthetic or harmonious whole paradoxically it then became fragmented chaotic unknowable the twenty sheets of this topographical survey are covered by rectangles and numbersi b cwhich are designed to expedite identification but the general effect is one of bewildering complexity when london is seen in terms of abstract size and measurement it becomes unimaginable there was instead a vogue for guidebooks which rendered london intimate and identifiableamong them couchs historical remarques and observations of de launes the present state of london and colsonis le guide de londres of they were complemented by such volumes as the antiquities of london and westminster with accounts of the townditch the gates the schools hospitals churches and wards by the eighteenth century there was an efflorescence of those books which emphasise whatever is most remarkable for grandeur elegance curiosity or use there were others designed to aid visitors or new residents as to the way in which they should conduct themselves in the city one for example suggests that should a carrier of a sedan chair behave unmannerly take the number of the chair as you do of a hackney coach and complaining at the office abovementioned the commissioners will correct their insolence the london adviser and guide of offers similar advice with the note that common people will be charged one shilling for swearing in the street and that every gentleman will face the higher penalty of five shillings the number of convictions is not mentioned the next attempt at a comprehensive cartography undertaken by john roque in emphasises the problems that were now inevitably encountered trigonometrical measurements of the streets did not align with actual measurements and street names were thoroughly confused the project took seven years to finish and in the process roque himself came close to bankruptcy the plan itself was of enormous size and the publishers suggested that it be placed on a roller so that it will not interfere with any other furniture yet it is by no means a complete survey it omits certain smaller or inconsiderable features place names are missing and there has been no effort to include individual buildings this is hardly surprising in a map covering some ten thousand acres of built land and the publishers were tactful enough to encourage subscribers to point out inaccuracies and omissions so it remains in many respects an impressionistic survey with the actual lanes tenements and shops reduced to a fine grey shading it has an enduring enchantment according to the authors of the history of london in maps but it is the enchantment of distance at the end of the eighteenth century the largest map ever printed in england conveyed what seemed to be even then the immensity of london richard horwoods map was ninetyfour feet square and contained street numbers as well as names and houses the project continued for nine years but four years after its publication horwood tired and careworn died at the age of fortyfive some of the inevitable difficulties he encountered can be measured by changes in four different editions within the space of thirteen years the fields adjacent to commercial road were gradually filled with houses and terraced streets in the space of twenty years the number of houses in mile end had tripled the persistent and steady growth of london in a sense had killed its mapmaker horwoods aim was largely utilitarian the enterprise was sponsored by the phoenix fire insurance office one of the citys most significant institutions and was advertised as indispensable in bringing ejectments or actions in leasing or conveying premises etcetera in that it proved successful if only because every subsequent attempt at conveying the specific houses or buildings of the city was engulfed by its sheer immensity the first ordnance survey of london completed in for example comprised some sheets it was greatly reduced for publication but then proved to be on too small a scale to be useful for travellers and inhabitants alike this and later maps of midand late victorian london simply display lines of streets linked together with shading used indiscriminately to represent the shops offices houses tenements and public buildings these are the direct predecessors of the contemporary a to z gazetteer in which hundreds of pages are needed to chart a city which cannot be recognised or understood in terms of one central image the begetter of the a to z phyllis pearsall entranced by londons immensity compiled the first edition in the mids by rising at five and walking for miles per day she covered miles of streets and completed entries which she kept in shoeboxes beneath her bed michael hebbert the author of london has revealed that the maps were drawn by a single draughtsman and pearsall herself compiled designed and proofread the book no publisher was interested however until she delivered copies on a wheelbarrow to a wh smith buyer by the time of her death in the number of london streets had risen to approximately the nineteenthcentury city already seeming too vast for comprehension was sometimes plotted in terms of theme or subject there were cabfare maps outlining the distance which could be travelled for a certain fare maps of street improvements with the renovated thoroughfares outlined in vivid red maps of the modern plague of london which marked each public house with a red spot and maps displaying the incidence of death by cholera maps of the underground railway of trams and of other forms of modern transport soon followed so that london became a city of maps one laid upon another like an historical palimpsest it never ceased to grow and in the process glowed perpetually with various coloursthose of death alcohol and poverty competing with those of improvements and railways up to this time henry james wrote in i have been crushed under a sense of the mere magnitude of londonits inconceivable immensityin such a way as to paralyse my mind for any appreciation of details yet for the true antiquarian of london those details live and survive within the memory beyond the reach of any plan or survey in my youth john stow wrote in the sixteenth century i remember devout people as well men as women of this city were accustomed oftentimes especially on fridays weekly to walk that way to houndsditch purposely there to bestow their charitable alms every poor man or woman lying in their bed within their window which was towards the street open so low that every man might see them it is a distinct and striking image in a city of spectacle and ritual and then again i remember within this fifty four years malmsey not to be sold more than one penny halfpenny the pint memory here must complete the task of observation if only to stop the tongues of unthankful men such as used to ask why have ye not noted this or that and give no thanks for what is done stow remains the guardian spirit of all those londoners who came after him filled with their own memories of time passing and time gone there is charles lamb wandering through the temple in the early s noting what an antique air had the now almost effaced sundials with their moral inscriptions seeming coevals with that time which they measured these were my oldest recollections a decade later macaulay spoke of a coming time when the citizens of london ancient and gigantic as it is will in vain seek amidst new streets and squares and railway stations for the site of that dwelling which was in their youth the centre of their lives or destinies leigh hunt in the town of observed of the city nor perhaps is there a single spot in london in which the past is not visibly present to us either in the shape of some old buildings or at least in the names of the streets at the very beginning of the nineteenth century a london journalist known as aleph wandered down lothbury recalling its previous tortuous dark vista of lofty houses lit only by oillamps since alephs journey it has changed many times yet it still remains unique and identifiable most particularly with its recurrent darkness and loftiness it has been said that no stone ever leaves london but is reused and redeployed adding to that great pile upon which the city rests the paradox here is of continual change and constant underlying identity it is at the core of the antiquarian passion for a continually altering and expanding city which nevertheless remains an echo chamber for stray memories and unfulfilled desires that is perhaps why as vs pritchett noted in the late s london has the effect of making one feel personally historic it is strange he once wrote that although london wipes out its past the londoner does not quite forget every journey through the streets of london can then become a journey into the past and there will always be londoners who thrill to that past like an obsession in the early s another london visionary arthur machen walked through camden town and found himself witnessing like a revenant the city of with pony gigs and dimly lit interiors all of it conjured up by the sudden glimpse of a little coachhouse and the little stables and all a vision of a mode of life that has passed utterly away until recent years it was possible to find inhabitants of bermondsey who were in the words of one reporter enthralled by the history of their borough it is a genuine london passion where thomas hardy could hear the voice of paul in ancient stones exhibited within the british museum londoners hear the voices of all those who came before them in the smallest houses and meanest streets charles lamb remembered a cashier in the southsea house mr evans who was eloquent in relation to old and new londonthe site of old theatres churches streets gone to decaywhere rosamonds pond stoodthe mulberry gardensand the conduit in cheap the author of highways and byways in london mrs et cook stood upon westminster bridge in a winters twilight when as the light faded and the mist rose i seemed to lose the forms of the modern buildings and to see as though in a vision the thorney isle of the dim past yet even as this early twentiethcentury observer sees intimations of the eighth century her meditations are broken by a beggarwomans plea for money i aint got a place ter sleep in this night gawd knows i aint dear lydy past and present collide in a thousand different forms when rose macaulay visited the wilderness of a bombsite in the second world war she had an intimation of the primeval chaos and old night which had been before londinium was in the preceding century leigh hunt observed that st pauls churchyard was a place in which you may get the last new novel and find remains of the ancient britons and of the sea despite his fear of the citys immensity henry james himself experienced the ghostly sense the disembodied presences of the old london there is a foottunnel under the thames linking greenwich with the isle of dogs which seems to harbour something of its mystery for stephen graham the author of the lachrymose london nights it told of an enigma which would never be solved the enigma of londons sorrow her burden her slavery there have always been solitary londoners meditating upon the past musing even upon civilisations which like their own had fallen into decay and dissolution edward gibbon sat alone in his lodgings in bond street and to the sound of rattling coaches reflected upon the fall of rome the young john milton sat up half the night in his bedchamber in bread street his candle glimmering at the window while he dreamed of ancient london and its founders there have been such men in every generation men who have spent their lives in the disquisition of venerable antiquity concerning this city one of the first fabyan a sheriff and alderman of london wrote a chronicle or concordance of histories of which the first edition was published in among other topics he compiled a chronology of the successive weathercocks upon st pauls arnolds chronicle or customs of london appeared in where among a record of the charters of the city can be found an estimate of the livings of london and a recipe to pickle sturgeon the work of stow himself was successively edited and corrected by munday dyson and strype who also considered themselves the faithful recorders of london being birthplace and breeder to us they were followed by william stukeley who found evidence of julius caesars camp by old st pancras church and traced the line of roman roads through eighteenthcentury london he appears to have had all the quiet virtues and gentle dispositions becoming an antiquarianone living in the halfvisionary world of the past as so many other londoners have done he died in queen square and by his particular direction was buried in the forlorn churchyard of east ham the most elaborate and extensive antiquarian studies however can be dated from the middle decades of the nineteenth century it was the time of encyclopaedic surveys including the six great volumes of old and new london edited by w thornbury and e walford there are literally hundreds of other volumes chronicling the curiosities and celebrities of what had become the largest and wealthiest city in the world this was also the period in which were completed various histories of london a tradition which was maintained into the early twentieth century by sir walter besant the founder of the peoples palace whose memorial can now be viewed beneath hungerford railway bridge it was besant who remarked on his deathbed ive been walking about london for the last thirty years and i find something fresh in it every day an observation which could be confirmed by almost any admirer of london by the s at the time when urban chroniclers were extolling the size and variety of the new city there were others who like their predecessors in earlier centuries mourned the passing of the old the society for photographing relics of old london was established in as a direct result of the threat of demolition of the oxford arms in warwick lane and its work was complemented by such books as london vanished and vanishing and unknown london there were individual writers many of them journalists from london newspapers who explored the vestiges of the past concealed in old courts and antique squares their labours were in turn continued in the twentieth century by books such as londons secret history the vanished city and lost london the city has always provoked sensations of loss and transitoriness yet antiquarianism can take many forms at the turn of the twentieth century sir laurence gomme a great administrative historian wrote a series of volumes which suggested even if they did not entirely prove that london had retained a territorial and judicial identity since the time of the roman occupation the permanent and unchanging nature of london was thereby affirmed in the very face of change gommes work was in a sense complemented by that of lewis spence whose legendary london connected the history of the city with the tribal patterns of the celts as well as the magic of the druids their contributions to the history of london have been sadly neglected or derided partly as a result of the more precise and scientific record of the citys growth maintained by the various london archaeological societies whose own work has proved invaluable a more fundamental challenge came from the numerous sociologists and demographers who in the postwar years were more concerned with rebuilding and with new forms of urban planning antiquarianism might itself be considered outmoded therefore except for one curious ceremony which is conducted every year at the church of st andrew undershaft here rests john stows tomb with a memorial figure of the tudor antiquarian resting upon it he holds a quill pen in his hand and every year at the beginning of april the lord mayor of london and a distinguished historian proceed to the memorial where a new quill is placed in stows stone hand so the city honours one of its greatest citizens with the changing of the quill a solemn token of the fact that the writing of londons history will never come to an end trading streets and trading parishes the london milkmaid as portrayed by marcellus laroon in the midseventeenth century milkmaids were generally welsh and seldom merry the silver plate on her head was part of mayday festivities chapter where is the cheese of thames street in the nineteenth century old clothes were sold by male jews the largest number of bakers in the same century came from scotland while london barbers were characteristically cityborn brickmakers were of london too while their labourers were almost exclusively irish navvies sprang from yorkshire and lancashire while a large proportion of shoemakers arrived from northampton sugarrefining and the trade in toys were once almost entirely in the hands of germans who confined themselves to whitechapel and its environs most butchers and fishmongers of smithfield and billingsgate respectively were londonborn but cheesemongers characteristically arrived from hampshire and dairymen from wales the welsh milkmaid was once a regular sight of the capital linen drapers came from manchester and only a small proportion of their assistants were londoners most came from the counties of devon and somerset in each case members of the same profession tended to form distinct enclaves of habitation and employment the same segregation has always been part of londons trade thus in the seventeenth century opticians tended to congregate in ludgate street pawnbrokers in long lane booksellers in st pauls churchyard in the eighteenth century cheese was to be found in thames street and playing cards along the strand signs for shops and taverns were on sale in hoop alley shoe lane where the signpainters kept large stocks ranging from teapots to white harts and red lions birdsellers were located in seven dials coachmakers in long acre statuaries in euston road clothiers in tottenham court road and dentists along st martins lane yet sometimes a street will shake off old associations and change its trade catherine street was once known as the quarter for pornographic bookdealers despite the fact that the saints name is derived from the greek for purity but then in the early decades of the nineteenth century it changed its trade to eatinghouses newsvendors and advertising agents the strand was notable for its publication of newspapers before that industry moved eastwards to fleet street and then eastwards again to the newly resurgent docklands certain parishes were identified by the trades which were continued within them there were poulterers in st georges lacemen in st martins artists in holy sepulchre without newgate and timber merchants in lambeth wheelwrights were to be found in deptford millers in stratford and saddlers at charing cross trades sometimes delayed their departure even when the streets themselves were pulled down very curious it is to mark walford wrote in old and new london how old trades and old types of inhabitants linger about localities he gave the example of the silversmiths in cranbourn street the street was demolished together with the adjacent cranbourn alley when suddenly shops in the recently created new cranbourn street were overflowing with plates jewellery and trinkets the segregation of districts within london is also reflected in the curious fact that the london artisan rarely understands more than one department of the trade to which he serves his apprenticeship while country workmen tend to know all the aspects of their profession it is another token of the specialisation of london by the nineteenth century the divisions and distinctions manifested themselves in the smallest place and in the smallest trade in hoxton there grew up the industry of furand featherdressing for example and in east london walter besant observed that the number of their branches and subdivisions is simply bewildering a man will go through life in comfort knowing but one infinitesimal piece of work a man or woman generally knows how to do one thing and one thing only and if that one piece of work cannot be obtained the man is lost for he can do nothing else so these workers become a small component of the intricate and gigantic mechanism which is london and london trade a map of the industrial quarters of northeast london shows welldefined patches of light blue for camden town instruments and the hackney clothing quarter as well as the south hackney shoe area a dark blue area shows the aldersgate clothing quarter close to the shoreditch printing quarter which is bordered on the north by furniture quarter and on the south by east end clothing quarter these areas comprising many small industries and businesses were described in the times london history atlas as the successors of longestablished crafts which originated in the medieval city then as if in imitation of the conditions of the citys medieval origin other more outlying areas began to specialise in certain trades hammersmith and woolwich were known for engineering and metals holborn and hackney for their textiles certain other professions migrate together flocking over the centuries to new territories as if by instinct or impulse it is well known that doctors and surgeons now cluster in harley street but in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries notable medical practitioners inhabited finsbury square finsbury pavement finsbury place and finsbury circus while the younger or less affluent doctors took lodgings in the immediate vicinity they all migrated in the s and s and finsbury became a socially deserted district there was a similar movement in the manufacture of hats they were made in an area of bermondsey known as the maze between bermondsey street and borough high street together with tooley street but then some unknown migratory instinct pushed the grand centre of hat manufacture further westward until it came to reside by the blackfriars road why bermondsey should thus be abandoned is unknown although it would be fair to guess that it was the result of some hidden mechanism involved in commerce by some similar process the business of furnituremaking removed from curtain road shoreditch to camden town the phenomenon of trading streets and trading parishes can also be recognised on a larger urban scale with the employment of land use maps these demonstrate that the whole area was once divided into regions marked built up area clay pits unproductive market garden pasture mixed farming and grain rotations in a remarkably fluent pattern of organisation a map of eighteenthcentury food markets shows a similar natural pattern as if the very topography of london was determined by silent and invisible lines of commerce why have the furniture dealers of tottenham court road still operating in that street after years in recent times been joined by shops selling electronic apparatus why have the clockmakers of clerkenwell been supplemented by design consultancies and advertising companies why has wardour street the home of antique bricàbrac now become the centre of the film industry an intervening period in the late nineteenth century when soho became the centre of music publishing may help to account for the transition but it does not explain it like much else in london there is no surviving rhyme or reason to elucidate its secret and mysterious changes a london neighbourhood a depiction of the rookery of st giles parish in it was perhaps even more noisome and squalid than this sketch suggests note the pig chapter the crossroads the bells of st gilesinthefields according to a church report are in very fair condition and in spite of their great age work very well they are more than three hundred years old and yet are still heard every thursday lunchtime but the history of this london parish stretches back much further in familiar and almost characteristic fashion there was a saxon church on the site of the present st giles drury lane once known as via de aldwych was the main road leading towards watling street from the settlement of lundenwic or covent garden at its northern end was a village cross and a chapel administered by john of good memory upon this site in the first years of the twelfth century were established a chapel and a hospital for lepers they were dedicated to st giles himself the patron saint of lepers the establishments lay among fields and marshes their contagion kept apart from the city but st giles was also the intercessionary saint for beggars and cripples for those afflicted with misery or those consigned to loneliness he himself was lame but refused to be treated for his disability in order that he might practise selfmortification all the more fervently the invocation of sorrow and loneliness first embodied in the twelfthcentury foundation has never entirely left this area throughout its history it has been the haunt of the poor and the outcast vagrants even now roam its streets and close to the church there is still a centre for the homeless the grounds belonging to the hospital which eventually became the parish of st giles are now roughly delineated by the triangle of charing cross road formerly hog lane and even earlier eldestrate new oxford street and shaftesbury avenue it remained a refuge for lepers until the fifteenth century when it seems that it also made provision for the very poor and the infirm it was in the words of a london county council survey a peculiarly london institution a village sprang up beside the refuge with small shops catering to the needs of the inmates gervasele lyngedrap linendraper is one of the late medieval merchants mentioned in the hospital records at the time of the reformation the establishment was dissolved and the chapel transformed into the parish church of st gilesinthefields the first postcatholic building was erected in but by that time the nature of the district had changed always an ambiguous and illdefined area hovering between city and country in the ninth century it had been on the saxon highway and as london grew more prosperous its trade and traffic had increased there were taverns and hostels for travellers another kind of wanderer arrived when by proclamation of elizabeth in many foreigners were ejected from the city itself and settled in the vicinity these in turn were followed by the vagrant and the impoverished meanwhile the position of st giles outside the city and close to westminster attracted various notables who built grand houses among pasture grounds recreated as gardens by the seventeenth century st giles was known for its startling contrasts between rich and poor the latter clustering to the south of what is now new oxford street it remained in that unsettled state for several centuries numbers of the habitations seem calculated for the depth of misery one chronicler of the parish wrote in the nineteenth century others for the extremes of opulence it functioned then as both entrance and exit it greeted arrivals and harboured those who had been expelled from the city it was in every sense a crossroads a gallows and later a cage or pound were placed on the spot where now tottenham court road charing cross road oxford street and new oxford street meet beneath st giles circus as it is called exists the crossroads of the northern and central lines of the underground system st giles has also been the crossroads between time and eternity for a shroud for a poor woman that dyed in the cage reads one notation in the churchwardens account even after the gallows had been removed in the late fifteenth century st giles was still the guardian of the threshold to death all malefactors on their way to the tyburn tree halted at the aptly named resurrection gate of st gilesinthefields where they were given a bowl of ale to comfort them on their journey it might almost be described as a local celebration since st giles was remarkable for nurturing the hangmen of the day as well as being the second largest source of those who were hanged in the words of an old lyric st giles breed better hang than seed that final drink upon the rite of passage was appropriate in another sense also since the parish was celebrated or condemned according to taste for the number of taverns and the incidence of drunkenness the white hart established in the thirteenth century survives in name at least by the corner of drury lane but many others have crumbled to dustthe maidenhead in dyot street the owl bowl in canters alley the black bear the black jack the black lamb the vine and the rose the maid in the moon off drury lane has now been curiously succeeded by the moon under water along the charing cross road there is another connection with alcohol the present grape street is aligned with the old vineyard of the hospital this is also the neighbourhood where william hogarth set gin lane the tradition of the last drink or the st giles bowl according to john timbs the author of the nineteenthcentury curiosities of london had made it a retreat for noisome and squalid outcasts but no description can match the outrage and despair of the eighteenthcentury engraving hogarth has established the essential spirit of the place where vagrants still sit in small groups drinking ale from cansthe emaciated young man the drunken woman with syphilitic sores the suicide the hasty burials in situ the child about to fall to its death all these reflect in exaggerated detail the reality of st giles as a centre of deathdealing drink but they are also uncannily prophetic of the early nineteenthcentury slums known as the rookeries which would arise on the identical spot some fifty years later another calamity was visited by drink upon st gilesinthefields in a great vat of the horseshoe brewery situated just north of the crossroads exploded and released approximately ten thousand gallons of beer stalls carts and walls were washed away in the flood and the beer quickly filled the cellars of the vicinity drowning eight people gin lane and beer lane met in confluence the cellars that proved so fatal have their own history to have a cellar in st giles was a catchphrase for squalor and misery as early as the churchwardens accounts refer to the great influx of poor people into this parish persons that have families in cellars and other abuses these lower rooms acquired their reputation for foulness because of the locality itself st gilesinthefields was known for being damp and unwholesome a parliamentary act of had condemned drury lane and its environs as deepe foul and dangerous to all who pass those ways a report by christopher wren complained of its noisomnesse as it was surrounded by marshland conduits and open ditches and in the same period an inquiry at westminster complained that the area was very much overflowed with water and had become exceeding miry dirty and dangerous was dangerous in more than one respect since from drury lane and the little courts beside it emerged that pestilence which became known as the great plague of london in the last weeks of the first people to be visited by that contagion were living at the northern end of the lane opposite the cole yard where the fourteenyearold nell gwynne dwelled the outbreak turned peoples eyes pretty much to that quarter as daniel defoe put it in his journal of the plague year and the sudden increase of burials in the parish led everyone to suspect that the plague was among the people at that end of the town so this unlucky spot was the source of the great distemper which threatened to destroy the greater part of londons citizens before being purged by fire many of the houses were closed down and in his diary for june samuel pepys noticed much against my will the red crosses daubed upon the wooden doors the area was in a curious way blamed for the virulent diseasethat one parish of st giles at london hath done us all this mischief sir thomas peyton wroteand it seems likely that its ambiguous status as a resort for the wretched and the outcast was now responsible for its dire reputation the refuse of the city were in a most threatening form coming back into the city yet this was not the end of st giless unhappy history waves of poor settlers generally inhabited its large buildings which over the years were converted into tenements and cellars it is not too fanciful to suggest that the spirit of st giles himself influenced the journey of the poor to the parish of st giles since as a direct consequence of its earlier history as a hospital it was known for the scale of its charitable relief the midseventeenthcentury accounts of the parish note gone to tottenhamcourt meg being verie sicke s d geven to the balletsinging cobler s d gave to old fritzwig s d p a years rent for mad bess s d there are many references to relief granted for poore plundered irish to families that came oute of ireland and in fact that nation was to maintain its hold upon the area for two centuries but the french also came and those expelled from the city for vagrancy as well as black servants reduced to beggary who were known as st giles blackbirds in this quarter there emerged a tradition of mendicity which it has not wholly exorcised as early as there were calls for idle persons to be taken up and within a generation complaints that the parish was the resort of irish and aliens beggars and dissolute and depraved characters three generations later the area was considered to be overburthened with poor the whole history of london vagrancy can be understood by proper attention to this small territory most poignant perhaps is the unhappy fate of individuals who appear in the annals of poor relief in the mideighteenth century old simon lived with his dog under a staircase in a ruined house within dyot street a contemporary description of him by jt smith in book for a rainy day is similar to that which could be given of late twentiethcentury vagrants he had several waistcoats and as many coats increasing in size so that he was enabled by the extent of the uppermost garment to cover the greater part of the bundles containing rags of various colours and distinct parcels with which he was girded about consisting of books canisters containing bread cheese and other articles of food matches a tinderbox and meat for his dog the presence or companionship of a dog seems to be a permanent characteristic of the london vagrant old jack norris the musical shrimp man lived some seventy years later in the same street now renamed george street a beggar engaged in the cadging ramble under the guise of selling shrimps he starved to death or as the jury put it died by the visitation of god there was anne henley who in the spring of died in her th year in smarts buildings she used to sit at various doors in holborn to sell her pincushions she was short in stature mild and modest in her deportment cleanly in her person and generally wore a grey cloak at the time of writing a large woman with a shaved head sits on new oxford street between earnshaw street and dyott street which has reacquired its old name she carries bags filled with newspapers and talks to herself continually but she never asks for money it is not clear why she should choose each day the same very public position unless we were to surmise that the old lure of dyott street has not been wholly lost in the rebuilding of the area a young man with closecropped hair and steelrimmed glasses sits and begs near the corner of dyott street on st giles high street between earnshaw street and dyott street the steps and doorway of a disused office block are used by middleaged men who beg money for a cup of tea st giles is indeed still a haven for beggars and vagrants among them the woman who sits surrounded by pigeons in a urinestained corner off high holborn and the old man who is always drunk but never begs by the dominion theatre where once the brewery stood vagrant youths beg from passersby around the corner of the theatre they lie in sleeping bags directly across the road from the ymca hostel emphasising that the place of transients in the life of st giles has never faded on the threshold of st giles where the great road of high holborn passes the entrances of southampton row and proctor street vagrants can always be seen singly or in groups as if they were guardians of the area they also linger in the churchyard of st gilesinthefields whiskered redfaced dirty drinking spirits like the generations who came before them in this spirit of individual narrative we can note the end of the characteristically short lives in this neighbourhood as recounted in the parish record like those of elizabeth otley and one grace who were killed by the fall of a chimney in partridgealley one farmers child in the coleyard drowned in a tub of water a dead man being thrust in the eye by a footman one goddid white that drowned herself a girl in hogg lane that hanged herself the deathe of a childe that parte of the limbes were bitt off by a dog or cat at my lord of southamptons house in longfielde a male child murdered and layed at the backside of the kings head inne indictment against priscilla owen for biting her husbands finger which occasioned his death there is another way of describing its inhabitants in pictorial narratives they are seen as emblematic of a certain urban type whose depraved or drunken character leads inevitably to an early demise through illness or upon the gallows death then becomes once more the province of st giles the fatal stages of hogarths harlots progress are set in drury lane and in a neighbouring nightcellar the idle apprentice is arrested for murder before being dispatched to the gallows another of hogarths infamous characters tom nero in four stages of cruelty is a st giles charity boy he also ends upon the gallows death was rife within the parish in another sense since st giles had the second greatest rate of mortality in the entire city the poor can also become the creatures of another narrative device when their lives are retold by those with a taste for neogothic sensationalism or prurience charles dickens was repeatedly drawn to this area either alone or in the company of police inspectors and immortalised one of its most celebrated thoroughfares in his reflections upon monmouth street tobias smollett wrote of two tatterdemalions from the purlieus of st giles and between them both was but one shirt and a pair of breeches in henry fielding another great london novelist published his own account of infamous proceedings in st giles where men and women often strangers to each other lie promiscuously the price of a double bed being no more than threepence as an encouragement for them to lie together that as these places are adapted to whoredom so are they no less provided for drunkenness gin being sold in them all at a penny a quartern in one of these houses and that not a large one he mr welch high constable of holborn hath numbered fifty eight persons of both sexes the stench of whom was so intolerable that it soon compelled him to quit the place drink sex and smell are here mingled in a heady compound designed to titillate the senses of those fortunate enough to be able otherwise to avoid the area these are precisely the scenes and scents which fielding could not have presented within any of his official fiction but in the guise of sober reportage he could indulge his novelistic appetite for the filth and noisomness it is not necessary to emphasise that the lives of the st giles poor were indeed wretched and that there were dirty houses of assignation in the parish but it ought also to be remembered that the great london novelists such as dickens and fielding created a strange shadowplay of urban imagery their own occluded or obsessive characters mingled with the darker forces of the city to create a theatrical and symbolic london which has on many occasions supplanted the reality of various areas the most sensational accounts of st gilesinthefields were reserved for the first decades of the nineteenth century this was the time of the rookeries an island of cellars and tenements roughly bounded by st giles high street bainbridge street and dyott street within this unfortunate triangle before new oxford street was constructed to lay waste the slums were church lane maynard street carrier street ivy lane and church street together with a congregation of yards and courts and alleys which turned the area into a maze used both as a refuge and as a hidingplace for those who dwelled there none else have any business there wrote edward walford in old and new london and if they had they would find it to their interest to get out of it as soon as possible the rookeries were also known as little dublin or the holy land because of the irish population which dwelled there but there were thieves coiners prostitutes and vagrants as well as labourers roadsweepers and streetsellers the lanes here were narrow and dirty windows of decaying tenements were stuffed with rags or paper while the interiors were damp and unwholesome the walls were sagging the floors covered in dirt the low ceilings discoloured by mould their smell was altogether indescribable thomas beames in the rookeries of london described how these sinister streets were crowded with loiterers women with short pipes in their mouths and bloated faces and men who filled every intermediate occupation between greengrocer and birdcatcher its inhabitants were also squalid children haggard men with long uncombed hair in rags wolfish looking dogs behind some of the most populous and busy streets in the capital were these areas of stale inactivity and impoverished languor it was one of the many permanent and formidable contrasts within the city the night lodgings here were known colloquially as beggars operas because of the drink and tumult which were encouraged for many generations there was also an annual carnival of beggars in the vicinity in fact only sex and drink could make the conditions bearable an official report in states that one room in a house was occupied by only three families in the day but as many as could be got into it at night more than twenty people were often found in one small space together with the wares which they sold in the street oranges onions herrings and watercress being the favoured articles in one alley behind church street there was a chamber like a cow house where seventeen human beings eat drunk and slept in this fearful place the floor was damp and below the level of the court once again the peculiar dampness or fetidness of the parish is emphasised the noisomness of which wren and others had complained the area was filled with vermin of every description and in these conditions there were innumerable cases of fever cholera and consumption thomas beames found a young man with a fatal consumptive coughhe was quite naked had not a rag to his back but over him was thrown a thin blanket and a blue rug like a horse cloththese he removed to let us see there was no deception in many cases of mortal disease those stricken were left to die alone untended unheeded they died and made no sign without a word which betokened religious feeling on their lips without god in the world nobody was beside them to murmur st giles protect them because the presiding saint may be said to have fled the vicinity the irish behaved in a reckless and violent manner because they believed that they had entered a heathen city the rookeries embodied the worst living conditions in all of londons history this was the lowest point which human beings could reach before death took hold of them and to the irish it seemed that the city and its inhabitants were already given over to the devil they were given over to the landlord however and not to the devil london is established upon commercial profit and financial speculation and the pattern of its housing has followed similar imperatives it has grown largely from speculative building advancing in succeeding waves of investment and profittaking while being momentarily stilled in periods of recession the parish of st giles was a particularly interesting case of exploitation a small group of individuals owned the housing stock of the areaeight people for example owned about per cent of the houses in the church lane quarterand they in turn let out the streets one by one a person for an agreed sum rented a street by the year and then let out certain houses on a weekly return while the proprietor of each house rented out separate rooms the person who rented a room would then take money from those who inhabited a corner of it it represents an absolute hierarchy of need or desperation in which no one assumed responsibility for the dreadful conditions which prevailed they were instead blamed upon the irish or the vices of the lower orders who somehow were seen to have brought their unhappy fate upon themselves the caricatures of hogarth or of fielding damn the victims rather than their oppression there also emerged the mob of st giles an undifferentiated mass of common human beings who posed a threat to order and security in one armed raid upon an irish ken as reported in peter linebaughs the london hanged the whole district had become alarmed and hundreds came pouring down upon usmen women and children women did i saythey looked fiends half naked here the demonic language of the heathen city is applied to the tormented themselves but if we look more closely at this mob it will perhaps become more variegated and more interesting it was often assumed that because st giles was a haven for transients it was therefore inhabited by a wholly transient population but in fact the evidence of the settlement and examination books of the period reveals that the population was relatively stable and the movement in the parish took place only within sharply defined boundaries the poor in other words clung to their neighbourhood and had no desire to move outside it when later redevelopment of the area removed many parts of the rookeries their inhabitants migrated to adjacent streets where they lived in even more overcrowded circumstances it is in fact a general characteristic of londoners that they tend to conduct their lives in a relatively restricted area it is still possible to find people in hackney or leytonstone for example who have never gone west and similarly inhabitants of bayswater or acton who have never travelled to the eastern portions of the city in the case of the paupers of st gilesinthefields that territorial imperative was very strong they lived and died within the same few square yards with their own network of shops public houses markets and street contacts the great social topographer charles booth described st gilesinthefields as the repository of ordinary labour but this term like mob hardly does justice to the nature of employment in this quarter of outcast london there were knifegrinders and streetsingers dealers in vegetables and makers of door mats dogbreakers and crossing sweepers bird dealers and shoemakers hawkers of prints and sellers of herring more exotic trades too flourished in the neighbourhood until when houses were built upon it the southern region of the parish was a wasteland known as cock and pye fields it was not properly urbanised until however when seven streets were laid out to meet at a central pillar and thereby form a star this area was known as the seven dials perhaps the symbolic dimension of this late seventeenthcentury development materially encouraged the presence of the astrologers who assembled here there was gilbert anderson a notorious quack who lived beside the inn called the cradle and coffin in cross street there was dr james tilbury at the black swan by st gilesinthefields who sold the herb spoonwart supposedly mingled with gold w baynham who resided a few yards away at the corner house over against the upper end of st martins lane near the seven dials st giles was able to inform his customers which shall win in horse or foot races again near the seven dials in st giles liveth a gentlewoman the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter who could divine the result of pregnancies and lawsuits she also interprets dreams another famous quack and alchemist lived by st giles church where you may see over the door a printed paper where he promised to reveal the workings of sulphur and mercury and there was the notorious jack edwards who lived in castlestreet in the parish of st gilesinthefields where he sold medicines pills and potions for the treatment of humans and animals alike all of them can be found in the quacks of old london by cj thompson these examples of what we might now term alternative medicine are taken from the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries but the neighbourhood has never lost its oblique reputation for occultism and strange practice in succeeding years the freemasons the swedenborg society the theosophical society and the order of the golden dawn have established themselves in the same parish a few hundred yards from monmouth street is the atlantis bookshop which remains the most celebrated depository of occult literature in england here again may be another example of that territorial imperative or genius loci which keeps inhabitants and activities in the same small area jack edwards was a ballad singer as well as a doctor and the ballads of seven dials were as notorious as the events and people whom they commemorated james catnach of monmouth court was the first begetter and promoter of the broadsides songs and pamphlets which circulated through the streets of eighteenthcentury london they cost a penny each hence the term catchpenny as a tribute to his marketing skills he was forced to take the coppers to a bank however because no one else would touch them in case of infection springing off the metal the reputation of seven dials was always dark and disturbed although catnach himself remedied his own position by boiling the pennies in potash and vinegar so that they became bright once more there were five other printers of ballads in the immediate vicinity of st giles publishing street literature with titles such as unhappy lady of hackney letter written by jesus christ last dying speech of these broadsides were for the people of london the real news passing from hand to hand in many instances it was disruptive or polemical news concerning events which affected the citizens themselves there was one mideighteenthcentury ballad for example which was issued from seven dials and which concerned the local workhousethe workhouse cruelty workhouses turnd gaols and gaolers executioners the death of one mrs mary whistle in the institution became the subject of popular resentment there were also ballad complaints about the conditions of paupers and beggars many left to die in the very same streets from which the ballads were issued in that sense st gilesinthefields perhaps because of its raging population and its awful mortality acted as an alternative source of authority that made it a suitable haven for coiners who were in effect issuing another kind of money in the process helping to disrupt the system of commerce and finance which cast so palpable a shadow over the impoverished inhabitants of this area it is appropriate also that the parish should be the haunt of prostitutes and a harbour of night houses the courts and lanes adjoining drury lane were the most notorious for the trade and it was here in his london labour and the london poor published between and that henry mayhew recorded the statement of one woman over forty shabbily dressed and with a disreputable unprepossessing appearance mayhews accounts are a remarkable and affecting source of street life as well as street anecdote his veracity and accuracy have sometimes been questioned largely because he was part of a generation of midvictorian writers who tended to sensationalise or fictionalise the events and inhabitants of the great wen but the general tenor and candour of mayhews transcriptions can be trusted as in this unhappy womans story i lodge in charles street drury lane now i did live in nottingham court once and earl street but lord ive lived in a many places you wouldnt think and i dont imagine youd believe one half im always achopping and achanging like the wind as you may say i dont think much of my way of life you folks as has honour and character and feelings and such cant understand how all thats been beaten out of people like me i dont feel im used to it i dont suppose ill live much longer and thats another thing that pleases me i dont want to live and yet i dont care enough about dying to make away with myself i arnt got that amount of feeling that some has and thats where it is mayhew declares that she had become brutal but in fact the city had brutalised her her fatalism however has not necessarily been shared dm green in people of the rookery remarked that because of its dreadful conditions st giles contained the seeds of revolution it is a curious chance then that in the second congress of the russian social democratic party should take place on tottenham court road itself it was organised by lenin and resulted in the separation of bolsheviks from mensheviks as the author of lenin in london lionel kochahs has put it it is almost true to say that bolshevism as a political party was actually founded in tottenham court road so the parish of st gilesinthefields did indeed contain those seeds of violent social disruption even if it were a species of instinctive and distant revenge the area around st giles was in the language of the period a sore or abscess that might poison the whole body politic with the unspoken assumption that it must in some way be purged or cauterised so between the years and a great thoroughfare known as new oxford street was run through it leading to wholesale demolition of the worst lanes and courts with an attendant exodus of the poor inhabitantsalthough most of them moved only a few streets further south the language of the body was once more used by contemporary moralists who characteristically celebrated the fact that one huge filthy mass had been dispersed yet the heady atmosphere of the place was by no means removed the exiled poor simply lived in conditions worse and more overcrowded than before while the premises and shops of the new street remained unlet for some years it was still a damp dismal and noisome place to which few new residents could be attracted and so it stands today new oxford street is one of the least interesting thoroughfares in london with no character except the somewhat dubious one of being dominated by the highrise block of centrepoint the building towers above the site of the old cage and gallows and may perhaps be considered a fitting successor to them it is an area now without character or purpose the home of computer suppliers an argos superstore some indistinguishable and undistinguished office buildings and shops designed for the trade of passing tourists there are still the vagrants lingering in the recesses of the area as a token of its past but where there was once life and suffering there is now a dismal quiet from which st giles himself can offer no deliverance london as theatre punch and judy arrived early in london and could be seen on the streets until recent times street entertainers have haunted the city since the thirteenth century and perhaps before chapter show show show show show show show show show show this was the cry of a seventeenthcentury city crowd as recorded in ned wards london spy there were indeed many shows to be seen on the london streets but the greatest fair of all was held at smithfield it was known as bartholomews fair smithfield itself began as a simple trading area for cloth in one place and cattle in another but its history has always been one of turbulence and spectacle great jousts and tournaments were held there in the fourteenth century it was the ritual place for duels and ordeal by battle it was the home of the gallows and the stake that festive nature was also evident in less forbidding ways football matches and wrestling contests were commonly staged and the appropriately named cock lane just beyond the open ground was the haunt of prostitutes miracle plays were also part of its entertainment the trading market for cloth had become outmoded by the middle of the sixteenth century but the privileges of the fair were still retained by the city corporation so instead of a threeday market it was transformed into a fourteenday festival which resounds through the plays and novels of succeeding centuries with the cry of what do you lack what is it you buy from the beginning of its fame there were puppetshows and street performers human freaks and games of dice and thimble canvas tents for dancing or for drinking eatinghouses which specialised in roast pork this was the fair which jonson celebrated in his play of the same name he notes the sound of rattles drums and fiddles here on the wooden stalls were laid out mousetraps and gingerbread purses and pouches there were booths and toyshops displayed at the sign of the shoe and slap was the wonder of nature a girl about sixteen years of age born in cheshire and not above eighteen inches long reads very well whistles and all very pleasant to hear close by was exhibited a man with one head and two distinct bodies as well as a giant man and little fairy woman performing among the other freak shows and theatrical booths there were puppies whistling birds and horses for sale there were ballads cried out with bottled ale and tobacco being constantly consumed cunning men cast nativities and prostitutes plied their trade jonson himself noted small details too and watched as the cores of apples were gathered up for the bears as one of his characters puts it bless me deliver me help hold me the fair it continued curiously enough during the puritan commonwealth no doubt with the primary motive of venting the steam of the more unruly citizens but flourished after the restoration of when liberty and licence came back into fashion one versifier of the period notes masquerades dramatising the woman of babylon the devil and the pope as well as shows of dancing bears and acrobats some acts came year after year there was the tall dutchwoman who made annual appearances for at least seventeen years together with the horse and no horse whose tail stands where his head should do and there were always ropewalkers among them the famous scaramouch dancing on the rope with a wheelbarrow before him with two children and a dog in it and with a duck on his head and the notable ropedancer jacob hall that can jump it jump it perhaps the most celebrated of all the acts however was that of joseph clark the english posture master or posture clark as he was known it seems that he could put out of joynt almost any bone or vertebra of his body and to replace it again he could so contort himself that he became unrecognisable even to his closest friends and so the fair went on as all fairs do there was even a ferris wheel known then as a whirligig later an up and down where according to ned ward in the london spy children lockd up in flying coaches who insensibly climbd upwards being once elevated to a certain height come down again according to the circular motion of the sphere they move in the general noise and clamour together with the inevitable crowd of pickpockets finally proved too much for the city authorities in the fortnight of the fair was reduced to three days at the end of august but if it became less riotous it was no less festive contemporary accounts dwell upon the drollery of merry andrews otherwise known as jack puddings or pickled herrings they wore a costume with donkeys ears and accompanied other performers with their fiddles one of the more famous fools was a seller of gingerbread nuts in covent garden since he was paid one guinea a day for his work at bartholomew fair he was at pains never to cheapen himself by laughing or by noticing a joke during the other days of the year alongside the merry andrews leapt the mountebanks who sold miracle cures and patent medicines to those credulous enough to purchase them in an illustration by marcellus laroon one such is dressed as a harlequin from commedia dellarte with a monkey tied to a rope beside him his voice too might be heard among the general noise and tumulta rare cordial to strengthen and cheer the heart under any misfortune a most rare dentifrice good to fortifie the stomach against all infections unwholesome damps malignant effluvias and so the fair rolled on it is perhaps appropriate amid the noise and excitement that in john bunyan collapsed and died at the corner of snow hill and cock lane if there was one central character however it was that of punch the uncrowned monarch of puppetplays hobbyhorses tabors crowds and bagpipes he had emerged upon the little stage by the end of the seventeenth century announced by a jester and accompanied by fiddle trumpet or drum he is not a uniquely london phenomenon but he became a permanent entertainer at the fairs and streets of the city with his violence his vulgarity and his sexual innuendo he was a recognisable urban character often turning towards a tightly packed bend of girls he sits himself down near to them my beautiful ones he says winking roguishly heres a girl friend come to join you with his great belly big nose and long stick he is the very essence of a gross sexual joke which unfortunately in later centuries became smaller squeakier and somehow transformed into entertainment for children there is a watercolour by rowlandson dated which shows a puppetplay with punch in action george iii and queen charlotte are driving to deptford but the attention of the citizens is drawn more towards the wooden booth where punch is beating the bare buttocks of his wife he was often conceived as a henpecked husband but here the worm has turned rowlandsons work is of course partly conceived as a satire against the royal family but it is filled with a greater and allencompassing urban energy within bartholomew fair itself there was a complete erasure of ordinary social distinctions one of the complaints against it lay in the fact that apprentice and lord might be enjoying the same entertainments or betting at the same gaming tables this is entirely characteristic of london itself heterogeneous and instinctively egalitarian it is no coincidence for example that at the time of the fair an annual supper was held in smithfield for young chimneysweeps charles lamb has immortalised the occasion in one of his essays the praise of chimney sweepers where he reports that hundreds of grinning teeth startled the night with their brightness while in the background could be heard the agreeable hubbub of the fair itself it might be argued that there is no true egalitarianism in the gesture and that such solemn festivities merely accustom the little weeps to their dismal fate this might then be considered one of the paradoxes of london which consoles those whom it is about to consume punch is also advertised in hogarths print of southwark fair known as the lady fair it was held in the streets around the borough in the month after bartholomew fair but since hogarth announced his engraving as the fair and the humours of a fair we may safely assume that he is portraying a characteristic and familiar london entertainment here punch is mounted upon a stage horse which picks the pocket of a clown above him there is a poster announcing punches opera which depicts the largenosed figure wheeling his wife in a barrow towards the open mouth of a dragon elsewhere in this fair a motley group of performers stands upon a wooden balcony where a painted cloth announces the siege of troy is here the entertainers have been identified as part of hannah lees theatrical company and one of their advertisements has in fact survived to which will be added a new pantomime opera intermixed with comic scenes between punch harlequin scaramouch pierrot and columbine nb we shall begin at ten in the morning and continue playing till ten at night it was a long day at the fair on each side of the players there are various feats of acrobatics a tightropewalker spans two wooden buildings while a ropeflyer descends precipitously from the tower of st george the martyr in another corner of the fair a wooden stage has collapsed and the actors fall upon stalls selling china and upset a table where two gamblers are playing at dice there are dwarves conjurors and waxworks performing dogs and monkeys a girl beats a drum while a mountebank sells his medicine a pickpocket plies his trade while another kind of performer swallows fire one customer can be seen gazing into the aperture of a wooden peepshow and does not notice that by his side a man is being arrested by a bailiff bartholomew fair itself became the arena for fictional characters whose authors used it as the setting of their adventures but perhaps the most famous account is autobiographical in nature in the seventh book of his prelude wordsworth memorialised his youthful residence in london in the s and chose bartholomew fair as one of its emblems with its anarchy and din barbarian and informala word which we might better translate as formless it was monstrous in colour motion shape sight sound filled with chattering monkeys dangling from their poles and children whirling in their roundabouts the stoneeater the man that swallows fire it is clear that the entertainments had not changed throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries but wordsworths particular response to its barbaric din and shapelessness is an example of his general attitude towards the city itself the fair becomes in fact a simulacrum of london the first lines of popes dunciad make a similar point by extolling the mighty mother and her son who brings the smithfield muses to the ear of kings it is a symbol of disorder and anarchy threatening to overwhelm the values of a humanised and civilised london with all its vulgar paraphernalia of shews machines and dramatical entertainments formerly agreeable only to the taste of the rabble the egalitarian energies of the city therefore are treated with the gravest mistrust by those who wrote for smaller london circles at the time of wordsworths visit the fair was gradually being extended until by it had spread up along one side of st johns street and in the other direction had almost reached the old bailey it had also become a place of danger and lawlessness with gangs of thieves known as lady hollands mob who robbed visitors beat inoffensive passersby with bludgeons and pelted harmless persons these were no longer the festivities of the eighteenth century and were certainly not to be endured in the more respectable climate of the midnineteenth bartholomew fair could never have lasted long into the victorian era and in it passed away without much sign of public mourning yet wordsworth had divined in the spectacle of the fair a permanent aspect of london life he recognised and recoiled from an innate and exuberant theatricality which was content to manifest sheer contrast and display with no interior or residual meaning in this book of the prelude residence in london he remarks on strangers of all ages the quick dance of colours lights and forms the babel din it is the play of difference characterised by mobility and indeterminacy which disturbs him within a few lines he notes shop after shop with symbols blazond names fronts of houses like a title page as if the city harboured endless forms of representation not one of which is superior to any other he records the ballads hanging upon the walls the huge advertisements the london cries and the stock urban characters of the cripple the bachelor the military idler as if they were all part of some great and endless theatre yet it is at least possible that he did not fully understand the very reality which he so vividly describesthese shifting pantomimic scenes these dramas of living men this great stage and public shows the spectacles and the showmen may indeed represent the true nature of london its theatricality therefore leads to extravagance in gesture mien and dress just as in all the streets and lanes the citizens were living shapes even the roadside beggar wears a written paper announcing his story thus all may be or seem unreal wordsworth believed that he saw only parts in every sense and could derive no feeling of the whole he may have been mistaken wordsworth was correct about the essential theatricality of the city but it may also be considered from another vantage it may become a cause for celebration charles lamb that great londoner extolled his city as a pantomime and masquerade the wonder of these sights impels me into nightwalks about her crowded streets and i often shed tears in the motley strand from fulness of joy at so much life macaulay wondered at the dazzling brilliancy of london spectacles while james boswell believed it to comprise the whole of human life in all its variety for dickens it was the magic lantern which filled his imagination with the glimpse of strange dramas and sudden spectacles for each of these londoners whether by birth or adoption the theatricality of london is its single most important characteristic the crowd that gathered to see the inauguration of the first underground railway in was compared in newspaper accounts to the crush at the doors of a theatre on the night of a pantomime and donald j olsen the author of the growth of victorian london has compared the speed and scale of city transport in that period to the magical transformation of the pantomime continually being translated into life that is why london has always been considered to be the home of stock theatrical charactersthe shabby genteel the city slicker the wide boy in printshop windows of the mideighteenth century there were caricatures of london types while the more fashionable citizens of the same period dressed up in costume for masques and disguisings the most famous pictorial series displaying london characters marcellus laroons the cryes of the city of london drawne after the life published in reveals many professions and trades where the actual principle was that of acting many beggars put on a masquerade for the benefit of their passing audience but laroon himself chose a particular female vagrant to exemplify what he called the london beggar he did not give her name but in fact she was known as nan mills who according to the most recent editors of his work was not only a good physiognomist but an excellent mimic and could adapt her countenance to every circumstance of distress there is no reason to doubt that she was also poor and conscious of her degradation here too is part of the mystery of london where suffering and mimicry penury and drama are aligned with each other to a degree where they become indistinguishable the rituals of crime have in london also taken on a theatrical guise jonathan wild the master criminal of mideighteenthcentury london declared that the mask is the summum bonum of our age while the marshalmen or city police of a slightly later date were costumed in cocked hats and spangled buttons there were more subtle disguises available to the detective of the city one is reminded of sherlock holmes a character who could have existed only in the heart of london according to his amanuensis holmes had at least five small refuges in different parts of london in which he was able to change his personality the mysteries of dr jekyll and mr hyde too could be conducted only through the swirling wreaths of london fog where character and identity may suddenly and dramatically be obscured if crime and detection rely upon disguise so london punishment had its own theatre of judgement and of pain the old bailey itself was designed as a dramatic spectacle and was indeed compared with a giant punch and judy show where the judges sat within the open portico of a sessions house which resembled a theatrical backdrop yet since punch who in the end manages to hang the hangman jack ketch is the epitome of disorder it is likely that his spirit would also be found in noisome circumstances the cellar floor of the fleet prison was known as bartholomew fair while in the chapel of newgate there were galleries where spectators were invited to watch the antics of those condemned to die who deliberately entertained their audience with acts of outrageousness or defiance we read for example of one john riggleton who made a practice of sneaking up to the ordinary prison clergyman when his eyes were fast shut in prayer and shouting out loud in his ear this of course is the role of the pantaloon in pantomime the theatre did not end in the prison chapel but continued upon the little stage where the execution took place the upturned faces of the eager spectators wrote one contributor to the chronicles of newgate resembled those of the gods at drury lane on boxing night another witness remarked upon the fact that just before the execution there was a roar of hats off and down in front as at a theatre there was one peculiarly theatrical episode at the execution in of thistlewood and his cato street companions for treason according to the traditional sentence they were to be hanged and then beheaded when the executioner had come to the last of the heads he lifted it up but by some clumsiness allowed it to drop at this the crowd yelled out ah butterfingers this small episode manifests the peculiar temperament of the london crowd combining humour and savagery in equal measure the witnesses at executions were not the only inhabitants of london to appreciate the virtues of urban theatre inigo joness construction of the banqueting house in was in the words of john summersons georgian london really an extension of his stage work the same might be said of his other great urban projects in a similar spirit two hundred years later john nash disguised a concerted effort at town planning dividing the poor of the east from the wealthy of the west by creating streets and squares which represented the principles of picturesque beauty by means of scenic effects george moore commented that the circular line of regent street was very much like that of an amphitheatre and it has been noted that the time of nashs improvements was also the period of the great panoramas and dioramas of london buckingham palace as viewed from the end of the mall seems nothing more than an elaborate stageset while the house of commons is an exercise in wistful neogothic not unlike the elaborate dramas to be seen in the patent theatres of the period the latest pevsner guide notes that the clearing banks of the city of london were built to impress inside and out while much of the architecture of the s took the expressive potential of concrete to a theatrical extreme that central spirit of london has been divined by artists as well as architects in the work of hogarth the streets are delineated in terms of scenic perspective in many of his prints perhaps most notably in his delineation of the fair the division between performers and spectators is for all practical purposes invisible the citizens fulfil their roles with even more animation than the stage actors and there are more genuinely dramatic episodes among the crowd than upon the boards some of the more famous portraits of london also borrow their effects from the theatre of the period it has been remarked for example how edward pennys painting of a city shower is taken from a scene from david garricks the suspicious husband one of the greatest painters of midnineteenthcentury cityscapes john oconnor was also an accomplished painter of theatrical scenery the editors of the most comprehensive volume upon the subject london in paint go so far as to suggest that further research will be carried out into this vital link between the two professions of urban painter and theatrical designer they may not be two professions however but one it would seem that everyone in london wore a costume from the earliest period the city records reveal the vivid displays of rank and hierarchy noting garments of coloured stripes and gowns of rainbow hues when the dignitaries of the city attended the first day of bartholomew fair for example they were expected to wear violet gowns lined but the emphasis on colour and effect was shared by all manner of london citizens in fact in such a crowded city people could be recognised only by their costume the butcher by his bluesleeves and woollen apron or the prostitute by hood scarf and topknot that is why at the fair when costumes change all social hierarchy is undermined a shopkeeper of the mideighteenth century would advertise the traditional worth of his wares with his hair fullpowdered his silver knee and shoe buckles and his hands surrounded with the nicelyplaited ruffle in the early twentieth century it was noted that the bank messengers and fishboys waiters and city policemen still wore midvictorian costume as if to display their antique deference or respectability in any one period of londons history in fact it is possible to detect the presence of several decades in the dress and deportment of those in the streets yet disguise can also be a form of deception one notorious highwayman escaped newgate dressed up as an oystergirl while a character in humphry clinker matthew bramble noticed how mere journeymen in london went around disguised like their betters in turn boswell delighted in low impersonation dressing up and taking on the role of a blackguard or soldier in order to pick up prostitutes and generally to entertain himself in the streets and taverns of the city boswell was entranced by london precisely because it allowed him to assume a number of disguises and thus escape from his own identity there was as matthew bramble had written no distinction or subordination left which accounts precisely for the combination of egalitarianism and theatricality that is so characteristic of london london is truly the home of the spectacle whether of the living or of the dead when in the cadaver of henry vii was carried along cheapside a wax effigy of his royal person dressed in the robes of state was placed upon the hearse the wagon was surrounded by priests and bishops weeping while the kings household of six hundred persons followed in procession with lighted candles it was the kind of funeral parade at which london has always excelled the funeral of the duke of wellington in was no less ornate and sumptuous and a contemporary account describes the event in highly theatrical termsthe effect is novel and striking with the mass of shade relieved by colour particularly that of a grenadier guardsman his scarlet uniform strongly contrasting with the sable decorations around him on the arrival of foreign monarchs or upon the birth of princes or after news of success in wars the city decked itself out in colourful pageants when catherine of aragon entered london in she was greeted by painted wooden castles built upon stone foundations columns and statues fountains and artificial mountains mechanical zodiacs and battlements it is impossible to overestimate the thirst for spectacle among londoners through many centuries when henry v returned from agincourt in he saw two gigantic figures placed upon the entrance to london bridge on the bridge itself were innumerable boys representing the angelic host arrayed in white with glittering wings and their hair set with sprigs of laurel the conduit on cornhill was covered by a pavilion of crimson cloth and on the kings approach a great quantity of sparrows and other small birds were set free at the conduit in cheapside there were virgins dressed entirely in white who from cups in their hands blew forth golden leaves on the king an image of the sun which glittered above all things was placed upon a throne and round it were angels singing and playing all kinds of musical instruments in succeeding reigns the conduits of cornhill and cheapside were arrayed with trees and caves artificial hills and elaborate streams of wine or milk the streets themselves were draped with tapestries and cloth of gold as agnes strickland an early biographer of elizabeth i remarked upon these manifestations the city of london might at that time have been termed a stage a german traveller similarly observed that at the coronation of george iv the king was obliged to present himself as chief actor in a pantomime while the royal costume reminded me strikingly of one of those historical plays which are here got up so well there is another kind of drama which seems close to the life of the city the streets provided a permanent arena for example in which any patterer or chanting trader could attract an inquisitive audience the stages of sixteenthcentury theatres were built to face the south so that more light might fall upon the players but we may imagine the actions and deportment of less professional actors to be similarly lit upon the crowded thoroughfares of london historical scenes were dramatised by street performers there are extant photographs of actors in nineteenthcentury street theatre they seem poor and perhaps grimy but they wear spangling tights and elaborate costumes against garishly painted backdrops in the early twentieth century too scenes from the novels of dickens were played out on open carts on the very sites where those scenes were set dickens may have appreciated such a gesture since he turned london itself into a vast symbolic theatre much of his dramatic imagination was formed by visiting the playhouses which abounded in his youth particularly the penny gaffs and the small theatrical houses around the drury lane theatre in one of them he saw a pantomime and noticed that the people who kept the shops and who represented the passengers in the thoroughfares and so forth had no conventionality in them but were unusually like the real thing he is adverting to the fact that ordinary londoners mainly of the younger generation paid to be allowed to act in that seasons latest urban drama or pantomime in vanity fair his contemporary thackeray noted two london boys as having a taste for painting theatrical characters in a similar spirit almost every street of london was once the object of dramatic curiosity from a chaste maid of cheapside to the cripple of fenchurch street from the boss of billingsgate to the lovers of ludgate from the devil of dowgate to the black boy of newgate the audience found in them what they also found in bartholomew fair a theatre which reflected the nature of their lives as well as the nature of the city itself these plays were generally violent and melodramatic in theme but that is precisely why they offered a true image of teeming city life london life itself could in turn become street theatre even if it were sometimes of a tragic and inadvertent kind the poor and the outcast in particular can claim no privacy and as gissing noted in his novel the nether world their scenes alike of tenderness and of anger must for the more part be enacted on peopled ways where their shouts and muttered words could plainly be heard chapter he shuld neuer trobell the parish no more out you rogue you hedgebird you pimp doest so snotty nose good lord are you snivelling you were engendered on a shebeggar in a barn these lines from bartholomew fair evoke something of the flavour of london speech even if they do not catch its particular accent and intonation london speech has been variously described both as harsh and as soft but the predominant characteristic is that of slackness w matthews author of cockneys past and present suggests that cockneys avoid movement of the lips and jaw as far as possible m macbride author of londons dialect makes the same point after examining microsegments and terminal contour peaks nuclei and junctures by declaring that the cockneys avoid as far as possible any unnecessary movements of the articulating organs in other words they are lazy speakers one more obvious point might also be made if the cockney voice is indeed harsh it is perhaps because cockneys have always inhabited a harsh and noisy city where the need to be heard above the roar of unresting london is paramount there are many famous examples of what became known as cockney a piper rather than a paper eye o pen rather than high holborn wot not what there are also very familiar constructionsso i goes and he goes is now more common than so i says and he says but the immediacy is still there innit or ennit are now more favoured than aint it and memorable phrases such as e didnt alf it er e did or you aint seen nuffin or nuffink can still be heard in certain regions of the east end other cockneyisms however have not survived the middle decades of the twentieth century for why is uncommon as is summut even blimey is fading out of discourse certain cockneyismsfamiliar perhaps from the novels of dickensare now of distant vintage wery instead of very wulgar rather than vulgar are quite out of use although the device was always more popular in fiction than upon the streets the same might be said of hexcuse rather than excuse in the early decades of the twentieth century you might hear a stallkeeper shouting out plees to reckleck please recollect that at this ere stall you gets but no longer it would once have been possible to hear the following sentence from a cockney waiterthere are a leg of mutton and there is chopsbut that particular construction appears to have gone out of favour some words have simply shifted allegiance in the midnineteenth century cockneys would tend to employ ax rather than ask but that ellipsis is now in use predominantly among black londoners one construction is still current paralysed like or fresh likeeven though it has been part of the london tongue for at least two centuries a more substantial point can be made in this context too since there is clear evidence that cockney english has not changed in its essentials for over five hundred years its history is significant therefore if only to demonstrate once more the essential continuities of london life cockney has always represented an oral rather than a written culture sustained by an unbroken succession of native speakers but for many centuries there was no standard london speech the legacy of the old english tongue left a variety of identifiable dialects among the citizens of early medieval london we can trace southeastern speech southwestern speech and east midland speech west saxon was the language of westminster because of the historical connection between the reigning sovereigns household and winchester while the predominant language of the city itself was east saxon hence the connections throughout the centuries between the london dialect and the essex dialect strate in london was strete at westminster there was no standard or uniform pronunciation in other words it would have differed even from parish to parish there were other forms of speech too which rendered the language of the city more heterogeneous and polyglot one linguistic survey of the registers of london english from the last decade of the thirteenth century to the beginning of the fifteenth reveals a vast range of sources and borrowings in the previously unstudied archives of london bridge generally dealing with the employment of thames fishermen there are elements of old english anglonorman and medieval latin as well as middle dutch and middle low german this might be considered merely the work of educated clerks transcribing the rough tongue into a more polished and formal style but in fact all the evidence suggests that there was a truly mixed or macaronic style caused by the interaction between different registers of london english the author of sources of london english laura wright has also pointed out that londoners who used french and latin habitually in their work would in all probability retain the terminology of these languages even when discussing or thinking about their work in english we do not need to imagine thames fishermen however speaking classical latin their latin would have been some form of argot or patois which included terms inherited from the time of the romans the addition of french is predictable enough after the conquest when all these tongues became part of the fabric of living speech there were however broad patterns of change during the fourteenth century the dominant east saxon voice of london was displaced by that from the central and east midlands there is no single reason for this shift although it is likely that over several generations the more wealthy or educated merchant families had emigrated from that region into the city there was in the same period another essential linguistic change when this different and apparently more educated language inaugurated a slow process of standardisation by the end of the fourteenth century there had emerged a single dialect known as london english which in turn became what the editor of the cambridge history of the english language calls modern literary standard english writing standards were progressively set by the scribes of chancery too with their emphasis upon correctness uniformity and propriety so the east and central midland dialect became the language spoken by educated londoners and increasingly the language of the english generally what happened then to the east saxon dialect which had previously been the native tongue of the native londoner to a certain extent it was displaced but more importantly it was demoted one of the central prejudices against its use lay in the fact that it had always been spoken and rarely if ever written down thus these vocal cries were filled with incongruities and barbarism by the sixteenth century this difference between standard and what had become cockney english was well enough understood to be the subject of critical attention but the salient fact was its survival the vestry records of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries show that cockney was not only well established but already exhibited certain permanent features thus the abbot of westmynster and the monks reprevyed mr phipp who was chosen constable in which complaint he made appear his imbecility yt was erecktyde by most voysses without the least predyges of the paryshe he wold nott church a woman owtsept she wold com at vi in the

necklygence of our pyssheners in diaries of the sixteenth century particularly that of henry machyn there are phonetic spellings that catch the very accent and intonation of these early cockneys

lightning when on of servand was so freyd that ys here stod up and yt wyll never come down synes a diligent investigator has also found many devices used by cockneys of the sixteenth and seventeenth

rile instead of rail suthe instead of south hoathe instead of oath orfunt instead of orphan cloues instead of clothes sawgars instead of soldiers notamy instead of anatomy vill instead of will usse instead of house im instead of him certain key words and phrases have also survived the centuries among them savd is bacon bouze drink poppet girl elbowgrease energy paw hand swop exchange and tick credit the central point is clear the cockney speech of the twentyfirst century is in many respects identical to that of the sixteenth century as an oral tradition it has never died cockney of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was also reproduced on stage as well as in written reports but at this early date it was parodied rather than mocked mistress quickly the garrulous hostess of the boars head in east cheap in the second part of shakespeares henry iv might stand as an emblem for the more strident cockney females i was before master tisick the debuty tother day and as he said to

name it might be the voice of mrs gamp almost three centuries later shakespeare must have heard these elisions repetitions and asides whenever he walked through the streets of the city fielding was another wonderful observer of london life in the first decades of the eighteenth century he heard the voices too and reproduced them with great precision it would be the hiest preasumption to imagine you eggnorant of my loave no madam i sollemly purtest writes jonathan wild to an assumed admirer i have not slept a wink since i had the hapness of seing you last therefore hop you will out of kumpassion it is the same accent identified by smollett at a slightly later date coind sur heaving the playsure of meating with you at the ospital of anvilheads invalids i take this lubbertea of latin you know there is more than humour here there is also a sense of farce and singularity which in no way condemns the cockney speakers for their mannerisms in the same spirit the dramatic vitality and sympathy to be found in shakespeare emerge in these other urban writers smollett practised for a while as a surgeon in downing street and fielding as a judge in bow street they knew all the voices their connection with london speech also throws a suggestive light upon the observations of karl friedrich schinkel writing in his journal of that for a man of letters who endeavours to cultivate however modestly the medium of shakespeare and milton london must ever have a great illustrative and suggestive value and indeed a kind of sanctity writers of a later generation were more concerned with polite taste and the maintenance of good english as the medium of enlightenment in that context the cockney accent becomes absurd and deplorable so in dramas of the mideighteenth century it is lampooned i have heard good sir that every body has a more betterer and more worserer side of the face than the other it is the onliest way to rise in the world all them kind of things soon enough there were treatises and educational manuals which condemned the vulgarity and incorrectness of cockney speech their prejudice was strengthened with the proliferation of board schools and religious schools where in the context of national education the cockney speaker was considered uneducated and illiterate since london english had become the standard of proper english so in turn the native dialect of london was all the more strongly condemned it became the mark of error and vulgarity the figure of the cockney however never disappeared the term itself has been considered one of derision cockney is generally supposed to derive from the medieval term cokenay or cocks egg in other words an unnatural object or freak of nature there is another equally derisory explanation a londoner on his first visit to the country is supposed innocently to have asked does a cock neigh too but there is also the possibility of more agreeable origins one historian has suggested that it comes from the latin term coquina or cookery and derives from the time when london was considered the great centre of cookshops it may also come from the celtic myth of london as cockaigne a place of milk and honey of whom the cockneys are the true inhabitants yet even this origin has been held against them by the fifteenth century the term was synonymous with a milksop an effeminate fellow and in the sixteenth century was a derisive appellation for a townsman as a type of effeminacy in contrast to the hardier inhabitants of the country sometimes he or she seems to be an image of pity then as in dickenss reproduction of the crossingsweepers conversationa sovring as waw give me by a lady in a wale as sed she was a servant and as come to my crossin one night as asked to be showd this ere ouse but there are many cockney characters in dickens who retain their exuberance and vitality there is ikey in a passage in the life of mr watkins tottle from sketches by boz who has the very model of a cockney manner he seed her several times and then he up and said hed keep company with her the young ladys father he behaved even worser and more unnatural so then he turns round to me and says and wasnt he a trembling neither dickens was a master of the spoken word and throughout his fiction he evinces his command of the london dialect it might even be said that the nineteenth century was the one in which cockneys and cockneyisms really flourished they were no longer the city merchants or innkeepers of the seventeenthcentury drama or the aspiring if vulgar neighbours of the eighteenthcentury novel they were considered to be members of a distinctive and extensive group the rise of rhyming slang for example can be dated to the first decades of the nineteenth century when there emerged phrases such as apples and pears for stairs and trouble and strife for wife backslang or the reversal of words also appeared at this time thus is yob for example slang for boy in the same century too the cockney fully emerged as an identifiable if not always lovable character writers including pierce egan henry mayhew and gah salawhose careers span the entire centurycopied a recognisable idiom in such phrases as shes a bloody rum customer when she gets lushy or they doesnt care nothink for nobody or she tippd him a volloper right across the snout the literature of cockney in the nineteenth century is for all practical purposes endless but it found one specific focus in the language of the music hall performers such as albert chevalier dan leno marie lloyd and gus elan gave cockney idiom artistic form and direction it allowed the genuine outflow of communal feeling with songs such as my shadow is my only friend and i wonder what it feels like to be poor they are the true songs of london the routines of the halls encouraged much elaboration and ingenuity also so that it can fairly be said that the standard of cockney was set by the s certainly this was the period that witnessed the emergence of what may still be called modern cockney its most fastidious exponent was perhaps bernard shaws eliza doolittle theres menners fyer teoo banches o voylet trod into the mad ow eez yeeooa san is e the last sentenceoh hes your son is he is indicative of shaws skill at phonetic reproduction but it is not always easy upon the ear or eye other examples of twentiethcentury cockney may be

general terms construction and intonation have remained the same a speaker from the she did not say nothing so he come in and just as he come in right in the corner it was of course they was cursing soany wayi give one look i seen them them daysdoes not differ radically from any cockney speaker of the early twentyfirst century one proviso ought to be entered however there are still speakers of modern or standard cockney but among younger londoners it has become milder or at least more subdued this may be the result of better formal education but is perhaps more closely related to the general diminution of local or native dialects as a result of mass media communications yet it is still a remarkable record of continuity native london speech has survived all the incursions of intellectual fashion educational practice or social disapproval and has managed to retain its vitality after many centuries of growth its success reflects and indeed may even be said to embody the success of the city itself cockney grew like london by assimilation it borrowed other forms of speech and made them its own it has taken words from dutch and spanish arabic and italian french and german it has borrowed the cant of thieves and the argot of prison since the city itself has on many occasions been described as a prison it is fitting that the language of the cockney should in part be the language of the convict from nark to copper given the general and persistent violence of london life also it is not altogether surprising that the london dialect has taken many words and phrases from the boxing ring including kisser conk scrap and hammer other terms have come from the army and navy where cockneys served and in recent decades americanisms have also been assimilated thus the language thrives cockney has other characteristics which also serve to define the life of the city it benefits from an extraordinary theatricality it is filled with a magniloquence and intensity not unconnected to braggadocio in machyns diaries of the sixteenth century we encounter the same bravura which with some modifications can still be heard on the streets of london the goodlyest scollers as ever you saw the greth pykkepus as ever was ther was syche a cry and showtt as has not byne this is also related to the cockney tendency to mix up or misunderstand apparently impressive words in an effort to convince the hearer a bathroom wall may be covered in condescension or an elderly person may suffer from alkaseltzer disease other observers have noted such phrases as yer a septic collector of internal residue jumbo sale give im a momentum when he retires the list is endless there is a certain cheerfulness and perkiness too which is as much a characteristic of the city as of the language londoners are fond of proverbs and of catchphrases and of very harsh oaths which are a combination of comedy aggression and cynicism their tongue has therefore been described as generally crude and materialistic but with precisely those characteristics it resembles and reflects the city in which it was fashioned slang and catchphrases are as old as the language itself the streets of london have always been filled with slogans and catcalls we can date some as far back as the fifteenth century who put a turd in the boys mouth as bare as a birds arse and god save you from the rain are typical examples of street language there were other expressions which had a specific urban origin a famous performing horse morocco for example when asked by its owner to pick out the biggest fool in the audience chose the comedian and jester richard tarleton whose response god a mercy horse ran through london at the end of the sixteenth century it could be used as a token of any kind of annoyance but it had a comic touch because of its associations oh good sir robert knock became in the seventeenth century a general cry of reproach among londoners at some naughty deed its derivation was the knock of a hammer to stop flagellation in bridewell at the beginning of the nineteenth century too street slang appears and disappears for no particular reason the word quoz was a great favourite for example and was capable of almost any meaning according to charles mackay in his memoirs of extraordinary popular delusions it was a mark of incredulity or hilarity or condescension when a mischievous urchin wished to annoy a passenger and create mirth for his chums he looked him in the face and cried out quoz every alehouse resounded with quoz every street corner was noisy with it and every wall for miles around was chalked with it it was followed by another favourite phrase of street life what a shocking bad hat which was directed at almost anyone of distinctive appearance this in turn was followed by the single word walker which was designed to cause maximum offence and was uttered with a peculiar drawl upon the first syllable and a sharp turn upon the last it was used by young women to deter an admirer by young boys mocking a drunk or to anyone impeding the way it lasted three or four months only and was replaced by another piece of london slang which lasted an equally short period there he goes with his eye out this was rivalled in its unfathomability by another popular phrase has your mother sold her mangle which became a customary term of abuse among the cockney population brevity and incomprehensibility are the two marks of popular favour in the s another phrase flare up became literally the talk of the town it answered all questions and settled all disputes charles mackay wrote and suddenly became the most comprehensive phrase in the english language a man who had spoken out of turn or who had drunk too much or had been involved in a quarrel had consequently flared up its popularity lasted again for a short time to be followed by does your mother know youre out addressed to anyone who looked a little too pompous or selfsatisfiedas in the retort by the cab driver to the peer who resisted the attempt to be charged double there are other examples of this continual invention of new words or phrases which seem mysteriously to resound in the streets of london immediately after they have been coined bywho knows whom it is almost as if they were invented by the city itself and sent echoing down the alleys and thoroughfares in the litany of london generations i can come it slap would you be surprised to hear go it immensikoff its naughty but its nice whatcher me old brown son chase me whoa emma have a banana twiggeyvoo archibald certainly not theres a lot of it about it hes a splendid performer i dont think can i do you now sir its being so cheerful as keeps me going see you later alligator shut that door the most recent examples come respectively from music hall radio and televisiontelevision together with cinema and popular music now being the most fruitful source of street slang the tradition continues principally because it is an aspect of cockney humour once known as chaff we hear in the eighteenth century of londoners being sent into convulsions of laughter by prints of a couple yawning after sexual intercourse the humour could also be of a more personal kind steele in the spectator of august tells the story of an eighteenthcentury gentleman who was approached by a beggar and politely asked for sixpence so that he might visit a tavern he urged with a melancholy face that all his family had died of thirst all the mob have humour and two or three began to take the jest the humour of the mob here consists in the beggar implicitly mocking the gentleman a form of burlesque which is the most common form of cockney humour chimneysweeps were dressed up as clergymen shoeblacks with their footstools on their heads were driven around the ring of hyde park at the precise moment when the fashionable were about to parade they were levelling distinctions and parodying wealth or rank william hazlitt divined in the plain speaker of that your true cockney is your only true leveller he concluded that everything is vulgarised in his mind nothing dwells long enough on it to produce an interest nothing is contemplated sufficiently at a distance to excite curiosity or wonder he has no respect for himself and still less if possible for you he cares little about his own advantage if he can only make a jest out of yours every feeling comes to him through a medium of levity and impertinence this may represent too jaundiced an attitude however since the levelling humour is also related to the spirit of fair play which was said to be prevalent among the london crowd one of the great cockney expressions was fair plays a jewel in this spirit the street urchins of the nineteenth century might innocently ask a gentleman is the missus quite well swift remembered a child declaring go and teach your grandmother to suck eggs when street scavengers were confronted by the new streetsweeping machines a brisk interchange of street wit took place the populace often enough encouraging both sides in similar fashion street fights however spontaneous took place according to rules well known to the london crowd the same equalising spirit of london burlesque may also lie behind the permanent affection for crossdressing among cockneys theatrical transvestism has been prominent in london entertainments for centuriesfrom mrs noah of the medieval pageants to the latest act in a london drag club when in the actor bannister played the character of polly peachum in the beggars operaitself a great emblem of londonone member of the audience was thrown into hysterics which continued without intermission until friday morning when she expired chapter theatrical city evidence for a roman theatre southwest of st pauls is now very clear it was located little more than feet east of the mermaid theatre which is situated by puddle dock further evidence can be found for a theatre at whitechapel in it was just beyond aldgate with a stage some five feet high and a series of galleries this was in turn followed by the erection of the theatre in the fields of shoreditch it was constructed of wood and thatch well enough designed to merit the description of this gorgeous playingplace erected in the fields marlowes doctor faustus and shakespeares hamlet were performed here certainly it must have proved popular because a year later another theatre was built two hundred yards away it was known as the curtain or latterly the green curtain in deference to the colourful sign painted on its exterior theatres like taverns and shops were well illustrated to catch the attention of the citizens these two early theatres set the standard for those more famous playhouses which play so large a part in elizabethan cultural history these playhouses were always outside the walls of the city unlike the private theatre of blackfriars and the two theatres in the northern fields were constructed upon land once belonging to holywell priory as the name suggests there was a holy well in the immediate vicinity it may be that they were deliberately sited close to the location where sacred plays had once been staged this might also account for the presence of a theatre in the old priory of the blackfriars londoners have always been aware of the topography of their city and its environs so that on many occasions and in many contexts the same activity can be observed taking place in the same location the situation of the twelfthcentury theatrum is not known but it is at least reasonable to suggest that it lay where the rose the swan and the globe eventually emerged in the s and s there has been speculation about the origins of early theatre architecture and some have supposed that it was established upon the pattern of the yards of galleried inns where itinerant groups of minstrels or actors would perform they were known as innplayhouses there were two in gracechurch street the bell and the cross keys while another stood on ludgate hill the latter was known as the belle sauvage or the bell savage and like the others soon acquired a distinctly unsavoury reputation in an edict from the privy council commanded the officers of london to thrust out the players from the city and to pull down the playing and dicing houses within the liberties where the presence of actors encouraged immorality gambling intemperance apprentices and factions the theatre then may provoke that unrest which seems always to have been present beneath the surface of the citys life it also provided occasion for the spread of those terrors of london fire and disease other theatrical historians have concluded that the true model of the elizabethan theatre was not the innyard but the bearbaiting ring or the cockpit certainly these activities were not incompatible with serious drama some theatres became bearrings or boxing rings while some cockpits and bullrings became theatres there was no necessary distinction between these activities and historians have suggested that acrobats fencers and ropedancers could also perform at the globe or the swan edward alleyn the great actormanager of the early seventeenth century was also master of the kings bears the public arena was truly heterogeneous the popularity of elizabethan drama characterises londoners who attended it both in their affection for colourful ritual and in their admiration of magniloquence the taste of the crowd for intermittent violence was amply satisfied by the plays themselves while the londoners natural pride in the history of their city was recognised in those dramatic historical pageants which were part of the diet of the playhouses when shakespeare places falstaff and his company in east cheap he is invoking the life of the city which existed two centuries before spectacle and violence civic pride and national honour all found their natural home in the theatres of london there were of course familiar complaints when burbage attempted to reopen the theatre of blackfriars in the noblemen and gentlemen who lodged in the old monastery buildings complained about the vagrant and lewd persons who would congregate there they also declared that the noise of the drums and trumpets would hinder church services in the vicinity when the blackfriars was eventually reopened visitors attending plays by shakespeare or by chapman were obliged to leave their coaches by the west end of st pauls or by the fleet conduit and proceed the rest of the way on foot this was designed to prevent further tumult the fortune theatre in golding lane now golden lane was famous for its inflamations with squibs thunder artificial lightning the costs were a penny for standing room only twopence for a chair and threepence for the most comfortable seats which are cushioned during the performance according to thomas platters travels in england food and drink are carried around the audience during the puritan commonwealth the theatres were closed it was said that the people had seen enough public tragedy and no longer required any dramatic version instead theatrical entertainments were performed clandestinely or under cover of some other activity the red bull playhouse in clerkenwellonly a few hundred yards to the north of smithfieldremained open for ropeacts and the like but also managed to make room for drolleries and pieces of plays so great was the appetite for these spectacles among ordinary londoners that one contemporary wrote i have seen the red bull playhouse which was a large one so full that as many went back for want of room as had entered there were continual complaints about plays and actors even after various inhibitory proclamations of and so we may assume that the more spirited londoners continued to find at least pieces of drama it might be thought then that the citizens would agree with one of their number samuel pepys who declared after the restoration that the theatre was a thousand times better and more glorious than ever before he was referring to the newly licensed theatres of dorset gardens and drury lane but the new theatres were nothing like the old as pepys went on to remark now all things civil no rudeness anywhere the drama had been refined in other words in order that it would appeal to the king the court and those londoners who shared the same values just as the cockney dialect was now being denigrated so the popular theatre of previous decades was dissolved and yet the more cockney londoners did also manage to attend the new plays they were not necessarily welcomed in the boxes or the pit with the more prosperous citizens but they took over the gallery from where they could shout insults or pelt fruit upon both stage and respectable audience cockney theatregoers were only one aspect however of the generally partisan and inflammatory aspect of the urban audience claques would attend in order to cry up or drown out the latest production fights would break out among the gentlemen of quality while there were often riots which effectively concluded all theatrical proceedings indeed the riots themselves were somewhat theatrical in appearance when in the mideighteenth century david garrick proposed to abolish halfprice seats for those who entered after the third of five acts the whole performance beginning at six oclock in the evening the day appointed for that innovation found the drury lane playhouse filled with a silent crowd pj grosley composed a tour of london in and set the scene as soon as the play commenced there was a general outcry with fistycuffs and cudgels which led to further violence when the audience tore up the benches of the pit and galleries and demolished the boxes the lion which had decorated the kings box was thrown upon the stage among the actors and the unicorn fell into the orchestra where it broke the great harpsichord to pieces in his london journal of january boswell remarks that we sallied into the house planted ourselves in the middle of the pit and with oaken cudgels in our hands and shrillsounding cat calls in our pockets sat ready prepared such behaviour in the capitals theatres continued well into the nineteenth century a german traveller of prince pückler muskau later caricatured by charles dickens as count smorltork in the pickwick papers reported that the most striking thing to a foreigner in english theatres is the unheardof coarseness and brutality of the audiences the old price riots of lasted for seventy nights and the private life of edmund keanaccused of being both a drunk and an adultererled to four nights of violent rioting in the playhouse of drury lane what was termed party spirit did on more than one occasion prompt fights both among the spectators and the players the presence of foreigners upon the stage was another cause of uproar when the theatre historique arrived at drury lane from paris there was a general rush for the stage mobs surrounded the theatre royal in the haymarket in when a comedy entitled the tailors caused offence among the fraternity professional boxers were brought into the auditorium by rival groups as early as in order to slug it out this was city drama in every sense and yet in the city itself the real drama was still performed upon the streets chapter violent delights as long as the city has existed there have been entertainers and entertainments from the street ventriloquists who cast their voices into their hands to the man with the telescope who for twopence would allow you to look at the heavens on a summers night performers balanced on the weathercock of st pauls steeple there were midnight dogshows and duels of rats there were street jugglers and street conjurors complete with pipes and drum there were performing bears and performing monkeys dragged through the streets of london upon long ropes in the late eighteenth century a pedlar exhibited a hare dancing upon a tambourine while another entertainer displayed a curious mask of bees on his head and face in the early nineteenth century a crowd gathered around a booth labelled fantasina while children examined a kelidascope on tower hill there was set up an ingenious contrivance of many mechanical figures with the legend please to encourage the inventor while in parliament street a donkey pulled along a peepshow entitled the battle of waterloo there are now amusement arcades where there were once the windows of printshops and instead of the london zoo there was once a menagerie in exeter change along the strand where the roaring of the beasts reverberated down the thoroughfare and frightened the horses there have always been wonders and curiosities john stow recorded the minute skills of a blacksmith who exhibited a padlock key and chain which could be fastened around the neck of a performing flea john evelyn reported seeing the hairy woman whose eyebrows covered her forehead as well as a dutch boy who displayed the words deus meus and elohim on each iris in the reign of george ii it was announced that from eight in the morning till nine at night at the end of the great booth on blackheath a west of england woman years of age alive with two heads one above the other she has had the honour to be seen by sir hans sloane and several of the royal society gentlemen and ladies may see her at their own houses as they please the advertisement has been taken from a pamphlet entitled merrie england in the olden time so the unfortunate creature was taken to the london houses of the rich to be inspected at closer hand in the early nineteenth century siamese twins were often exhibited although such monstrous couplings had already been shown under other names in other centuries and in the same period was displayed the anatomic vivante or living skeleton who at the height of five feet seven and a half inches weighed less than six stone at another london exhibition the heaviest man that ever lived weighing eightyseven stone also entertained the curious public as trinculo says upon first confronting caliban on that enchanted island strangely recalling london when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead indian fleet street was once the home of london marvels other than those of newspaper stories the playwright ben jonson noticed a new motion of the city of nineveh with jonah and the whale at fleet bridge in the fleet street mandrakes were on show for a penny a fourteenyearold boy only eighteen inches high was to be seen in at a grocers shop called the eagle and child by shoe lane a lincolnshire ox nineteen hands high and four yards long could be viewed at the white horse nearby there was the usual diet of giants and dwarfs anything out of its due size and proportion was welcome in disproportiond london there was also much interest excited by automata and other mechanical devices as if they somehow imitated the motions of the city itself it is curious to learn from the daily advertiser of that at the mitre tavern there was exhibited a most curious chaise that travels without horses this beautiful convenient machine is so simply contrivd and easily managd as to travel upwards of forty miles a day in fleet street too were the waxworks they were first exhibited by mrs salmon the direct predecessor of madame tussaud at the sign of the golden salmon near aldersgate as the spectator pointed out on april it would have been ridiculous for the ingenious mrs salmon to have lived at the sign of the trout but she removed to fleet street where her collection of figures was the object of public admiration on the ground floor of her establishment was a toyshop selling punch dolls and cricket bats and chessboards while on the two upper floors stood replicas of john wilkes samuel johnson mrs siddons and other london notables the sign emblazoned across the housefront read simply enough the wax work outside was the pale yellow wax image of mother shipton who on the release of a lever would kick the unsuspecting pedestrian these figures mobile or immobile also served an apparently more serious purpose for many centuries the wax effigies of dead monarchs and statesmen coloured and made up were exhibited in westminster abbey where once the effigy of the dead elizabeth i carried in procession at her funeral elicited general sighing groaning and weeping its decrepit condition in the mideighteenth century made her seem half witch and half ghoul yet the phrase man of wax was still in general circulation it had no disagreeable connotations then but rather meant a personage who one day might be granted the honour of display in the abbey mrs salmon herself has long since sunk from view but the waxworks of madame tussaud survive in glory curiously enough waxworkers have always been women and madame tussaud herself can be credited with the invention of what punch dubbed the chamber of horrors the present establishment lies by the equally spectacular planetarium mayfair is named after the annual fair which took place on the north side of piccadilly now only the prostitutes of shepherds market bring an echo of its past but haymarket has retained its old associations since the eighteenth century it has been a street of entertainment from the cats opera of to the phantom of the opera of the last decade of the twentieth century in samuel foote a famous actor and mimic gave a series of comic lectures at the haymarket theatre in the theatre built upon the same site in the comic actor john sessions gave a very similar performance the persistent energy of the city has its own momentum which defies rational explication it is a city always known for its vivacity and its restlessness we learn from thomas burkes the streets of london that the citizens progress through the streets is marked by impetuosity and a constant exertion of strength we learn further from pierre jean grosleys a tour of london in that the english walk very fast their thoughts being entirely engrossed by business they are very punctual to their appointments and those who happen to be in their way are sure to be sufferers by it constantly darting forward they justle them with a force proportioned to the bulk and velocity of their motion a century later a parisian traveller noted that throughout london there surges a bustling thrusting crowd such as our busiest boulevard gives no idea of the cabs move twice as fast watermen and bus conductors run a whole sentence to a single word the last atom of value is extracted from every action and every minute even the entertainments were energetic and at greenwich the rabble of london assemble on easter monday and roll down its green side men and women promiscuously sexual licence and commercial energy are all mixed to send the citizens whirling forward a twentiethcentury french traveller believed that in london english legs move with greater velocity than ours and this whirl carries even the ancient with it the whirl is part flux and disorder but it is also an aspect of the ceaseless movement of people goods and vehicles tobias smollett in humphry clinker noted only rambling riding rolling rushing justling mixing bouncing cracking and crashing all is tumult and hurry one would imagine they were impelled by some disorder of the brain that will not suffer them to be at rest it does indeed on occasions appear to be a kind of fever maurice ash the author of a guide to the structure of london in when confronted with the continuous hurrying to and fro was tempted to conclude that there is no real business other than the business of traffic itself the city in other words represents movement for its own sake it is reminiscent of the scene of shooting the bridge out of george borrows lavengro when a london boatman fearlessly navigated the rush of water through the middle arch of london bridge elevating one of his sculls in triumph the man hallooing and the woman waving her shawl it is a picture of the intense vitality of london life when southey asked a pastrycook why she kept her shop open in harsh weather she replied that she would lose much custom so many were the persons who took up buns or biscuits as they passed by and threw their pence in not allowing themselves time to enter that pace has hardly slowed in a century and one of the latest social surveys of london focus on london reveals that the economic activity rates for london have consistently been between and percentage points higher than those for the united kingdom as a whole this infinite motion has continued for more than a thousand years fresh and ever renewed it still partakes of antiquity that is why the whirl and business of the streets comprise only an apparent disorder and some observers have noticed a central rhythm or historical momentum which propels the city forward this is the mysteryhow can the endless rush itself be eternal it is the riddle of london which is perpetually new and always old there are days of rest however even in the turbulent city it has often been remarked that sunday is dreariest in london of all cities perhaps because restfulness and silence do not come easily or naturally to it it was not always so londoners have characteristically used their holidays or holy days for violent delights from the early medieval period there have been archery and jousting bowls and footballas well as the hurling of stones and wood and ironbut the taste of the london crowd could also be less healthful there were cockfights and boarfights bullbaiting bearbaiting and dogbaiting the bears were given affectionate names such as harry hunks or sacherson but the treatment of them was vicious one visitor to bankside in the early seventeenth century watched the whipping of a blind bear which is performed by five or six men standing circularly with whips which they exercise upon him without any mercy as he cannot escape from them because of the chain he defends himself with all his force and skill throwing down all who come within his reach and are not active enough to get out of it and tearing the whips out of their hands and breaking them in the late seventeenth century we read of horsebaiting at bankside where several dogs were set upon a great horse it defeated its persecutors but then the mobile mob in the house cryed out it was a cheat and thereupon began to untyle the house and threatened to pull it quite down if the horse were not brought again and baited to death this was the sport of the london crowd bulls were baited with dogs also but they were sometimes maddened by having peas placed in their ears or fireworks stuck on their backs in the eighteenth century there was bullockhunting in bethnal green badgerbaiting in long fields by the tottenham court road and ferocious wrestling matches at hockleyinthehole this area just across the fleet from clerkenwell was one of the most dangerous and unruly in all london where all sorts of rough games were provided the more respectable seventeenthcentury citizens were not necessarily amused by these diversions instead there were healthful walks in a number of carefully planned and plotted public areas by the early seventeenth century moorfields had been drained and laid out creating upper walks and lower walks and a few years later lincolns inn fields were also designed for common walks and disports grays inn walks were highly favoured and hyde park although still a royal park was open to the public for horseracing and boxing st jamess park was designed a little later here in the words of tom brown a contemporary journalist the green walk afforded us varieties of discourses from persons of both sexes disturbed with the noisy milk folkscryinga can of milk ladies a can of red cows milk sir but the true nature of london is not shrubbery or parkland but human nature at night beneath the shade of the trees according to the earl of rochester are buggeries rapes and incests made while rosamonds pond on the southwest side of st jamess park became notorious for suicides in spring gardens were a bowling green and butts for target practice in the new spring gardens later vauxhall gardens there were avenues and covered walks small green refreshment huts sold wine and punch snuff and tobacco sliced ham and quartered chicken while ladies of doubtful morals sauntered among the trees with gold watches dangling from their necks as a token of their trade the apprentices and their girls would visit spa fields in clerkenwell or the grotto gardens in rosoman street where they were encouraged to consume tea or ices or alcohol to the accompaniment of song music and generally low entertainment much of that vigour has now vanished the parks are now characteristically restful places within the noise and uproar of london they attract those who are unhappy or ill at ease the idle and the vagrant sleep more easily beneath the trees together with those who are simply exhausted by the city london parks have often been called the lungs of the city but the sound is that of sleep it being mighty hot and i weary pepys wrote on july lay down upon the grass by the canalle in st jamess park and slept awhile it is a world of weariness which hogarth depicted in an engraving that shows a london dyer and his family return from sadlers wells the landscape behind them is one of sylvan charm but they are returning on the dusty road to the city the plump and pregnant wife is dressed according to city fashion and sports a fan with a classical motif upon it but she is pregnant because she has cuckolded her husband and the man himself looks tired and dejected as he carries an infant in his arms their two other children fight and their dog looks at the canal which takes water from islington into the conduits of london everything denotes heat and enervation as an expedition out of london comes to its inevitable end in more recent days too exhausted and fretful citizens still come back to london from their outings like prisoners returning to gaol chapter music please by the middle of the nineteenth century the pleasure gardens were outmoded and their legacy lay in the concert rooms which sprang up within the city in it was advertised that in the great room of spring gardens the sevenyearold mozart would be seen playing the harpsichord in a perfection it surmounts all imagination but formal musicmaking was not the only music of london londons arias and laments began with the first street trader and have continued ever since it has often been noted that the low culture of the native londoner can revitalise and refashion the forces of traditional culture the spectacle of the infant mozart playing in a music room is complemented by handels remark that hints of his very best songs have several of them been owing to the sounds in his ears of cries in the streets in the city high and low are inextricably mingled we hear the merchants of medieval cheapside singing out in london lickpenny with strabery ripe and cherryes in the ryse here is parys thred finest in the land hot shepes feete makerell ryshes grene the costermonger sold costards which were big apples but in later centuries the coster with his horse and cart cried out soles oh live haddick eeeeeels alive oh mackareel mackmackmackareel so it continued down other streets and other centuries pretty maids pretty pins pretty women buy my great eeels diddle diddle diddle dumplens ho any card matches or savealls buy any wax or wafers old shoes for some brooms buy a rabbit a rabbet buy a fork or fire shovel crab crab crab any crab buy my fat chickens old chairs to mend any kitchen stuff have you maids pair for a shilling holland socks buy my ropes of hard onyons any work for john cooper new river water volumes have been written about these london cries and we also have images of the tradespeople who uttered them this identification was another way of deciphering the chaos of the city and of creating out of the poor or lower order a gallery of characters the seller of cod for example wears an old apron while the vendor of shoes sports a cape the seller of dried hake carries the basket of that commodity upon her head but the vendor of oranges and lemons carries her bounty at her waist the irish were known to sell rabbits and milk the jews old clothes and hareskins the italians lookingglasses and pictures the old woman selling fireshovels dresses herself in an oldfashioned coneshaped hat as a representation of the wintry months countrywomen entering the metropolis to sell their wares characteristically wore red cloaks and straw hats while the countrymen wove flowers in their hair those who sold fish were generally the poorest while women selling clothes were the most smartly dressed yet the clothing of most street vendors bears the unmistakable mark of destitution with worn and tattered dresses or coats many of these tradespeople were crippled or deformed and as the editor of marcellus laroons the cryes of the city of london drawne after the life sean shesgreen has noted if they give one impression more than any other it is a careworn melancholy laroons portraits are distinctly individual unlike types or categories and in his art we can see the lineaments of specific fate and circumstance the distinctive features he depicted in the s remain the silent token of many generations who have walked crying through the streets of the city even as the poor trader diedor left some scanty stock to anotherhis or her cry was taken up like an echo it was certainly true that as addison wrote in people know the wares they deal in rather by their tunes than by their words the words were often indistinct or indistinguishable the mender of old chairs was recognised by his low and melancholy note while the retailer of broken glass specialised in a sort of plaintive shriek quite appropriate to his goods but even the music itself might become confused and confusing the vendor of shrimps could adopt the same tune as the vendor of watercress and potatoes were sold with the same cry as that of cherries there was also in the passage of years or centuries the steady clipping or abbreviation of jargon will you buy any milk today mistress became milk maids below then milk below then milko and finally mieu or meeo old clothes became ogh clo or owld clo salted hake became poor jake or poor jack then poor john became the recognisable phrase for the vendors of dried cod the chimneysweeps cry became weep or eep and pierce egan author of life in london recalled one man from whom i could never make out more than happy happy happy now as london grew larger and noisier the cries became louderperhaps even more desperate and more hysterical from a distance of half a mile they were a low steady and continuous roar much like a fall of water they became a niagara of voices but in the middle of the city they were a great turmoil of notes london to foreign observers was a distracted city and samuel johnson noted that the attention of a newcomer is generally first struck by the multiplicity of the cries that stun him in the street stun stunner stunningit is a true london word as the print salesman said of his wares placed in an upturned umbrellaitll show stunnin and sell as yer goes the cries of the streetseller were joined by those of the common criers who announced such items of public news as if any man or woman can tell any tydyngs of a grey mare with a long mane and a short tayle there were the shopkeepers of cheapside paternoster row east cheap and a hundred other localities calling out continually what do you lack will you buy the cry of the mercurywomen londons gazette here was eventually superseded by that of the newsboy with his paapar ainy of the mornin pipers the horn of the sowgelder plying his trade mingled with the bell of the dustman and the sound of the twancking of a brass kettle or a fryingpan together with the myriad and unending sounds of the london traffic today street markets are still alive with chatter and patter most of the cries have vanished although even in the twentyfirst century you might still hear the bell of the muffinman or the horn of the knifegrinder and see the ponyandtrap of the anyoldiron or ragandbone man there were also the barrow man with shrimps and winkles all aliveo the lavender seller and the lilywhite celery and watercress man who cried out eres yer salory and watercreases in the past there were also the balladsingers and the street patterers and the peripatetic vocalists and the almanac vendors and the flying stationers who would take up their pitch on any corner and sell single sheets on juicy murders or fashionable songs perhaps the oldest form was the broadside a sheet printed on one side which bore the latest news and the newest sensations from the earliest years of the sixteenth century this was the language of the streetsir walter raleigh his lamentations strange news from sussex no natural mother but a monster alongside these headlines as they might appropriately be called were such broadside ballads as a maydens lamentation for a bedfellow or i can nor will no longer lye alone the mans comfortable answer to the mayden this maid would give ten shillings for a kiss these were the songs which were shouted down the streets and pasted on the walls their vendors did not expect to get paid for their voices but instead drew a crowd and then sold their wares for a halfpenny a sheet there was of course an especial delight in last dying speeches sold to the crowd at the very moment of execution by flying patterers otherwise known as death hunters in a city which lived upon rumour sensation and sudden alterations of mass feeling the crying out of news and the singing of popular ballads were the perfect forms of communication the politic john dryden was not able to compete with the political ballad lillibullero which outsold him in every sense and another balladeer wrote dryden thy wit has catterwauld too longnow lero lero is the only song songs like slogans and catchphrases could sweep through the streets for days or weeks before being utterly forgotten then new songs together with an old ballad for company would in turn become part of a long song which comprised several ballads printed together on a roll of paper they might also come into the hands of the pinner up who fastened many hundreds of ballads on iron railings or an area of dead wall in the s some eight hundred yards of wall on the south side of oxford street were used to display these songsheets until the arrival of shops and shopfronts transformed the thoroughfare yet some ballads retained their individual popularity for many years willikins and his dinah billy barlow and the ratcatchers daughter remained great favourites with the london crowdthe pretty daughter of the ratcatcher herself having such a sweet loud voice siryou could hear her all down parliament streetand as far as charing cross sir she was representative of those itinerant streetperformers whose lives were often as pathetic and terrible as the ballads they sang they performed mainly in the evening sometimes accompanied by a flute or a cracked guitar and were to be found upon every corner from the strand to whitechapel charles dickens recalled his encounter with one such itinerant singer by the upper marsh on the south side of the riversinging how few of those who pass such a miserable creature as this think of the anguish of heart the sinking of soul and spirit which the very effort of singing produces the balladsinger had as a counterpart in the london streets the running patterer who cried out the romances and tragedies of the day henry mayhew described their activities in his usual laconic style it is a mob or school of the running patterers for both these words are used and consists of two three or four men all these men state that the greater the noise they make the better the chance of sale they would often take up positions in different parts of the street and pretend to vie with each other for attention thus heightening interest in the latest crime murder elopement or execution once again the requisite in the city is sheer volume of noise commotion and rumour are certainly more important than truth if that commodity can ever actually be found in london and the patterer often supplied his auditors with cockpolitely described as a pleasing fictionwhich was then sold as a catchpenny the offender was known as a cockcrower and sometimes advertised his false wares with a lurid picture often incorporating the london motifs of blood and flame mounted upon a pole it would be unfair to scorn these products of native art joshua reynolds confessed that he borrowed a motif from a woodcut he had found pinned to a dead wall walter scott studied street literature chapbooks and ballads to stimulate his interest in folk myth and history it is important to emphasise once again how cockney taste can enter and animate a more refined cultural tradition the voices of the running patterers and the itinerant singers were invariably joined by the often discordant airs of the street musicians hector berlioz visiting london in the midnineteenth century wrote that no city in the world was consumed so much by music despite his profession he was concerned less with the melodies of the concert hall than with those of the barrelorgan the barrelpiano the bagpipes and the drums which filled the streets as charles booth noted in his survey of the east end let a barrel organ strike up a valse at any corner and at once the girls who may be walking past and the children out of the gutter begin to foot it merrily men join in sometimes two young men together as likely as not while an appreciative crowd watched the dancing there were german bands as well as indian drummers and blackedup abyssians who played violin guitar tambourine and castanets there were glee singers and minstrels generally a couple who could be heard crooning oh where is my boy tonight and will you meet me at the fountain in the s there was a blind musician who played the violoncello with his feet and a crippled trumpeter who drove around in a dogcart the cacophony was immense and yet in one of those gradual but necessary transitions of london life most of it has passed away leaving only buskers to entertain cinema queues and inventive players of illegal music in the underpasses of londons transport system chapter signs of the times an eighteenthcentury traveller remarked that if towns were to be called after the first words which greeted a traveller on arrival london would be called damn it at the beginning of the twentieth century it would have been called bloody and today fuckin fucking is one of the longestserving terms of abuse having been heard on the london streets since the thirteenth century and it is perhaps no surprise that the prevalent adjective applied to the language of londoners is disgusting the disgust is a response to that undertow of violence and anger which exemplifies life in the city while such miseries as sexual abuse may have testified to the distaste which londoners have had for their own fallen and once dirty condition contemporary standards of hygiene and more liberal sexual mores have not however materially diminished the fucking and cunts heard in the street perhaps modern londoners are simply mouthing the words which the city itself has bequeathed to them in this context the obscene gesture should not be forgotten in the sixteenth century a biting of the thumb represented aggression this in turn led to the hat being cocked backwards and in the late eighteenth century by a jerk of the thumb over the left shoulder the thumb then moved to the tip of the nose to represent contempt and by the twentieth century two fingers were raised in the air as a v sign the arm and elbow were then employed in an upward thrust to suggest derision the hand gestures of the street could also be free of sexual innuendo there was once everywhere a pointing hand on the palm of which a destination was offeredplease to go this way whether to an eatinghouse or a toyshop london was a city of signs in according to jenny uglows hogarth the society of sign painters announced a grand exhibition of its products and in some rooms off bow street were exhibited keys bells swords poles sugarloaves tobacco rolls candles all the ornamental furniture carved in wood it was meant as a reproof to the more tasteful productions of the society of arts but its comic variety was also a testimony to an ancient but still living tradition of street art once a pole draped with red rags was the emblem of the barbersurgeon who was permitted to bleed customers on his premises the pole itself a token of the wooden rod which the customer held to keep his arm steady the red rag later turned into a red stripe until it became the customary barbers pole of succeeding centuries almost every house and certainly every trade had its own sign so that the streets of the city were a perpetual forest of painted imagery floure de lice ravyns head corniyshe coughs the chalice the cardinals hat there were images of chained bears and of rising suns of sailing ships and angels of red lions and golden bells there were also simple tokens of residence mr bell for example might hang the sign of a bell outside his house but there were also wellknown if somewhat surprising conjunctions in pub signs such as the dog and gridiron or the three nuns and a hare there were unusual attributions too as addison pointed out i have seen a goat set up before the door of a perfumer and the french kings head at a swordcutlerss tom jones in henry fieldings novel of that name takes up the litany here we saw josephs dream the bull and mouth the hen and razor the ax and bottle the whale and crow the shovel and boot the leg and star the bible and swan the frying pan and drum adam and eve represented a fruiterer while the horn of a unicorn symbolised the shop of an apothecary a bag of nails denoted an ironmonger a row of coffins a carpenter a sign of male and female hands conjoined might sometimes be completed by the message marriages performed within it was a question of reading the street of making the right associations and connections in an environment which needed a thorough decoding to mitigate its chaos and variety interpretative tracts such as the elegantly titled vade mecum for malt worms were also published in john gay gave best expression to the situation however in the art of walking the streets in londona theme taken up by many writerswith his portrait of a stranger who dwells on evry sign with stupid gazeenters the narrow alleys doubtful maze there were also signs and plaques carved into the stone of londons buildings small tablets marked newly laidout streetsthis is johns street ano dom while corporate heraldry was employed in the arms of a district or company affixed to various buildings the symbol of st marylebone contains lilies and roses because these were the flowers found in the grave of st mary after whom the district is named at a later date even the lowly coalhole covers were richly decorated so that those who preferred to look down upon the ground were still assaulted by symbols of dogs and flowers a nailed hoop upon a door or wall denoted the presence of fresh paint while a small bouquet of straw meant that building work was taking place in the vicinity the city is indeed a labyrinth of signs with the occasional but unnerving suspicion that there may exist no other reality than these painted symbols which demand your attention while leading you astray as one commentator said of the modern and brilliantly illuminated piccadilly circus it is a wonderful sightunless you can read the signs of the city were distracting in another sense they hung out so far from the wall that they touched those on the opposite side of the street and they were sometimes so large that they blocked out sight of the sky they could also be dangerous they were meant to be placed at least nine feet above the level of the pavement so that a horse and rider could pass beneath but the regulation was not always obeyed they were very heavy and there were occasions when the weight of sign and leaden support was too great for the wall to which they were fixedone frontfall of this kind in fleet street injured several people and killed two young ladies a cobbler and the kings jeweller on windy days in the capital the noise was ominous their creaking noise a sure sign of impending rainy floods so in the same years as the exhibition of street signs off bow street the city authorities concluded that they had become an impediment to the ever increasing traffic of the streets and ordered that they be taken down ten years later came street numbers but all colour was not lost the passion for street art simply changed its form with the expansion of advertising there had always been posters wrapped around the wooden posts of the street to publicise the latest auction or the latest play but only after the demise of street signs did other forms of public art properly emerge by the early nineteenth century london had grown wondrously pictorial with a variety of papiermâché ornaments or paintings placed in shop windows to denote the trade of the occupant an essay in the little world of london entitled commercial art lingers pleasurably on these objets dart many coffee houses had a symbol of loaf and cheese together with cup fishmongers painted the walls of their premises with a group of fish in the grand style all variously and picturesquely coloured while grocers specialised in conversation pieces which portrayed various benevolent london matrons assembled round the singing kettle or the simmering urn boots cigars and sealing wax in gigantic form were also suspended over the doors of various premises while the destruction of pompeii seemed a fitting advertisement for a patent cockroach exterminator one great innovation of the nineteenth century was the advertising hoarding and in some of the earliest photographs of london they can be seen lining the streets and the new railway stations offering everything from pears soap to the daily telegraph advertising was in that sense very much part of the ideal of progress since the hoardings themselves had first been erected to protect the streets from the myriad building sites and railway improvements once posters had been enlarged to cover these wooden frames then advertising images appropriate to the city itselflarge gaudy colourful began to emerge there were certain popular sites among them the north end of waterloo bridge and the dead wall beside the english opera house in north wellington street here according to charles knights london could be found rainbowhued placards vying in gorgeous extravagance of colour with turners last new picture pictures of pens gigantic as the plumes in the casque of the castle of otranto spectacles of enormous size irishmen dancing under the influence of guinnesss dublin stout a london street scene painted by jo parry in could serve as an introduction to any street scene over the last two centuries a small blackened sweepboy looks up in admiration as a poster for a new performance of otello is placed over one advertising john parry in the sham prince there is a bill proclaiming mr matthewsat home tom amp jerrythe christening and a narrow strip asking have you seen the industrious fleas thus the walls of the city become a palimpsest of forthcoming recent and old sensations on a dead wall today close to where i am now writing this book and not far from the site of the painting can be seen posters for armageddon to heathrow in fifteen minutes mr love pants is coming meltdown festival drugstoresobernew single available apostle and the girl with brains in her feet more mysterious advertisements suggest that theres a revolution in sight that the magic is closer than you think and that nothing else moves me peripatetic placards appeared on the streets in the s these were such a novel phenomenon that charles dickens interviewed one and by describing him as a piece of human flesh between two slices of pasteboard created the phrase sandwich man george scharf drew many of them from a small boy in surtout overcoat holding a barrel inscribed malt whiskey john howse to an old woman holding up a sign for anatomical model of the human figure then in characteristic london fashion the single placardcarriers were put together in order to create a kind of pageant or pantomime a group of them were placed inside paste models of blacking pots for example and paraded in line to advertise the efficacy of warrens blacking strand the very place where dickens himself began his tortuous london childhood then arrived the advertisement as the horsedrawn gig surmounted by an enormous hat or an egyptian obelisk the search for novelty was always intense and the passion for posters blossomed into the electric advertisements of the s when vinolia soap was hailed in illuminated letters above trafalgar square advertisements in lights soon began to move at piccadilly circus could be seen a red crystal bottle pouring port into a waiting glass and a car with turning silver wheels soon they were everywhereabove the ground under the ground and in the sky the plethora of advertising in london helped fashion huxleys vision of the future city in brave new world where above westminster the electric skysigns effectively shut off the outer darkness calvin stopes and his sixteen sexophonists buses of the twentyfirst century perhaps beyond the purview of dystopian fiction are now plastered with gaudy images like the pageant wagons of medieval london the pavement artists have had a less glorious career in the city they commenced their work only when the streets were paved with stone rather than cobbles and in that sense theirs is a recent london profession there was a time when beggars scrawled their messages of supplication upon the stones can you help me out being a favourite expressionbut the pavement artist supplied a variant in the s with the chalked words all my own work or every little helps i thank you these street artists or screevers as they were once called had their own particular pitches the corners of fashionable squares were considered to be ideal territory but cockspur street and the site opposite gattis restaurant in the strand were favoured locales there was also a line of such street artists along the embankment with twentyfive yards between each pitch many of these screevers were demoralised artists whose orthodox work had not prosperedsimeon solomons career as a preraphaelite painter had been applauded for example but he ended up as a pavement artist in bayswater others were the homeless or unemployed who realised that they had a talent for the job it required only coloured chalks and a duster and a scene or portrait could be conjured upon the stone some specialised in portraits of contemporary politicians or of sentimental domestic situations one artist painted religious scenes along the finchley road while in the whitechapel road another specialised in scenes of fire and burning houses in all cases however they satisfied the taste of london by painting in the crudest and most garish tones although by curious association they are related to the night sky above the city in the highways and byways of london mrs et cook reported that the sky behind the artists lodging houses in drury lane or hatton garden would often be robed in intense hues of orange purple and crimson as if mimicking their colours george orwell in down and out in paris and london recalls the conversation of one screever bozo whose pitch was close to waterloo bridge he was walking with orwell back to his lodgings in lambeth but was all the time looking up at the heavens say will you look at aldebaran look at the colour like agreat blood orange now and again i go out at night and watch the meteors bozo had even engaged in correspondence with the astronomer royal on the subject of the sky above london so that for a moment the city and the cosmos were intimately connected in the life of one wandering artist of the street but no account of london art can be complete without the history of its graffiti one of the first is a curse by one londoner upon two others written in a roman handpublius and titus were hereby solemnly cursed it is matched by a late twentiethcentury graffito recently recorded by the contemporary london novelist iain sinclair tikd fuck you dhkp and suggests a characteristic of london streetwriting for the stone shall cry out of the wall according to habakkuk and in london the cries are frequently those of anger and hostility many are entirely personal with no meaning except to the one who carved or sprayed the words upon a wall and remain the most enigmatic features of the city one moment of anger or loss has been inscribed upon its surface to become part of the chaos of signs and symbols which exist all around outside paddington station can be found fume everywhere together with cos boz and chop rava can be seen upon the bridges of the south bank great redeemer peoples liberator adorned kentish town station in the s thomas jordan cleaned this window and damn the job i say was written on an ancient window and on a london wall a thomas berry scribbled oh lord cut them with thy sword as one exponent of the art of graffiti put it to iain sinclair if youre going to be around the city all the time youd better put your name up which is the reason why people over many centuries have simply written down their names or initials on any tractable surface with the occasional amendment of was here or more frequently woz ere it is a way of asserting individuality perhaps but it becomes immediately part of the anonymous texture of london in that sense graffiti are a vivid token of human existence in the city they may be compared to footprints or handprints laid into cement which become part of the citys fabric hand impressions have been found in fleet road hampstead as mysterious and poignant as symbols carved on ancient stones sometimes graffiti have a relevance to the immediate localityjames bone is a bad kisser or rose maloney is a thiefwhere they serve as silent messages the written equivalent of drumtaps in the jungle but there are also more general admonitions in one of his prose works thomas more quotes a fifteenthcentury slogan written upon many wallsdc hath no pwhich can perhaps be deciphered with the help of mores summary that it toucheth the readiness that woman hath to fleshly filth if she fall in drunkenness one may surmise that dc denotes drunken cunts but the p is mysterious any particular year over the last thousand will provide its own litany of curses execrations and imperatives in for example these were some of the graffiti christ is god no coach tax murder jews joanna southcott damn the duke of richmond damn pitt in the most prominent graffiti remained strike in the west now and in the later part of the century the two most formidable slogans were george davis is innocent and no poll tax the city seems almost to be speaking to itself by means of these messages in a language both vivid and cryptic some recent graffiti have been more reflective in tonenothing lasts painted upon a brick wall obedience is suicide upon a bridge in paddington the tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction inscribed above rangers aggro boots and rent revolt on the corner of basing street notting hill gatethe last being a potent example of the phenomenon of clustering a wall may remain inviolate for many years but as soon as one graffito is placed upon it others ineluctably follow in competitive or aggressive display aggression can often be associated with sexuality many of these messages have an anonymous sexual intent which suggests isolation as well as desireoh please dont cane me too hard master i am i have aplace at victoria swi love dressing up i am wearingpink panties now the proper locale for these harsh and impersonal messages of love is naturally enough the public lavatory it has become the principal source of all urban graffiti here in confinement and secrecy the londoner speaks to the entire city with words and signs that are as old as the city itself one attendant told geoffrey fletcher the author of the london nobody knows that the lavatory in charing cross road was the place to go if you want the writing on the wall make your blood run cold it would in fact london lavatories have been notorious for centuries and in hurlo thrumbo printed at bethlehem wall moorfields a compilation entitled the merry thought or the glass window and bog house miscellany we may extract from these some of the more salient and perhaps immortal epigrams from the boghouses of pancras wells comes hither i came in haste to shit but found such excrements of wit that to shew my skill in verse had scarcely time to wipe my arse there then ensues a dialogue or chorus of other costive notes in which write is frequently rhymed with shite and london with undone the anonymous authors clothing is undone literally in the london boghouse but perhaps there is also a more plaintive suggestion that they have themselves been undone in london from the boghouse by the temple comes no hero looks so fierce in fight as does the man who strains to shite and upon a tavern wall in covent garden theres nothing foul that we commit but what we write and what we shit sometimes there is a grand riposte to this city scatology it is the vanity of degenerates one londoner inscribed to write their names here the other principal source of london graffiti has always been the prison house from the inscription of thomas rose upon the wall of the beauchamp tower in the tower of londonkept closeby those to whom he did no wrong may th to the cell of a modern prison where one inmate has written you may be guiltybut what must thisbe like for thosewho are not these men also have been undone in london thomas mehoe writes in bitertvrestrangemytrouthwastryedyetofmylibertiedenied with words painfully but carefully inscribed with an iron nail they are still preserved within the tower and in that ancient prison are many carvings crosses skeletons deathheads and hourglasses carved as tokens or symbols of suffering there are words which are supposed to provide comforthope to the end and have patience spero in deo patience shall prevail which can be contrasted with the graffiti found in the modern london prisonhome by may this is where i spent most of my life it was just onetime i never got away by someone who got caught treat me carefullyim seven yearsbad luck in many inscriptions the prison itself seems to be treated as an image of the world or of the city which will perhaps lend further significance to another graffito found upon a london walli cant breathe chapter all of them citizens there are other kinds of anonymity dickens knew of a woman seen in the streets about the strand who has fallen forward double through some affliction of the spine and whose head has of late taken a turn to one side so that it now droops over the back of one of her arms at about the wrist who does not know her staff and her shawl and her basket as she gropes her way along capable of seeing nothing but the pavement never begging never stopping for ever going somewhere on no business how does she live whence does she come whither does she go and why dickens saw her many times he never knew her name and she could not have seen the famous novelist as he passed her and perhaps looked back i used to pass a dwarf dressed in old clothes and with wizened features who in a hoarse voice would direct the traffic at the crossroads of theobalds road and grays inn road he was there every day and then suddenly in the summer of he was gone there was even more recently a young west indian who would walk up kensington church street dressed in silver foil and with balloons tied to his wrists a gentleman known colloquially as the king of poland used to walk barefoot along the strand in red velvet robes and with a wreath upon his head he too vanished without warning these london particulars have their own locale and are rarely seen beyond it they are the sprites or spirits of a specific place and belong exclusively to the city there was the musical smallcoal man of clerkenwell who after his daily round was over organised concerts in his lodgings in jerusalem passage he died when as a practical joke a ventriloquist known as talking smith pretended to be the voice of god proclaiming his doom there was lord queensberry old q who every day sat at the window of his house at piccadilly although he had only one eye he leered and winked at every pretty female who passed in the street and there was the afflicted girlwhite faced and expressionless who sat for many years close to the horseshoe of tottenham court road oblivious of time and inured to suffering through all the noise and tumult there were always such familiar faces in every locality today there are the lollipop men and women helping children to cross the road but until the early decades of the twentieth century the best known were the crossingsweepers many crossingsweepers remained at their postsor on their particular property as it was calledfor thirty or forty years there was the bearded crossingsweeper at cornhillsometimes i get insulted only in words sometimes i get chaffed by sober people and there at the corner of cavendish square was billy who could remember ancient riotsthe mob was carrying a quartern loaf dipped in bullocks blood and when i saw it i thought it was a mans head so that frightened me and i run off one elderly sweeper kept the narrow passage from berkeley street into stratton street and wore an old huntsmans coat and hat he once came into the police court as a witness and the following exchange is recorded by mayhew judge are you a fieldmarshal witness no my lord i am the sweeper of the lansdowne passage there was sir harry dimsdale of seven dials according to old and new london a poor diminutive creature deformed and half an idiot who hawked laces and threads at the turn of the nineteenth century he followed the same routes along holborn or oxford street and suffered the jeers of the children and the watermen who washed down the hackneycoach stands he had only four or five teeth but could bend a silver coin with them when he could induce anybody to trust him with one his favourite amusement was to torment children by pinching them or throwing them to the ground but his chief pleasure was found in drink he was helplessly drunk every evening howling in the frenzy produced by his fiery draughts or uttering the low dismal plaint caused by hunger or pain it is reported that his expression was one of idiotcy physical suffering and a propensity to mischief but the mistress of his wretched lodgingsa back attic laid with strawreported that at night she heard him praying sir harry was known throughout london and there is an extant engraving of him at the age of thirtyeight but then he too suddenly disappeared his is a curious story of suffering and isolation but one with echoes and parallels in the modern city other eccentric tradesmen led more amiable lives in the street there was the famous character peter stokes the flying pieman of holborn hill in the early nineteenth century as described by aleph in london scenes and london people he always wore a black suit scrupulously brushed dress coat and vest knee breeches stout black stockings and shoes with steel buckles this tradesman with an expression open and agreeable expressive of intellect and moral excellence would dash out of fetter lane on the stroke of twelve noon and run through the streets of the neighbourhood for the next four hours dodging horses and wagons and coaches incessantly crying buy buy buy he too was famous throughout london and sat to an engraver with the basket of pies balanced neatly on his right arm equally notable in the streets of london a little more than a century earlier was colly molly puffe a short hunchbacked man who also sold pastries he preferred to balance his basket upon his head rather than his arm and despite his frail form he had a stentorian voice with which he sang out his wares his cry was unmistakable and he was to be seen at city parades or public hangings always brandishing a big stick to ward off any thief or urchin who tried to steal his goods tiddy doll was a vendor of gingerbread in the haymarket who wore ornate and brightly coloured dress complete with feathered cap and had the distinction of being drawn by hogarth he was so well known by londoners that once being missed from his usual stand on the occasion of a visit which he paid to a country fair a catchpenny account of his alleged murder was printed and sold in the streets by thousands his actual death was almost equally sensational during a frost fair when a festival was held upon the iced surface of the thames tiddy doll plunged through a sudden crack and was drowned there have been any number of london eccentrics and exhibitionists who achieved fame in the streets there was a celebrated miser thomas cook of clerkenwell who on his deathbed demanded his money back from the surgeon who had not cured him there was a notorious doctor martin van butchell who rode around the west end on a pony upon whose flanks he had painted spots when at home in mount street he sold oranges and gingerbread on his doorstep and kept his first wife embalmed in the parlour he dressed his first wife in black and his second in white according to edward walford in old and new london never allowing either a change of colour he astonished his contemporaries by growing a beardthis at the end of the eighteenth centuryand equally astonishing to his fellow citizens was one of the earliest teetotallers benjamin coates first came to public notice in when he hired the haymarket theatre so that he might play romeo for one night he appeared on stage in a cloak of skyblue silk profusely spangled red pantaloons a vest of white muslin and a wig of the style of charles ii capped by an opera hat unfortunately he had a guttural voice and the laughter which greeted his performance was increased by the fact that his nether garments being far too tight burst in seams which could not be concealed he was known ever after as romeo coates and was often seen driving through the streets in a carriage manufactured in the shape of a sea shell for sheer vigour and energy we may put him beside the engraver william woolett who each time he finished a new work fired a cannon from the roof of his house in green street leicester square certain women also made a singular impression there was the rich and learned miss banks who wore a quilted petticoat with two immense pockets stuffed with books of all sizes when she wandered on her bookhunting expeditions through the streets she was always accompanied by a sixfoot manservant with a cane almost as tall as himself in this state she was again according to walford more than once taken for a member of the balladsinging confraternity miss mary lucrine of oxford street kept the shutters of her windows barred and never left her lodgings for some fifty years one of several london spinsters who closed themselves off from the anxiety and violence of the city some londoners became notorious through their diet in the middle years of the seventeenth century roger crab of bethnal green subsisted on dockleaves mallows or grasse and plain water while in the late twentieth century stanley green wearing cap and blazer paraded in oxford street with a banner proclaiming less passion from less protein for twentyfive years crowds swirled about him almost oblivious of his presence engaged only in their usual uproar pestilence and flame the causes and consequences of the great plague of were endlessly described but most considered it to be gods punishment upon a heathen city chapter a plague upon you london is a city perpetually doomed it has always been considered the jerusalem about which the prophets were so clamant and the words of ezekiel have often been applied to curb its mighty spiritsay unto them which daub it with untempered mortar that it shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it ezekiel xiii in the fourteenth century john gower lamented its approaching destruction and in thomas nashe wrote that london doth mourn lambeth is quite forlorn trades cry woe worth that ever they were born from winter plague and pestilence good lord deliver us in the earl of shaftesbury described london as the city of the plague and one of the characters in george orwells keep the aspidistra flying talks of a city of the dead much has been written about the nature of fear in london james boswell arrived in the city in i began to be apprehensive that i was taking a nervous fever a supposition not improbable as i had one after such an illness when i was last in london i was quite sunk the editors commentary upon laroons depiction of street traders emphasises the traces of anxiety upon their faces in particular hollow frightened eyes in the poem london william blakes narrator wanders through the streets by the river and mark in every face i meetmarks of weakness marks of woe together with the infants cry of fear soldiers sigh harlots curse newborn infants tear in the illustration with which he has adorned the righthand side of the poem a child is warming itself beside a great fire which may itself be a token of calamity in his account of the plague of and daniel defoe depicted the city itself torn by fever and nervous fear it was said of thackeray that it seemed as if london were his disease and he could not help telling all the symptoms to which is appended the remark that is another sign of a true londoner in a poem by thomas hood the stones of london cry out against a woman careering through the streets upon a horsebatter her shatter her kick her brains out let her blood spatter her there has always been so much to create anxiety in the citythe noise the endless rush the violence of the mob london has been compared to a prison and to a grave to the german poet heinrich heine this overdriven london oppresses the fancy and tears the heart heckethorns london memories records that when in one soldier prophesied an earthquake vast multitudes left london for the country and the fields around were crowded with fugitives from the threatened catastrophe the unfortunate seer was later confined to a madhouse but the symptoms of fear have never materially diminished in times of pestilence many citizens simply died of fright and it has been remarked that in nineteenthcentury discourse the word gloom emerges frequently it is related to the fogs or london particulars of that century but it seems also to have possessed an intimate and more unnerving significance november was the month for london suicides and when the fog was at its thickest people who experienced this phenomenon said it seemed as if the world was coming to an end these last words were exactly those used by the inhabitants of whitechapel road when a firework manufactory exploded the phrase came readily and easily to the lipsas if perhaps there was some unconscious wish for this mighty cessation dostoevsky noted after visiting the great exhibition in london and you feel nervous a feeling of fear somehow creeps over you can this you think in fact be the final accomplishment of an ideal state of things is this the end by any chance death has always been one of londons devices the dance of death was painted on the wall of st pauls churchyard so that the people who thronged that church for business or amusement were always aware of their mortality in june of the registrar of a parish records the following causes of death within that one montha swellynge ague consumption thought cough blody fluxe poches pox postum which brake browce bruise famyne consumed away the bills of mortality in london published every thursday include those who were planet struck or who suffered from horseshoe head or rising of the lights the latter now quite uninterpretable there are entries on those killed in the pillory or who died from want in newgate even before the plague of and the fire of memento mori motifs were one speciality of the seventeenth century city churchyards nobody is healthy in london mr woodhouse complains in emma nobody could be a character in smolletts humphry clinker matthew bramble suffered certain symptoms in london which warn me to be gone from this centre of infection a century later london was described as the great wen or fleshy excrescence indicative of poor health there have always been epidemics and waves of death within the metropolis the black death of killed approximately per cent of londons population many were buried outside the walls in nomansland otherwise known as pardon churchyard or wilderness row now part of the clerkenwell road behind the charterhouse in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries epidemics of the sweating sickness fell upon the capital on at least six occasions that of visited london with such violence that it carried off thousands in the space of five or six hours the quagmires and open sewers of the city turned it into a paradise for mosquitoes thus causing the ague which is now known as malaria the plague came early to london the first recorded instance is from the seventh century between the years and there were five severe attacks in the latter year killing some londoners when feare and trembling the two catchpolles of death arrest every one no voyce heard but tue tue kill kill and watling street was like an empty cloyster no one was ever safe no one was ever entirely well in a city full of pits and sloughs very perilous and noyous dirty and filled with corrupt savours london itself had become a sink of disease yet nothing in its history could have prepared its citizens for the events which unfolded between the fated and fateful years of and there had been intimations of catastrophe in walter costello wrote that if fire make not ashes of the city and thy bones also conclude me a liar for ever oh london london in the following year a quaker tract entitled a vision concerning london contained the prophecy that and as for the city herself and her suburbs and all that belonged to her a fire was kindled therein but she knew not how even in all her goodly places and the kindling of it was in the foundation of all her buildings and there was none could quench it in his monarchy or no monarchy published in the london astrologer william lilly inserted an hieroglyphical plate representing on one side persons in winding streets digging graves and on the other a large city in flames wenceslaus hollar had noticed the vigour and energy of the citizens in but on his return in he found the countenances of the people all changed melancholy spight full as if bewitched mother shipton predicted a general conflagration and a quaker walked naked through bartholomew fair with a pan of fire and brimstone on his head as a prophecy a man in a narrow passage by bishopsgate convinced all those around him that a ghost there was making signs to the houses and to the ground suggesting plainly that abundance of people should come to be buried in that churchyard there is an area adjacent to goswell road known as mount mills it is now an open space used as a car park it is unusual in this part of london to find what is essentially a patch of waste ground the answer lies in its history here according to daniel defoe in a journal of the plague year on a piece of ground beyond goswell street near mount mill abundance were buried promiscuously from the parishes of aldersgate clerkenwell and even out of the city it was a plague pit in other words where during the great plague of and thousands were taken in dead carts and dumped in the loose soil it was comparable to the burial pit in houndsditch about forty feet in length sixteen feet broad and twenty feet in depth containing more than a thousand corpses some of the bodies were wrapt up in linen sheets some in rags some little other than naked or so loose that what covering they had fell from them in the shooting out of the cart it was reported that the living out of despair sometimes flung themselves among the dead the pye tavern was very close to the houndsditch pit itself and when at night the drunken heard the rumble of the dead cart and the noise of the iron bell they came to the window and jeered at anyone who mourned for the newly dead they also uttered blasphemous expressions such as there is no god or god is a devil there was one driver who when he had any children in his dead cart could cry faggots faggots five for sixpence and take up a child by the leg the area of mount mills is waste ground still these reports are all taken from defoes chronicle he was only six years old at the time of the visitation and much of his evidence is anecdotal but there are also contemporary accounts which furnish additional material for contemplation any observer willing to enter the city during the plague would first have noticed the silence there was no traffic except for the dead carts and all the shops and markets were closed those who had not fled had locked themselves within their houses and the river was deserted any citizens who did venture upon the streets walked in the middle down the kennel away from the buildings they also avoided chance meetings it was so quiet that the rush of the water beneath the bridge could distinctly be heard throughout the old city great bonfires were placed at intersections and in the middle of main thoroughfares so that the streets were filled with smoke as well as the miasma of the dead and dying the life of london seemed to be over the plague had begun in the parish of st giles at the close of it is understood now that the infection was carried by the black rat known also as rattus rattus otherwise called the ship rat or the house rat these rats are old inhabitants of london their bones being discovered in excavations of fourthcentury fenchurch street it is likely that they arrived from south asia in roman ships and they have remained ever since the severe cold of the early months of prevented any spread in the infection for a while but from the beginning of spring the bills of mortality began to rise by july the plague had entered the city from the western suburbs it was a dry hot summer without any wind grass grew in the abandoned streets john allin a clergyman stayed in the city and sent many letters to those at a safe distance they are reprinted in wg bells unknown london on august he wrote i am troubled at the approach of the sicknesse neerer every weeke and at a new burying place which they have made neer us they indicating some indeterminate authority all the more pressing for being so vague has always been part of the london vocabulary thirteen days later i am through mercy yet well in middest of death and that too approaching neerer and neerer not many doores off and the pitt open dayly within view of my chamber window in the following week at the beginning of september he described the dolefull and almost universall and continuall ringing and tolling of bells so this was the noise that broke the silence in the same letter he mentioned that his brother had left the house one morning and on his return from the streets had found a stiffness under his eare where he had a swelling that could not be brought to rise and breake but choacked him he dyed thursday night last five days later allin wrote of the distemper it is at the next doore on both hands of mee and under the same roofe these dayes hath bene sea cole fyres made in the streets about every th doore but that will not do the worke of stopping gods hand his anxiety is palpable it was not until the middle of september that some rain mitigated the appalling heat but after that modest abatement the plague raged again john allin told the story of six physicians who believing that they had found a remedy opened up an infected bodyit is said that they are all dead since the most of them distractedly madd six days later there came report of that word spoken by a child here concerning the increase of the plague until dye in a weeke the child died yet the rates began to fall in the last week of february there were only fortytwo deaths reported whereas more than eight thousand died each week of september within the texture of defoes prose london becomes a living and suffering being not the abstract civic space of wh audens poem london is itself racked with fever and is all in tears its face is strangely altered and its streets circulate steams and fumes like the blood of those infected it is not clear whether the whole sick body of london is an emanation of its citizens or whether the inhabitants are an emanation or projection of the city certainly its conditions were responsible for much death in the great centre of trade and commerce the process of buying and selling itself destroyed the citizensthis necessity of going out of our houses to buy provisions was in a great measure the ruin of the whole city the people dropped dead in the very markets in the act of trading they would just sit down and die with the tainted coins still in their pockets there is another melancholy image which issues from the pages of defoe it is of a city where there were so many prisons in the town as there were houses shut up metaphors of incarceration are persistent throughout london writing but during the great plague there emerged vivid and literal examples of urban imprisonment the symbolism of the red cross and the words lord have mercy on us has not been wasted on mythographers of the city but the measure of societal control has perhaps not been fully recognised of course many people escaped often by the expedient of going over a garden wall or travelling along the roofseven with some watchmen murdered to ensure libertybut in theory each street and each house became a gaol one ordinance has remained in force for three centuries with the proclamation that all the graves shall be at least six feet deep all beggars were expelled public assemblies were banned in a city which had shown its manic propensities in a thousand different ways order and authority had to be imposed directly and harshly hence the turning of houses into prisons by shutting up a measure which even at the time was considered by many to be both arbitrary and pointless but in a city of prisons it was the natural and instinctive response of the civic authorities by means of anecdote and circumstantial detail defoe provides a londoners vision of a city quite abandoned to despair it is clear from his report that the citizens very quickly reverted to superstition and apparently primitive belief a genuine madness was in the streets with prophets and interpreters of dreams and fortunetellers and astrologers all terrifying the people to the last degree many fearful of sudden death ran out into the streets to confess that i have been a murderer and i have been a thief at the height of the plague it was fully believed that god was resolved to make a full end of the people of this miserable city and as a result the citizens became raving and distracted daniel defoe knew london very wellperhaps better than any man living in his periodand he declared that the strange temper of the people of london at that time contributed extremely to their destruction there were conjurors and witches quacks and mountebanks who placed posters all over the city advertising their services and who dispensed pills and cordials and treacles and plague waters to the desperate a list of cures was published at the sign of the angell neare the greate conduit in cheapside and it was possible for an excellent electuary against the plague to be drunk at the green dragon cheapeside at sixpence a pint london has always been a centre for healers and doctors surgeons and magnetisers of all descriptions perhaps its nervous fear has in turn promoted symptoms to be cured by physic in fourteenthcentury london calendars of saints as well as various charts of astrology were used to determine the efficacy of particular herbs ecclesiastics were the first surgeons in the thirteenth century the papal authorities banned them for shedding blood after that date lay surgeons and physicians were ubiquitous not all of them had undergone the usual apprenticeship of ten years however and in the early sixteenth century it was proclaimed that the science and cunning of physick and surgery were being exercised by smiths weavers and women who used sorcery and witchcraft to effect their cures it was believed for example that water drunk from the skull of a hanged man or the very touch of a dead mans hand were efficacious earlier londoners admiring london stone which has been considered alternately as a milestone or a symbol of civic power it now lies almost unseen in cannon street john stow the great

elucidate the manner in which londoners identified each other by citing location in terms of the nearest tavern there seems little doubt that william salmon did indeed effect cures like a modern psychiatrist he was particularly effective at dispelling or exorcising that melancholy which was a recurring london condition he was himself a london original part showman part sorcerer and part physician he was born in the summer of and began life as an assistant to a mountebank before establishing his own career as the seller of elixir vitae he was also a popular educator and in published synopsis medicinae or a compendium of astrological galenical and chymical physick which passed through at least four editions he wrote several other popular books upon mathematics and drawing as well as medicine but his most successful work was his london almanack in which he prophesied in a manner to be later adopted or stolen by old moore his practice across london can be traced with some accuracyfrom smithfield to salisbury court off fleet street from there to the blue balcony by the ditch near holborn bridge and then on to mitre court beside fleet street like many londoners he became a radical dissenter he joined a sect called the new religious fraternity of freethinkers which assembled near the leathersellers hall then at a somewhat late age he began to practise anatomy on his death in he left two microscopes and a library of over three thousand volumes of course there were more genteel if not more learned practitioners of healing who came under the aegis of the company of barber surgeons they were later to split in two becoming barbers or surgeons or the college of physicians the latter institution with a roof described as the distant sight of a gilded pill was in warwick lane near newgate prison from which many of its anatomical subjects came anatomy lessons were its principal and compelling feature they were conducted in a central chamber used as the setting for hogarths the reward for cruelty in which the corpse of a wretched murderer tom nero is thoroughly anatomised and degraded it was known as a theatre and indeed it became an intrinsic part of london spectacle the taking of the corpses of the hanged for dissection and dispersal was an old customwe read of the necessity of a wax candle to look into the bodybut in later years the corpses were also used to test the properties of electricity one recently deceased killer was galvanised in with the result that one of his eyes opened and he raised his right hand it is reported by charles knight that the instructor died that very afternoon of the shock at an earlier date in a specimen was about to be anatomised when he threw his hand in the surgeons face and accidentally cut his lips with the lancet after this escape from the knife he sat in a chair groaning and in great agitation eventually he recovered and heartily asked for his mother hogarths engraving is a swirling composition in which the round complementarity of all parts evokes the circles of tom neros life within the inferno of london it also seems to demonstrate the connection between neros own cruelty and that of the physicians who are presently disembowelling him the violence of the streets fashions neros character so that he becomes an emblem of the worst london type yet he is not so different from the surgeon delightedly plunging a scalpel into his eyesocket hogarth based his portrait upon a surgeon named dr john freke in this city everything connects the skeletons of two famous malefactors which once hung in the alcoves of the anatomical theatre can still be seen in the museum of the royal college of surgeons jonathan wild the most notorious villain of eighteenthcentury london and william corder the killer of maria martin in the old red barn murder now hang together as part of a truly oldfashioned london spectacle in the same gallery can be seen the irish giant charles byrne whose skeleton of seven feet ten inches has been placed beside the diminutive remains of caroline crachami who was only one foot ten and a half inches in height they were london freaks and in death they still satisfy the taste for urban theatre the apothecaries of london like the anatomists were accustomed to stage management they customarily wore black and it was almost mandatory that their shops however humble would contain a skull as well as a folio written in some ancient tongue here were sold herbs and powders pills and electuaries drugs and dentifrices pomades and lovecharms in camomile street and bucklersbury in particular all herbal remedies were to be found in smolletts roderick random there is a summary of the trading artsoystershells he could convert into crabs eyes common oil into oil of sweet almonds thames water into aqua cinnamoni when any common thing was ordered for a patient he always took care to disguise it in colour or taste or both in such a manner as that it could not possibly be known the drugs themselves came and went according to the fashion of the age in the seventeenth century these included moss smoked horses testicles may dew and henbane in the eighteenth century we find nutmeg and spiders wrapped in their own silk in the nineteenth century we read of turkey rhubarb and sulphuric acid in the early twentieth century in the east end there are reports of iron jelloids zam buk ointment enos fruit salt owbridges lung tonic clarkes blood mixture andersons scots pills first given to the world in were still being sold in in his account of the great plague defoe emphasises the credulity of ordinary londoners who wore charms philtres exorcisms amulets in order to ward off the encroaching disease some kept signs of the zodiac or the written phrase abracadabra in pockets and seals they had reverted to the paganism that had dominated the city ever since the first wooden idol was carved in dagenham bc there is a museum south of the river off the walworth road which contains the lovett collection of london charms amulets and relics it is the true home of urban superstition with a range of artefacts which suggests that the city has absorbed all the traditions of magic and ritual from both native and immigrant populations from the east end came in five uneven shaped stones on a string these were according to the museums catalogue hung on the corner of the bed to keep nightmares away in the same year was deposited a greyish white tubular bottle sealed at each end with thread mercury inside this was used as a cure for rheumatism a grey cats skin was employed as a remedy for whooping cough and a leather slipper painted gold was a symbol of good luck from clapham arrived a pincushion in the form of a domino piece marked with seven dots from east london came a key attached to a rope as a talisman to safeguard the wearer against witches as well as a necklace of amber and other gems worn in to bring good health barking was the area in which to search for mandrake roots which scream like a child when taken out of the ground there are coins to bring wealth iron pyrite acorns to prevent lightning strikes the acorn from the tree of the thunder god cows hearts and rams horns and donkeys shoes to act as charms the museum also contains the head of a london magicians wand or staff engraved with solomons seal it was carved in the fourteenth century and then lost in the depths of the river as recently as it was common practice in the east end to cut off some of the hair of a sick child the hair was placed in a sandwich and given to the first dog that was encountered the illness then left the child and entered the body of the unfortunate animal in the east end too it was customary for women and female children to wear blue glass beads around the neck as a preventive charm against bronchitis these necklaces were sold in hundreds of small shops usually presided over by an aged woman at the price of one halfpenny it became a custom that the beads were eventually buried with the woman who had worn them in the early twentieth century too young women all over london were visiting herbalists in order to purchase tormentil root or dragons bloodgum from a sumatran treeas love philtres in a suggestive book written by edward lovett magic in modern london published in it is reported that sharks teeth taken from the london clay were said to cure cramp in camberwell it was customary to cover a horseshoe with red cloth in order to ward off nightmares while mile end was known as the place where children could be charmed and healed when market business was bad in the east end the trader would exclaim ah i expect i forgot to bow to the new moon it is appropriate in a city of commerce that it was customary to call out money at the sight of a falling star strangely shaped stones were placed on london mantelpieces as a votive offering in the same manner that silver representations of limbs were hung in medieval city churches a woman in whitechapel told an investigator that when moving house it was customary to swing the cat around one room in order to induce it to stay there are also interesting records of cat sacrifice in the walls of certain houses cauls in which children had been born were on sale for eighteen pence each as a safeguard against drowning but at the time of the first world war when the danger of death was very close the price rose to in london markets it was possible until recent times to buy neolithic stone axes or flint arrowheads as another precaution against thunderbolts london resembles a prison and it is perhaps not surprising to discover that keys have always been an object of taboo they were associated with magic and the presence of demons thus the art of lockpicking was known as the black art according to peter linebaugh in the london hanged and the most common lockpicking tool was called a charm keys were used to investigate suspected persons the name was placed in the stem of a key and guilt was established if the key then moved or shook the lodgings of prostitutes were often symbolised by the drawing of a large key and many ladies of the night wore keys around their neck as a symbol of their trade there is a suggestive eighteenthcentury passage connected with the storming of newgate prison one rioter came back to his lodging house and announced i have got the keys of newgate at his subsequent trial a fellow lodger was questioned by the magistrate about these keys you would not touch them for fear that they would contaminate you i would not come near them patients at bedlam who refused to swallow their drugs had their mouths opened by a specially designed metal key at the time of the plague spectres were seen in the thoroughfares of the city indeed london has always been troubled by ghosts a fine brick house on the south side of the churchyard in clerkenwell was seldom tenanted because of its reputation number parker street off drury lane had a name for ill luck and was eventually torn down another house in the same street no was haunted by fearful noises in a corner where death had occurred there was a haunted house in berkeley square which was empty for a long time and another in queens gate pj grosley visiting the city in the eighteenth century remarked upon the great practical fear of ghosts there even while londoners make a jest of them in theory another stranger in the same period visited the theatres and noticed that the ghosts of shakespearean drama provoked surprise fear even horror to such a degree as if the scenes which they saw were real it has often been remarked that in a city of spectacle londoners find it difficult to distinguish theatre from reality but more significantly such reports suggest a surprising credulity in the middle of the sixteenth century a young girl was found to have counterfeited a supernatural voice in a house near aldersgate through which the people of the whole city were wonderfully molested we must imagine flying rumour and reports and fear the london writer aleph has another story in the early months of it was firmly believed that within a house in cock lane that once dingy narrow halflighted street there dwelled a ghost known as scratching fanny responsible for certain knockings and bangings a young girl was believed to be possessed by this spirit and was constantly attended by mysterious noises though bound and muffled hand and foot thousands of londoners visited cock lane and the more genteel were permitted to visit the girls bedroom fifty at a time almost suffocating her from the stench a committee of eminent londoners was set up to investigate the claimsone of their number was the superstitious samuel johnsonand concluded that the girl had some art of counterfeiting noises her father was put in the pillory at the end of cock lane where the populace treated him with compassion and so the affair ended after london had once again been wonderfully molested it is almost as if it were itself a spectral city so filled with intimations of its past that it haunts its own inhabitants the islington ghost visited a patch of ground beside trinity church in cloudesley square causing a wondrous commotion in various parts the earth swelling and turning up every side michael faraday is supposed to haunt a telephone exchange in bride street which was once the chapel of his sandemanian congregation lord holland and dan leno dick turpin and annie chapman have variously been seen old hospitals and the city churches have proved fruitful ground for phantoms and the stretch of swains lane in highgate beside the cemetery has been the home of many sightings there is apparently a ghost in the oriental department of the british museum and a phantom blackbird haunted a house in dean street for many generations the daughter of the earl of holland walking in kensington gardens met with her own apparition habit and everything as in a looking glass she died a month later the rector of st bartholomews smithfield saw in his pulpit the ghost of a divine in the black gown of geneva exhorting the unseen audience with the greatest fervour gesticulating vehemently bending first to the right and then to the left over the pulpit thumping the cushions in front of him and all the while his lips moving as though speech was pouring from him the tower of london has of course been the natural haven of many spirits familiar figures have glided by among them walter raleigh and anne boleyn the latter was seen by three witnesses as a white figure and a soldier on duty at the door of the lieutenants lodgings fell in a dead faint he was courtmartialled but later acquitted the ghost of a bear issued from beneath the door of the jewel house and the sentry who saw it died two days later it might be recalled that there was indeed a menagerie or a zoo within the tower itself one of the most ambiguous apparitions was that vouchsafed to the keeper and his wife they were at table in the sitting room of the notorious jewel house when a glass tube something about the thickness of my arm hovered in the air it contained some dense fluid white and pale azure incessantly rolling and mingling within the cylinder it approached the keepers wife who exclaimed oh christ it has seized me before it crossed the room and disappeared other places have remained objects of london fear it is believed the cries of drowned jews murdered in the great expulsion of can still be heard at low tide near gravesend the field of forty footsteps which now lies beneath gordon square was considered to be charmed or blasted according to taste here were once picked plantain leaves which were supposed to influence dreams but more importantly on the same spot two brothers killed each other in a duel the imprint of their fatal footsteps was thought to have lingered while the area of the killings could produce no grass southey did indeed decipher the outlines of seventysix footsteps the size of a large human foot about three inches deep and in the summer of just before the area was built upon moser counted more than forty washington irving observed the inhabitants of little britain behind smithfield and beside aldersgate in the s they are apt to be rendered uncomfortable by comets and eclipses he wrote in the guise of geoffrey crayon gent and if a dog howls dolefully at night it is looked upon as a sure sign of death he also listed the games and customs of the people we may include here the ancient ceremony of beating the bounds an act of parish assertiveness which derives from the importance of beating the devil out of the locality once charity children were whipped at each boundary with white willow wands but in more recent years the particular walls are simply beaten with sticks there are altogether some fiftysix annual customs and ceremonies in the city ranging from the swearing on the horns in highgate to the verdict of the trial of the pyx in goldsmiths hall but the rituals of mayday are the most enduring if not necessarily the most endearing in the first recorded ceremonies the merry milk maids of london would carry upon their heads a pyramid of silver plate instead of their usual pails this may sound quaint but the connotations of the practice were more ritualistic and barbaric the maids were hardly merrythey were some of the most poorly paid and heavily worked of all city tradesand this parade of silver plate borrowed for the occasion from pawnbrokers can be seen as a token of their financial enslavement during the rest of the year the first of may was also a day of sexual licence and in recognition of this lubricious fact young chimneysweeps joined the maids in a later version of the spectacle grosley reports that their black faces are whitened with meal their heads covered with periwigs powdered as white snow and their clothes bedaubed with paperlace and yet tho dressed in this droll manner their air is nearly as serious as that of undertakers at a funeral chimneysweeps like miners have always been associated with the dark and promiscuous forces of the world hence their appearance on mayday but the young sweeps with their serious air were also the most harshly treated of all london children many were killed burned or deformed in the exercise of the trade which was literally to climb up the flues of the chimneys and dislodge any soot or cinders so their labour and suffering were paraded for one day of levity there is a painting of great interest dated around and entitled the curd and whey seller cheapside it depicts a blind girl sitting at the foot of the conduit in that street holding out her hand to three young sweeps this conduit was their usual haunt and their expressions are of startling vivacity the faces of two of them are so blackened that only their eyes and mouths are visible they are all very small and one of them seems to have a deformed back they do indeed seem like the grotesques of the city with a suggestion of threat or menace directed against the blind and very pale streetseller it can be suggested therefore that the procession of sweeps on mayday was a reenactment of their threat which was to be symbolically alleviated by laughter like all london rites however the ceremony gradually became more fanciful with the introduction in the late eighteenth century of a green man covered in twigs and leaves he was known as jackinthegreen or simply green and accompanied by milkmaids and sweeps was paraded in various parishes as some garish token of spring mayday ceremonies were eventually taken over by street performers before disappearing altogether yet the superstitions of london have not wholly departed the city itself remains magical it is a mysterious chaotic and irrational place which can be organised and controlled only by means of private ritual or public superstition that great adopted londoner samuel johnson felt obliged to touch every post in fleet street when he walked down that thoroughfare in similar spirit many london streets have refused to countenance a no among them fleet street park lane oxford street praed street st jamess street haymarket and grosvenor street but the very line of a thoroughfare has for some a more numinous function there have been many attempts to plot the trajectory of the city by means of leylines or leys which connect certain sites in straight alignment one such line connects highgate hill in the north with pollards hill in norbury to the south on the way touching a surprising number of churches and chapels efforts have been made to connect the various churches built by nicholas hawksmoor or to align st pancras old church the british museum or the greenwich observatory within a significant topography in one sense it marks a revival of the earth magic once practised by the celtic tribes of this region yet it also gives due recognition to the power of place this is the power that william blake celebrated in his vision of los treading through london till he came to old stratford amp thence to stepney amp the isleof leuthas dogs thence thro the narrows of the rivers sideand saw every minute particular in those particulars like the mournful days of the great plague the life and history of the city can be revived chapter painting the town red red is londons colour the cabs of the early nineteenth century were red the pillar boxes are red the telephone boxes were until recently red the buses are characteristically still red the underground trains were once generally of that colour the tiles of roman london were red the original wall of london was built from red sandstone london bridge itself was reputed to be imbued with red bespattered with the blood of little children as part of the ancient rituals of building red is also the colour of violence the great capitalists of london the guild of the mercers wore red livery the chronicles of london for describe the mair recourdour and aldermen off london in oon suyt also in skarlett while a poem commemorating henry vis triumphal entry into london in depicts the noble meir cladde in reede velvette the pensioners of the chelsea hospital still wear red uniforms red was the colour used to mark street improvements on the maps of london and to indicate the areas of the welltodo or wealthy red was also the cockney slang for gold itself the london riverworkers who supported the mobs that poured through the streets in the spring of invented the red flag as a token of radical discontent novelists have also identified the colour of red with the nature of the city in the napoleon of notting hill chestertons vision of a future london a protagonist asks i was wondering whether any of you had any red about you and then stabs his left palm so that the blood fell with so full a stream that it struck the stones without dripping this is a prelude to the success of the red notting hillers in that novel red crosses were placed upon the doors of households shut up with the plague thus confirming the symbolic association of the colour with that london disease which was once considered always smouldering like covered embers the firefighters of london wore red jackets or crimson livery cloth their commander dying in a great fire in performed one telling actpausing only for a moment to unwind the red silk paisley kerchief from his neck the colour is everywhere even in the ground of the city itself the bright red layers of oxidised iron in the london clay identify conflagrations which took place almost two thousand years ago yet there is one fire which has always remained in the memory of londonersa fire which as john locke noted created sunbeams of a strange red dim light which covered the whole of the city and could be seen even from his library in oxford the great fire of londonof was considered to be the greatest of fires but in truth it was only one of a series of devastations the fires of ad and ad destroyed most of the city for example creating what is described by archaeologists as a fire destruction horizon this is the horizon of the city itself london burned in and rs fitter writing londons natural history after the second world war noted that the constant laying waste of large areas of the city must have made the aspect of medieval london often a good deal more like the blitzed london of than most people realise james popehennessy compiling a book on that wartime destruction found in the ruins of london churches a kind of continuity he recalled that the city fire of december did at one moment look like pepys famous description of the fire of the night sky lit by a wavering orange glare seemed to display an aura not at all unlike his bow of flame london seems to invite fire and destruction from the attacks of boudicca to those of the ira in the literature of the subject there are references to particularly incandescent areas arthur hardwicks memorable fires in london revealed watling street to be the region in the heart of the city that has always been a fiery one aldersgate and silver street have the reputation of the danger zone while areas such as cheapside and bread street have been repeatedly subject to flame wood street too has proved a notoriously fiery streetperhaps because of its nameand mysterious fires have broken out in paternoster square the area of st mary axe was destroyed in and then again in it is significant too that in the city of spectacle theatres continually go up in flame thirtyseven were destroyed in years from to providing an appropriately theatrical scene for those who flocked to watch them the nature of london fires has also been conceived in theatrical terms during one conflagration in paternoster square in the flames burst through the roof and brilliantly illuminated the city a fire two years later in the charterhouse sent out a fiery glow as though the sun shone over everything london bridge has been destroyed by fire as have the royal exchange the guildhall and the houses of parliament in the nine years from to there were fires in the city yielding an average of per annum or about three in two days in the city of there were some fires in the great london region of occurred primary and secondary fires in there were approximately chimney fires in such events more fires spring up in december and fewer in april than in any other months friday is the worst day of the week for conflagrations and saturday the best the most hazardous time is ten in the evening and the most benign seven in the morning some fires begin with arson but most by accidenta great conflagration of consuming more than a hundred houses in the streets and passages by exchange alley and killing a dozen people began through the servant leaving a candle burning in the shed whilst she was listening to a band performing at the swan tavern an engraving of the fiery ruins was promptly issued by a printer in scalding alley yet fire can also reveal the forgotten or neglected history of the city the site of winchester palace on the south bank of the thames was first uncovered after a fire at bankside mustard mills the remains of a thirteenthcentury barbican or watchtower were revealed in after a fire in st martins court ludgate flame can recreate therefore as well as destroy it is perhaps significant that in london folklore a dream of fire denotes health and happiness or marriage with the object of the affections a nineteenthcentury correspondent of le temps noticed that in comparison with parisians londoners showed astonishing promptitude in their reaction to the call of fire fire it was the war cry of the city in firstcentury london vigiles or bucket boys patrolled the city by night already there was some fascination or mystery concerned with fire since they were known for their liveliness and devilry their organised system of watching decayed in succeeding centuries but it can be inferred that the early medieval wards assumed responsibility for locating and putting out fires in their vicinity the next attempt at precaution was the simple curfew or couvrefeu on the ringing of the evening bell resounding all over the eleventhcentury city all fires were supposed to be covered and the ashes raked if a fire did rage then the bells of the churches rang backwards to spread the alarm it was as if the devil had suddenly reemerged in the roar of the flames barrels of water were kept outside the larger houses and by the twelfth century there were elaborate regulations for the quenching of the flames and the pulling down of burning thatch in the fifteenth century it was decreed that each new sheriff and alderman within a month of taking up office shall cause new buckets to be made of leather for the quenching of fire the successor of the humble bucket was a kind of syringe or squirt which was in turn followed by an early pumping device this was pulled by the firemen calling out their familiar cry of hi hi hi and has been termed the first fire engine to reach the streets of london it was succeeded in the early seventeenth century by an engine or instrument which with the help of tenne men to labor could pump more water than five hundred men with the helpe of bucketts and laydels this was the engine celebrated by dryden in annus mirabilis he described the spectacle of the flames and how streets grow throngd and busy as by day the impression again is of fire as some alternative sun flooding the streets with light one of the earliest fire insurance companies named itself the sun and its mark can still be seen on many houses fire by a sudden leap of metaphor then becomes the source of energy and power as if it represented the sporadic and violent irruption of the citys own heated life one of the greatest maps of london horwoods plan of was dedicated to the phoenix fire office in lombard street which had risen soon after the fire of again it is a mark of the importance of those who deal with fire in the capital curiously enough the first chief executive of the phoenix was a mr stonestreet over the centuries the shouts of the firemen were replaced by handbells then by mechanical and electric bells then came the siren replaced in turn by a complex system of sound including the twotone the wail and the yelp the first firemen themselves were placed in colourful regalia one company for example was arrayed in blue jackets with elaborate gold cuffs and gold braiding with black kneebreeches white stockings and gold garters on days of ceremony they marched with silver staffs and badges they were themselves fired by dutyhearts aglow as hilaire belloc appropriately put it such was their prestige that the headquarters of many fire offices were described as resembling in design highlyenriched palaces two children pass the phoenix fire office in a novel by edith nesbit fire one says for altars i suppose yes for the great sacrificial altar of london fire became one of the principal characteristics of the city it was even known as the fire king throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the fires grew in size and frequency and perhaps as a consequence the crowds became larger a conflagration at tooley street took more than a month to die away the house of commons was destroyed by fire in which provoked some of the most picturesque london paintings the westminster burning became according to the authors of london in paint the single most depicted event in nineteenth century london attracting to the scene a host of engravers watercolourists and painters among them constable and turner these artists recognised that in the heart of the flame they might also evoke the spirit and presence of the city itself there are reports of great crowds assembling to view the destruction of the crystal palace in as well as of many dock fires and warehouse fires where the ghost of victorian conflagrations was said to walk the consuming appetite for fire among the citizens did not diminish until the blitz of on the night of december the raid timed when the water of the thames was at its lowest some fires were burning at the same time in the city it was said then that the great fire had truly come again that great fire one of the most formative events of the citys history may be dated from september when pepys and his wife were horribly frightened to see young killigrew come in to a place of public resort with a great many more young sparks these young sparks represented the fiery youth of the city samuel and elizabeth pepys returned to their house in seething lane where at three on the following morning they were roused by a maid with news of a fire in the city pepys saw some flames at the lower end of a neighbouring street and then went back to sleep the fire had started one hour before at the house of the kings baker mr farryner in pudding lane at the later enquiry farryner insisted that before retiring to bed he had gone through every room and found no fire but in one chimney where the room was paved with bricks which fire he diligently raked up in embers the cause of the great fire was never discovered it just happened the month of august had been unusually hot characterised by an extraordinary drought so that the thatch and timber of the neighbouring buildings in the narrow streets and alleys were already halfburned the fire found friendly territory in other words and was further aided by a strong southeast wind it was carried onward from pudding lane towards fish street and london bridge then down through thames street into old swan lane st lawrence lane and dowgate everyone in a position to do so took to the water with boats lighters and skiffs carrying the goods of their houses threatened by the flames pepys also took to the river where with his face in the wind he was almost burned with a shower of fire drops he observed that most households took with them a pair of virginals he also noticed that the poor pigeons were loth to leave their houses but hovered about the windows and balconies till they burned their wings and fell down the fire was now out of control burning steadily to the north and to the west pepys eventually took refuge from the incendiary river in an alehouse on the other bank and there saw the fire grow in corners and upon steeples and between churches and houses as far as we could see up the hill of the city in a most horrid malicious bloody flame not like the fire flame of an ordinary fire it was then that he noticed the arch or bow of flame about a mile in width which popehennessy was to observe during the fireraids of that night the fire spread from cheapside down to the thames along cornhill tower street fenchurch street gracechurch street and to baynards castle it had gone so far down cheapside that it took hold of st pauls which by chance was surrounded by wooden scaffolding john evelyn who walked among the streets even at this hour noted that the noise and cracking and thunder of the impetuous flames the shrieking of women and children the hurry of people the fall of towers houses and churches was like an hideous storm and the air all about so hot and inflamed that at last one was not able to approach it the unprepared citizens were left bewildered they made no attempt to put out the fires and simply fled those who remained of the lower sort stole whatever they could take from the burning dwellings those who did not take refuge upon the river itself now choked with smoke and deluged by fire drops went into the surrounding fields of islington finsbury and highgate watched and wept by the following day monday the fire had spread down ludgate into fleet street and had burned down the old bailey newgate and billingsgate were gone while the molten lead from the roof of st pauls ran through the streets glowing with fiery redness so as no horse or man was able to tread on them by now the smoke stretched for fifty miles so that those leaving the city could travel for hours in its shadow that night several fires met together one came down cornhill and one down threadneedle street which uniting together in turn met two separate fires coming from walbrook and bucklersbury john evelyn remarked that all these four journeying together break into one great flame at the corner of cheapside with such a dazzling light and burning heat and roaring noise by the fall of so many houses together that was very amazing it was as if some ancient spirit of fire had reared its head in the very middle of the city by tuesday the wind had abated and the fire stopped at the top of fetter lane in holborn the deeds of the mitre tavern at the other end of fetter lane described a boundary by the tree where the fire of london divides the fire was still raging in the north at cripplegate and in the east by the tower but the authorities advised by charles ii who had always evinced a strong interest in fireprevention were able to stop its growth by blowing up with gunpowder houses in its path on thursday john evelyn once more walked the streets of his city now a ruin through the late fleet street ludgate hill by st pauls cheapside exchange bishopsgate aldersgateall gone he found himself clambering over heaps of yet smoking rubbish and frequently mistaking where i was this was also the experience of londoners after the bombing raids of their city was suddenly unknown and unrecognisable it had become an alien place as if they had woken from some dream to encounter a quite different reality nor could anyone have possibly known where he was wrote evelyn but by the ruins of some church or hall that had some remarkable tower or pinnacle remaining the ground under his feet was so hot that he could hardly walk the iron gates and bars of the prisons had all melted the stones of the buildings were all calcined and rendered a brilliant white the water left in fountains was still boiling while subterranean cellars wells and dungeons were belching forth dark clouds of smoke fivesixths of the city were thus consumed the area of devastation encompassing a mile and a half in length and half a mile in breadth fifteen of the citys twentysix wards were thoroughly destroyed and in total streets containing houses were razed eightynine churches had gone and four of the seven city gates were reduced to ashes and powder it was officially reported that only six people were killed one a watchmaker in shoe lane where on excavation his bones with his keys were found perhaps the most notable image of this extraordinary fire was that from a clergyman the revd t vincent in a book entitled gods terrible advice to the city by plague and fire he too had seen the dreadful bow of light across the city he had witnessed the burning of the guildhall which stood the whole body of it together in view for several hours together after the fire had taken it without flames i suppose because the timber was such solid oak in a bright shining coal as if it had been a palace of gold or a great building of burnished brass in the aftermath of the great fire emerged a yellowflowering plant known as london rocket and in and it grew very abundantly on the ruins around st pauls it was seen again in just outside the city boundary it is the true flower of fire the monument erected on the site of the fires first emergence is also a form of rocket or vehicle of fire it was first proposed that a statue of the king or a great phoenix should be placed upon its summit but it was eventually agreed that an urn of flames known as the blaze should furnish the column daniel defoe deciphered the object as a great candle with the urn as handsome gilt flame there were many representations of the events of those five days of fire not least a series of long poems which can be found in an anthology entitled london in flames london in glory the burning city is severally compared to rome to carthage to sodom and to troy the classical gods are depicted as wandering through the burning streets together with virgil and jezebel as the spectacle of flaming london conjures up images of dead or dying civilisations in past ages of the world the painted images of the fire were equally ostentatious although some of them seem literally to have been sketched at the very time of the blaze itself there are sober studies including those of hollar showing a true and exact prospect of the famous citty of london before the autumn of together with the same as it appeareth now after the sad calamitie and destruction by fire it was sketched from the south bank of the river and it is possible to see through the ruins right into cheapside itself but most works were in the style of conflagration painting according to london in paint which found their inspiration in biblical or mythic city fires two of the most famous paintings after jan groffier the elder depict the towers and portcullis of ludgate in flames as if it were the entrance to hell itself there may be another explanation for the appearance of ludgate however since the area beside it was considered an artists quarter in the middle of the seventeenth century there are many small scenes and episodes reflected in these paintings the woman running with wild face and arms outstretched from the encroaching fire the man carrying a bundle of silver plate upon his head the carts and horses being driven in a great crowd towards the open fields but the most striking image is that of a man carrying a child on his shoulders against a backdrop of flame it was reemployed by blake doré and other artists as a true representation of the mysteries and sufferings of london the great fire was not simply the inspiration therefore of contemporary artists for over two hundred years it remained the most arresting image of the seventeenth century philippe jacques de loutherbourg a great scenic designer in the london theatres painted his own version at the end of the eighteenth century and in the following century the great fire was recreated every night at the surrey gardens but the conflation of the city and fire goes deeper than theatre or spectacle to panizzi in the midnineteenth century london had the appearance of a city that had somehow already been burned in night and day virginia woolf describes it as eternally burnt it seemed that no darkness would ever settle upon those lamps as no darkness had settled upon them for hundreds of years it seemed dreadful that the town should blaze for ever in the same spot in a frenchman believed the entire capital to be a temple of fireworshippers his companion on this urban pilgrimage arthur machen went on to describe all the fires of london reflected dimly in the sky as if far away awful furnace doors were opened mirbeau talked of london in terms of mystery of the conflagration of the furnace while monet at the end of the nineteenth century wished to depict the sun setting in an enormous ball of fire behind parliament in some of that artists paintings in fact london seems to breathe and live within an atmosphere of fire surrounding all streets and buildings with the same unearthly glow by the midnineteenth century the sky above london was notable for the glowing atmosphere that hangs over the capital for miles the brick kilns on the perimeter of the city in that period created a ring as if of stage fire while the great dust mountains inside the capital had the appearance of volcanoes it was a city where fires can scarcely be kept under while in twentiethcentury terms it is characterised as an urban heat island london was popularly known as the great oven and in the s vs pritchett confessed to the sensation of being smoked and kippered in the depths of the city when the fire does eventually go out the city is forbidding blackened and relentless some charred monument of eternity filled with what keats called the burden of mystery it became clear after the great fire that fire itself must be controlled the twin visitations of flame and plague had been interpreted by moralists as the handiwork of a god enraged by the sinfulness and dissipation of london but there were others including christopher wren and edmond halley who began to question the wisdom of placing all responsibility for its disasters on fate or divine displeasure the royal society had been established in london in and the two visitations prompted its members to find scientific or objective causes for such violent events in the name of reasonwhat is simple solid sensibleit was hoped that london consciousness might be changed so that in future ages such pestilences and conflagrations might be averted the greatest effect of the fire paradoxically was to promote the advancement of science even before the end of september according to a quotation in london in flames london in glory men begin now everywhere to recover their spirits again and think of repairing the old and rebuilding a new city specifically it seemed an opportunity to exorcise the rebellious humours the horrid sacriledges and gingling extravagances of the previous age this refers to the civil war and to the execution of charles i but it also suggests that extravagant piety and superstitious practiceprecisely the citizens responses to the plague as documented by defoewere no longer permitted it was to be a new city in every sense after the fire two plans of a london reconstructed after the great fire of one by christopher wren and the other by john evelyn their theoretical and hypothetical city had no chance against the twin forces of tradition and commerce which obstinately recreated london in its former image chapter a london address the great fire had stopped by fetter lane which for most of its existence has been border territory it runs from fleet street to holborn and the ancient route is now lined with twentiethcentury airconditioned officeblocks and some nineteenthcentury survivals in the stretch of fetter lane which leads directly out of fleet street with on the respective corners a bookshop and a computer supplier is cliffords inn the oldest inn of chancery and once the most important edifice in the street rebuilt now and partitioned into offices and apartments it is situated beside a modern restaurant the café rouge and opposite a new drinking establishment called the hogshead the judicial air of the lane has not entirely disappeared however since beside cliffords inn is a building which contains the technology and construction court this stretch of the lane is continually busy with traffic in particular with taxis decanting into fleet street upward from this site towards holborn the lane divides and the eastern fork is turned into new fetter lane but the old fetter lane still pursues its course northward albeit now with difficulty its whole eastern side has been demolished as the foundations of taller and greater buildings are sunk within the ever receptive london earth the former public record office is still visible to the west of the statue of john wilkes down rolls buildings while closer to holborn the mucky duck and the printers devil have survived as public houses three midnineteenthcentury houses remain as if they were some ancient terrace preserving the memory of the street and their ground floors are now occupied by coffee shops and sandwich bars and where did fetter lane get its name john stow who knew it well believed that fetter was so called of fewters or idle people lying there as in a way leading to gardens others however have suggested that the word is derived from the norman defaytor defaulter some prefer another french origin in foutre blackguard but there are other possibilities fetter may derive from the feuriers or feltmakers who are deemed to have inhabited the street in the fifteenth century or it may spring from the name of the landlord viteri or viter who lived there a century earlier more ingenious antiquarians have in turn suggested that the name sprang from fetor or offensive smell on the face of it unlikely in an area surrounded by gardens and orchardsunless the fewters or foutres or defaytors were in some way responsible for the stink another connection has been made with frater brother which was a characteristic address between the men of law who frequented the area a more simple connection has been made with the workshops of the street which manufactured fetters or lance vests for the knights templar who also congregated in the vicinity the confusion and speculation will never be resolved and the obscurity of fetter lanes derivation serves only to demonstrate the unknowability of many london names it is as if the city was striving to conceal its origins yet as gk chesterton once remarked the narrowest street possesses in every crook and twist of its intention the soul of the man who built it perhaps long in his grave every brick has as human a hieroglyph as if it were a graven brick of babylon every slate on the roof is as educational a document as if it were a slate covered with addition and subtraction sums it might also be suggested that every object every doorway throws a light upon the ancient territory of which the present fetter lane is now the custodian a roman urn filled with coins was found beneath the surface of the lane confirming stows observation that an old roman road had been located in the immediate vicinity there was a wooden bridge over the fleet here too so the early inhabitants of fetter lane and its environs had the advantage of living beside a swiftly flowing river a ninthcentury sword handle was also discovered within the depths of the lane its manufacture and material were of fine quality indicating that it was employed for ceremonial rather than sanguinary purposes it may then have some connection with a charter of by which king edgar of wessex granted the neighbouring land to the monks of westminster abbey one boundary of which was marked by a line parallel to fetter lane throughout its history fetter lane acted as a boundary or has been recorded as frontier territory it was where the great fire stopped and it marks the area where the citys influence ceases it is also the area where two parishes st andrews holborn and st dunstans in the west meet we may find in turn that it has attracted those who live upon the edge at the beginning of the fourteenth century its present contours emerged in it was known as the neu strete but in it is styled as a new lane called faiteres lane the earliest records suggest however that it had already acquired an ambiguous reputation there is a report on one emmade brakkele a harlot living in fetter lane a keeper of a house harbouring prostitutes and sodomites was noted as living in fayters lane yet it must already have been a mixed neighbourhood in a thoroughly medieval spirit since there is a tradition of an inne or court in fewter lane and the fact that cliffords inn was established here in suggests that some original foundations may have been maintained here even before fetter lane appeared in the public records the religious establishments in the immediate vicinity will also have provided some measure of extramural control with st dunstans to the south st andrews and ely place to the north in john blakwell cetizen of london purchased with his wife property in faytourslane and henry vi is recorded as collecting rents from the dwellings there this in itself is not necessarily a guarantee of respectability but these bare records suggest that throughout the medieval period it was a wellknown and welldocumented subarbe of london by the early fifteenth century there was a famous tavern on the corner of fetter lane with holborn known as le swan on le hope which contained rooms for travellers there were complaints about its overhanging roof and some barriers which had been erected outside the inn and so distracted the roadway but it survived until the middle of the eighteenth century under the revised name of the black swan a few yards down the lane there now stands the mucky duck as a plaintive reminder of a more graceful presence on a midsixteenthcentury map fetter lane is clearly marked with fifteen houses down its eastern side and twelve down its western the topography may not be entirely accurate but it is in contrast to liver lane leather lane to the north which proceeds among gardens and open fields at the northern end of fetter lane barnards inn can be seen and down towards fleet street cliffords inn is already visible a stone archway spanning the lane almost at its midway point has also been marked the map is less than accurate in one respect however since it does not convey the continual encroachment of new buildings in and around the lane itself on land once owned by st bartholomews ten tenements with gardens were erected by and by a further thirteen illegal new houses had been constructed neither does the map reveal the narrow yards and alleys like fleur de lys alley and crane court which ran off the main thoroughfare and which exist still like other areas of london it had its share in fires and executions both entries to the lane were in fact customary sites for the gallows there are records of catholic recusants in being hanged and quartered at the fleet street end it is according to one catholic history catholic london by wd newton one of our sacred spots the melancholy catholic composer john dowland who died in had been living in fetter lane in two plotters against parliament were hanged at the holborn end having arranged their conspiracy in a lodging in the lane and for two centuries this spot was often a place of execution it has been the site of death in more than one form however there was a distillery on the corner of fetter lane and holborn in the mideighteenth century it was on the site of the black swan formerly le swan on le hope and so had a long association with drink during the most violent days of the gordon riots in with the mobs cry of no popery rising through the streets it was rumoured that the owner of the distillery was a catholic so it was ransacked and fired with fatal results the gutters of the street and every crack and fissure in the stones ran with scorching spirit which being dammed up by busy hands overflowed the road and pavement and formed a great pool into which the people dropped down dead by dozens this account is written by charles dickens who like many londoners was obsessed with fiery death but his version is authenticated by several contemporary sources so by fetter lane some stooped with their lips to the brink and never raised their heads again others sprang up from their fiery draught and danced half in mad triumph and half in the agony of suffocation until they fell and steeped their corpses in the liquor that had killed them others leaving the distillery with their clothes on fire actually rolled in the spirit mistaking it for water until they became themselves the dust and ashes of the flames they had kindled and strewed the public streets of london they became part of fetter lane there have been other fires and explosions over the centuries curiously enough one upon april was believed to be the consequence of a papist plot the hanging of the recusants and the firing of the distillery then become part of a morbid catholic trinity then again in just after the neighbouring church of st andrews holborn had been new glazed to remove all signs of popish superstition a large explosion of gunpowder in fetter lane caused all its windows to shatter and fall by use of gunpowder too the great fire was quenched in the vicinity the fire court established to adjudicate claims of ownership sat in cliffords inn itself so fetter lane became a famous boundary with its legal inns beside its taverns and its churches beside the houses of pimps it always possessed an intermediary status the more dubious healers lived here in the seventeenth century one bromfield at the blue balls in plow yard fetter lane advertised pills against all diseases samuel johnsons friend a poor apothecary named levett met a woman of bad character by a coalshed in fetter lane and was duped into marrying her he was then nearly imprisoned for her debts the whole story according to johnson being as marvellous as any page of the arabian nights the lane was also the haunt of pawnbrokers to which reference is made in one seventeenthcentury drama barrys ramalley take thou these books go both to the brokers in fetter lane the allusion to books is appropriate in another sense since fetter lane has become associated with several london writers henry peacham the author of the art of living in london dwelled here michael drayton the author of polyolbion lived at no thomas hobbes according to john aubreys brief lives lived most part in fetterlane where he writ or finished his book de porpore in latin and then in english he preferred his fetter lane life to any in the country where the want of learned conversation was a great inconvenience john dryden lived at the corner of fetter lane and fleurdelys court in one of the houses newly fashioned after the fire he remained here for nine years according to the dictionary of national biography and for a while his neighbour across the street was another dramatist thomas otway who died of drink in an adjacent tavern charles lamb attended school in an alley off the lane coleridge lectured in the lane and at different times samuel butler lionel johnson and virginia woolf lived in cliffords inn lemuel gulliver the hero of swifts novel is also recorded as having dwelled in fetter lane one of the most notorious if now least known residents of fetter lane was isaac praisegod barebone he pursued his trade as a leatherseller on the corner of fleet street which by some atavistic remembrance may have prompted george eliot in the nineteenth century to remark that fetter lane had something about it that goes with the smell of leather but barebone was also a fiery and assiduous anabaptist preacher who in the s stirred up various tumults in the neighbourhood with his disorderly preachment pratings and prattlings at oliver cromwells instigation he entered parliament as a member for the city of london even though it was christened by its enemies as barebones parliament he did not speak in the chamber he was imprisoned after the restoration but on his release returned to his old parish his burial is registered in st andrews holborn the church to the north of fetter lane but barebones presence was not the only element of dissent in that street a group of sixteenthcentury puritans met in a carpenters yard midway down the eastern side of the lane during the reign of mary their persecutor they prayed in a simple sawpit and in later years an anonymous pamphlet our oldest chapel declared that the site was regarded by dissenters with feelings akin to veneration it contrasts strangely with the sacred spot of catholic veneration a few yards further south where the gallows was situated on the corner of fleet street and it is suggestive that one small london street can harbour contrasting spiritual memories in the reign of elizabeth i the puritans were permitted to build a wooden temple on the site of the sawpit then the presbyterians migrated to the location and erected a brick chapel on the same spot their interest in fetter lane like that of their nonconformist predecessors lay in secrecy and seclusion the chapel itself could only be reached through a long narrow passage known as goldsmith or goldsmiths court a seventeenthcentury map of fetter lane reveals that there were a number of such courts and small yards aligned to it so that its irrepressible life seemed to flow in all directions the chapel was also concealed by the continuous row of houses which even at that early date fringed the east of fetter lane while upon the other side tall buildings to the west effectually masked it from the notice of any passerby so in the middle of london it was possible to find seclusion yet the london mob knew the byways of the city very well and in the chapel was torched by rioters it was rebuilt but then adopted by the radical and sectarian moravian brethren who maintained their presence in the area for the next two centuries the wesleys worshipped here with the brethren and on the first day of john wesley recorded that the power of god came mightily upon us insomuch that many cried out for exceeding joy and many fell to the ground so the sudden effusion of the holy ghost had touched a small court in fetter lane from where a revival spread into other parts of england other radicals and dissenters were drawn to the same place the conventicler richard baxter gave lectures in fetter lane there was a baptist congregation in black raven passage and another dissenters chapel in elim court between and fetter lane a number of moravians inhabited the area in community houses in nevills court and elsewhere they were living on the borders of orthodox faith just as they were living on the borders of the city certain groups and people are undoubtedly attracted to a certain locality the topography of which is strangely analogous to their own situation that is why political as well as religious radicals were drawn to the same area a jacobin and member of the london corresponding society thomas evans established the centre of his operations in plough court fetter lane a public house in fetter lane the falcon was also under surveillance as a centre for subversive political activity evans himself who lived in fetter lane throughout the s laced his revolutionary zeal with strong drink and financed his activities by selling ballads and pornography in that he was perfectly congruent with his equally ambiguous surroundings he was elusive enough to have adopted numerous professions among them pornographer printer coffeehouse keeper and paintcolourer all trades that were associated with fetter lane itself so that in another sense he becomes as protean and as shiftless as the lane is it possible then that certain inhabitants acquire their identity or temperament from the circumstances of their immediate locale other names can be enlisted in light of this radical connection tom paine whose rights of man became the unofficial bible of eighteenthcentury radicalism lived at no fetter lane william cobbett wrote and published his political register from no fetter lane keir hardie lived at no nevills court off fetter lane at the beginning of the twentieth century for s d a week he lodged in one of the oldest houses in london a latemedieval halftimbered fivestorey tenement building so he was inhabiting the history of fetter lane although perhaps unaware that cobbett and paine had trod the same street before him as if in implicit homage to that past the statue of john wilkes the great london radical now stands at the place where fetter lane and new fetter lane converge it has the incidental merit of being the only crosseyed statue in london adding to the ambiguous status of its locale in the nineteenth century the lane suffered a fate similar to many other streets of the period it was overwhelmed by the size of london seeming somehow to become smaller and darker those who live in fetter lane and the adjoining streets one church report stated are of the poorest and most irreligious class the neighbourhood is simply a labyrinth of business premises this was the condition of many streets close to the ancient centre of london the inns were demolished in their place were constructed a workhouse and a great general records office of the buildings which were to be destroyed by that office an anonymous surveyor commented that those in fetter lane are principally occupied by persons not concerned in lucrative business and it is believed that none of the leases are for a longer period than years it was always the character of fetter lane to have a migrant population except for the moravian settlers who knew that on this earth there is no abiding city the pattern is one of transience and yet in the city there are always other patterns within the general pattern in a street directory of there are no fewer than nine taverns listed the relatively large number in so relatively short a street is an indication of early nineteenthcentury london but it also suggests elements of a mobile and perhaps anonymous population in the commercial directory of there is a preponderance of printers publishers stationers engravers and booksellerssome nineteen altogetherrivalled only by the proprietors of coffee houses hotels and eatinghouses these are all trades reliant upon passing taste and what might be considered news it might be imagined therefore that fetter lane was not a stable or a settled place but one which participated in the citys usual uproar in a street directory of no fewer than three oil and colour men are listed in the post office directory of are two painters and an oil amp colorman and in an oil and colour warehouse appears in one of his sketches charles dickens describes a certain mr augustus cooper of fetterlane as in the oil and colour line dickens may have discerned a remarkable coincidence of trade alternatively he was somehow divining the spirit of the lane in his usual fashion he also mentions that over the way from augustus cooper was the gasfitters curiously enough in the directory for appears a brass finisher amp gasfitter in that charmed urban space where reality and imagination mingle it may also be noted that in a street where lemuel gulliver was a surgeon two other surgeons are listed in the directory a sketch of showing the west side of fetter lane reveals that many houses were of seventeenthcentury date but it is also clear that the thoroughfare was lined with groundfloor shops one representative section in a street directory of manifested in sequence a butcher a dairy an ironmonger a toolmaker a watchmaker an electric bell manufacturer a pub a baker a printer a coffee house another pub another coffee house a hairdresser and a mapmounter yet down the courts and alleysblewitts buildings bartletts buildings churchyard alley and many othersthere were tenants and lodgers who were often registered as poor cant pay or wont pay in the local rate books in nevills court where keir hardie lodged once spacious houses were divided into tenements some predated the great fire while others were built immediately after the conflagration but they were characterised by small front gardens in a report for the london topographical society in walter bell noted how well tended these gardens were and suggested that it is the poor man who keeps intact for us this fragment of londons older self in that sense the vicinity was reclaiming its sixteenthcentury identity as a place of straggling courts and gardens but in the early twentieth century you rub your eyes and wonder can this really be the citythis hidden place where people live their lives and tend their flowers and die it is false that no one dies in the city in fetter lane they do not die they move on it is clear from the records of the parish and the post office that businesses remained only for a short period and then dissolved at no over a period of seventy years there was in turn a razormaker an eatinghouse a beer retailer a coffee room a printer and a dairy man all passing away into the fabric and texture of the street in the dwelling today on the ground floor can be found tuckers sandwich bar the pattern of small businesses persisted until the second world war when in firebombs razed the area when it arose again fetter lane reasserted itself as a street of stationers printers and cafés but all the inhabitants had gone now the remaining courts and alleys are lined with office accommodation and business premises while in the lane itself the sandwich bars are a present reminder of the coffee rooms and eatinghouses which were once so familiar a presence but the principal sights and sounds are those of demolition and rebuilding in this lane of perpetual change chapter to build anew in many of the citizens immediately returned to the smoking ruins in order to discover where their houses had once stood they then laid claim to the area by erecting some kind of temporary shelter on the very day that the fire was extinguished charles ii was informed that some persons are already about to erect houses againe in the citty of london upon their old foundations three days later the king issued a proclamation to the citizens in which he promised that rebuilding would proceed quickly but declared that no new work could begin until order and direction had been introduced he then went on to formulate certain principles the chief of which was that all new dwellings were to be built of brick or stone certain streets such as cheapside and cornhill were to be of such breadth as may with gods blessing prevent the mischief that one side may suffer if the other be on fire which was the case lately in cheapside the monarch also showed some concern for the health of his subjects by declaring that all those trades which are carried on by smoak such as brewers and dyers should inhabit together certain schemes had already been propounded most notably by wren and evelyn in which the reconstruction of london was planned upon a grand and elaborate scale wren proposed a series of intersecting avenues on a european model evelyns new city resembled a giant chessboard dominated by twelve squares or piazzas none was accepted none acceptable the city as always reasserted itself along its ancient topographical lines but first the work of demolition had to begin those who had lost their trades or who were otherwise unemployed were called into city service the ruins had to be levelled and the debris carted away the smoking streets must be cleared and opened up while the quays were once again made safe for trade makeshift markets were established on the perimeters of the city while the more enterprising bankers and merchants set up their businesses in the area by bishopsgate which had not been touched by the flames by the end of the year the tradesmen of the royal exchange for example had removed to gresham college there was in one sense a new and exhilarating atmosphere of freedom debts and property mortgages and buildings were destroyed by the fire in equal measure yet against this financial cleansing there must be put the loss of stock and of goods the spices and the wine the oil and the cloth all destroyed in the warehouses and manufactories which contained them it was a sign of the citys vitality however that within a year the busy round of trade had been resumed it was still the same city in another sense thieves and footpads found the new conditions good for their own trade and there are many people found murdered and carried into the vaults among the ruins this additional detail prompts further speculations what happened to those prisoners who had before the fire been inhabiting such vaults many of the compters and gaols were below the surface of the city and it is hard to believe that all the prisoners were liberated and escaped with their lives is it not more likely that they burned or were suffocated to death the stated mortality was six but that extraordinarily low figure may in fact obfuscate the loss of life due to official negligence did many of those incarcerated escape as their prison bars melted and what of the others a committee of six was established to direct the rebuilding of the city one of its members was christopher wren who knew already that his idealised version of london was not to be achieved a fire court was set up to adjudicate all the claims and disputes which arose over the ownership of land and property by february of the following year parliament had enforced what the commission suggested certain streets were widened but not surprisingly very few alterations were made king street was formed and a small thoroughfare widened into queen street so that the guildhall could be approached directly from the thames a more noticeable change however was enforced upon the size and fabric of the houses themselves they were to be built of brick or stone as the king had declared and there were to be four classes or types of houses for better regulation uniformity and gracefulness those on the principal streets were to be four storeys in height for example while in lanes and bystreets two storeys were considered sufficient in other respects the old lines of the city were to be renewed then the work began the citizens and private householders were compelled to rely upon their own resources while money for public works such as the rebuilding of the churches was funded by a tax on seacoal by the spring of the lines of the streets had been staked and the entire country was advertised for all persons who are willing to serve and furnish this city with timber brick lime stone glass slates and other materials for building thus ensued one of the great changes in londons population it can be assumed that many of those who had lived in the city before the fire did not return to the scene of devastation some migrated to the country districts others travelled to the united states in both instances the presence of relatives and the possibility of work affected their decision but once the rebuilding of the city began thousands of new people were drawn within its orbit there were earthmovers and brickmakers carters and moulders who dwelled just outside the walls in addition hundreds of hawkers and traders moved into the city which had lost half of its markets and most of its shops and there of course came the builders who took advantage of the situation to run up whole streets of houses roger north has described how the most celebrated of these speculators nicholas barbon eventually transformed part of london by casting of ground into streets and small houses and to augment their number with as little front as possible barbon understood the virtues of simplicity and standardisationit was not worth his while to deal little he once remarked that a bricklayer could do but the bricklayers had already been heavily employed within two years of the fire twelve hundred houses had been completed and in the following year another sixteen hundred it was not quite the rapid and vigorous process which some historians have assumed and for some years london had all the aspects of a ruined city yet gradually it was rising once again john ogilbys map of only eleven years after the great fire shows its new appearance most of the city has been rebuilt although some of the churches are missing and a proposed development of the quays beside the thames never occurred the new brick narrowfronted houses are drawn as square rectangles already they are packed tightly together making room for lanes and small alleys which thread among them many of these houses have small gardens or courtyards behind them but the general impression is once more of dense and constricted life if you were to walk eastwards down leadenhall street one hundred yards from billiter lane to the junction with fenchurch street you would pass on the lefthand side no fewer than seven small lanes or alleyscategorised by john strype as indifferent good or small nasty and beggarly which were either simple deadends or issued into tiny courtyards much of the area is shaded grey to mark small dwellings of brick and stone ogilbys map reveals the steady spread of london the area around lincolns inn in the western district has been marked out for streets and houses to the north in clerkenwell there are already many new lanes and courts nicholas barbon created essex street devereux court red lion square buckingham street villiers street and bedford row with his skills as a builder and developer he was surpassed only by nash in his influence upon the appearance of london the pragmatism and financial opportunism of barbon seem subtly to suit the nature and atmosphere of the city which he did so much to extend both prospered together partly as a result of his activities wealthier merchants and businessmen moved away from the smell and noise of the older trading areas it was a means of escaping from the fumes steams and stinks of the whole easterly pyle much of the development had in fact taken place before the fire hastened its progress the piazza of covent garden had been planned and rebuilt in it was followed by leicester fields four years later the construction of seven dials linked the churches of st giles and st martin both in the fields great russell street was completed by in the year before the fire bloomsbury square was laid out by the process of western expansion had spread as far as red lion square and st jamess square the principle of these squares lay in the creation of what john evelyn called a little town which in theory was not so different from the independent sokes of anglosaxon london controlled by one great lord in the seventeenth century a lord of the manor such as lord southampton who owned bloomsbury might realise that there was money to be earned from his land he himself would live in one of the residences upon his estate but the rest was divided into units which were then leased to speculative builders who constructed the housing before letting or releasing it after ninetynine years the houses became the property of the landlord the other features of the squares lay in their civic aspect they were in the best circumstances regarded as small communities with church and market attached to their development it seemed to be a way of creating an attractive and humane city outside the old walls when the squares were first erected they were considered to be in macaulays words one of the wonders of england combining convenience and gentility the regularity and uniformity of these squares so unlike the baroque vistas of paris or of rome might have been derived from the example of old monastery courtyards or convent gardens with which london was once familiar to walk through queen square russell square torrington square and bedford square was to sense that the traditions of the middle ages had been handed down and that the tranquillity of the ecclesiastical establishments had been carried westward yet it is never wise to underestimate the atavistic elements of london life even as it grows beyond all of its old boundaries expansion takes place in waves with a sudden movement and roar succeeded by a calm the city will on one occasion brush against an area or on another colonise it wholly leicester fields and soho square for example were already so close to the burgeoning capital that no attempt at creating a graceful public or communal space was ever made in this context too it is important to note that the restless movement of the city was in the words of john summerson established upon the trade cycle rather than the changing ambitions and policies of rulers and administrators for a while the city stopped to the west at what is now new bond street but what was then an open field building had come to a temporary halt on the southern side of oxford street which was little more than a deep hollow road filled with sloughs and bordered by hedges regent street was then a solitude and golden square previously employed as a plague pit was a field not to be passed without a shudder by any londoner of that age the new squares did not necessarily remain models of civic or communal harmony for very long macaulay notes that by the end of the seventeenth century the centre of lincolns inn field was an open space where the rabble congregated every evening and where rubbish was shot in every part of the area st jamess square became a receptacle for all the offal and cinders for all the dead cats and dead dogs of westminster at one time an impudent squatter settled himself there and built a shed for rubbish under the windows of the gilded saloons it is further evidence of the contrast and contrariness of london life but it is also suggestive of a city which was even then established upon a basic brutality and offensiveness it is tempting to think of the new squares as separate communities still surrounded by fields for example but in fact the fields themselves were being built upon at this end of town one resident of westminster complained whole fields go into new buildings and are turned into alehouses filled with necessitous people where most of the developments of the western suburbs of london were conducted by means of leasehold arrangements and governed by acts of parliament the extension of the eastern regions was confused and haphazard governed as it was by ancient statutes of the manors of stepney and hackney which provided for only short copyholds of thirtyone years thus from the beginning the expansion of the city at the east end remained unplanned and underdeveloped wapping and shadwell had taken shape ten years after the fire while spitalfields was almost completely built over by the end of the century mile end was emerging as a populous district while the bankside from ratcliffe to poplar was a continuous mean street of houses and of shops the ogilby map does not include the meaner streets of the east nor the confused development of the west instead it reveals what in his poem annus mirabilis dryden glorified as a city of more precious mold more great then humane now and more august new deified she from her fires does rise her widening streets on new foundations trust and opening into larger parts she flies a view of lambeth palace painted in the s reveals a distant prospect of westminster and the strand it is altogether a model of elegance with the spires of st clement danes and st gilesinthefields clearly visible together with stately representations of durham house and salisbury house if the artist had turned his eyes only slightly to the east he would have seen within the newly built city the tower of the reerected royal exchange which as the financial centre of london was naturally graced with the very first of the brandnew steeples the great steeple of st marylebow had also been rebuilt and was followed by that of st clement eastcheap and st peter upon cornhill st stephen walbrook and st michael crooked lane as well as those of fortyseven other churches designed by wren and his colleagues in wrens visionary design of london the great cathedral of st paul had been the central point from which the streets were to be extended and he tried to hold fast to his original conception of its grandeur and immensity he had found the old cathedral in ruins where pepys noted strange how the very sight of the stones falling from the top of the steeple do make me seasick as late as eight years after the fire the ancient edifice had been neither replaced nor restored london was still in part a ruined city but wren then began the task of demolishing the old walls with gunpowder and battering rams and the first stone was laid in the summer of thirtyfive years later wrens son in the presence of his father the master architect placed the highest stone of the lantern upon the cupola of the cathedral in order to mark its completion i build for eternity wren had said yet in that sentiment he was preempted by the poet felton who predicted that nothing would last as long as the stones of newgate crime and punishment a london hanging evoked by rowlandson the children in the crowd seem delighted by the spectacle and a mother carries her infant without the least disquiet it was often said by foreigners that londoners did not fear death chapter a newgate ballad within four years of the great fire newgate prison was near to completion rebuilt with a design which the london encyclopaedia describes as one of great magnificence and sumptuousness it was in a sense the very symbol of london it had stood on the same site since the twelfth century and was almost from its beginning an emblem of death and suffering it became a legendary place where the very stones were considered deathlike and it has inspired more poems dramas and novels than any other building in london its role as gateway also created elements of myth since it was the threshold from which prisoners left the earthly city and were dispatched to tyburn or smithfield or the gallows just beyond the walls of newgate itself it became associated with hell and its smell permeated the streets and houses beside it in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries newgate prison had begun to decay and to collapse upon itself sixtyfour prisoners died in an epidemic of gaol fever in while the various keepers were regularly charged with afflicting torture and unjust punishment upon the inmates jews falsely accused of circumcising christian children clippers and coiners and murderers were placed within deep underground dungeons where they were loaded with chains or confined in stocks a bequest of money by richard whittington ensured that the prison was completely rebuilt in but it soon reverted to its natural state of gloom and horror approximately three hundred prisoners were confined within the space of half an acre in a building divided into three sidesthe masters side for prisoners who could pay for food and drink the common side for impecunious debtors and felons and the press yard for prisoners of note it can be inferred then that the common side was the site of hardship and indignity the keepers of newgate had always been notorious for their violence and intemperance in james manning left the body of one of his prisoners in the thoroughfare causing a nuisance and great danger to the king who was passing there when he refused to remove it after several warnings and after his wife had spoken shameful words they were both taken to the compter two years later his successor was also imprisoned for a dreadful assault upon a female prisoner so the keepers snuffed up the contagion of brutality as well as that of gaol fever perhaps the most famous of these gaolers in the years before the fire was andrew alexander who in the reign of mary i hurried his protestant inmates to the fires of smithfield with the words rid my prison rid my prison one favoured prisoner who played the lute for alexander and his wife who do love music very well was granted the best lodgings in the prison but the conditions of the gaol could not be escaped the evil savours threw the poor gentleman into a burning ague alexander offered to keep him in his own parlour but it was near the kitchen and the smell of the meat was disagreeable the smell is preeminent in these accounts from the chronicles of newgate while in the dungeons themselves there was turbulence rioting disorders those who could afford liquor were continually drunk on sherry sack ambercoloured canary or liquorish ipocras while those imprisoned for their religious or political beliefs raved amid their shackles there are seditious preachings by fifth monarch men at newgate according to the records and prayers for all righteous blood while the prison was so overcrowded that the majority of prisoners had an infectious malignant fever it was a place of infamy and great distress where lice were the prisoners constant companions one inmate was forced to lie in a coffin for a bed while another spent fourteen days without light or fire living on half penny worth of bread a day here in eleven catholic monks were left standing and chained to pillars to die of starvation it was in this period that there first emerged the legend of the black doga walking spirit in the likenesse of a blacke dog gliding up and down the streets a little before the time of execution and in the night whilst the sessions continued some believed the creature to be an emanation of the miseries of twelfthcentury newgate when famine compelled certain prisoners to cannibalism others surmised that it was a being which walked in the name of service and office that it was in other words a phantom created by the wickedness of the gaolers by the early eighteenth century however making the black dog walk was the phrase used to designate the prisoners brutal treatment of new inmates the present ivycovered wall at the bottom of amen court close to the old sessions house yard is supposed still to be the haunt of this malign spirit in the sixteenth century however the black dog was only one of the many terrors of newgate an underground dungeon known as limbo was described as being full of horrors without light and swarming with vermin and creeping things this was the condemned hold beneath the gates which was a most fearful sad deplorable place they lie like swine upon the ground one upon another howling and roaringit was more terrible to me than death this is the constant refrain of those who had entered newgatebeing more full of horror than deathwhich of course marked one of the entrances to london itself when one prisoner imprisoned for his religious beliefs cried out i would not change my chain for my lord mayors great chain he was in his agony making the connection between the sufferings of newgate and the oppression of the city an anonymous drama of the early seventeenth century dick of devonshire contains the plea of a man as loaden with gyves shackles amp fetters as any thief that lay in newgate confirming the notion that it was a prison from which it was impossible to escape but it also became a symbol of brotherhood among thievesbothe shakeled in a fetteror as bardolph says to falstaff two and two newgate fashion and in dekkers satiromastix well walk arme in arme as tho we were leading one another to newgate it is in part a symbol of defiance under oppression and the prospect of death that is why one cry of the rogue or thief was newgate or victory the prison becomes the central token of authority and thus as we shall see the first object of london rioters who were determined to destroy the order of the city in that capacity too it has often been the object of fire and flame with the great fire itself as a notable token of wrath or vengeance so it rose again in embellished and decorated in a manner appropriate to one of the citys greatest public monuments there was even a basrelief model of richard whittingtons cat and for a while the prison was known popularly as the whit no more lucid demonstration could be given of its intimate connection with london it rose five storeys spanning the entry to newgate street from giltspur street and the steep incline of snow hill there were now five sides for various felons and debtors together with a newly designed press room the object of pressing to death was to extort confessions condemned holds a chapel and jack ketchs kitchen on arrival the prisoners were fettered and ironed passing under the gate to be led to their appropriate dungeon they passed on the left the keepers house beneath which was the hold for those condemned to hang a prisoner confined in this subterranean area which did not perhaps differ very much from the dungeon before the fire is quoted in anthony babingtons the english bastille as saying that there were some glimmerings of light by which you may know that you are in a dark opaque wild room entered by a hatch it was entirely constructed of stone with an open sewer running through the middle which diffused a stench that entered every corner fastened into the stone floor itself were hooks and chains to castigate and confine those who were stubborn and unruly immediately to the right of the gate was the drinking cellar this was run by a prisoner who was allowed a profit on sales since it was also below ground it was lit by candles placed in pyramidal candlesticks made of clay those inmates who could afford the prices were allowed to drink themselves into senselessness day or night with gin variously known as cockmycap killgrief comfort meatanddrink or washingandlodging one prisoner recalled that such wretchedness abounds there that the place has the exact aspect of hell itself beyond this cellar taproom going along newgate street were located a stone hall for common debtors and a stone hold for common felons these were virtually unlighted dungeons strewn with unutterable filth trampling on the floor the lice crawling under their feet made such a noise as walking on shells which are strewn over garden walks the rest of the prison rose upward for master prisoners and female prisoners so these were the quarters which greeted each new arrival a place which no physician would enter in the s boswell noticed the cells three rows of em four in a row all above each other they have double iron windows and within these strong iron rails and in these dark mansions are the unhappy criminals confined these dismal places stayed with him all that day newgate being upon my mind like a black cloud casanova briefly imprisoned there described it as an abode of misery and despair a hell such as dante might have conceived wilhelm meister crossing the press yard on a tour of inspection was attacked as by a swarm of harpies and had no means of escaping but to throw a handful of halfpence amongst them for which they scrambled with all the fury of a parcel of wild beasts while others who were shut up stretched forth their hands through the iron bars venting the most horrible cries this is the yard to which daniel defoe consigned moll flanders in his narrative of her adventures since the author himself spent some time incarcerated in newgate in his account bears the mark of genuine remembrance it is impossible to describe the terror of my mind when i was first brought in and when i looked round upon all the horrors of that dismal place the hellish noise the roaring swearing and clamour the stench and nastiness and all the dreadful afflicting things that i saw there joined to make the place seem an emblem of hell itself and a kind of an entrance into it in more than one passage however it is emphasised that the inmates by degrees grow accustomed to this hell so that it becomes not only tolerable but even agreeable with its inhabitants as impudently cheerful and merry in their misery as they were when out of it it is natural to me now one female prisoner declares i dont disturb myself about it this is of course an astute observation of newgate manners but it might perhaps be construed in the wider context of london itself in the company of this crew moll herself turned first stupid and senseless and then brutish and thoughtless until she becomes a mere newgatebird as wicked and as outrageous as any of them some inmates were far from thoughtlesshowever and contrived many ingenious plans of escape the great heroes of london have often been those who freed themselves from the constraints of newgate the greatest of them all jack sheppard escaped from confinement on six separate occasions for two centuries he remained a type or symbol of those who elude the practices of oppression with effrontery and bravery as well as skill it is worth noticing for example that a report of the childrens employment commission in the s remarked that poor london children who had never heard of moses or queen victoria had general knowledge of the character and course of life of dick turpin the highwayman and more particularly of jack shepherd sic the robber and prison breaker jack sheppard was born in whites row spitalfields in the spring of and then placed in the bishopsgate workhousebuilt on the perimeter of the city like newgate itselfbefore being apprenticed to a carpenter in wych street he broke free of his apprenticeship after six years of industry even though he was within ten months of completing his terms and turned to theft for his trade in the spring of he was first imprisoned in the st giles roundhouse but was free within three hours after cutting open the roof and lowering himself to the ground with sheet and blanket there he joined a gathering throng and made his escape through the lanes of st giles a few weeks later he was arrested again for a pickpocketing offence in leicester fields and was incarcerated in the new prison of clerkenwell he was taken to the newgate ward there and pinioned with links and fetters of great weight he sawed through the fetters and somehow cut through an iron restraint before boring his way through an oaken bar some nine inches thick the severed chairs and bars were afterwards kept by the prison authorities to testifie and preserve the memory of this extraordinary event and villain for three months he was at liberty before being found by the notorious criminal and thieftaker jonathan wild sheppard was now escorted to newgate and after being sentenced to death for three robberies was consigned to the condemned hold even within that dreadful place by some means or other he managed to smuggle in a spike and with that began to carve an opening in the wall or perhaps ceiling with the help of accomplices on the other side he was dragged out it was the week of bartholomew fair and he made his escape through the crowds of those going up snow hill and giltspur street into smithfield from there he travelled eastwards into spitalfields where he stayed at the pauls head on an eighteenthcentury map like that of john roque it is still possible to track his route it is in any case a potent imageof a prisoner almost miraculously escaping from incarceration to join the crowds celebrating their own temporary liberty among the booths and shows of bartholomew fair during the next few days according to peter linebaughs the london hanged he was seen by a cobbler in bishopsgate and a milkman in islington in fleet street he entered a watchmakers shop and addressed the apprentice there bidding him stick to his tools and not use his master to such ill habits of working so late he promptly robbed the premises but was pursued and taken then once again he was led to newgate and in a secluded gaol was fastened to the floor with double fetters everyone came to see him and everyone talked about him he had become a true london sensation the people mad about him at a time of the greatest idleness among meckanicks that has been known in london they had all gone to the taverns and alehouses in other words to discuss the prodigy when certain reverend gentlemen visited his cell he declared that they were gingerbread fellows and that one files worth all the bibles in the world the pagan temper of the londoner is here revealed yes sir i am the sheppard he said while in confinement and all the jailors in the town are my flock a file was found upon him and he was removed to the stone castle on the fifth storey where he was chained to the floor his legs secured with irons and his hands cuffed these instruments were inspected daily and sheppard himself was under regular supervision and then wonderfully if not miraculously he escaped again somehow he managed to slip his hands through his handcuffs and with a small nail managed to loose one of the links in the chains about his legs like some posture master from bartholomew fair he then squeezed through the great chains which held him with a piece of this broken chain he worked out a transverse bar from the chimney and climbed upwards into the red room whose door had not been unbolted for seven years with a nail he freed its bolt in seven minutes and got into a passage which led to the chapel then with a spike from one of the interior railings he opened four other doors which were all locked and bolted from the other side on opening the final door he found himself on the outside of the prison with the roofs of the city below him then he remembered his blanket he had left it in his cell he returned all the way to the stone castle through the chapel and down the chimney in order to retrieve it he returned to the outer air and with the blanket spiked to the stone wall slid down quietly over the next few days he disguised himself as a beggar and as a butcher the two most familiar london types while the streets around him were filled with ballads and broadsides proclaiming his latest escape in the disguise of a foot porter he visited the printer of those last dying speeches which as he knew or guessed would accompany his own journey to the scaffold he robbed a pawnbroker in drury lane and with the proceeds bought a fashionable suit and a silver sword then he hired a coach and with that innate sense of theatre which never seemed to desert him he drove through the arch of newgate itself before visiting the taverns and alehouses of the vicinity recaptured on that evening two weeks after his escape he was taken back to the prison from which he had effected such a remarkable exit and constantly watched when he was led to the court where the punishment of death was again pronounced he was surrounded by the most numerous croud of people that ever was seen in london he was sentenced to be hanged within a week there were reports that he would break away at little turnmill along holbornand on the road to tyburn a penknife was taken from himbut there was to be no reprieve from what peter linebaugh has called his final escape it is an intensely private as well as a very public london story we may infer that his youthful experience in the workhouse of bishopsgate prompted his obsessive desire for escape while it is likely that he somehow acquired his extraordinary skills while working as a carpenters apprentice certainly he would have learned the uses of files and chisels while practising upon wood he was a violent and dishonest man but his series of escapes from newgate transformed the atmosphere of the city where the prevailing mood became one of genuine collaborative excitement to escape from the most visible and oppressive symbol of authoritythat black cloud which pursued boswellwas in a sense to be freed from all the restraints of the ordinary world we might then equate the experience of the prison with the experience of the city itself it is indeed a familiar and often an accurate analogy and the history of jack sheppard suggests another aspect of it he hardly ever left london even with the opportunity and indeed the pressing necessity of doing so after three days on the run in northamptonshire for example he rode back to the city after his penultimate escape from newgate he returned to spitalfields where he had spent his earliest days after his final escape he was determined to remain in london despite the pleas of his family he was in that sense a true londoner who could not or would not operate outside his own territory he possessed other urban characteristics after his escapes he disguised himself as a variety of tradesmen and generally behaved in a thoroughly dramatic fashion to ride in a coach through newgate was a mark of theatrical genius he was profane to the point of being irreligious while his violence against the propertied interests was not inconsistent with the egalitarianism of the mob after one of his escapes a pamphleteer declaimed woe to the shopkeepers and woe to the dealers in ware for the roaring lion is abroad so jack became an intrinsic part of london mythology his exploits celebrated in ballads and verses and dramas and fiction in the smell of newgate had become pervasive throughout the neighbourhood all its walls were then washed down with vinegar and a ventilation system was installed seven of the eleven men working on that project were themselves infected with gaol fever which suggests the extent of the pestilence within five years later the inhabitants of newgate street were still unable to stand in their doorways and customers were reluctant to visit the shops in the vicinity for fear of infections there were even directions for those who might come close to the criminalshe should prudently empty his stomach and bowels a few days before to carry off any putrid or putrescent substance which may have lodged in them the prison was rebuilt in by george dance and was described by the poet crabbe as a large strong and beautiful building beautiful no doubt because of its simplicity of purpose there is nothing in it one contemporary wrote but two great windowless blocks each ninety feet square it was fired by rioters in and rebuilt two years later upon the same plan it was in many respects now more salubrious and hygienic a prison than many others in london but its ancient atmosphere lingered a few years after the rebuilding the new gaol begins to wear a brooding and haunted air already the old conditions also began to reemerge within the prison and in the early years of the nineteenth century it was reported in the chronicles of newgate that lunatics raving mad ranged up and down the wards a terror to all they encountered mock marriages were of constant occurrence a school and nursery of crime the most depraved were free to contaminate and demoralise their more innocent fellows the ministrations of elizabeth fry in seem to have produced some effect upon this hell above ground but official reports in and from the inspector of prisons still condemned the squalor and the misery immediately before the first of these reports newgate was visited by a young journalist charles dickens who from childhood had been fascinated by the looming gatehouse of the dark prison by his own account in sketches by boz he had often contemplated the fact that thousands of people each day pass and repass this gloomy depository of the guilt and misery of london in one perpetual stream of life and bustle utterly unmindful of the throng of wretched creatures pent up within it a light laugh or merry whistle can be heard within one yard of a fellowcreature bound and helpless whose days are numbered and who waits for execution in his second novel oliver twist dickens returns to those dreadful walls of newgate which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish here fagin sits in one of the condemned cellsdickens notes that the prison kitchen is beside the yard where the scaffold is erectedand an engraving by george cruikshank drawn after a visit to one such hold shows a stone bench with a mattress across it nothing else is visible except the iron bars set in a thick stone wall and the blazing eyes of the prisoner himself the young oliver twist visits the condemned cell through the dark and winding ways of newgate even though the gaoler has said that its not a sight for children dickens might be revisiting his own childhood since his most formative early experience of london was of attending his father and family lodged in the marshalsea prison of southwark perhaps that is why the image of newgate always haunted him and why towards the end of his life at night utterly wearied and demoralised he returned to the old gaol and touching its rough stone began to think of the prisoners in their sleep dickens was writing of a period when newgate had ceased to be a general prison and was instead used to confine those who had been sentenced to death as well as those waiting to be tried in the adjacent central criminal courts but a further refinement was added in when the prison was redesigned to house a series of separate cells where each inmate was held in silence and isolation in a series of articles published in the illustrated london news the prisoner awaiting a flogging is described as the patient the prison becomes a hospital then or perhaps the hospital is no better than a prison in this manner the institutions of the city begin to resemble one another newgate also became a kind of theatre when on wednesdays or thursdays between the hours of twelve and three it was open to visitors here sightseers would be shown casts of the heads of notorious criminals as well as the chains and handcuffs which once held jack sheppard they could at their wish be locked into one of the condemned cells for a moment or even sit within the old whipping post at the end of their tour they were conducted along birdcage walk the passage from the cells of newgate to the court of sessions here also they could read curious letters on the walls denoting the fact that the bodies of the condemned were interred behind the stone the name of the walk is strangely reminiscent of a scene from arthur morrisons a child of the jago where an infant visits her father before a double iron railing covered with wire netting at newgatecarrying into later years a memory of father as a man who lived in a cage the last execution at newgate took place at the beginning of may and three months later the work of demolition began at a quarter past three in the afternoon of august according to the daily mail of the following day a piece of stone about the size of a foot fell on the pavement and a hand with a chisel in it was seen working away in the breach a little crowd soon gathered to watch the operations it was noticed too that the old pigeons rough and grimy as the prison itself compared with the other flocks in london fluttered about the statue of liberty on the pinnacle of the prison these birds at least had no wish to leave their london cage six months later an auction of newgate relics was held within the prison itself the paraphernalia of the execution shed sold for s d while each of the plaster casts of the famous criminals was knocked down for two of the great doors and the whipping post for the patients may now be seen by the curious in the museum of london the old bailey now lies upon the ancient site chapter a note on suicide many inmates committed selfmurder within the walls of newgate but in london suicide assumes many forms people have hurled themselves from the whispering gallery in the cathedral of st pauls poisoned themselves in the solitude of london attics and drowned themselves for love in the waters of st jamess park the monument was another favourite location the unhappy subject would throw himself or herself from the summit of the pillar and fall upon its base rather than the street on may according to grosleys a tour of england the wife of a colonel drowned herself in the canal in st jamess park a baker hanged himself in drurylane a girl who lived near bedlam made an attempt to dispatch herself in the same manner in the summer of the suicide mania became a topic of public attention in that same century the thames was wreathed with the bodies of the drowned london was the suicide capital of europe as early as the fourteenth century froissart described the english as a very sad race which description applied particularly and even principally to londoners the french considered that the london vogue for suicides was owing to the affectation of singularity although a more perceptive observer believed that it was from a contempt of death and a disgust of life one frenchman described the plight of london families that had not laughed for three generations and observed that citizens committed suicide in the autumn in order to escape the weather another visitor remarked that selfslaughter was no doubt owing to the fogs he also suggested that beef was another essential cause since its viscous heaviness conveys only bilious and melancholic vapours to the brain his diagnosis has a curious resemblance to the folk superstition of londoners in which to dream of beef denotes the death of a friend or relation the modern connection between beef and bse may be noted here it was also remarked by grosley that melancholy prevails in london in every family in circles in assemblies at public and private entertainments the merry meetings even of the lowest sort are dashed with this gloom dostoevsky observed the gloom which never forsakes the londoner even in the midst of gaiety the wine sold in london taverns was also considered to occasion that melancholy which is so general even the theatre was held responsible for the unhappy distemper one traveller described how the son of his landlord after being taken to see richard iii leaped out of bed and after beating the wainscot with his head and feet at the same time roaring like one possessed he rolled about the ground in dreadful convulsions which made us despair of his life he thought he was haunted by all the ghosts in the tragedy of richard the third and by all the dead bodies in the churchyards of london everything was blamed except perhaps for the onerous and exhausting condition of the city itself chapter a penitential history there have been more prisons in london than in any other european city from the penitential cell in the church of the knights templar to the debtors prison in whitecross street from the clink situated in deadmans place bankside to the compter in giltspur street london has been celebrated for its places of confinement there was a prison in lambeth palace where early religious reformers the lollards were tortured and a roundhouse in st martins lane where twentyeight were thrust into a hole sixfeet square and kept there all night four of the women being stifled to death new prisons were always being built from the tun in cornhill at the end of the thirteenth century to wormwood scrubs in east acton at the end of the nineteenth century the prisoners were obliged to wear masks in the new model prison at pentonville while the new prison of millbank was supposed to have been built as a panopticon whereby each cell and inmate could be individually scrutinised by the early seventeenth century the london prisons like its churches were celebrated in verse in london and within a mile i weene there are of layles or prisons full eighteene and sixty whippingposts and stocks and cages the first prison mentioned in this sorrowful litany is the gatehouse at westminster and it is followed by an encomium upon the fleet prison the fleet was the oldest of them all older even than newgate and had once been known as the gaol of london it was also one of the first of the medieval citys stone buildings it was situated on the east side of the fleet and surrounded by a moat with tree clad banks where now farringdon street runs down to the thames the lowest sunken storey was known as bartholomew fair although the usual reports of brutality immorality and mortality render it an ironic sobriquet the prison was however most notorious for its secret and unlawful marriages performed by degraded clergymen for less than a guinea by the early eighteenth century there were some forty marrying houses in taverns of the vicinity with at least six known as the hand and pen women drugged or intoxicated could be taken there and married for their money innocent girls could be duped into believing that they were lawfully joined there was a watchmaker who impersonated a clergyman calling himself dr gaynamor perhaps gain them he resided in brick lane and it was his practice to walk up fleet street crossing fleet bridge in his silk gown and bands he was known for his commanding figure and a handsome though significantly rubicund face in the locality he was named as the bishop of hell on several occasions the fleet prison was itself consigned to the flames the last notable fire taking place in when a mobled perhaps appropriately by a chimneysweepmounted an incendiary assault upon it it was rebuilt in its old form with many of its more interesting details left intact along what is now farringdon street for example the wall of the gaol had one open grating with bars across it here was placed an iron box for alms and from within one chosen inmate would call out perpetually remember the poor prisoners this was the prison in which was incarcerated samuel pickwick who after speaking to those who lay there forgotten and unheeded muttered i have seen enough my head aches with these scenes and my heart too the fleet prison was demolished in but the site was not cleared for another eighteen years where once were walls and cells there emerged blind alleys which even on summer days were so narrow and crowded that they are bleak and shadowed the atmosphere of the ancient place lingered even after its material destruction it is likely that the fleet inspired thomas mores famous metaphor of the world as a prison some bound to a poste some in the dungeon some in the upper ward some wepying some laughing some labouring some playing some singing some chiding some fighting more eventually himself became a prisoner too but before that time as undersheriff of london he had sent many hundreds of londoners to gaol he consigned some to the old compter in bread street and others to the poultry compter near bucklersbury in the prison in bread street was moved a few yards northward to wood street where one of the inmates might have been echoing the words of thomas more he is quoted in old and new london this littel hole is as a little citty in a commonwealth for as in a citty there are all kinds of officers trades and vocations so there is in this place as we may make a pretty resemblance between them the men consigned here were known as rats the women as mice its underground passages still exist beneath the ground of a small courtyard beside wood street the stones are cold to the touch and there is a dampness in the air once a new prisoner drank from a bowl full of claret to toast his new society and now the compter is on occasions used for banquets and parties the image of the city as prison runs very deep in his late eighteenthcentury novel caleb williams william godwin described the doors the locks the bolts the chains the massy walls and grated windows of confinement he affirmed then that this is society the system of prison representing the whole machine of society when holloway prison was opened in its entrance was flanked by two stone griffins which are of course also the emblems of the city of london its foundation stone carried the inscription may god preserve the city of london and make this place a terror to evil doers it is perhaps suggestive that its architect james b banning used the same principles of design in his work upon the coal exchange and the metropolitan cattle market there was a visible affinity between some of the great public institutions of the city in the s vs pritchett described london as this prisonlike place of stone and in wordsworth cursed the city as a prison where he hath been long immured in turn matthew arnold in depicted it as this brazen prison where the inhabitants are dreaming of naught beyond their prisonwall in william morris added his own note to this vision of incarceration with his account of this grim net of london this prison built stark with the greed of all ages a mean lodging was his prisoncellin the jail of weary london keir hardie on returning to his native ayrshire in wrote that london is a place which i remember with a haunting horror as if i had been confined there a report on london prisoners themselves in londons underworld by thomas holmes in the very same period as keir hardies observations notes that the great mass of faces strikes us with dismay and we feel at once that most of them are handicapped in life and demand pity rather than vengeance the conditions of poverty in the city were such that the conditions of prison life are better as they need to be than the conditions of their own homes so they simply moved from one prison to another but gaol was the place in cockney idiom where the dogs dont bite there were also areas of sanctuary rights in london apparent neighbourhoods of freedom over which the prisons failed to cast their shadows these areas were once within the domains of great religious institutions but their charm or power survived long after the monks and nuns had departed among them were st martins le grand and whitefriars they had been respectively the home of secular canons and of the carmelites but as sanctuaries from pursuit and arrest became in turn havens for the lowest sort of people rogues and ruffians thieves felons and murderers one of the presumed murderers of the princes in the tower miles forest took refuge in st martins and stayed there rotting away piecemeal st martins beads became a popular expression for counterfeit jewellery the privileges of st martins le grand were abolished at the beginning of the seventeenth century but the sanctuary of whitefriars lasted for a longer period the area became popularly known as alsatia named after the unhappy frontier of alsace because no parish watch or city officials would dare to venture there if they did so there was a general cry of clubs and rescue before they were seized and beaten it is the area now marked by salisbury square and hangingsword alley between dorset street and magpie alley two other sanctuaries were connected with the coining of money they were located by the mints at wapping and in southwark as if the literal making of money were as sacred as any activity which took place in monastery or chapel in the mids legal officers attempted to infiltrate and expel the minters of wapping but were fought back one bailiff was duckd in a place in which the soil of houses of office lavatories had been emptyd while another was forcemarched before a crowd with a turd in his mouth the connection between money and ordure is here flagrantly revealed other sanctuaries still clung around the churches as if the tradition of begging for alms had continued in a more dissipated form the area which had once been dominated by blackfriars was a notorious haunt of criminals and beggars a sanctuary in the neighbourhood of westminster abbey was for centuries low and disreputable and shire lane beside the church of st clement danes was known as rogues lane here were houses known as cadgers hall the retreat and smashing lumber the last being a manufactory for counterfeit coin wherein according to old and new london every room had its secret trap or panel the whole of the coining apparatus and the employés could be conveyed away as by a trick of magic in any alternative london topography sanctuaries like prisons become highly specific sites of ill fame tread there who dares chapter a rogues gallery if the places of crime and punishment do not necessarily change but leave a steady mark there may also be continuity among the criminals of london we read of fourteenthcentury forgers and blackmailers and the coroners inquests of reveal a long tally of bawdyhouse keepers nightwalkers robbers women of ill fame the city was even then so filled with thieves that in this period the right of infangthief was given to the city authorities it permitted them to hang thieves caught redhanded cum manu opere without trial by jury it was not until the sixteenth century however that the literature of london crime becomes extensive the works of robert greene and thomas dekker in particular reveal an underworld of thieves and imposters which remains as old and as new as the city itself certainly the argot or cant of the thieves had very ancient roots while some of its more expressive phrases endured well into the nineteenth century and bing we to romevill to nip a bung can be translated as now let us travel to london to cut a purse how london acquired the name of romevill long before it was ever compared to that imperial city is something of a mystery yonder dwelleth a queer cuffin it were beneship to mill him there lives a difficult and churlish man it would be a very good thing to rob him the individuals as well as their words come to life in the pages of these old catalogues of crimejohn stradling with the shaking head henry smyth who drawls when he speaks john browne the stammerereach of them engaged in some kind of fifteenthcentury cheating trade that trade too has survived the game of cups in which the spectator must choose which one conceals the ball is still played on the streets of london in the twentyfirst century the fraud has now existed for over a thousand years in the capital in their record of abraham men who pretended to be mad clapper dodgers who fished for goods from open windows and priggers of prancers horse thieves dekker and greene may on occasions be guilty of overemphasis the streets of sixteenthcentury london might not have been quite as violent or as perilous as they suggest nevertheless real criminality could be found in many specific areas the neighbourhood of chick lane and field lane in clerkenwell for example was always notorious in chick lane itself there was a dwelling once known as the red lion inn which upon its demolition in the eighteenth century was discovered to be three centuries old cw heckethorn in london souvenirs reveals that it contained dark closets trapdoors sliding panels and secret recesses one of these trapdoors opened upon the fleet ditch and afforded easy means of getting rid of the bodies there was a morass of lanes off ratcliffe highway with names like hog yard and black dog alley money bag alley and harebrain court which were known for moral degradation there was also a dwelling near water lane off fleet street known as blood bowl house named from the various scenes of blood that were almost daily exhibited and where there seldom passed a month without the commission of a murder in perhaps less sensational a context a city recorder of the seventeenth century gave evidence of a raid upon wattons alehouse at smarts key beside billingsgate the tavern was in reality a school set upp to learne younge boys to cutt purses pockets and purses were hung upon a line with hawkes bells or sacring bells attached to them if a child could remove a coin or counter without setting off the bell he was adjudged a judiciall nypper during the following century there was another such school in smithfield where a tavernkeeper taught children how to pick pockets to pilfer from shops by crawling through their wooden hatches and to break into buildings by a simple expedient they pretended to be asleep against the wall while all the time they were actively chipping away at the bricks and mortar until a hole had been breached it is curious in this description of crime that the criminals themselves adopted the terminology of law cheating law was the term for playing with false dice versing law the art of passing counterfeit coin and tigging law that of cutting purses it was the alternative law of low london yet new crimes could also evolve in the seventeenth century for example highway robbery became known as high law the age of coaches meant also the age of coach theft and in the last days of john evelyn wrote this week robberies were committed between the many lights which were fixed between london and kensington on both sides and while coaches and travellers were passing between flaring lights along the high road there was at night absolute darkness where the robbers could easily strike we may even hear them talking in the pages of the london hanged one drover edward smith suggested to a companion that they go upon the accompt take up highway robbery let us enter into articles to have no others than ourselves concerned for the future and if they were caught there is an account of one thief taken and led back to londonhe was very unruly pulling the horse about making motions with his hands at every body that came near him as if he was firing a pistol crying phoo hounslow heath and turnham green marylebone and tottenham court road were particular areas of danger for the unwary these were the places for footpad robberies known to the criminal fraternity as low tobies it became customary in the early eighteenth century for travellers into london to gather in bands for mutual protection beginning their perilous journey only on the sounding of a bell at night they would also be accompanied by linkboys carrying lights the same flaring torches were necessary for journeys within the city itself a gentleman was stopt in holborn about twelve at night by two footpads who on the gentlemans making resistance shot him dead and then robbed him one richard watson tollman of marybone turnpike was found barbarously murdered in his tollhouse a female who served in a public house in marylebone is quoted in charles knights london as having often wondered why i have escaped without wounds or blows from the gentlemen of the pad who are numerous and frequent in their evening patroles through these fields and my march extended as far as long acre by which means i was obliged to pass through the thickest of them a commentator in the same volume has remarked that the citizens of london looked upon the worshipful company of thieves much in the same way that settlers in a new country regard the wild beasts prowling in the forests around them the judiciall nyppers of one period had migrated into another and it was reported that eighteenthcentury london swarms with pickpockets as daring as they are subtile and cunning they stole under the very gibbet from which they might one day be suspended and there never is any execution without handkerchiefs and other articles being stolen if they were caught in the act by londoners themselves they were dragged to the nearest well or fountain and dipped in the water till nearly drowned if they were taken up by the authorities a more severe penalty was imposed by the middle of the eighteenth century the number of offences for which men and women could be hanged had risen from to over yet this may not have been a powerful deterrent a few years later in a treatise on the police of the metropolis it was reported that persons in london were regularly engaged in criminal pursuits this would amount to oneseventh of the population so in it was recorded by the gentlemans magazine that the papers are filled with robberies and breaking of houses and with the recital of the cruelties committed by the robbers greater than ever before we may surmise therefore that in a period of affluence and conspicuous wealth crimes against property were as numerous as crimes against peopleand this despite the fact that the larger the sum involved in theft or cheat the greater the possibility of being hanged peter linebaugh has scrutinised the statistics for hanging all through the eighteenth century and has arrived at interesting conclusions those born in london tended to hang in their early twenties an earlier age than that of immigrants to the city the main trades of those who reached the scaffold were butchers weavers and shoemakers there was a pronounced association between butchers and highway robbers dick turpin himself had been apprentice to a butcher cultural and sociological interpretations of this correspondence have been made but in general terms the butchers of the city were always known for their boisterous individualistic and sometimes violent nature certainly they were the most prominent of all london tradesmen and one foreign visitor to london reported that it was a marvel to see such quantities of butchers shops in all the parishes the streets being full of them in every direction they were often the leaders of their little communities too those of clare market for example worked and dwelled among the patent theatres of the area and were described as the arbiters of the galleries the leaders of theatrical rows the musicians at actresses marriages the chief mourners at players funerals they were also leaders of the community in times of scarcity and disorder it was reported of one violent assault for example that the buttchers have begun the way to all the rest for within this toe days they all did rise upon the exise man it is not inconsistent then that they or their apprentices should be at the very forefront of adventurous or desperate crime in henry fielding published his inquiry into the causes of the late increase of robbers and a year later the murder act added a further terror to death by declaring that the bodies of the hanged should be publicly dissected by surgeons and anatomists a measure such as this may have been prompted by a perceived increase in crime but it was also a direct product of panic fear among the gullible and the anxious london has always been the centre of panic and of rumour at the end of the twentieth century for example an official survey reported that fear of crime is a social problem in itself with a significantly higher proportion of londonersas opposed to those living elsewherefeeling unsafe both in their dwellings and in the streets they might have been echoing the sentiments of a londoner in who stated that from the authors own experience in almost every part of europe he can mention no place so full of peril as the environs of london of course it was then still a relatively compact and enclosed citythe crucial intensity of crime has in fact diminished with londons growthand indeed its criminals seem to have borrowed their habits and demeanour from its earlier eighteenthcentury life the low toby or footpad was known in the early nineteenth century for example as a rampsman but the violent assault had not changed the housebreaker of this period was called a cracksman while a bug hunter was one who picked the pockets of drunks a snoozer was one who booked into a hotel before robbing its guests while an area sneak called at kitchen doors in the hope of finding them open and unattended these were the crimes typical of the city and their perpetrators were generally thieves pickpockets burglars and those fraudulent merchants and tricksters who took advantage of the gullibility or credulousness of the passing transient crowd although it would be going too far to say that the man who knew his londoncould recognise each type by his dress and manner as thomas burke puts it in the streets of london criminals were still a particular and distinguishable element of city life until the middle of the nineteenth century their language too like that of the abraham men of a previous century was itself pronounced and peculiarstow that pottering about on the sneak flimping or smashing a little if im nailed its a lifer this existence had its own kind of music also a villain was known as a sharp and his victim a flat it was reported in that this criminal class amounted to yet the streets were by then safer than they had ever been five years before there had been an outbreak of garrotting the popular name for violent robberies but that had been effectively suppressed by means of equally violent floggings it was no longer possible to claim as the duke of wellington had done forty years before that the principal streets of london were in the nightly possession of drunken women and vagabonds as well as organised gangs of thieves where in previous periods of the citys history the vagabonds and thieves were scattered indiscriminately in various islands off the main thoroughfares they had by the middle of the nineteenth century retreated into various quarters on the fringes of the now more civilised metropolis they were often located in the eastern suburbs or as it soon became known the east end that area some sixteen years before jack rendered the region of whitechapel notorious was reputed to be a place of thieves kitchens and ragged public houses charged with the unmistakable overpowering damp and mouldy odour attendant upon street crime in bethnal green too there were pubs and houses which acted as a convenient and secluded exchange and house of call filled with dippers and broads and welshers these are the words of arthur morrison writing a child of the jago at the end of the nineteenth century when once more the slang or patter had changed in order ever more colourfully to depict the familiar crimes of london a house of call like exchange was in fact a word used to describe a dealing room of city business so in mockery as well as implicit deference the terminology of financial and commercial london was parodied by the more secretive if more notorious speculators in urban goods in bethnal green and its environs morrison noticed the presence of the most successful late nineteenthcentury criminals who belonged to the high mobs or as one resident put it igh mob oohs toffs morrison was in fact depicting a traditional london pursuitthat of an organised gang generally of more than usually skilful or vicious practitioners of the criminal arts with one or two leaders the mob or gang controlled a certain area of the city or certain specific activities dick turpin led the essex gang of thieves and smugglers in the s while a decade earlier such gifted individuals as jonathan wild could dominate the general course of london crime but as the city expanded it became divided into separate territories controlled by specific gangs in the nineteenth century rival gangs vied for territory and for influence in the early twentieth century east london once again became the scene of murderous conflict the opposition of the harding gang and the bogard gang culminated in a violent confrontation in the bluecoat boy public house in bishopsgate in the s and s the crime families of the sabinis and cortesis fought against each other in the streets of clerkenwell over the control of clubs and racetracks while in the next decade the white family of islington were challenged by billy hill and his heavy mob from seven dials there were other criminal fraternities known variously as the elephant gang the angel gang and the titanic gang these dealt in organised shoplifting or smashandgrab raids as well as the general business of drugs prostitution and protection racketeering in the late s and s the kray brothers of the east end and the richardsons from over the water in the southern suburbs controlled their respective areas with notable success in the krays own territory the popular admiration for great thieves to use a phrase of the midnineteenth century had never seriously abated in the funeral procession for ronnie kray along bethnal green road and vallance road was a great social event as iain sinclair wrote of the east end in lights out for the territory no other strata of society has such a sense of tradition the memories of grand criminality in that neighbourhood go back to turpins essex gang and beyond it is hard to say that any aspect of crime or criminal behaviour is altogether new smash and grab became popular for example in the s and s although it did not originate then there are records of that offence in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the gangs of the krays and the richardsons have now been displaced by those with other ethnic origins the jamaican yardie and chinese triad groups for example working their own particular areas in the s as the trade in drugs such as heroin khat crack and ecstasy became ever more lucrative gang elements from nigeria turkey and colombia participated in the citys new criminal activity the yardies are considered to be in the twentyfirst century responsible for the largest proportion of killings in a city where murder is perpetual murder to paraphrase thomas de quincey is one of londons fine arts chapter horrible murder it has come in many different forms in the eighteenth century it was often remarked that the noses of the victims were bitten off during the act of strangling strangulation and stabbing were popular at the end of that century succeeded in the early nineteenth century by slashed throats and clubbing at the end of the nineteenth century poison and various forms of mutilation or hacking to death became more favoured yet the element of mystery remains perhaps the most interesting and suggestive aspect of the london murder as if the city itself might have taken part in the crime one of the unsolved murders of the seventeenth century in an age when all were inured to death concerned a man known variously as edmund berry godfrey or edmunsbury godfrey he was found in upon what is now known as primrose hill with his own sword thrust through his body but no blood was on his clothes or about him and his shoes were clean he had also been strangled and his neck broken when his clothes were taken off his breast was found to be all over marked with bruises another curious element lay in the fact that there were many drops of white wax lights on his breeches a catholic plot was suspected and on concocted evidence three members of the royal court at somerset house were arrested and executed their names were green berry and hill the earliest name of primrose hill where the body was found was greenberry hill the real murderers were never discovered but it would seem that the topography of london itself played a fortuitous if malign part one evening at nine oclock in cannon street in the spring of sarah millson went downstairs to answer the streetbell an hour later a neighbour who lived above her discovered her body at the bottom of the stairs she had been killed by a number of deep wounds to the head but her shoes had been taken off and were lying on a table in the hall there was no blood upon them the gaslight had been quietly extinguished after the murder presumably in order to save expense the neighbour opened the street door to find help and saw a woman on the doorstep apparently shielding herself against the heavy rain which was then falling she was asked for assistance but moved away saying oh dear no i cant come in the murderer was never apprehended but the characteristics of london mystery are here found in almost emblematic detailthe lodging house in cannon street the heavy rain the gaslight the perfectly cleaned shoes the strange woman shielding herself from the rain only contributes to the air of intimacy and darkness that characterises this crime once more it is as if the spirit or atmosphere of the city itself played its part that is why the murders committed by jack the ripper between august and november are an enduring aspect of london myth with the areas of spitalfields and whitechapel as the dark accomplices of the crimes the newspaper accounts of jacks murders were directly responsible for parliamentary inquiries into the poverty of these neighbourhoods and of the east end in general in that sense charity and social provision followed hard upon the heels of monstrous death but in a more elusive way the streets and houses of that vicinity became identified with the murders themselves almost to the extent that they seemed to share the guilt one scholarly account by colin wilson refers to the secrets of a room in the ten bells public house of the neighbourhood in commercial street which suggests that the walls and interiors of the then impoverished streets were the killers confessional there are contemporary reports of the panic engendered by the whitechapel killings mv hughes author of a london girl of the eighties has written that no one can believe now how terrified and unbalanced we all were by his murders this is recorded by one who lived in the west of london many miles from the vicinity and she adds one can only dimly imagine what the terror must have been in those acres of narrow streets where the inhabitants knew the murderer to be lurking it is testimony to the power of urban suggestion and to the peculiar quality of late victorian london that popular belief lent a quality of the supernatural to the work the essential paganism of london here reasserts itself even as the murders were continuing the books and pamphlets began to appear among them the mysteries of the east end the curse upon mitre square jack the ripper or the crimes of london londons ghastly mystery the place becomes the central interest therefore and soon after the crimes sightseers were flocking through berners street and george yard and flower and dean street a whitechapel peepshow even provided wax figures of the victims for the delectation of the spectators such is the force of the area and of its crimes that several daily tours are still organised mainly for foreign visitorsaround the ten bells public house and the adjacent streets the connection between london and murder is then a permanent one martin fido author of the murder guide to london states that more than half the memorable murders of britain have happened in london with the prevalence of certain killings within certain areas murder may appear respectable in camberwell while brutal in brixton a litany of cut throats in nineteenthcentury london is followed by a list of female poisoners yet as the same narrator has pointed out there has been too much murder in london for a comprehensive listing there are episodes and incidents however which remain emblematic and it is noticeable that certain streets or areas come to identify the crimes there were the turner street murders and the ratcliffe highway murders for example the last of which in prompted de quinceys memorable essay on the fine art of murder he begins his account of a series of killings the most superb of the century by many degrees with an invocation of ratcliffe highway itself as a most chaotic quarter of eastern or nautical london and an area of manifold ruffianism an entire family had been found murdered in a shop beside the highway in the most gruesome circumstances less than three weeks later in new gravel lane very close to that highway a man called out they are murdering people in the house seven citizens altogether including two children and one infant had been dispatched within eight days one of the killers john williams committed suicide in his cell within coldbath fields prison at clerkenwell his dead body together with the bloody hammer and chisel which had been the means of his crimes were paraded past the houses where he had assisted in the murders he was then buried beneath the crossroads of back lane and cannon street road or as de quincey puts it in the centre of a quadrivium or conflux of four roads with a stake driven through his heart and over him drives for ever the uproar of unresting london so williams became part of london having marked a track through a specific locality his own name was buried in the urban mythology surrounding the ratcliffe highway murders he became instead the citys sacred victim to be interred in a formalised and ritualistic manner some hundred years later workmen digging up the territory found his mouldering remains it is appropriate that his bones were then shared out in the area as relics his skull for example was granted to the owner of a public house still to be seen on the corner of the fatal crossroads other roads and streets can prove to be injurious dorset street was the site of mary kellys murder in the winter of at the hands of jack it reclaimed its original name of duval street after this peculiarly savage crime as a way of preserving anonymity only to be the site of a fatal shooting in in both cases no murderer was ever convicted there are many accounts of such anonymous killers wandering through crowds and crowded thoroughfares concealing a knife or some other fatal instrument it is a true image of the city the remarks of the killers have on occasion been recorded damn her dip her again and finish her yours to a cinder get the knives out the streets themselves then become the object of fascinated enquiry we read for example in the murder guide to london that the murder victim in baroness orczys lady molly of scotland yard had his office in lombard street in wilkie collinss the moonstone the gem was pledged to a banker in lombard street an actual police station in wood street has been used as an imaginative location by several writers of mysteries and edgar wallace turned all hallows by the tower into st agnes on powder hill in a city where spectacle and theatre become an intimate part of ordinary reality fact and imagination can be strangely mingled a complex of streets can also become haunted by crime so that martin fido himself an eminent criminologist writes of the dense murder area of islington located in the back streets behind upper street and the city road in this neighbourhood the sister of charles lamb killed her mother in the autumn of only a few yards from the room where joe orton was murdered by his lover in in the early decades of the twentieth century there were killings known generically as the north london murders although they were in fact separately conducted by hawley harvey crippen and frederick seddon the list of london murderers is long indeed catherine hayes proprietress of a tavern called the gentleman in trouble severed her husbands head in the spring of and tossed it into the thames before strewing other parts of the corpse all over london the head was recovered and placed upon a pole in a city churchyard where eventually it was recognised mrs hayes was committed for trial and sentenced to death earning the further distinction of being one of the last women ever to be burned at tyburn thomas henry hocker described by an investigating policeman as a fellow in a long black cloak was seen springing from behind some trees in belsize lane on a february evening in singing to himself he walked past the scene of the murder he had just committed and still undiscovered conversed with the policeman who had found the body it is a nasty job he said and then took hold of the dead mans hand this site was his own handiwork as the chronicles of newgate puts it yet he could not overcome the strange fascination it had for him and remained by the side of the corpse until the stretcher came one of the most celebrated of londons mass murderers was john reginald christie whose house at rillington place itself became so notorious that the name of the street was changed eventually the house was itself torn down after harbouring a variety of transient lodgers extant photographs reveal a characteristic london location it was a typical example of a notting hill tenement in the early s with tattered curtains cracked and badly stained plaster bricks dark with soot murder in such a context can be concealed there is another aspect of london killings to be fathomed in the career of dennis nilsen who while living in muswell hill and cricklewood during the late s and early s murdered and dismembered many young victims the details of the lives of these murdered men may no longer seem of much significance except that in the words of one report few of them were missed when they disappeared this is the context for many london murders where the isolation and anonymity of strangers passing through the city leave them peculiarly defenceless to the depredations of an urban killer one of nilsens victims for example was a downandout whom he had met at the crossroads by the church of st gilesinthefields nilsen apparently horrified by his emaciated condition killed him and burned him in the garden of his house in melrose avenue another victim was a young skinhead who had inscribed graffiti upon his own body among them a dotted line around his neck together with the words cut here here in these brutal and brutalising circumstances the darker face of london seems to emerge all that was known of elizabeth price condemned to death for theft in was that she had followd the business of picking up rags and cinders and at other times that of selling fruit and oysters crying hot pudding and grey pears in the streets we read of mary cutandcomeagain who when arrested by the watchmen took out her breasts and spurted the milk in the fellows faces and said damn your eyes what do you want to take my life away that spirit of contempt against the forces of law and order is characteristic of london life it is connected too with a buoyant paganism as in the case of a domestic servant charged with murder who was reported to take a mighty disgust at things of religion in similar spirit ann mudd who was convicted of murdering her husband was equally defiant why said she i stabbd him in the back with a knife for funn she spent her last hours singing obscene songs in the condemned cell the whitechapel murders encouraged the earliest use of police photographs recording the scene of the crime while a murder in cecil court off st martins lane in resulted in the first success of the identikit picture the device of placing the head of catherine hayess husband upon a stake as a means of identification has had some interesting successors the essential point remains that crime and in particular murder enlivens the urban populace that is why in london mythology the greatest heroes are often the greatest criminals chapter londons opera the exploits of jack sheppard proved how intense could be the excitement aroused in london by the adventures of a criminal the most notable painter of the day sir james thornhill visited him in in order to complete a portrait which was then sold to the public as a mezzotint nine years later in thornhills soninlaw william hogarth made a similar journey to newgate here he sketched another famous malefactor sarah malcolm herself held in the condemned cell she had strangled two elderly parties and then cut the throat of their maid the recklessness of the crimes lending her notoriety among the london public she was very youngonly twentytwoand very composed at her trial she declared the blood on her shift to be the issue of menstruation rather than of murder and after the sentence of death had been pronounced upon her confessed that she was a roman catholic hogarth painted her sitting in her cell her rosary beads before her and announced in the public press that his print would be ready within two days it was an advertisement of his skill as well as a tribute to the notoriety of his subject in her biography of hogarth jenny uglow describes how sarah arrived at her hanging by the scene of her crimes according to custom neatly dressed in a crape mourning hood holding up her head in the cart with an air and looking as if she was painted after she had been cut down it was reported that there was among the rest a gentleman in deep mourning who kissed her and gave the people half a crown here are all the elements of drama and intrigue which rendered memorable such rituals of crime and punishment in london hogarth himself could not resist the lineaments of the condemned when in theodore gardelle was about to be hanged at the corner of panton street and the haymarket hogarth captured his countenance of despair with a few swift strokes it is of some interest then that in february hogarth attended and enjoyed the beggars opera by john gay in this drama the low criminal life of london is presented in bright theatrical guise a true london production part burlesque and part burletta it was a parody of fashionable italian opera as well as a satire upon governmental cabal with its main characters of macheath a highwayman and peachum a receiver of stolen goods it aspired to be a spirited representation of the london criminal world appropriately completed by the portrait of lockit the keeper of newgate the dramatic scenes within newgate itself confirm two of the citys most permanent images the world as a stage and the world as a prison there are other aspects of london life within the drama its constant references to commerce and to currency together with its tendency to treat people and relationships in commodity terms according to john gays latest and best biographer david nokes mark the powerful and possibly corrupting atmosphere of trade and finance which lingers over all the activities of the city how else is it possible that the characters from the london streets should reach so casually and easily for mercantile metaphors these people are invariably valued in trading terms that is according to how much may be got by them here is the true spirit of city commerce but it has an interesting and significant ramification this trading activity is pursued by both high and low by courtiers as well as highwaymen so that the gaiety and exuberance of the opera are in part based upon its implicit denial of all distinctions of rank and class it is the egalitarianone might almost say antinomianinstinct of the london populace represented upon the stage in a colourful and spirited form in turn gay himself was accused of glamorising thieves and receivers of stolen goods as if in the act of equalising the activities of the beggars and their betters he was somehow lending vulgar distinction to the more disreputable elements of london life it was reported by one contemporary moralist that several thieves and street robbers confessed in newgate that they raised their courage at the playhouse by the songs of their hero macheath before they sallied forth in their desperate nocturnal exploits if that was indeed the case then we see in the fervent and fevered context of london that street life feels no compunction in taking on the lineaments of dramatic art that is the significance of hogarths admiration for the beggars opera this quintessentially london artist saw the possibility of channelling his own genius through it he painted the same scene from the play on six separate occasions in the process according to jenny uglow bursting into life as a true painter it is not hard to understand how this intense depiction of london life invigorated and animated the artist since in his subsequent work he reveals his own vital engagement with the scenic possibilities of street life in fact he creates his own tradition of london villains in the characterisation of tom nero in the four stages of cruelty and thomas idle in the industry and idleness series both end as murderers suspended on the gallows but the course of their fatal careers is given a lurid and sensational aspect by being placed within the context of the streets and low haunts of the city everything there conspires to engender dreadful deeds in the four stages of cruelty the life of the city itself is the true engine of that cruelty as hogarth put it in his disquisition on these prints the work was done in hopes of preventing in some degree that cruel treatment of poor animals which makes the streets of london more disagreeable to the human mind than any thing what ever the very describing of which gives pain in one scene outside thavies inn coffee house in holborn along the main route to smithfield from the rural areas of islington and marylebone the driver of cab number twentyfour is mercilessly belabouring his horse while a sheep is being clubbed to death in the foreground a child unnoticed falls under the wheel of a brewers cart while on the wall there is a poster advertising a cockfight at the execution of thomas idle the drunken and violent rabble beneath the gallows act as a mirror of his existence and are an emblem of it recognisable figures are also part of the tyburn crowdtiddy doll the eccentric seller of gingerbread mother douglas the fat and drunken procuress and on the gallows itself halfwitted funny joe who amused the populace at executions with his jokes and speeches a suggestive biblical motto from proverbs at the bottom of the print announces that then they shall call upon god but he will not answer hogarth is depicting a pagan society from which these criminals have ineluctably emerged if john gay was intent upon turning thieves or receivers into dramatic heroes or characters then he was himself following a distinguished london tradition in the four years before the beggars opera had appeared on stage there had been other theatrical representations of harlequin sheppard and a match in newgate the former suggesting a remarkable link between pantomime and crime more than a century earlier beaumont and fletcher in the beggars bush had given dramatic currency to the tricks and slang of london criminalsagain with the powerful insinuation that they were behaving no worse than those betters who ruled them in marcellus laroon similarly depicted in elegant style and form the squire of alsatia a notorious thief and confidence man called bully dawson who is nevertheless posed in laroons print in the manner of a great fop and gentleman the theatrical manner and disguise are emblematic of the contrasts and variety of the streets all these various works manifest in turn a strange fascination for the life of the vagrant and the outcast as if the conditions of london might propel anyone into a state of need or outlawry why else should the streets of london so haunt hogarths own imagination the tradition continued in the sensational accounts of the lives of famous criminals whose exploits were every bit as melodramatic as the characters upon the stage you cannot conceive wrote horace walpole in the latter part of the eighteenth century the ridiculous rage there is for going to newgate the prints that are published of the malefactors and the memoirs of their lives set forth with as much parade as marshal turennes swift satirised that rage some decades earlier with his description of tom clinch being driven to the scaffold the maids to the doors and the balconies ran and said lackaday hes a proper young man in the nineteenth century an essay was written on popular admiration for great thieves in which it is noted that in the previous century englishmen were no less vain in boasting of the success of their highwaymen than of the bravery of their troops hence the widespread popularity of the newgate calendar the general title given to a succession of books which began to emerge at the end of the eighteenth century the first was the malefactors register or new newgate and tyburn calendar and its popularity was such that it can be compared to foxes book of martyrs in the midsixteenth century or perhaps the ubiquitous legends about saints of the medieval period it might even be compared to the vogue for fairy tales emerging in the early nineteenth century the ambiguity of the genre is further compounded by the school of the newgate novel which emerged in the same period with such celebrated practitioners as harrison ainsworth and bulwer lytton it is perhaps significant that in newgate itself the inmates were addicted to light literature novels flash songs plays books everyone was copying everyone else the content of these various publications was equally ambiguous hovering somewhere between celebration and condemnation in similar fashion skill and cunning disguise and stratagem were commonly admired as the dramatic expedients of street life there was the infamous little casey a nineyearold pickpocket whose skills made him the wonder of late s london there was mary young known as jenny diver who practised in the same streets some forty years before she would dress up as a pregnant woman and hiding a pair of artificial arms and hands beneath her dress opened pockets and purses with ease she in turn was celebrated by the london populace for her skills of timing disguise wit and dissimulation at a later date there emerged charles price or old patch he committed sophisticated forgeries and passed off his banknotes in a variety of elaborate disguises he was a compact middleaged man but typically would dress as an infirm and aged londoner wearing a long black camlet cloak with a broad cape fastened up close to his chin he had a large broadbrimmed slouch hat often green spectacles or a green shade he dressed up in other words as the old man of stage comedy in the late nineteenth century charles peace was also celebrated as a master of disguise and manipulation the son of a filemaker he conducted an ordinary life as a suburban householder variously in lambeth and in peckham yet by shooting forward his lower jaw he could entirely alter his appearance he had been a onearmed man the live limb being concealed beneath his clothes the police declared that he could so change himself even without material disguises that he was unrecognisable he even designed a folding ladder eight feet long which folded down to a sixth of that length fifteen inches and could be concealed under the arm he had once been a street musician and had a great love for fiddles he even contrived to steal them although on occasions they furnished an awkward addition to his swag after his death on the scaffold his collection of instruments was put up for auction yet in a city of character and spectacle it was his ability to disguise himself which exerted the most fascination in the black museum of scotland yard there used to be exhibited the pair of blue goggles he was accustomed to wear in his favourite character of eccentric old philosopher he was also a callous criminal who murdered anyone who got in his way and so the celebration of disguise is tempered by disgust at the nature of his crimes this indeed was a feature of the newgate calendar itself as in a narrative of the horrid cruelties of elizabeth brownrigg on her apprentices she was a midwife chosen by the overseers of the poor of st dunstans parish to take care of the poor women who were taken in labour in the workhouse she had several penniless girls working as her servants at her house in fleurdelis court off fleet street and she systematically tortured abused and killed them as she was led to her death in the autumn of the london mob shouted out that she would go to hell and that the devil would fetch her her body was anatomised and her skeleton displayed in a niche of surgeons hall after such events came the trade in last dying confessions some were genuinely composed by the felons themselveswho often took great delight in reading their last speeches in their cellsbut customarily it was the ordinary or religious minister of newgate who wrote what were essentially morbid and moralistic texts the city then became a stage upon which were presented spectacles for the delight and terror of the urban audience there is a short story by arthur conan doyle concerning sherlock holmess exposure of what were then known as fraudulent mendicants in the man with the twisted lip neville st clair a prosperous gentleman living in the suburbs of kent travelled to his business in the city every morning and returned on the five fourteen from cannon street each evening it transpired however that he had secret lodgings in upper swandam lane a vile alley to the east of london bridge where he dressed up as a sinister cripple called hugh boone who was well known as a matchseller in threadneedle street with his shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar this tale was published in as part of the adventures of sherlock holmes twelve years later there was a beggar who sold matches in bishopsgate he was well known in the vicinity since he was paralysed he could be seen dragging himself painfully along the gutter his head hanging to one side all his limbs trembled violently one foot dragged behind him and his right arm limp withered and useless to complete the terrible picture his face was most horribly distorted this account was written by a chief detective inspector of the city police force ernest nicholls in crime within the square mile in the autumn of a young detective constable from that force decided to tail the matchseller the policeman discovered that the beggar would drag his paralysed body into crosby square and then make his exit at another corner as a nimble young man he turned out to be a gentleman by the name of cecil brown smith who lived in the genteel suburbs of norwood and who earned a prosperous living from the charity of those who passed him in bishopsgate it is a curious coincidence if no more and may be accounted as one of the many strange coincidences which life in the city creates in the same book of police cases there is the story of a bloodstained razor being discovered behind the seat of a bus the young man who found the blade hesitated a few days before giving it to the police because some years before he himself had slashed the throat of his sweetheart with just such a murder weapon it is as if the city itself brought forth evidence from its own history the stories of the mendicant beggars may imply that cecil brown smith had read conan doyles story of london vagrancy and had decided to bring it to life or it may be that certain writers are able to divine a particular pattern of activity within the city in any case that connection of fact and fiction in the realm of crime was not wholly lost in the twentieth century tommy steele played jack sheppard in wheres jack phil collins was buster edwards in buster roger daltrey was john mcvicar in mcvicar and two performers from spandau ballet enacted the kray brothers in the krays the tradition of the beggars bush and the beggars opera continues chapter raw lobsters and others if villains become heroes it has been the fate of policemen to become figures of fun shakespeare satirised dogberry the constable in much ado about nothing in what was already a long tradition of city humour at the expense of its guardians at first the watch as the police forces were called for many centuries were literally watchers upon the walls of london in a document of it is stipulated that two men of the watch well and fittingly armed be at all hours of the day ready at the gate within or without down below to make answer to such persons as shall come on great horses or with arms to enter the city but what of the enemy within the good men of each ward were by custom responsible for maintaining order but in an informal system of mutual protection was supplanted by the establishment of a public watch comprising the householders of each precinct under the jurisdiction of a constable each householder when not assuming the offices of beadle constable or scavenger had to serve as part of the watch operating under the rules of hue and cry so we hear of unruly apprentices being chased and nightwalkers arrested there are constant descriptions of roreresroarerswho drink and gamble and beat people in the streets these are taken up locked up and brought before the city magistrates the following morning to act as a member of the watch was considered a public duty but it became customary for the hardpressed householder to hire another to take his place those who took the job were generally of a low calibre however hence the description of the london watch made up of old men chosen from the dregs of the people who have no other arms but a lanthorn and a pole who patrol the streets crying the hour every time the clock strikes we also have the watch organised by constable dogberry in much ado about nothing you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern in the s a watch act was introduced to regularise the situation a system of payment out of the rates was supposed to encourage the employment of better watchmen in some cases by hiring disbanded soldiers or sailors rather than the old pensioners of the parish but it seems to have made little difference there is a midnineteenthcentury photograph of william anthony one of the last of the london watch grasping a pole in his right hand and a lantern in his left he is wearing the peculiar broadbrimmed hat and greatcoat which marked his profession and his expression hovers somewhere between sternness and imbecility they were known as charleys and were continually mocked they patrolled certain streets and were supposed to act as guardians of property the first time this man goes on his rounds césar de saussure remarked in he pushes the doors of the shops and houses with his stick to ascertain whether they are properly fastened and if they are not he warns the proprietors he also awakened early any citizens who have any journey to perform but the charleys were not necessarily reliable the report of one high constable who made an unannounced visit to their various lockups and boxes included remarks such as called out watch but could get no assistance no constable on duty found a watchman there at a great distance from his beat from thence went to the nightcellar and there found four of st clements watchmen drinking in the sixteenth century they were well known for coming very late to the watch sitting down in some common place of watching wherein some falleth on sleep by reason of labour or much drinking before or else nature requireth a rest in the night three hundred years later they were still being reviled as old codgers whose speed will keep pace with a snail and the strength of whose arm would not be able to arrest an old washerwoman of fourscore returned from a hard days fag at the washtub the watchmen were in turn the targets of rowdy or drunken bloods or bucks it was reported that a watchman found dozing in his box in the intervals of going his rounds to utter his monotonous cry was apt to be overturned box and all and left to kick and struggle helplessly like a turtle on its back until assistance arrived the charley was often assaulted by roarers as he made his way through the dark streets it is unlikely therefore that london was well policed through the fourteenth to eighteenth centuries the evidence suggests that the medieval concept of cooperation within ward and precinct prevailed for many hundreds of years the citizens of london themselves ensured that their city was at least relatively safe and an informal system of local justice prevailed pickpockets and prostitutes were ducked as were fraudulent doctors or merchants a cuckolded husband was given a charivari or scornful music of tin cans kettles and marrow bones it was a system of selfpolicing which must have been effective if only because the calls for a city police force were so long rejected but the growth of london demanded more effective measures of control in the s henry fielding almost singlehandedly established at bow street a police office which acted as a kind of headquarters for the suppression of london crime his thief takers or runners were known as robin redbreasts or raw lobsters because of their red vests their numbers increased from six to seventy by the end of the century while in seven other police offices were set up in various parts of the capital the old city of london protecting its medieval identity had already established its own regular police patrolsthe day police were formed in and were immediately identified with the blue greatcoat which they wore according to donald rumbelow in the triple tree to lend them an air of distinction when they provided the prisoners escort on execution day from such unhappy origins did the conventional police uniform emerge in the thames police office was instituted to protect quays and warehouses as well as the newly built docks along the river it was outside the usual system of ward and precinct seven years later a horse patrol was established to deter highwaymen there is a painting dating from of a watch house it is a twostoreyed building of early eighteenthcentury construction with shuttered windows on the ground floor it is situated on the west side of the piazza just beside the church of st pauls covent garden and shows several bluecoated and blackhatted policemen milling about its iron gateway there are potted plants on the top window ledge and the words watch house vividly painted on to the white brick façade the impression is that of an establishment nicely suited to its surroundings with the potted plants as a picturesque emblem of covent garden but the appearance is perhaps deceptive there are underground dungeons behind the queen anne façade and the painting was completed some six years after the passing of a metropolitan police act which profoundly altered the face of law and order in london the problem had been one of corruption as so often happens in the city those who were supposed to regulate criminal activity eventually began to condone or even encourage it the bow street runners were found to be receiving money and goods while congregating with villains in taverns this is illustrative of the citys demotic as well as commercial spirit it was with great difficulty therefore that robert peel was able to enforce proposals to establish an organised and centralised police force for london it was considered by some to be a direct threat to the citys liberty and according to the times an engine invented by despotism yet by excluding the old city police from his ministrations and by regaling a select committee with episodes of street crime and statistics of vagrancy he ensured the success of his proposals in the office of the new police was established in a small whitehall courtyard known as great scotland yard with a force of some three thousand men organised into seventeen divisions these are the officers to be seen in the painting of the covent garden watch house with their black top hats and blue swallowtail coats not popular in the streets of london they were known as blue devils or real blue collarers the latter an allusion to the depredations of cholera in the s when in an unarmed police constable was stabbed to death near clerkenwell green the coroners jury recorded a verdict of justifiable homicide the police came from the same class and neighbourhoods as the policed they were in that sense considered to be attempting to control and to arrest their own people like the runner before them they were also open to the charges of drunkenness and immorality but such offences were punished with summary dismissal with the result that according to the london encyclopaedia within four years fewer than one sixth of the original remained those who survived were known as crushers or coppers with the less vivid terms of peelers and bobbies coming from their association with robert peel those terms have been transmogrified into the modern old bill which in turn seems to share some of the derogatory tone of the previous charleys there is in fact a continuity in these forms of address in the middle of the twentieth century a policeman was often known as a bluebottle which is precisely the term that doll tearsheet hurls at a beadle in the second part of henry ivi will have you as soundly swindgd for this you blew bottle rogue over more recent years they have also been known as bogeys or rozzers slops or narks fuzz or pigs creepers or flatties yet historians of the london police have noted that within two or three decades robert peels force had acquired some degree of authority and success in its pursuit of crime allusions to the demeanour and appearance of the individual police officer are often made in this context the habitual state of mind towards the police of those who live by crime is not so much dislike as unmitigated slavish terror one observer wrote it was a way of suggesting that the darkness of london had been effectively dispelled by the bullseye lamp of the constables on the beat in a foreign traveller ventura de la vega noted their quasimilitary uniform with their blue coats closed in the front with a straight collar on which a white number is embroidered and their hats lined with steel when necessary he goes on they take from the back pocket of their coat a stick a half a yard long in the shape of a scepter which has an iron ball on the tip it is never used however since on hearing a policemans voice nobody answers and everybody obeys like a lamb so against the records of the violence and energy of the london crowd we must place this evidence of almost instinctive obedience of course this is not to claim that every costermonger or street trader cowered in fright at the advancing uniform the statistics of attacks upon the police then and now are testimony to that but the observers are correct in one general respect there does seem to be a critical point or mass at which the city somehow calms itself down and does not consume itself in general riot or insurrection a level of instability is reached only to retreat other shapes emerge to touch upon the very nature of london even in the twentyfirst century it might be suggested for example that the fenian explosion at clerkenwell prison in was part of a pattern which manifested itself at the canary wharf explosion by the ira in the trafalgar square riots of occupied the same space as the poll tax riots of march complaints about police incompetence and corruption are as old as the police force itself in an official investigation into the murder of a black teenager stephen lawrence revealed many instances of bad judgement and mismanagement it also suggested implicit racial prejudice within the police force which has indeed been bedevilled by that charge for fifty years ever since the first peeler put on his blue swallowtail coat the london police have been the object of derision and suspicion yet those officers lingering outside the covent garden watch house would no doubt have been surprised to learn that their arm of investigation would be extended to almost eight hundred square miles with the number of offences according to the latest statistical survey rising to over they would not have been quite so surprised to learn however that the clearup rate was only per cent chapter thereby hangs a tale there can be no calculation of the numbers of burnings and stonings beheadings and drownings hangings and crucifixions practised in roman and saxon times but by the fourteenth century we have written reports of a condemned man wearing a striped coat and white shoes his head covered with a hood and pinioned to a horse the hangman rode behind him the rope in his hand while his torturers rode beside him mocking him all the way from cheapside to smithfield this was a very public and formalised ritual of death making its way through the streets of london contrition and penance however were as important as any severity of punishment the penalty for one convicted of insulting an alderman was to walk with bare feet from the guildhall into cheapside and through fleet street carrying a threepound candle in the hands this carrying of a lighted candle was a common punishment for assaults upon the authority of civic leaders or the church and it suggests an atonement to london itself the preferred punishment for false trading was the pillory there the shopkeeper came literally face to face with those whom he had deceived the convicted man was drawn upon a horse facing the tail and wore a fools cap he might be preceded by a band of pipers and trumpeters on arrival at the pillorythere was one in cheapside and another in cornhill the goods deceitfully sold were burned before his face if he had committed fraud false coins or dice were suspended about his neck if he had been found guilty of lying a whetstone was hung around him as if representing a sharpened tongue the time of the punishment in the pillory was exactly measured for spreading lying reports that foreign merchants were to be allowed the same rights as freemenone hour for selling cups of base metal rather than silvertwo hours for selling stale slices of cooked congerone hour yet the timing was only one measure of pain and humiliation to be identified and paraded in front of neighbours and fellow tradesmen was for any citizen of london the cause of extreme embarrassment and shame it could also be perilous some were plied with rotten fruit fish and excrement but the most unpopular or unprincipled offenders were in danger of being pelted to death with sticks and stones it is a measure of londons conservatism or strictness that the pillory was not abolished until the summer of among the other sights of the city were the impaled heads of traitors above the main gateway of london bridge rose iron spikes upon which the remnants of condemned men were fixed in most illustrations five or six of these mementoes are generally depicted although it is not clear if demand outstripped supply in a german traveller counted nineteen or twenty which suggests that the civil conflicts of that unhappy period were fruitful in at least one respect in the following century the heads migrated to temple bar where people make a trade of letting spyglasses at a halfpenny a look they were also visible from a telescope set up in leicester fields which suggests that heads were a city attraction certainly the citizens seem to have become inured to these solemn spectacles of punishment except according to aleph when there had been a recent sufferer the curious would then stop to ask what new head is that in the late s oliver goldsmith was wandering in poets corner of westminster abbey with samuel johnson who surveying the memorial stones to the great dead muttered forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis there may be a chance that our name will be mingled with these but when they walked up to temple bar and observed the heads goldsmith stopped johnson and slily whispered me forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis during one memorable storm in march two heads of decapitated jacobites fell down mrs black the wife of the editor of the morning chronicle recalled how women shrieked as they fell men as i have heard shrieked one woman near me fainted thirty years later the iron spikes were finally removed from the malevolent bar there was no respite in hanging however in the fifteenth century eight offences merited that fate among them arson and petty treason the killing of a husband by his wife anyone who could read a passage from the bible known as the neck verse was deemed to be a cleric and therefore given over to the ecclesiastical authorities averting death was thus for two centuries one of the primary gifts of literacy from the twelfth century the favoured site for a hanging was tyburn the first of william longbeard being noted in and the last of john austen in the actual site of the gallows has been disputed the notoriety being given variously to connaught place or connaught square both on the edge of the desolate edgware road slightly to the north of marble arch but antiquarian research has revealed that the site lies on the southeast corner of connaught square a carpenter recalled that his uncle took up the stones on which the uprights of the gallows were placed when the square itself was being built in the s a low house on the corner was demolished and quantities of human bodies were found so some of the victims of the gallows were buried in situ other remains were discovered when the neighbouring streets and squares were laid out in the early decades of the nineteenth century and a house in upper bryanston street which overlooked the fatal spot had curious iron balconies to the windows of the first and second floors where the sheriffs sat to witness the executions there were also wooden galleries erected around the area like stands at a race course where seats were hired by curious spectators one notorious stallkeeper was known as mammy douglas the tyeburn pewopener yet of course and more especially the executioners themselves became notorious the first known public hangman was one bull who was followed by the more celebrated derrick and derrick must be his host dekker wrote of a horsethief in his bellman of london and tiburne the land at which he will light there was a proverbif derricks cables do but holdwhich referred to an ingenious structure like a crane upon which twentythree condemned could be hanged together this device was then put in more general use for unloading and hoisting vessels on board ships and still bears the executioners name derrick was succeeded by gregory brandon upon whose name several puns were elaboratedgregorian calendar and gregorian tree among themand who was in turn succeeded by his son richard who claimed the public office by inheritance squire dun followed and the post was then given to the notorious richard jaquet alias jack ketch in the s there were many tracts and ballads directed against ketch among them the tyburn ghost or strange downfal of the gallows a most true relation how the famous triple tree near paddington was pluckt up by the roots and demolisht by certain evil spirits with jack ketchs lamentation for the loss of his shop it was known as the triple tree because the gallows was triangular in shape with three posts or legs acting as supports each of the three beams could accommodate eight people and so marginally more effective than the derrick it was possible to hang twentyfour at the same time execution day was a monday those about to be hanged were taken in an open cart from newgate generally attended by a huge and enthusiastic crowd the english are a people that laughs at the delicacy of other nations one foreign traveller reported who make it such a mighty matter to be hanged he that is to be takes great care to get himself shaved and handsomely dressed either in mourning or in the dress of a bridegroom sometimes the girls dress in white with great silk scarves and carry baskets full of flowers and oranges scattering these favours all the way they go so the ceremonial way to tyburn was also the site of celebration it was customary for famous london criminals to wear white cockades in their hats as a sign of triumph or derision they were also an emblem occasionally of their innocence the more dashing or notorious criminals were handed a nosegay from the hand of one of the frail sisterhoodone of the prostitutes who stood before the church of holy sepulchre opposite the prison the procession made its way down snow hill and across holborn bridge down holborn hill and into holborn itself with those about to be hanged greeted with cheers or execrations they were always surrounded by a group of officers on horseback who restrained the crowds ferdinand de saussure in a foreign view of england noted some eighteenthcentury criminals going to their death perfectly unconcerned others so impenitent that they fill themselves full of liquor and mock at those who are repentant at the church of st gilesinthefield the malefactors were ritually handed jugs of ale after the prisoners had quenched their thirst the procession moved forward down broad st giles into oxford street and on to tyburn itself the cart was halted just before the gallows those about to die were escorted on to another carriage especially built like a platform for the occasion it was driven beneath the triple tree the halters were placed around the necks of the condemned the horses kicked into action and there the malefactors would be suspended until death overtook their pains at this point friends and relatives might be seen tugging at the hanging mens feet so that they should die quicker and not suffer when the corpses were cut down there was a general rush for them since the bodies of the hanged were believed to be of curious efficacy in the healing of disease the london encyclopaedia remarks upon one frenchman who noted a young woman with an appearance of beauty all pale and trembling in the arms of the executioner who submitted to have her bosom uncovered in the presence of thousands of spectators and the dead mans hand placed upon it there was a disturbing paganism latent beneath the surface of this piece of dramatic theatre in the midseventeenth century such a severed hand could command the price of ten guineas since the possession of the hand was thought to be of still greater efficacy in the cure of diseases and prevention of misfortunes there was also a general struggle over the body conducted between those who wished to retain it for their own purposes and those hired assistants come to transport it to the surgeons for dissection in the mêlée the populace often come to blows as to who will carry the bought corpses to the parents who are waiting in coaches and cabs to receive them it was all most diverting again according to ferdinand de saussure who was sitting in one of the stands which surrounded the whole event one thief and housebreaker john haynes displayed signs of life after being escorted to the house of a famous surgeon he was asked what he rememberedthe last thing i recollect was going up holborn hill in a cart i thought then that i was in a beautiful green field and that is all i remember till i found myself in your honours dissecting room so he came to death and to life babbling of green fields london did indeed become the city of the gallows in the morning post reported that the criminals capitally convicted at the old bailey shall in future be executed at the cross road near the mother red cap inn the halfway house to hampstead and that no galleries scaffolds or other temporary stages be built near the place this measure was promoted in order to curb rioting among the spectators at a time when a fierce radicalism characterised the politics of london the site of the executions was typically at a crossroads where the present camden town underground station now stands other crossroads were also used as a natural location for the gallows sending travellers upon their ambiguous journeythe division between the city road and goswell road in islington was once in usebut in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was also customary to hang offenders on or near the spot where their crimes had been committed in for example two arsonists were hanged in aldersgate street immediately opposite the house which they had fired the last recorded example of topographical killing occurred in skinner street in when a thief was despatched in front of the shop of a gunsmith which he had plundered at wapping lay execution dock the place of punishment for all those who had committed high crimes upon the high seas while the suspended bodies of the hanged could be seen swaying opposite blackwall and other sites along the thames such as bugsbys hole the bodies of the condemned could also be seen at aldgate and pentonville st giles and smithfield blackheath and finchley kennington common and hounslow heath so that these mementoes caught the attention of all those travelling into or out of london it was not a pleasant prospect murderers for example were first hung on the common gibbet their bodies are then covered with tallow and fat substances over this is placed a tarred shirt fastened down with iron bands and the bodies are hung with chains to the gibbet and there it hangs till it falls to dust why this should have been considered an appropriate spectacle for those leaving or entering london is another matter it is curiously reminiscent of the fact that the principal gates or entrances to the city were also used as prisons and suggests an attitude both defensive and minatory some forms of punishment however were more secret in newgate was a press reserved for those who refused to plead to their indictments here they were stripped and put in low dark chambers with as much weight of iron placed upon them as they could bear and more there to lie until they were dead there is an eighteenthcentury engraving of a felon one william spiggot under pressure in newgate he lies naked upon a bare floor his arms and legs stretched and pinioned to hooks against the walls upon his naked chest is a wooden board loaded down with great weights one gaoler bearing keys stands over him while another moves forward with a lighted candle to observe his sufferings this quasimedieval torture known as pressing to death continued until an apt indication of the barbarity of city justice in that spirit too the number of hanged rose in the latter part of the eighteenth century in one month of for example near one hundred and fifty persons have been committed to new prison and clerkenwell for robberies and other criminal offences it was said in the annual register that the reckless wretches seem almost to have crowded in crying you cannot hang us all but they could try soon enough however the venue of slaughter had changed the gradual spread of gentility to the west meant that the old tribal route from newgate to tyburn began to impinge upon the fashionable quarters close to oxford street so in the authorities removed the gallows to newgate itself thus cutting off the procession at its source the populace at large felt deprived of the spectacle of the cheat to use the cant term for the gallows and the more scholarly londoners felt that an habitual aspect of the city was being removed in an untimely fashion the age is running mad after innovation samuel johnson told boswell and tyburn is not safe from the fury of innovation no sir it is not an improvement they object that the old method drew together a number of spectators sir executions are intended to draw spectators if they dont draw spectators they dont answer their purpose the old method was most satisfactory to all parties the public was gratified by a procession the criminal was supported by it why is all this to be swept away boswell might have had his own answer he himself was addicted to the watching of executionsi had a sort of horrid eagerness to be there he once wrote of tyburnand through the good offices of richard ackerman the keeper of newgate was able to witness many hangings outside that prison the first newgate hanging was conducted on december but its revolutionary system of the new drop soon claimed more victims a few days after the sentence of death had been pronounced in the courtroom the malefactor was cast and the dead warrant sent down to his cell the newgate chronicles themselves detail the hours leading up to his appearance on the stage on the first night in the condemned cell the solemn notification of the impending blow keeps nearly all awake but soon they slept more easily all too have a fairly good appetite the same chronicler reports and eat with relish up to the last moment the italian boy condemned for murdering a french woman in the haymarket ate constantly and voraciously as if to stuff himself before the final exit one jeffreys who hanged his child in a cellar in seven dials called for roast duck as soon as he entered the condemned cell in the hour before execution the condemned man was led from his cell into a stonecold room which was the place where he was pinioned by the yeoman of the halter before being taken to the new drop the engine of death which was transportable was dragged by horses into grooves marked upon newgate street itself it consisted of a stage upon which were constructed three parallel beams the part of the stage next to the gaol had a covered platform here were the sheriffs seats while around it stood the interested spectators in the middle of the stage was a trapdoor ten feet long by eight feet wide above which the beams were placed the hour of execution was always eight oclock in the morning and a few minutes before that time the sheriffs brought out the prisoners upon the dropping of a flag the bolts holding up the trap were pulled and the convicted men or women fell or dropped to their deaths there are several contemporaneous prints displaying the new gallows in the old bailey with those about to suffer praying or weeping with halters about their necks around them hemmed in by soldiers are the crowd who stare up with fascination at the fatal stage in fact a contributor to the chronicles of newgate wrote that the change from tyburn to the old bailey had worked no improvement upon the crowd or its demeanour as many spectators as ever thronged to see the dreadful show and they were packed into more limited space displaying themselves as heretofore by brutal horseplay coarse jests and frantic yells on one occasion a few minutes of most dreadful suspense took place the culprits stood gazing at each other at last the chime struck upon the ear and the poor fellows seemed startled in defoes account of moll flanderss period in newgate the sound of the bell of holy sepulchre set up a dismal groaning and crying followed by a confused clamour in the house among the several prisoners expressing their awkward sorrows for the poor creatures that were to die some cried for them some brutishly huzzaed and wished them a good journey some damned and cursed those that had brought them to it the night before an execution outside newgate all the paraphernalia of executionthe gallows the barriers the platformshad to be set up these preparations naturally attracted a crowd of idle or interested observers the low taverns and beerhouses about newgate street smithfield and the fleet district are gorged with company who sally out at intervals to see how the workmen get on and knots of queerlooking fellows form here and there to discuss the following mornings proceedings the police moved them on but they clustered elsewhere just after midnight on sunday when most of the nightrevellers had been cleared the gin shops and coffee houses opened their doors and hired out their roomscomfortable room excellent situation beautiful prospects splendid view both roofs and windows in the vicinity were hired out five pounds were given for the attic storey of the lambs coffee house and a firstfloor front could command five times as much the crowd began to assemble at four or five in the morning and the whole area in front of newgate was packed by seven oclock by the time of the ceremony itself some of the spectators pressed up against the barriers for several hours had nearly fainted from exhaustion when governor wall was marched from the press yard towards the place of execution he was greeted with howls of abuse and execration from the other prisoners of newgate while the governor of goree in africa he had been responsible for the death of a soldier by excessive floggingone of those abuses of authority which londoners most detest his appearance on the scaffold was then accompanied by three harsh and prolonged shouts from the crowd assembled in newgate street after the hanging was over the yeoman of the halter offered portions of the rope for sale at one shilling per inch a woman known as rosy emma rumoured to be the yeomans wife exuberant in talk and hissing hot from pie corner where she had taken her morning dose of ginandbitters was selling parts of the fatal cord at a cheaper rate governor wall met his fate with fortitude and in silence arthur thistlewood condemned as one of the cato street conspirators in ascended the scaffold and exclaimed i shall soon know the last grand secret mrs manning convicted in of a more than usually unpleasant murderwith the connivance of her husband she had murdered her lover with a ripping chiselappeared upon the scaffold in a black satin dress her preference brought the costly stuff into disrepute and its unpopularity lasted for nearly thirty years it is curiously reminiscent of the case of mrs turner a notorious poisoner in the reign of james i she was a woman of fashion who had invented yellowstarched ruffs and cuffs hence her sentence was to be hangd at tiburn in her yellow tinny ruff and cuff she being the first inventor and wearer of that horrid garb to emphasise the moral the hangman on that day had his hands and cuffs painted yellow and from that time the coloured starch like mrs mannings black satin grew generally to be detested and disused it is a measure of the central importance of this ritual of execution that newgate and tyburn could affect the fashions of the day once more the idea of the city as spectacle asserts itself hanging then was essentially a form of street theatre when five pirates were hanged for mutiny in front of newgate the chronicles record that the upturned faces of the eager spectators resembled those of the gods at drury lane on boxing night the remarks heard amongst the crowd were of course ones of approval shelp me aint it fine a costermonger was heard to exclaim to his companion theatricality and savagery are subtly mingled the unceasing murmur of the crowd broke into a loud deep roar as the condemned man appeared there were calls of hats off and down in front as he approached the halter there followed a moment of silence abruptly broken by the drop itself at the moment of descent every link in that human chain is shaken along the whole lengthened line has the motion jarred the silence was replaced after that sudden jarring of the body of the city by a noise from the crowd like the dreamy murmur of an ocean shell and then more distinctly the familiar cries of the sellers of gingerbeer pies fried fish sandwiches and fruit together with the names of famous criminals whose tracts were still being advertised on the spot where they too once fell with these were soon mingled oaths fighting obscene conduct and still more filthy language together perhaps with the faintest note of disappointment there was always the hope or expectation that something might go wrongthat the condemned man might fight for his liberty or the engine of death might not function satisfactorily charles white condemned for arson in sprang forward at the exact moment the trap was opened and balanced on its edge while the crowd roared their encouragement as he struggled furiously with the executioner and his assistants he was eventually thrown down the drop with the hangman clinging to his legs in these instances the sympathy of the london crowd flooded instinctively to the condemned as if they were watching their own selves in the act of being despatched by the authorities of the state there were occasions when death upon the scaffold was accompanied by death upon the streets the execution of two murderers haggerty and holloway took place in february the anticipation was so great that close to people were packed in front of the prison and its vicinity even before the murderers appeared upon the scaffold women and children were trampled to death amid cries of murder at green arbour court opposite the debtors door of the prison a pieman stooped to pick up some of his broken wares and some of the mob not seeing what had happened stumbled over him no one who fell ever rose again elsewhere a cart filled with spectators broke down and many of those who were in it were trampled to death and yet amid these scenes of chaos and death the rite of execution continued only after the gallows had been taken down and the mob partly dispersed did the officers find the bodies of twentyeight dead and hundreds injured two great nineteenthcentury novelists seemed implicitly to recognise the emblematic significance of these monday mornings when the city gathered to acclaim the death of one of its own william makepeace thackeray rose at three on the morning of july in order to witness the hanging of a manservant benjamin courvoisier convicted of killing his master he recorded the scene in an essay going to see a man hanged in a carriage bound for snow hill thackeray followed the crowd intent upon seeing the execution by twenty minutes past four beside holy sepulchre many hundred people were in the street here thackeray registered his electric shock when he first caught sight of the gallows jutting from the door of newgate he asked those around them if they had seen many executions most assented and had the sight done them any good for the matter of that no people did not care about them at all and in a transcription of genuine london speech nobody ever thought of it after a bit the windows of the shops were soon filled with dandies and with quiet fat family parties while from a balcony an aristocratic rowdy squirted those assembled with brandy and soda from a siphon the crowd grew more eager as the hand of the clock came closer to eight when the bell of holy sepulchre tolled the hour all the men removed their hats and a great murmur arose more awful bizarre and indescribable than any sound i had ever before heard women and children began to shriek horribly and then a dreadful quick feverish kind of jangling noise mingled with the noise of the people and lasted for about two minutes this was a scene of fever and alarm as if the whole body of london was starting up from an uneasy sleep it was the noise almost inhuman which thackeray immediately noticed the man about to be hanged emerged from the prison door his arms were tied in front of him but he opened his hands in a helpless kind of way and clasped them once or twice together he turned his head here and there and looked about him for an instant with a wild imploring look his mouth was contracted with a sort of pitiful smile he walked quickly beneath the beam the executioner turned him round and put a black nightcap over the patients head and face thackeray could look no more the episode left him with an extraordinary feeling of terror and shame it is interesting that apparently inadvertently he uses the word patient to describe the condemned it was the same term applied to the prisoners of bridewell about to be flogged it is as if the city were a vast hospital filled with the diseased or the dying yet the city is also a surgeons hall where the novelist and the crowd were all the spectators of the doomed and the dead thackeray described it as a hidden lust after blood he was suggesting that there were permanent and atavistic forces at work charles dickens had gone down to newgate early that same morning just once he told his friends i should like to watch a scene like this and see the end of the drama here a great london novelist instinctively reaches for the appropriate word to mark the fatal occasion he found an upper room in a house close to the scene and paid for its hire from there he eagerly watched the movement of the london crowd which he was soon to revive in his account of the gordon riots in barnaby rudge and as he watched the mob he saw a tall familiar figurewhy there stands thackeray chance encounters in the streets of london suffuse the novels of dickens and in front of newgate amid the great crowd the actual life of london confirmed his vision nine years later on a cold november morning he rose from his bed to watch another execution the mannings were to be hanged outside horsemonger lane gaol in southwark and immediately after the event dickens wrote a letter to the morning chronicle there in the mob assembled before the prison he saw the image of the devil i believe that a sight so inconceivably awful as the wickedness and levity of the immense crowd could be presented in no heathen land under the sun here the evident paganism of london is given express form dickens like thackeray is appalled by the noise of the mob in particular the shrillness of the cries and howls like that feverish kind of jangling noise which thackeray heard there were screeching and laughing and yelling in strong chorus of parodies on negro melodies with substitutions of mrs manning for susannah faintings whistlings imitation of punch brutal jokes another mrs manning in the crowd itself proclaimed that she had a knife about her and threatened to murder another woman so that she might step up to the gibbet after her namesake the fury and excitement of the mob expressive of general contamination and corruption fill dickenss account of the proceedings he declared that there are not many phases of london life that could surprise me but he was astonished and alarmed by this experience the crowd outside newgate and horsemonger lane often jeered and hissed the executioner that of courvoisier and the mannings was one calcraft who had previously earned his living by flogging boys in newgate the mannings were his only victims in and his services were less and less frequently required between and there were approximately eighty executions a year but from to that figure was reduced to per annum william calcraft was succeeded by william marwood who perfected the long drop method he once declared that it would have been better for those i execute if they had preferred industry to idleness thus in a fatal thread connecting the exercise of his craft with hogarths depiction of the hanging of the idle apprentice marwood died of drink his most recent and celebrated successor within this unique profession was albert pierrepoint who boasted that he could kill a man within twenty seconds pierrepoints ministrations however were performed in silence and secrecy the last public hanging outside newgate was held in and from that time forward hangings took place in an especially constructed shed or hut behind prison walls ruth ellis was hanged within holloway prison in her execution and that of eighteenyearold derek bentley two years before materially assisted the campaign for the abolition of capital punishment the last execution in london took place in more than a hundred years after thackeray prayed for god to cleanse our land of blood yet here is another mystery of london according to city superstition to dream of the gallows is a prophecy of great good fortune money and blood still run together voracious london a detail from an aquatint by rowlandson entitled revellers at vauxhall the gardens of that area had been known for their gentility but they eventually degenerated into a place of drunkenness and sexual licence chapter into the vortex when in the early months of de quincey travelled towards london in an open carriage he experienced a suction so powerful felt along radii so vast and a consciousness at the same time that upon other radii still more vast both by land and by sea the same suction is operating the image here from his essay the nation of london is of a vast magnetic range drawing all the forces of the world towards its centre when he was within forty miles of london the dim presentiment of some vast capital reaches you obscurely and like a misgiving an unknown and unseen area of energy has found him out and leads him onwards one characteristic phrase london conquers most who enter it is perhaps now a truism there is a famous early nineteenthcentury cartoon which has been embellished and elaborated in a thousand different ways two men meet beside a london milestone one returning from the city is bowed and broken down the other advancing upon him full of animation and purposefulness shakes his hand and asks him is it paved with gold long ago walter besant remarked in east london it was discovered that london devours her own children it seems as if great city families die out or disappear within a century the principal names of the fifteenth century whittington and chichele had vanished by the sixteenth the families of seventeenthcentury london were no longer active in the eighteenth that is why london must continue to exert a continual attractive energy and pull in new people and new families to replenish the constant loss on the road to london de quincey had noted the vast droves of cattle all with their heads directed towards the capital but the city needs animal spirits as well as animals in records show that per cent of those given the freedom of the city by apprenticeship were born outside london an astonishing figure the annual migration to london in the first half of the eighteenth century was approximately ten thousand and in it was observed that for any son or daughter of an english family that exceeds the rest in beauty or wit or perhaps courage or industry or any other rare quality london is their north star the city is the lodestone or magnet by the capital was home to per cent of the population prompting defoes remark that this whole kingdom as well as the people as the land and even the sea in every part of it are employd to furnish something and i may add the best of every thing to supply the city of london with provisions a million people swarmed in the metropolis by the end of the eighteenth century within fifty years that figure had doubled and there was no sign of abatement who could wonder wrote an observer in that men are drawn into such a vortex even were the penalty heavier than this until the middle of the twentieth century the figures bear in one direction onlyever upward counting by the millions until in eight million are recorded to have inhabited greater london nearer our time these figures have diminished yet still the power which de quincey felt exerts its attraction a recent survey at the centrepoint night shelter only a few hundred yards from the old haven of st gilesinthefields discovered that four fifths of young people were from outside london and most were recent arrivals as ford madox ford has put it it never misses it never can miss anyone it loves nobody it needs nobody it tolerates all the types of mankind yet if london needs nobody in particular it requires everything to sustain its momentum it draws in commodities and markets and goods the anonymous author of letter from albion was suitably exultant it is impossible not to be astonished in seeing these riches displayed here the costly shawls from the east indies there brocades and silk tissues from china now a world of gold and silver plate an ocean of rings watches chains bracelets voracity repeating itself in endless different ways is one of the most prominent characteristics of london it was said of the museum of the royal college of surgeons a somewhat disturbing collection of anatomical specimens that the whole earth has been ransacked to enrich its stores to ransack is to pillage and to destroythat too is the nature of the city addison was worked up into a similar enthusiasm by the spectacle of the royal exchange making this metropolis a kind of emporium for the whole earth emporium in turn excites imperium since the master of trade is the master of the world the fruits of portugal are bartered for the silk of persia the pottery of china for the drugs of america tin is converted into gold and wool into rubies i am wonderfully delighted addison wrote in the spectator of may to see such a body of men thriving in their own private fortunes and at the same time promoting the public stock by bringing into the country whatever is wanting and carrying out of it whatever is superfluous here is an indication that london had become by the early eighteenth century the centre of world commerce it was the age of lotteries and flotations and bubbles everything was for salepolitical office religious preferment landed heiressesand said swift power which according to the old maxim was used to follow land is now gone over to money in the pilgrims progress john bunyan had also derided londons vanity whereby houses lands trades places honours preferments titles kingdoms lusts pleasures and delights of all sorts all come under the general denomination of trade by per cent of englands commerce with the world passed through london there was trade in money as well as goods the centre of commerce was also the centre of credit with the banker and the jobber taking over the spirit of the merchant adventurer the bankers emerged out of the company of goldsmiths goldsmiths knew how to protect their goods and for a time their offices had been used as informal places of safety for the deposit of money yet during the seventeenth century this primary function of hoarding and protecting was subtly supplanted by the issue of banking orders or cheques to facilitate the passage of revenue throughout the capital and beyond francis child and richard hoare had both been goldsmiths before establishing their banking houses with three or four others they were as edward earl of clarendon put it in his autobiography of men known to be so rich and of so good reputation that all the money of the kingdom would be trusted or deposited in their hands out of these banking ventures emerged the bank of england the single greatest emblem of the citys wealth and confidence the principal stockholders of this new bank were themselves london merchants but this essentially speculative venture was soon lent constitutional status when it was guarded by soldiers during the gordon riots of june its gold was turned into guineas at the mint of the tower of london and its huge reservoir of bullion was the prime agent in maintaining the financial stability of the nation through a succession of bubbles panics and wars yet even as it maintained good governance it expedited the adventures and trades of london businessmenfrom linen and diamond merchants to smallcoal men from the exporters of hats to the importers of sugar one of the key figures of the period derided in verse and drama was the stockbroker or jobber gay denounced a capital and an age where in sawcy state the griping broker sits they sat in fact in the coffee houses of change alley jobbers were the lineal descendants of the london scriveners who set up documents for the exchange of land or of houses but now they were concerned with the floating of companies and the transfer of stock or assets cibber anatomised the scene

grew too loud and the jobbers removed to new jonathans which in the summer of was renamed the stock exchange a little more than twenty years later a new building arose in capel court its voices

french pursuing four per cents for the opening the bank of england and the stock exchange still dominate this small compact area of land the mansion house stands close by on the site of the original stocks market where fish and flesh were traded from the thirteenth century and so this trinity of institutions may mark one of the citys sacred sites a study of successive maps shows the area being more and more darkly engraved as the building of the bank of england gradually grew in size until it took up the entire area between lothbury and threadneedle street to the south of this site during the great fire of john evelyn observed the concurrence of the two great fireballs it is not necessary to be a psychogeographer to recognise that this area is devoted to energy and to power and as the city incorporated more money and more credit so steadily it grew it stretched out to the west and to the east by the scheme of building cavendish square as well as certain streets to the north of the tyburn road was first suggested then came henrietta street and wigmore road the development of which prompted the extraordinary growth of marylebone in the s berkeley square emerged on the western side bethnal green and shadwell were built up in the east paddington and st pancras to the west the maps grew denser too so that one square of the map covered six squares of the map i have twice been going to stop my coach in piccadilly thinking there was a mob wrote horace walpole in only to realise that it was the usual londoners sauntering or trudging down the thoroughfare there will soon be one street from london to brentford he complained and from london to every village ten miles round he was announcing a law of life itself the direct consequence of power and wealth is expansion the eighteenthcentury improvements within the capital were also an aspect of that power and wealth lincolns inn fields was enclosed in and four years later the increasingly squalid stocks market was removed from the centre of the city in the houses upon london bridge were demolished and in the same year the noisome fleet ditch was filled and covered and the fleet river itself embanked four years later the city gates were removed in order to encourage freer access into the centre of london as the gates went so did the streetsigns making the thoroughfares more airy and wholesome but also divesting london of its old identity all these measures were designed to encourage the traffic of goods as well as of people allowing a freer circulation throughout the urban body with a novel emphasis placed upon speed and efficiency in this spirit too the westminster paving act of inaugurated legislation for lighting and paving throughout the city and thus initiated a general cleansing and clearing of the civic thoroughfares and in a city which brought in silk and spice coffee and bullion why should not light also be imported in the s a german visitor wrote that in oxford road alone there are more lamps than in all the city of paris they represented more illumination for the burgeoning centre of world commerce these measures had according to pughs life of hanway altogether introduced a degree of elegance and symmetry into the streets of the metropolis that is the admiration of all europe and far exceeds anything of the kind in the modern world symmetry is another expression of uniformity and in the building act of there was a further attempt at standardisation it categorised the types of london houses in a series of grades or rates so that the city might become as infinitely reproducible and as uniform as its currency this was the age of stucco or white light the public monuments were also a credit to commerce with such homages to trade as the new custom house the excise office in old broad street the corn exchange in mark lane and the coal exchange in lower thames street south sea house in threadneedle street and east india house in leadenhall street vied with one another for magnificence while the bank of england in rose to be continually embellished and enlarged the livery halls of the various trades too were constructed in terms of munificent display and then there was westminster bridge opened in the winter of to the accompaniment of trumpets and kettledrums its fifteen arches of stone spanned the river to create a bridge of magnificence it had a decisive effect upon the appearance of the city in another sense since its commissioners persuaded giovanni canaletto to visit london in order to paint it it was still in the course of construction when he depicted it in but already his vision of london was tempered by his venetian practice london became subtly stylised italianate stretching out along the thames in a pure and even light a city aspiring to fluency and grace had found its perfect delineator yet the diversity and contrast of london are nowhere better exemplified than in the fact that at the same time the city was being celebrated by william hogarth in the foreground of a new improved street hogarth shows a beggar child scoffing pieces of a broken pie chapter a cookery lesson one of the most cheerful origins of cockney is coquina the latin term for cookery london was once seen as a vast kitchen and the place of plenty and good fare thus as has already been observed it became cockaigne or the fabled land of good living in one year it consumed calves sheep and lambs swine sucking pigs as well as mackerel lb of cheese the great fire began in pudding lane and ended at pie corner where the golden figure of the fat boy still occupies a site he was once accompanied by an inscription noting this boy is in memory put up of the late fire of london occasioned by the sin of gluttony pie corner itself was known for its cookshops and in particular its dressed pork shadwell writes of meat dressed at pie corner by greasy scullions while jonson describes a hungry man there taking his meal by sniffing the steam from the stalls the steam of cooked meat drifted just a few yards from smithfield where the cooked flesh of the saints once also rose in smoke a twentyfirst century restaurant beside smithfield offers spleen and tripe pigs head and veal hearts as part of its menu a kitchen of the second century ad has been reconstructed in the museum of london it shows a large stove upon which were cooked portions of beef and pork duck and goose chicken and deer such was the profusion of wild life in the neighbouring woods and forests that london became a meateaters haven and so it has remained in recent years deep excavation of roman london has also revealed evidence of scattered oyster shells the stones of cherries and of plums the remnants of lentils and cucumbers peas and walnuts one surviving beaker or amphora from southwark bears the advertisement lucius tettius aficanus supplies the finest fish sauce from antipolis the diet of the saxon londoner was less exotic at the times of noonmeat and evenmeat a staple diet of flesh was enlivened by leeks onions garlic turnips and radishes an ox had a value of six shillings a pig one shilling but there is also evidence that at a slightly later date londoners demanded a plentiful supply of eels at various spots along the thames there were eel fisheries which date back at least as far as the eleventh century from this century too excavations beneath st pancras have uncovered more plumstones and cherrystones bread was the most important commodity throughout londons history there are many city regulations of the thirteenth century concerning the conduct of bakers whose profession was divided into those who made white bread and those who made tourte bread pouffe was french bread simnel or wastel white bread fine as well as common bis brown bread and tourte the inferior bread the principal bakers were situated to the east in stratford and the loaves were carried by long carts to the various shops and stalls within the city bread was indeed the staple of life scarce supplies in for example had the direct consequence that fifteen thousand of the poor perished shiploads of wheat and grain were imported from germany and certain london nobles distributed bread to the crowd but innumerable multitudes of poor people died and their bodies were all lying about swollen from want the permanent contrast in london between need and abundance has taken many different forms in the more prosperous years of the thirteenth century however the diet of the citizen included beef mutton and pork together with lampreys porpoise and sturgeon vegetables were not greatly in demand but there was a particular delicacy known as soup of cabbage londoners had also invented a kind of mixed meat dish created by pounding together pork and poultry into one concoction a household book at the end of the thirteenth century reveals that on fish days there was also a choice of herrings eels lampreys salmon and on meat days a similar variety of pork mutton beef fowls pigeons and larks together with eggs saffron and spices the records of the fourteenth century are less descriptive but stow denotes and as years of want when a diet of apples and nuts was forced upon the poor it is an open question whether the poor ever lived well even in years of prosperity the average wage of a london labourer was sixpence a day while a capon pasty cost eightpence and a hen pasty fivepence a roast goose could be purchased for sevenpence while ten finches cost one penny ten cooked eggs also cost a penny and a leg of pork threepence oysters and other shellfish were cheap as were thrushes and larks here then is evidence of a strangely assorted diet complemented by rich delicaciesgruel of almondes a potage of whelks blancmaung of fysshe gruel of porke pigges in sawce in chaucers canterbury tales c the cook is employed to boil the chicken and the marrow bones maken mortrewes and well bake a piea mortrewe being a soup whose ingredients included fish pork chicken eggs bread pepper and ale one must also imagine the hasty londoner picking up a roasted lark or thrush from a cooks stall and eating it as he makes his way along the thoroughfare perhaps picking his teeth with the bones before discarding the remains by the side of the road in the fifteenth century the main dish remained that of meatswan roasted capons venison in broth coney partridges and roasted cocks together with very sweet compound desserts such as leche lombarde which was a kind of jelly made of cream isinglass sugar almonds salt eggs raisins dates pepper and spices all dishes seem to have been highly spiced with herbs for meat in particular demand the author of london lickpenny is assailed by merchants of newgatecomes me one cryd hot shepes feeteone cryd mackereland as he wanders down into east cheap one crys rybbs of befe and many a pye the evidence of fifteenthcentury kitchens and monastic gardens given by an authority known simply as mayster ion gardener is of sage chickweed borage rosemary fennel and thyme as the staple vegetable diet the other favoured vegetables were garlike onions and lekes which does not suggest much taste for green vegetables a change in that diet is marked by the tudor chronicler harrison who notes that in old daysby which he means the thirteenth centuryherbs and roots were in great demand but that they became less frequently used in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries yet in my time their use is not only resumed among the poore comonsi mean of melons pompines gourds cucumbers radishes carrots marrowes turnips and all kind of salad herbesbut they are also looked upon as deintie dishes at the tables of delicate merchants gentlemen at times of commercial success and plenty however meat is often required to maintain the animal spirits of londoners that is perhaps why there is so much emphasis in the contemporary chronicles on feasting as a way of exemplifying the power and wealth of the city stow writes of one such occasion that it would be tedious to set down all the preparation of fish flesh and other victuals spent in this feast but then goes on to enumerate the twentyfour oxen the hundred sheep the fiftyone deer the thirtyfour boars the ninetyone pigs there were variations in diet according to the season with fresh herrings at michaelmas pork and sprats at all saints veal and bacon at easter in the summer of a venetian observer noticed that the native population enjoyed raw oysters with barley bread other dietary habits were changed by law after the partial relaxation of the intricate fast laws for example cheap meat was often substituted for fish alterations were also fostered by voyages of discovery yams or sweet potatoes from virginia and rhubarb from china became sixteenthcentury commodities in a city which plucked its fruits from every known country in the early seventeenth century we read of the almost emblematic significance of roast beef as well as fresh oysters as a token of civic existence these were invariably followed by a dessert of milk puddings or apple pippin to come in pudding time is as much as to say to come in the most lucky moment in the world according to misson de valbourg in the early years of the century in the houses of the more affluent citizens roast beef and pudding were sometimes exchanged for a piece of boild beeff and then they salt it some days beforehand and besiege it with five or six heaps of cabbage carrots turnips or some other herbs or roots well pepperd and salted and swimming in butter for more delicate fare the london household would sit around a gridiron roasting slices of buttered bread this is calld toast from the seventeenth century too comes evidence of the food available from the hawkers of london the illustrator marcellus laroon places the costermonger or regrater crying out buy my fat chicken next to the female huckster selling ripe speragas because chicken and asparagus together were considered by londoners to be a dainty dish chicken was cheap too that and rabbit seem to have been the only meats on sale in the streets the rabbitseller shouting buy a rabbet a rabbet was likely to have been an irishman who came to london in the autumn with his wares those sent out to buy from him were advised that for being new killed you must judge by the scent milk and water were carried through the streets in vessels but not wine cherries were available in early summer followed by strawberries later in the season and apples in the autumn from autumn to winter the costermonger sold her pears or wardens baking hot from a pot she balanced upon her head the countrymans attitude to these city fruits is perhaps best exemplified by matthew bramble in smolletts humphry clinker who declared that i need not dwell upon the pallid contaminated mash which they call strawberries soiled and tossed by greasy paws through twenty baskets crusted with dirt here the emphasis is upon dirt of course but also the endemic overpopulation of london wherein every item is passed through a selection of anonymous paws eels were a cheap element of the londoners diet sold alive generally by female vendors they were skinned on the spot before being used in pies or pastries they were not the only fish hawked about the main thoroughfare crabs were cheap as were mackerel and flounders while oysters were purchased for twelve pence a peck or approximately two gallons from the countryside came the young man trading lilly white vinegar three pence a quart made from cider or white wine vinegar was employed as a sauce and as a preventive against disease but its main use was as a preservative almost anything could be pickled including walnuts cauliflowers peaches onions lemons oysters and asparagus by the eighteenth century roast beef was described as being of old england although in fact it had been only one of many meats burdening the tables of earlier centuries as a token of national character the myth of roast beef may owe more to the observations of foreign visitors that londoners were entirely carnivorous with the prevailing assumption of voraciousness in may a great meat pudding eighteen feet two inches in length and four feet in diameter was dragged by six asses to the swan tavern in fish street hill but apparently its smell was too much for the gluttony of the londoners the escort was routed the pudding taken and devoured a foreigner wrote a german pastor visiting london in will be surprised to see what flesheaters the english are he will be struck with the sight of an enormous piece of beef such perhaps as he never saw in his life placed before him upon the table the same observer also noted that the common people in london insisted upon daily beef or mutton together with white bread and strong beer the meat may not necessarily have taken the form of rib or haunch however since in the s beef sausages became the culinary fashion one other aspect of the pastors account is of interest in those passages where he remarks upon the fact that londoners require their food and drink to be vivid in colour the brandy and wine must be deeply coloured the vegetables as bright and as green as when gathered cabbage and peas for example are not boiled for fear they should lose their colour it is perhaps an intimation of the unnaturalness of the london palate in a city of spectacle even the food must be completely seen before being understood but it may also be a symptom of a certain craving after effect which may itself be unhealthy he observes the whiteness of the veal and mentions that the calves are made to lick chalk in order to procure that colour he also notices that the poorer londoners are much prejudiced in respect of the colour the whiter the bread is the better they think it to be one of smolletts characters considered the white bread to be nothing more than a deleterious paste mixed up with chalk alum and boneashes so londoners mistake the nature of things by judging upon appearances alone this of course was also the criticism of social moralists who saw villains and parvenus accepted as gentlemen because of their dress and manners yet there are also intimations of a revulsion against so much greedy consumption what should they do as the poet john lewkenor put it with all this greasie meat another of smolletts heroes enters a cookshop filled with steams of boiled beef where the sight of skinofbeef tripe cowheel or sausages turned my stomach in this same period the worshipful company of butchers in debt and pestered by competition in the suburbs proved wholly incapable of enforcing regulations on the sale of meat every kind of shoddy or mouldy flesh could be purchased once more the unchecked reign of commerce becomes a symbol of city life so it was that in the early part of the nineteenth century food processing took its place beside the manufactories along the thames essences of meat and meat sauces came from london bridge while tinned meat or patent beef came from bermondsey this was the century of anchovy paste and preserved tongue of clarified butter and tinned pâté de foie gras there were also more familiar items accounts describe nineteenthcentury travellers breakfasting off ham tongue and a devil kidney or dining off mutton chop rump steak and a weal cutlet while in less splendid establishments the fare included hams and sirloins the remnants of geese and turkeys codfish reduced to the gills fins and tail but the overwhelming mass of evidence still concerns food provided by the streetsellers of the period with a restless large and rapidly moving population the equivalent of fastfood was the most characteristic and appropriate form of sustenance whether they bought fried fish sold in oily paper or boiled puddings in cotton bags it was the custom of the poorer citizens to eat upon the stones newlaid eggs were for sale on holborn hill and pork in broad st giles there was also the ubiquitous bakedpotato stall as well as the shops plying roly poly or plum duff one trader in whitechapel informed henry mayhew that he sold pennyworths of pudding in a day two thirds of this quantity he sold to juveniles under fifteen years of age the boys are often tiresome mister theyll say cant you give us a plummier bit than this or is it just up i likes it ot all ot in competition with these hot delicacies came sandwiches hailed as one of our greatest institutions by charles dickens who saw them in an image of perpetual activity and perpetual consumption being engorged by the shelfload at the britannia theatre in hoxton the times of that consumption have changed both in the commercial and the fashionable areas of the city an entire history of social manners might be constructed from the essential fact that over the last five centuries the time for eating dinner or the main meal of the day has advanced by approximately ten hours in the late fifteenth century many londoners dined at ten oclock in the forenoon although others delayed for a further hour in the sixteenth century the hour for meat varied between eleven and twelve but no later in the seventeenth century the hours of twelve and one became common but then in the early decades of the eighteenth century there was a rapid acceleration of mealtime by two oclock was the appropriate hour and by three was considered the vital moment in the last decades of the eighteenth and the first of the nineteenth the dinner hour slid to five or six then harriet beecher stowe writing about london life in the s noted that dinner at eight or even nine oclock in the evening was considered appropriate at aristocratic tables the reason for this postponement of the main meal was credited by eighteenthcentury moralists to the decline of moral fibre and the rise of social decadence as if it were important to devour food before successfully devouring the day but a more specific circumstance may have assisted the process particularly in the early decades of the eighteenth century when according to grosley the hour of going to change interfered with dinner time so that the merchants thought it most advisable not to dine till their return from change once more commercial imperatives play their part within the intimate texture of london life chapter eat in or take away eatinghouses or restaurants have for many centuries been an intricate part of that texture in the twelfth century one monk describes a great public place of cookery by the thames where ordinary flesh and fish could be purchasedroasted fried or boiledwhile the more dainty could order venison no doubt with ale or wine for refreshment it may lay claim to being the first london restaurant except that one historian of london believes that this place of city refreshment was in fact a survival of a roman public kitchen in that case the tradition of london hospitality is ancient indeed the twelfthcentury version included for example a dining room for the rich man an eatinghouse for the poor man with a version of takeaway in the event of friends calling unexpectedly certainly it was a large operation perhaps equivalent to terence conrans vast eateries in soho and the west end since according to william fitzstephen whatsoever multitude of soldiers or other strangers enter into the city at any hour of the day or night or else are about to depart they may turn in the number of these eatinghouses multiplied as the population increased so that by the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries there were many cookshops clustered in bread street and east cheap these thoroughfares were known as the quarters for eatinghouses where under the supervision of the civic authorities the price of meals was strictly controlled sometimes the customers would bring their own food with them to be cooked in ovens on the spot with the price varying from a penny to twopence for the cost of fire and labour the ordinaries were a sixteenthcentury variation upon the cookshop there were twelvepenny ordinaries as well as threepenny ordinaries the price varying according to style and comfort as well as the cost of the main meal wooden benches and trestle tables stood on a rushstrewn floor and the tapster or his boy wandered among the customers crying out what do you lack or what is it that you would have brought meat poultry game and pastry were served in succeeding order to be at your woodcocks meant that you had almost finished eating the citizens arrived about eleven thirty and wandered about singly or in groups waiting for their meat to be served while some published their clothes and talked as loud as they could in order to feel at ease it was indeed an easy environment and it became the pattern of the london eatinghouse continuing well into the succeeding century in the late seventeenth century there is a description by françois misson of the butchers meat on the menu in just such a placebeef mutton veal pork and lamb you have what quantity you please cut off fat lean much or little done with this a little salt and mustard upon the side of a plate a bottle of beer and a roll at the end of the meal when the payment or reckoning was made the server carried a basket to the table and with a knife cleared away the crumbs of bread and morsels of meat in many such establishments there was a best room for those with delicate or expensive appetites while for the ordinary citizen a sixpenny plate in the publick room would suffice these eatinghouses had by now migrated far beyond the bounds of east cheap and bread street towards the populous areas of the capital bishopsgate street lincolns inn fields the old bailey covent garden haymarket and many others besides all had their local and wellfrequented places of call in the eighteenth century they became known as beefhouses or chophouses together with taverns specialising in more formal or protracted meals dollys chophouse in paternoster row was a particular favourite serving its meats hot and hotwhich is to say delivered up as quickly as they were cooked there was also a famous resort of cookshops behind st martininthefields known to the natives as porridge island it was a somewhat unsavoury haunt however where gin and ale provided as much sustenance as the food carried from the cook under cover of a pewter plate yet of course the most famous establishments of eighteenthcentury london were the coffee houses in fact they found their origins in the middle of the previous century when according to a contemporary note recorded in the topography of london theire ware also att this time a turkish drink to be sould almost in eury street called coffee and another kind of drink called tee and also a drink called chacolate which was a very harty drink the first coffee house was set up in st michaels alley off cornhill in two or three years later a second was established close by in st michaels churchyard a third the rainbow located in fleet street by the gate of the inner temple was prosecuted in for being a great nuisance and prejudice to the neighbourhood the principal complaint was of evil smells as well as the danger of fire yet the popularity of coffee houses among londoners immediately became apparent both from the convenience of being able to make appointments in any part of town as macaulay said and the further convenience of being able to pass evenings socially at a very small charge by the turn of the century there were some two thousand of them in the capital an anonymous painting of one dated approximately shows several bewigged gentlemen sitting down to dishes of coffee there are candles upon the tables while the floor is of bare wood one customer is smoking a long clay pipe others are reading periodicals one such periodical the spectator opened its first number in the spring of with an account of the world of coffee houses sometimes i am seen thrusting my head into a round of politicians at wills and listning with great attention to the narratives that are made in those little circular audiences sometimes i smoak a pipe at childs and whilst i seem attentive to nothing but the postman overhear the conversation of every table in the room i appear on sunday nights at st jamess coffeehouse and sometimes join the little committee of politicks in the inner room as one who comes there to hear and to improve my face is likewise very well known at the grecian the cocoatree in all these coffee houses the news and rumours of the day were disseminated there were coffee houses for every trade and every profession and macaulay noted that foreigners remarked that the coffeehouse was that which especially distinguished london from all other cities that the coffeehouse was the londoners home and that those who wished to find a gentleman commonly asked not whether he lived in fleet street or chancery lane but whether he frequented the grecian or the rainbow the famous doctor john radcliffe travelled from bow street to garraways coffee house in change alley cornhill where at a particular table he was always to be found surrounded by surgeons and apothecaries he timed his visits at the hour when the exchange was full no doubt in the hope of also being attended by rich merchants and brokers in other coffee houses lawyers met clients and brokers met each other merchants drank coffee with customers and politicians drank tea with journalists the virginia and maryland coffee house in threadneedle street became a recognised meetingplace for those engaged in business with russia and so changed its name to the baltic the jerusalem in cornhill was the haven of west indies trade while batsons in cornhill was a kind of consulting room for doctors waiting to receive their clients in the city old slaughters coffee house in st martins lane became the recognised centre for london artists st jamess of st jamess street was for whigs while down the road the cocoatree at the corner of pall mall was the haunt of tories and jacobites the grecian in devereux court catered for lawyers wills on the north side of russell street covent garden was a haven for wits and authors there was even a floating coffee house a boat moored off the stairs of somerset house which was called the folley it was as bulky as a manofwar and was divided into several rooms serving coffee tea and spiritous liquours like many london establishments on the river it began with fashionable company but by degrees attracted drunken or disreputable customers until it seems to have become little more than a floating brothel at length it decayed and was sold for firewood not being on land it had no tenacity of purpose coffee houses on land or on water were generally somewhat dingy places reeking of tobacco the wooden floor was often sanded with spittoons liberally placed in some the tables and chairs were stained and dirty while in others there were boxes with upright backs and narrow seats the lamps smoked and the candles spluttered so why were they thronged with ordinary citizens and why did they like the twentiethcentury public house become a token of city life there was as always a commercial reason the coffee houses acted as countinghouses and auction rooms offices and shops in which merchants and agents clerks and brokers could engage in business agents who sold estates or property would meet their clients in such places while the sale of other goods was also encouraged in for example one could read the somewhat chilling notice a black boy twelve years of age fit to wait on a gentleman to be disposed of at deniss coffeehouse in finch lane the ambience itself could also be used to commercial advantage and sales by auction became a coffeehouse speciality at the inchofcandle sales at garraways coffee alcohol and muffins were employed to encourage the bidding garraways was opposite the exchange and therefore a harbour for people of quality who have business in the city and for wealthy citizens as a result there were sales of books and pictures tea and furniture wine and hard wood wide and lowroofed with boxes and seats running down its sides it had a broad central stairway that led to the sale room upstairs in such proximity that business and entertainment were curiously mingled its genial aspect complete with seacoal fire and muffins toasting on forks is compounded by the description of its customers by aleph in london scenes and london people in admirable humour sly jokes were circulating from ear to ear everybody appeared to know everybody but in london appearances can be deceptive swift commenting upon the effects of the bursting of the south sea bubble in which fortunes were lost upon the crash of the south sea company in describes the speculators on garraways cliffs as a savage race by shipwrecks fed i am quite familiar at the chapter coffeehouse wrote thomas chatterton to his mother in may and know all the geniuses there the haunt of booksellers and aspiring writers the chapter was situated on the corner of paternoster row opposite ivy lane and was characteristic of its class with smallpaned windows wainscoted walls and low ceilings with heavy beams making it dark even at noon when chatterton wrote of the geniuses he may have been referring to a small club of publishers and writers who always sat in the box in the northeast corner of the house and called themselves the wet paper club when they chose to recommend a good book it was of course one that had sold extensively and rapidly in this context and company it is perhaps worth recalling that chattertons apparent suicide was considered to be the direct result of his inability to profit from the commercial practices of the london publishing world the chapter was also known for its custom among the clergy since according to aleph it was a house of call for poor parsons who were in hire to perform sunday duty and who also wrote sermons on request the discourses varied in price from s d to s da buyer had only to name his subject and doctrine and the appropriate pious lesson would be delivered if there was a glut of the commodity of charity sermons a moving appeal for example for a parish school could be obtained at a very cheap rate prices at the chapter were on a par with other such establishments at the turn of the nineteenth century a cup of coffee was fivepence while four ham sandwiches with a glass of sherry cost twopence a pot of tea serving three cups together with six slices of bread and butter a muffin and two crumpets cost tenpenceor rather a shilling since twopence extra went to the head waiter william one of those london types who seem forever fixed in the establishment where they work a figure entirely made out of the quintessence of london of average height somewhat stout william was rumoured to have money in funds he was imperturbable always civil and as the ever observant aleph put it carefully dressed in a better black cloth suit than many of the visitors wearing knee breeches black silk hose and a spotless white cravat of few words he was always attentive his eyes were in every corner of the room he expected his tip of a penny or twopence but had moments of unexpected generosity when he suspected a customer was very needy he would bring him two muffins and only charge for one he was on easy terms with regulars who always called him simply william but he inspected strangers with inquisitive looks those whom he deemed not suitable for admission were dismissed by suggesting that they must have mistaken the housethe blue boar was in warwick lane to this coffee house of hacks or pendrivers seventy years after chatterton came charlotte and emily brontë en route to belgium charlotte recalled a head waiter a greyhaired elderly man it is likely to have been william he led them to a room upstairs which looked out upon paternoster row here they sat by the window but could see nothing of motion or of change in the grim dark houses opposite the street itself was so quiet that every footfall could be distinctly heard one of charlotte brontës heroines lucy snowe in villette spends her first night in london in the very same coffee house she looks out of her window on the following morning and above my head above the housetops coelevate almost with the clouds i saw a solemn orbed mass darkblue and dimthe dome while i looked my inner self moved my spirit shook its alwaysfettered wings half loose i had a sudden feeling as if i who have never yet truly lived were at last about to taste life so in the shadow of st pauls the london coffee house could produce revelations the coffee houses lingered well into nineteenthcentury london when some became specialised exchanges others turned into clubs or private hotels while others again became dininghouses complete with polished mahogany tables oillamps and boxes with green curtains dividing them at the beginning of the nineteenth century another kind of coffee house altogether emerged which catered for the breakfasts of labourers or porters on their way to work it served chops and kidneys bread and pickles one familiar order was tea and an egg in many of them different rooms charged different prices for coffee at four oclock in the morning the poor customer would have a cup of coffee and a thin slice of bread and butter for one penny halfpenny at eight oclock breakfast for the less impoverished would include a penny loaf a pennyworth of butter and a coffee for threepence arthur morrison in a child of the jago describes a coffee house with shrivelled bloaters doubtful cake pallid scones and stale pickles yet it was still a more respectable establishment than the neighbouring cookshop filled with steam and may have given rise to that cockney expression in the depths of poverty or despairi wish i was dead an kep a cawfy shop in one of his visitations to the east end charles booth entered a rough coffeehouse and found a long counter on which were piled in rude plenty many loaves of bread flitches of bacon a quantity of butter two teaurns three beer pumps for kops ale and a glass jar filled with pickled onions note the ubiquity of the pickle londoners love sharpness thirty years later george orwell entered a coffee house on tower hill and found himself in a little stuffy room with highbacked pews that had been fashionable in the s when he asked for tea and bread and butterthe staple of the workingclass breakfast since the beginning of the nineteenth centuryhe was told no butter only marg there was also a notice upon the wall to the effect that pocketing the sugar is not allowed there were other places for a meagre breakfast early breakfast houses were essentially coffee shops by another name stiflingly hot with the flavour of coffee mingling with the odours of fried rashers of bacon and others not by any means so agreeable ever since the eighteenth century there had also been early breakfast stalls which were essentially kitchen tables set up at the corner of a street or the foot of a bridge purveying halfpenny slabs of bread and butter together with large pots of tea or coffee heated over charcoal fires these in turn were succeeded by more elaborate coffee stalls which were constructed on the pattern of a medieval london shop with a wooden interior and shutters they were generally painted red ran on wheels and were led by a horse to familiar locations at charing cross at the foot of savoy street on westminster bridge below waterloo bridge by hyde park corner and by west india dock gates they sold everything from saveloys to hardboiled eggs as well as coffee and woods woodbine cigarettes there is an animated painting dated which depicts a variety of londoners congregating around a day stall set up outside the gates of a park or square the female proprietor is washing up a cupmost of the stalls were indeed run by women on the principle maintained by many public houses of the present day that aggressive customers were less likely to cause trouble and offence if a female was present there is bread on the table but no sign of the ham sandwiches and water cresses which were also part of the daily menu a boy in a red jacket bearing the livery of the city of london sits in a wheelbarrow and blows upon his saucer of liquid he was one of those employed by the city to run after horses in the street and scoop up their manure a female crossingsweeper and a female vendor both with expressions of sorrow or perplexity seem to be looking on at the feast a welldressed young lady with umbrella and bandbox sips delicately from her cup on the other side of the stall it is a suggestive picture of late victorian london in competition with such a stall was the bakedpotato van a portable oven wheeled around the streets there were also oyster stalls where londoners as the saying goes ate on their thumbs the ordinaries and the eatinghouses continued well into the nineteenth century as chophouses or hamandbeef shops or àlamode beefhouses there were also taverns or public houses where it was customary for the client to bring in his own piece of meat which was then dressed and cooked upon a gridiron by a waiter who charged a penny for the service the origin of twentiethcentury pub food lies in these nineteenthcentury establishments where fine old cheese and mutton pies and baked potatoes were generally on sale by the counter the old chophouses and beefhouses were not necessarily of good reputation nathaniel hawthorne described one such establishment in the english notebooks with a filthy tablecloth covered with other peoples crumbs iron forks a leaden salt cellar the commonest earthen plates a little dark stall to sit and eat in he noticed that the conditions of this place the albert diningrooms were not uncommon it was a measure of the discomfort and dirtiness to which londoners historically have accommodated themselves there were gradations in service and comfort however in the more formal dininghouse a waiter with napkin over his left arm would announce to the client what was just ready in a rapid but monotonous tone he would go through the list of roast beef boiled beef roast haunch of mutton boiled pork roast veal and ham salmon and shrimp sauce pigeonpie rumpsteak pudding in the àlamode beefhouses there was a sixpenny plate and a fourpenny platetwo sixes and a four the waiter would call out to the cook in a nearby kitchen such places of resort having dominated london in various forms for several centuries were displaced in the latter half of the nineteenth century by dininghalls restaurants associated with the new hotels and refreshment rooms connected to the new railway stations they were not necessarily an improvement on their predecessors in fact londons reputation as the purveyor of drab and unpalatable food began essentially in the midnineteenth century henry james in was scathing about londons restaurants whose badness is literally fabulous and yet they flourished the st jamess hotel was reputed to be the one in which separate tables for dining were first introduced but it was m ritz who capitalised upon the idea the advent of his hotel restaurant effectively ended the old london fashion of people dining together at large tables from the s the number of restaurants diningrooms and luncheon bars multipliedthe café royal opened in and the criterion restaurant like many named after an adjacent theatre in spiers and pond gaiety restaurant next to the gaiety theatre in the strand opened in there is a photograph of its restaurant amp ballroom a hansom is parked outside with men in top hats milling about the entrance a contemporary description in building news mentions a luncheon bar a café and two diningrooms all fitted out with an ostentation of design worthy of the stained glass designer or even the scene painter restaurant and theatre were eventually swept aside for the construction of aldwych social changes were engineered by the advent of the restaurant women for example were no longer excluded from dinner walter besant wrote in the early twentieth century that ladies can and do go to these restaurants without reproach their presence has made a great alteration there is always an atmosphere of cheerfulness if not of exhilaration a description which by indirection suggests the somewhat mournful or low tone of the oldfashioned allmale chophouse the first restaurant to introduce music during meals was gattis at charing cross and the fashion spread quickly until by the s only the café royal remained defiantly silent with the new century too came the fashion for dancing at dinner and even between the courses other alterations were more gradual and subtler ralph nevill the author of night life in noted that the pace of the victorian restaurant had been much slower with always a pause between the appearance of the various dishes as opposed to the speed and hustle of modern restaurants which the author ascribed to the advent of the motor on the streets of london in the city everything connects in the new century too emerged the great chain of lyons corner houses they were instituted in and sprang from a number of tea shops and restaurants established at the very end of the nineteenth centuryincluding the first entirely underground restaurant lyons of throgmorton street with a grill room forty feet below ground level all types of londoners mingled within the plainer london coffee houses similarly the london tea shops were considered to be democratic in the mixture of classes that you see therein seated together eating and drinking the same things theodore dreiser visited a lyons just above regent street in and observed a great chamber decorated after the fashion of a palace ballroom with immense chandeliers of prismed glass hanging from the ceiling and a balcony furnished in cream and gold yet the dishes were homely and the customers very commonplace here then the demotic and theatrical characteristics of city living were effortlessly combined there is a vivid account of east end food at the beginning of the twentieth century in walter besants east london with descriptions of salt fish for sunday morning breakfast of slabs of pastry known as nelson of the evening trade in faggots saveloys and pease pudding and of course of the ubiquitous piehouses or eelpie saloons where jellied eels saveloys or hot meat pies with mashed potatoes were the standard fare these were rivalled only by the fishandchip shops in the years before the second world war a typical cockney menu would comprise saveloy and pease pudding german sausages and black pudding fried fish and pickles pie crust and potatoes faggot and mustard pickle strong tea and lashings of bread and butter were the other staples of life the situation was more complex in other parts of london where there was much less emphasis upon a traditional cuisine but the standard dish was always meat potatoes and two veg swimming in gravy thus reinforcing londons reputation as a city with no real culinary skills between the wars and after the second world war londons restaurants were considered very much below the standard of other european capitals some were restaurants of the middling english sort serving beef and mutton and greens sausage and mash apricots and custard but in soho the restaurant trade flourished because of the influence of french italian spanish russian and chinese cooking in the purlieus of soho too an informality of eating was introduced or rather reintroduced the first sandwich bar sandys of oxendon street was opened in very soon sandwich bars and the new snack bars were springing up all over the capital this revolution in taste was complemented twenty years later by the opening of the first coffee bar also in soho the mika in frith street the world of quick eating and quick drinking a phenomenon previously noted in the pieshops of the fourteenth century no less than in the bakedpotato vans of the nineteenth thus reestablished itself sandwiches are now the staple ingredient of the london lunch from the pret a manger chain to the corner shop on a busy junction there has been a concomitant increase in fast food from burgers of beef to wings of chicken the staple of the city diet remains the same therefore while the statistics of its voracious appetite also remain constant the budget of london households for restaurants and cafés takeaways and snacks is according to a survey of national statistics approximately a third higher than for the united kingdom as a whole londons reputation as a culinary inferno was gradually dispelled during the s when large restaurants catering to every taste in food or ambience became fashionable now the london customer can choose between monkfish tempura and chilli breast of chicken with coconut rice grilled rabbit with polenta and braised octopus with chickpeas and coriander many of these restaurants soon became flourishing commercial enterprises their chefs were recognised and controversial london figures their owners part of a chic world of art and society in the s the connection between food and commerce was rendered all the more distinctive by the floating of certain restaurants on the stock exchange others have been bought by large companies as a profitable form of speculation some of the more recently established restaurants are very large indeed and the fact that few tables remain unbooked is testimony to the permanent and characteristic voracity of londoners that is why it has always been known as a city of markets chapter market time the first markets were upon the streets in fact it is possible to envisage the central axis of twelfthor thirteenthcentury london as one continuous streetmarket from the shambles at newgate to poultry by cornhill at the shambles in all the stalls of the butchers are to be numbered and it is to be asked who holds them and by what service and of whom down the street in the shadow of st michael le querne stood the cornmarket corn the staff of life therefore lies under the aegis of the church just beyond the cornmarket were established the markets for fish in old fish street and friday street on fridays people were to refrain from meat bread street and milk street are adjacent thus setting up a topographical alignment of great significance to the city the naming of the streets is established upon the food which is purchased there the city may be defined then as that place where people come to buy and sell as the citizens of thirteenthcentury london walked down west cheapnow cheapsideaway from the smell of the shambles and the fish stalls they passed shops where harnesses and saddles were sold where cordwainers plied their trade and where mercers and the drapers laid out their fabrics upon their stalls beyond these lay poultry of which the meaning is selfexplanatory and coneyhope lane where rabbits were sold gracechurch street was originally grass church street named after the herbs which were sold within it there are some energetic if idiosyncratic drawings of adjacent streetmarkets in a caveatt for the citty of london beside st nicholas shambells flanks of beef whole pigs and lambs hang outside a row of butchers shops in gracechurch street purveyors of apples fish and vegetables have set up their stalls beneath pillars and awnings which proclaim their origin in essex kent and sorre yet not all goods were sold on open stalls and it has been estimated that there were some four hundred small shopsperhaps like wooden kiosksalong the length of cheapside the noise and tumult were intense and several laws were passed in order to prevent crowds there were other perils too with strict measures against the resale of stolen articles the clothesmarket of cornhill for example was notorious it was here that the narrator of london lickpenny recognised the hood which had been lifted from him at westminster in light of many perils and great mischiefs many brawls and disorders during the evynchepynge or evening market at cornhulle it was ordained that after the bell has been rung that hangs upon the tun at cornhulle no more items were to be taken to the market one bell rang an hour before sunset and another thirty minutes later it is possible to imagine the traders calling out to the slowly diminishing crowds as the sun begins to decline over the towers and rooftops of the city the general confusion of trades was one of the reasons why in a general stocks market was established at the eastern end of poultry where fish and flesh could be sold as well as fruit roots flowers and herbs its name came not from its stocks of provisions but from the stocks set up in that area for the punishment of city offenders a privileged market which remained on the same site for years before being removed to farringdon street in the mideighteenth century it acquired a reputation for having the choicest of all provisions there is an engraving limned just before its removal which shows the statue of charles ii erected in the very heart of the market two small dogs look up at a stall selling cheeses while a woman and child sit with their baskets against the steps of the statue in the background there is an animated scene of trading and bargaining a pair of lovers meet in the foreground apparently oblivious to the noise around them while a londoner is pointing out directions to a foreign visitor here we may remark upon the testimony of a stranger one of the many hundreds in the three volumes of xavier barons wonderful london whatever haste a gentleman may be in when you happen to meet in the streets as soon as you speak to him he stops to answer and often steps out of his way to direct you or to consign you to the care of someone who seems to be going the same way on a balcony above the scene a young woman is beating out a carpet in such visions london may be said to live again billingsgate was perhaps the most ancient of londons markets with its foundation supposedly some four hundred years before the beginning of the christian era it is not impossible that fishermen landed their catches of eel and herring here in remote antiquity but the official records date only from the beginning of the eleventh century that it was a place apart from the rest of london is not in doubt here in an atmosphere of reeking fish with fishscales underfoot and a shallow lake of mud all round specific types and traditions had sprung up there were the wives of billingsgateperhaps the descendants of the devotees of the god belin who was once purported to be worshipped here who dressed in strong stuff gowns and quilted petticoats their hair caps and bonnets were flattened into one indistinguishable mass because of the practice of carrying baskets upon their heads called fish fags they smoked small pipes of tobacco took snuff drank gin and were known for their colourful language thus came the phrase to shriek like a fishwife a dictionary of defined a billingsgate as a scolding impudent slut but gradually throughout the nineteenth century the fish fags were extirpated to make way for a breed of london porters who wore helmets made of hide with a flap which reached down to their necks so that they could more easily carry their baskets of fish these fish porters were complemented by the fish salesmen who wore straw hats even in winter so a definite tradition of dress and of language emerges from this small area of london the same phenomenon can be witnessed at a variety of sites smithfield does not have as long a history as billingsgate but by the eleventh century the smothe field just beyond the city walls was a recognised area for the sale of horses sheep and cattle known for drunkenness rowdiness and such general violence that it had earned the name of ruffians hall that violence did not stop with the granting of a royal charter to the cattlemarket in market days were held on tuesday and friday the horses were kept in stables in the neighbourhood but the cattle and other livestock were driven in from the outlying areas causing much distress to the animals and inconvenience to the citizens it is recorded in smithfield past and present by forshaw and bergstrom that great cruelty was practised the poor animals being goaded on the flanks and struck on the head before they could be marshalled in their proper places in the early part of the nineteenth century a million sheep and a quarter of a million cattle were sold annually the noise and the stench were considerable the danger too was significant on one day in a gentleman was knocked down by a very powerful bull in high holborn and before he could recover himself he was severely trampled on and gored in turnmill street another thoroughfare into the market from adjacent fields a hog mangled a young child and tis judged would have eaten it the animals were sometimes goaded into stampedes down the narrow and muddy lanes off clerkenwell and aldersgate street while the general air of chaos and intemperance was exploited by various louche persons who preyed on the drunkenness and unwariness of others dickens had an intuitive sense of place and fastened upon smithfield as a centre of filth and mire in oliver twist it is filled with crowding pushing driving beating among unwashed unshaven squalid and dirty figures the protagonist in great expectations becomes aware that the shameful place being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to me eight years before this was written the market for live animals had been transferred to copenhagen fields in islington but the atmosphere of death remained when the central meat market was instituted on the smithfield site in it was described as a perfect forest of slaughtered calves pigs and sheep hanging from castiron balustrades of vegetable markets there is no end borough market in southwark can claim to be the first ever recorded having its origins at some time before the eleventh century but covent garden remains the most illustrious once it was truly a garden filled with herbs and fruit which seem uncannily to anticipate their later profusion on the same spot then it was the kitchen garden of westminster abbey contiguous with the garden of bedford house erected at the end of the sixteenth century but the market itself sprang from the earl of bedfords proposals to build an ornamented and ornamental piazza as part of his grand scheme of italianate suburban development the plaza and adjoining houses began to rise in and very soon afterwards the trade of the populace began to flow towards the area on the south side of the square beside the garden wall sprang up a number of sheds and stalls selling fruit and vegetables it was a local amenity which had the additional merit of being financially successful and in the estate obtained a charter authorising a market for the buying and selling of all manner of fruits flowers and herbs thirtyfive years later permanent singlestorey shops were set up in two rows gradually inexorably the market spread across the piazza it became the most famous market in england and given its unique trading status in the capital of world trade its image was endlessly reproduced in drawings and in paintings it was first limned in an etching by wenceslaus hollar in which work according to the editors of london in paint has the merit of being the first closeup depiction of one of londons quarters another work of the early eighteenth century shows a group of early morning shoppers making their way between lines of wooden shops and open stalls fresh fruit and vegetables can be seen in wicker baskets while a horse and cart are driving away from the main scene twenty years later in the painted image has entirely changed instead of ramshackle sheds there are now twostorey buildings and the market activity stretches over the entire square everything is in life and motion from the young boy struggling with a basket of apples to the middleaged female trader who portions out some herbs here are cabbages from battersea and onions from deptford celery from chelsea and peas from charlton asparagus from mortlake and turnips from hammersmith carts and sedan chairs jostle while the covered wagons from the country make their way through the crowds this picture depicts the very essence of a trading city while another painting of slightly later date betrays the evidence of pickpockets and street musicians among the assembly the drawings of george scharf dated and depict in minute and various detail the life of the market the shop of jw draper orange merchant has a sign painted yellow and green according to scharfs notes while there are drawings of the shops of potatoe salesman whitman and of butler seller of herbs and seeds there are wheelbarrows filled with cabbages and turnips and carrots and cocoa nuts alongside mobile stalls with apples and pears and strawberries and plums one young costermongers barrow has a red white and blue flag flying from it with the sign that four oranges will cost a penny in a permanent market with avenues and colonnades and conservatories in three parallel ranges was completed it gave the market an institutional aspect as well as confirming its status as an emporium of world trade there is more certainty of purchasing a pineapple here every day in the year john timbss curiosities of london declares than in jamaica and calcutta where pines are indigenous steam boats carried articles from holland portugal and the bermudas order was introduced to the market also with vegetables to the south fruit to the north and flowers to the northwest it became customary for londoners to come and look upon the cut flowers stealing a few moments from the busy day to gratify one of the purest tastes they gazed at the daffodils roses pinks carnations and wallflowers before once again withdrawing into the usual noise and uproar of the city the new market as it was called continued for more than a century until in it was moved to a site in battersea the spirit of covent garden has of course changed since that removal but it is still a centre of noise and bustle the hucksters and hawkers are still there but the sounds of the basketsellers have changed into those of travelling musicians and the agile porters have turned into a different kind of street artist the great marketssmithfield billingsgate covent garden the stocks were seen as central to london life and somehow emblematic of it charles booth in his life and labour of the people in london revealed that in petticoat lane on sunday morning could be found cotton sheeting old clothes wornout boots damaged lamps chipped china shepherdesses rusty locks together with sellers of dutch drops and sarsaparilla wine bed knobs door knobs and basins of boiled peas here in the early twentieth century tubby isaacs set up his stall

canaries rabbits fowls parrots or guinea pigs hungerford market was known for its vegetables spitalfields for its potatoes and farringdon for its watercress in goodge street there was a market for

now spread all over london and across its trading systems and yet it springs from places such as brick lane petticoat lane leather lane hoxton street and berwick street all these and almost a hundred others survive still as streetmarkets the majority of them on sites where they first flourished centuries before here the poor buy at fifth hand what the rich bought at first hand some streetmarkets however have vanished rag fair by tower hill has gone a woebegone place where raggs and old clothes were sold beside rotten vegetables stale bread and old meat it disappeared beneath its own waste chapter waste matter what the voracious city devours it must eventually disgorge in rubbish and excrement thomas more who as undersheriff knew the malodorous and insanitary conditions of london at first hand decided that in his utopia anything sordidum dirty or morbum diseased should be forbidden within the walls in the early sixteenth century this was indeed a utopian state the sanitary conditions of london in the centuries of roman civilisation when a system of public baths and latrines helped actively to promote urban cleanliness were as good as anywhere within the empire yet it would be unwise to depict a marbled city without stain refuse heaps containing the bones of oxen goats pigs and horses were found in the open areas of the city still within the walls although it is likely that semidomesticated ravens were always ready to consume offending garbage littered upon the street the practice of throwing the contents of urine jars out of the window is well known as is attested by numerous court cases in the entrance to roman taverns and workshops however have been uncovered large stone vessels which can best be described as urinals here is the first physical evidence of londons toilet facilities in one such site along fish street hill was found a bag of cannabis which also testifies to the longevity of the drug culture of the city in the period of saxon and viking occupation there is evidence of excrement dropped anywhere and everywhere even within the houses which suggests a deterioration in healthy practice in turn we may imagine the medieval town littered with horse dung and cesspools strewn with the offal of butchers with wooden chips and kitchen refuse human excrement and daily rubbish generally impeding the channels which ran down both sides of the street regulations of the thirteenth century ordained that no one shall place dung or other filth in the streets or lanes but cause the same to be taken by the rakers to the places ordained these places were an early version of the rubbish tip from which the contents were taken by cart or boat to outlying areas where the dung could be used as manure for the fields pigs were allowed to roam through the streets as natural consumers of rubbish but they proved a considerable nuisance with their custom of blocking narrow lanes and straying into houses their place after a cull was taken by kites who performed the same function as ravens in firstcentury london indeed there were laws that forbade on pain of death the killing of kites and ravens which became so tame that they would snatch a piece of bread and butter from a childs hands in edward iii wrote to the mayor complaining that the thoroughfares were foul with human faeces and the air of the city poisoned to the great danger of men passing as a result the civic authorities issued a proclamation denouncing the grievous and great abomination to be found in filth dung and other nuisances obstructing the streets from entries in the letter books and the plea and memoranda rolls it is clear that the city leaders fearing epidemic disease accepted the need for sanitary legislation four scavengers scawageours were to be held responsible for rubbish in each ward and each householder had a duty to ensure that the street outside his door was cleared of noisome waste there were fines for any citizen found dumping refuse into the fleet or walbrook and a serjeant of the channels was appointed to ensure that the rivulets of street and stream remained unimpeded but old habits persisted households overlooking the walbrook paid a tax or toll in order to build their latrines over the running water of the river and upon london bridge itself there were houses as well as a public latrine which showered down upon the thames public places in that capacity were used more often than private spaces pissing lane later known as pissing alley leadinge from paules church into pater noster rowe may be mentioned along with two other alleys of the same name dating variously from the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries similarly there were dunghill lanes beside puddle dock and whitefriars as well as queenhithe while dunghill stairs was located to the front of three cranes wharf the first public lavatories since the urns of roman london were constructed in the thirteenth century the new bridge across the river was equipped with one of these modern conveniences which had two entrances while the smaller bridges across the fleet and the walbrook also made provision for them against the streams and tributaries there were houses of office too although many consisted simply of wooden planks with holes carved out of them more elaborate public privies were constructed some with four or more holes culminating in richard whittingtons fifteenthcentury house of easement or long house over the thames at the end of friar lane it contained two rows of sixtyfour seats one row for men and the other for women while the refuse dropped into a gully washed with the tides public exposure in the citys privies however could be dangerous a quarrel between two men in a privy beside the wall of ironmonger lane ended in murder death came in other forms from the same source the privy above the fleet near the mouth of the thames caused much discomfort to the monks of white friars who in declared to edward i that the putrid exhalations there from overcame even the frankincense used in their services and had caused the death of manie brethren certain other parts of london were renowned and arraigned for their dirtinessfarringdon without and portsoken were known for their dungheaps and rubbish dumps while the inhabitants of bassinghall ward and aldrich gate aldersgate ward were fined for casting out of ordure and urine one may add to this noisome list the place known as moorfields which before being drained in was said to be a melancholy region with raised paths and refuseheaps deep black ditches not unodourous and detestable open sewers it was a walk according to one city history suitable for london suicides and london philosophers the london memoranda court records of the fourteenth century

house of office is full and comes into my cellar londoners are fascinated by excrement sir thomas more in the early sixteenth century uses five names of shitcacus merda stercus lutum coenumin his polemical work these are latin terms but in the english of the same century homage was paid to human excrement with the nickname of sirreverence in the late twentieth century those quintessentially london artists gilbert and george of spitalfields arranged large exhibitions of their shit paintings the very houses of london are built upon refuse discarded and forgotten objects left among old foundations help to support the weight of the modern city so that beneath our feet are copper brooches and crucibles leather shoes and lead tokens belts and buckles broken pottery and sandals and figurines tools and gloves jars and pieces of bone shoes and oyster shells knives and toys locks and candlesticks coins and combs plates and pipes a childs ball and a pilgrims amulet all spreading their silent ministry through the earth but the city is built upon remains and ruins in a more literal sense in chick lane in it was discovered that thirty tenements and twelve cottages had been erected upon a great dump of public refuse while holywell street was built upon a site of rubbish and waste which had accumulated for a hundred years after the great fire even the pavements of the modern city are made according to the stones of london by elsden and howe with slabs produced from clinkered household refuse by the municipal authorities the streets also bear the marks of waste maiden lane is named after middens pudding lane after the pudding sent down it to the dung boats moored on the thames public dumps were also known as laystalls and there is still a laystall street in clerkenwell sherborne lane was once known as shiteburn lane in the period when pepys was complaining about the substances in his cellar the privy was being used in most households for kitchen and domestic as well as human refuse the streets despite all the prohibitions and regulations were still offensive with dust and unwholesome stenches in summer and in wet weather with dirt this passage occurs in a report of and eight years later the city made one of its periodic efforts to cleanse itself with injunctions that householders on wednesdays and saturdays should put their refuse in basket tubs or other vessels ready for the raker or scavenger the approach of his cart or carriage was meant to be heralded by a bell horn clapper or otherwise thus alerting the inhabitants to bring out their rubbish excrement itself was removed from the cesspits by nightsoil men whose carts were notoriously leaky they dropped near a quarter of their dirt and the great eighteenthcentury philanthropist jonas hanway remarked that they subjected every coach and every passenger of what quality whatsoever to be overwhelmed with whole cakes of dirt at every accidental jolt of the cart of which many have had a most filthy experience it might be thought the great fire would bring a speedy and fiery end to the citys problems of waste but the habits of the citizen were not to be easily changed the novels of the eighteenth century pay horrified if somewhat oblique attention to the malodorous and generally offensive conditions of the capital yet if the great fire did not cleanse london it is appropriate that commerce should do so instead improved methods of agriculture meant that by manure had become a valuable commodity since household ash and cinders also began to be employed in brickmaking a whole new market for refuse emerged now there came new dealers competing upon the exchange of the streets in a city scavenger of st james piccadilly reported that he was greatly injured by a set of persons called running dustmen who go about the streets and places of this parish and collect the coal ashes he begged the parishioners only to deliver their coal ashes but to the persons employed by him the said john horobin who are distinguished by ringing a bell one eighteenthcentury advertisement parades the benefits of joseph waller residing by the turnpike at islington who keeps carts and horses for emptying boghouses when rubbish became part of commerce the conditions of the city were improved more speedily than by any paving acts or cleansing committees in the nineteenth century the history of city refuse became part of the history of city finance the dustheap in dickenss our mutual friend modelled upon a real and ever more offensive pile off the kings cross road was believed to contain buried treasure and had already made a fortune for its owner im a pretty fair scholar in dust mr boffin explains i can price the mounds to a fraction and i know how they can be best disposed of there were mounds or mounts of refuse in various parts of london one immediately to the west of the london hospital was known as whitechapel mount and from its summit could be seen the former villages of limehouse shadwell and ratcliffe another was situated at battlebridge and was known to the author of old and new london as a mountain with heaped hillocks of horsebones together with cinders rags and ordure it became the resort of innumerable pigs but its true commercial worth was proved in a remarkable manner when in the first years of the nineteenth century the russians purchased all the ashes from that site to assist in the rebuilding of moscow after its burning by the french the area itself just north of the present kings cross station had become the quarters of dustmen and cindersifters as well as more general scavengers or in other words all those who lived upon the refuse of the city in that sense it was a benighted place and even at the beginning of the twentyfirst century it is characterised by its bleakness and ugliness the atmosphere of dereliction hangs over it still at letts wharf on the southern bank of the thames near the shot tower at lambeth another band of londoners used to sift and pick through the refuse most of them were women who smoked short pipes and wore strawboard gaiters and torn bonnet boxes for pinafores theirs was an old profession passed from mother to daughter generation after generation the appearance of these women is most deplorable one medical officer wrote standing in the midst of fine dust piled up to their waists with faces and upper extremities begrimed with black filth and surrounded by and breathing a foul moist hot air surcharged with the gaseous emanations of disintegrating organic compounds the dust was sifted into its coarse and fine components while old pieces of tin were salvaged together with old shoes and bones and oyster shells the tin often went to make clamps for luggage while the oyster shells were sold to builders old shoes went to the manufacturers of the famous dye prussian blue nothing was wasted it was once rumoured that the streets of london were paved with gold and so it is perhaps no surprise that in the nineteenth century the refuse daily swept up and collected from the streets is turned into gold to the tune of some thousands of pounds a year in photographs of the victorian city the gutters are filled with litter and streetsweepings with the added nuisance of multifarious orange peel the rewards of the city sweepers were based entirely upon locality but the most obvious product was street mud which was sold to farmers or market gardeners the thoroughfares most highly prized were those where locomotion never ceaseshaymarket being six times in excess of the average streets followed by watling street bow lane old change and fleet street so even movement itself creates profit in a city based upon speed and productivity street orderlies swept the streets and crossings some were pauper labourers set to the task as a convenient method of combining discipline with efficiency while others were philanthropic labourers who were paid by various charitable concerns by the middle of the century all were in competition with the new streetsweeping machines which had a mechanical power equal to the industry of five streetsweepers the industry was complex however and different forms of scavenging were specific horse manure was collected by boys in red uniforms who ran among the traffic shovelling it up and placing it in receptacles by the side of the road this represented yet more london gold at least to farmers in dire need of fertiliser there were bonepickers and raggatherers cigar and cigarette pickers old wood collectors sweeps and dredgermen dustmen and mud larks all intent upon collecting up the most abject refuse of the city in case it might become the source of great riches from one owner of a beershop on the southwark bridge road henry mayhew who chronicled the streetfinders as a different class of city dwellers learned how the bonegrubbers took their bags of bones to his establishment here they received payment and sat silently looking at the corners of the floor for they rarely lifted their eyes up the ragfinders had their own separate beats the pure finders took up dog excrement from the street in the early nineteenth century it had been the profession of women who were known as bunters but the increasing demands of the tanning trade for which the excrement was used as an astringent meant that male workers were also in demand in the hope of finding fitting associates and companions in their wretchedness or else for the purpose of hiding themselves and their shifts and struggles for existence from the world the pure finders tended to congregate within tenements in the east of the city just past the tower of london between the docks and rosemary lane this was an area according to mayhew redolent of filth and pregnant with pestilential disease the inadvertent use of pregnant suggests here the general association of dirty people with sexual depravity indeed the attempt to take prostitution off the streets of london was itself linked with the removal of excrement for the cleanness of the city in a similar spirit there were also warnings concerning the revolutionary potential of the poor with their fevers and filth once more is made the implicit connection between poverty disease and excrement it was an association which occurred to the pure finders themselves theres such a dizziness in my head now one told mayhew i feel as if it didnt belong to me no i have earned no money today i have had a piece of bread that i steeped in water to eat i could never bear the thought of going into the great house the workhouse im so used to the air that id sooner die in the street as many i know have done ive known several of our people who have sat down in the street with their basket alongside them and died and thus the dead in turn became rubbish to be removed by the parish and swept away the cycle of life was completed the outlines of age may be seen in the features of the very young the youthful collectors of river refuse known as mud larks scavenged for pieces of coal or wood which they would then put in kettles baskets or even old hats many of them were small children approximately seven or eight years old and mayhew questioned one of them he had heard of jesus christ once but he never heard tell of who or what he was and didnt particular care about knowing london was england and england he said was in london but he couldnt tell in what part for him the condition which made up london was everywhere therefore and as mayhew observed there was a painful uniformity in the stories of all the children of the city another group of scavengers were known as toshers hence the pejorative expression tosh they were the sewer hunters burrowing beneath the surface of the city in search of valuable waste in the early part of the nineteenth century they could enter by the holes along the thames braving the crumbling brickwork and rotten stone in order to creep along the underground labyrinth but then in the s and s everything changed as a result of what was called londons sanitation revolution it is a curious fact of city life that the sanitation of the early nineteenth century did not differ materially from that of the fifteenth century there had been attempts at superficial improvement with efforts to maintain the cleanliness of the kilbourne and the westbourne the ranelagh and the fleet the shoreditch and the effa the falcoln brook and the earl all important rivers and streams but the central feature of londons sanitation remained its greatest disgrace there were still cesspools beneath some houses effluent was forced upwards through the wooden floors of the poorer households the solution of the metropolitan commission of sewers in that all privy refuse was to be discharged directly into the sewers seemed convincing at the time but the effect was that the effluent was transported straight into the central reaches of the thames as a result the swan and the salmon together with other fish vanished in an open sewer in the words of disraeli the river had become a stygian pool reeking with ineffable and unbearable horror where once rose petals had been papered across the windows of the westminster parliament building now sheets soaked with chlorine were used instead the problem was compounded by the fact that the water supply for many londoners was taken directly from the thames and from this time forward it was often described as of a brownish colour the prevalence of cholera in the same period when it was believed that all smell is disease only increased the noxious horror of the city where the discharges of three million people were running through its midst the concentration of people seeking work in the capital and the rising consumption of the victorian middle class had led to a complementary rise in effluence the pervasive smell may in that sense be regarded as the odour of progress these were the conditions of london as late as the year of the great stink in under the pressure of extreme circumstances a metropolitan board of works had been established to remedy the unhappy situation three years later during a long and hot summer joseph bazalgette began his scheme to divert all sewage from the thames through different types of sewer main line and intercepting storm relief and outfall to outfalls at barking and crossness it was described by the observer as the most extensive and wonderful work of modern times and by the end of this great engineers ministrations miles of main sewers had been reconstructed in portland cement with a further miles of new local sewers for all practical purposes large parts of bazalgettes system remain in place at the beginning of the twentyfirst century it was a signal example of public health enterprise in the face of a rapidly deteriorating urban environment characteristic of london administration however was that it occurred very quickly and in conditions of near panic all the great works of the city seem to be in one sense improvised and haphazard by the early twentieth century the dust mounds and open ashpits were removed from the capital and most of the rubbish was pulverised burned or treated with chemicals the environmental theory of disease which simply prescribed that waste should be removed to as distant a point as possible was replaced by the germ theory which meant that waste had effectively to be neutralised so changes in epidemiological research can affect the topography of the city the fabric of london is susceptible to theory therefore and in the previous century huge areas of sewage purification were complemented by vast incineration plants the enormous solid waste transfer station by smugglers way in wandsworth and the great sewage works of beckton are largely unseen they are monuments to the citys secret industry there are still rubbish tips located in various parts of the capital and although gulls and pigeons have now taken the place of ravens and kites the vagrant scavenger once known as a totter is still to be seen in the streets of london searching through bins and garbage for cigarette ends food or drink the abilityin fact the necessityof the city to discharge its own rubbish continues in various guises the quantity of waste in the everincreasing city has risen higher than any nineteenthcentury dust mound with an average of ten million tonnes produced by the capital each year among it almost one and a half million tonnes of scrap metal and half a million tonnes of paper it is only to be expected too that the history of modern effluent is still part of the history of commerce in the sixteenth century it was discovered that the nitrogen from excreta could be used in the manufacture of gunpowder but in the twentieth century human faeces yielded a different form of power incineration plants like that at edmonton produce hundreds of thousands of megawatts of electricity each year gold and platinum are being emitted by the catalytic converters fitted to cars and deposited within exhaust fumes soon according to one scientist reported in the times of it will make economic sense to pan the deposits along the city thoroughfares so londons streets are also now truly paved with gold chapter a little drink or two and with the food arrives the drink the inhabitants of the london region some four thousand years ago imbibed a variety of beer or mead londoners have been drinking it ever since close to the old kent road a roman brooch of jasper was recently uncovered engraved upon it was the head of silenus the drunken satyr who was tutor to bacchus no better divinity of london could have been discovered thomas brown noted of london in that to see the number of taverns alehouses etc he would imagine bacchus the only god that is worshippd there in the thirteenth century london was already notorious for the immoderate drinking of the foolish the wines of the rhineland and of gascony of burgundy and maderia the white wine of spain and the red wine of portugal flooded in but the less affluent drank ale and beer the hop seems to have been cultivated by the beginning of the fourteenth century but most ale was spiced with pepper and known as stingo this again suggests the partiality of londoners for highly flavoured comestibles perhaps as a fitting adjunct to their energetic and competitive lives in the city in chaucers canterbury tales c the cook is well aware of the requirements for what the poet elsewhere calls a draught of moist and corny ale while his miller an aledrinker fardronken was all pale in the same period glutton in william langlands piers the plowman c yglubbed a galon and a gille of ale certainly there were many establishments for that purpose by the early fourteenth century there were in london taverns and breweries more familiarly known later as boozing kens or tippling offices early in the fifteenth century it was recorded that there were some brewers and in the london company of brewers was incorporated with its own coat of arms already it had composed rules for its members such as that in which ordered that retailers of ale should sell the same in their houses in pots of peutre sealed and that whoever carried ale to the buyer should hold the pot in one hand and a cup in another and that all who had pots unsealed should be fined a similar respect for quality was imposed upon the vintners who by city statute in the early fifteenth century were forbidden to colaire ne medle with their wine one william harold was in sentenced to the pillory for an hour on the charge of contrefetyng of old and feble spaynissh wyn for good amp trewe romeney in the parisshe of seynt martyns in the vyntry by the sixteenth century according to john stow the problems of drunkenness had become so acute that two hundred london alehouses were suppressed in there were some twentysix brewers in london by that time and their produce was variously known as huffe cup mad dog angels food lift leg and stride wide the ingredients seem to have varied with constituents including broom bayberries and ivyberries together with malt and oats although only the concoction brewed from hops was given the name of true beer the elizabethan chronicler william harrison noted the drunkards in the streets and remarked that our malt bugs lie in a row lugging at their dames teats till they lie still againe and not be able to wag certain alehouses of the period were so identified with london itself both in ballad and in drama that they became representative of the city the boars head in eastcheap was the vivid setting of falstaff and pistol doll tearsheet and mistress quickly and so impressed itself upon the folk memory of londoners that it was generally agreed that shakespeare himself must have drunk on the premises in the eighteenth century members of a literary club assembled there in order to assume shakespearean roles and such was the power of its associations that it attracted pilgrims to its site long after its destruction in there is however one specific remembrance robert preston late drawer at the boars head tavern departed this life at the age of twentyseven on march he drew good wine took care to fill his pots and his headstone lay against the wall of st magnus the martyr the myter in cheape the mitre of cheapside was a haunt of locals where according to ben jonson if any stranger comes in amongst em they all stand up and stare at him as he were some unknown beast brought out of africk the drawer here george attained immortality when named in by jonson in every man out of his humourwheres george call me george hither quicklyand in by dekker and webster in westward hoo you are george the drawer at the mitre it is evidence of the way in which a particular londoner can become fixed as a type or character in the eyes of his contemporaries the peculiar and persistent connection of alehouses with drama was also maintained by the memory of the mermaid what things have we seen done at the mermaid heard words that have been so nimble and so full of subtle flame wrote beaumont to jonson keats echoing the sentiment two hundred years later knew no happy field or mossy cavern choicer than the mermaid tavern the poet himself a londoner who as a child lived on the premises of the swan and hoop in moorgate had migrated in imagination to the junction of friday street and bread street where the mitre was consumed in the great fire a tavern is the onlely rendevous of boone company according to the guls hornebooke of where it is important to know the bar staff or drawers and to learn their names such as jack and will and tom to procure prompt service as well as credit then you may say to the waiter boy fetch me money from the barre the bill was known as the reckoning or the shot games of dice were played and travelling fiddlers went from establishment to establishment we are allowed to peer closely into the rooms of an early seventeenthcentury tavern by using an inventory from the aptly named mouthe in bishopsgate street here are listed the boarded partitions separating one room from another in that tavern each chamber bearing a different name the percullis the pomgrannatt the three tuns the vyne and the kings head so we have five different barres on the same premises furnished with tables benches and stools in the percullis there was one longe table of waynscote with a fforme as well as one oyster table one olde wynestoole and a payre of playinge tables in the kings head there was also an oyster table as well as a childs stoole in one of the guests chambers on the floor above were listed down pillows flaxen sheets and a tapestried coverlet as well as chests and cupboards a poem of mentions the bores head hard by london stone the swan at dowgat the myter in cheape the castel in fishstreet and others to make noses red but it was not only drink and lodging which seventeenthcentury tavernkeepers supplied an advertisement from a landlord moving from the swan at holborn bridge to the oxford arms in warwick lane mentioned that he hath also a hearse and all things convenient to carry a corps to any part of england there are endless inns thomas platter wrote in the early s beer and wine shops for every imaginable growth alicant canary muscatels clarets spanish rhenish endless also are the verses written upon the topic of london alehouses ned wards vade mecum for malt worms and john taylors pilgrimage are only two examples of poems that list public houses and their locations as a kind of topography of the city in which the nature and shape of london are known only in terms of intoxicated reverie hence to cloaklane near dowgate hill we steer and at three tuns cast anchor for good beer thereafter haste made waste and sun was set ere to the shoreditch flagon i could get at ten i took my leave and by the moon reached the bell inn and fell into a swoon the words of the two poets are conflated here in order to suggest the precision of their references to the city as a place where one must get drunk in order to survive the excise tax imposed upon beer in testifies to the increasing popularity of that drink pepys noticed during the great fire that the women would scold for drink and be drunk as devels there may of course have been some excuse for their behaviour during that inferno but a calm observer henry peacham writing the art of living in london in commands above all things beware of beastly drunkenness some are found sometimes so drunk who being fallen upon the ground or which is worse in the kennel are not able to stir or move again drinking begets challenges and quarrels and occasioneth the death of many as is known by almost daily experience drunken men are apt to lose their hats cloaks or rapiers nor to know what they have spent pepys also recorded a lady dining at the house of a mutual friend who in one draught knocked back a pint and a half of white wine yet if the seventeenth century might rival any of its predecessors for the amount of alcohol flowing through the veins of london it was overshadowed by the eighteenth century when drinking reached massive even crisis proportions this was the period when samuel johnson that great london luminary declared that a man is never happy in the present unless he is drunk a vast number of his fellowcitizens seemed to agree there was a fashion for brown ale a sweet beer but a further duty upon malt made it important for breweries to introduce more hops into their drink this became bitter beerso bitter that i could not drink it according to casanovawhich when mixed with regular ale became known as half and half in the same period pale ale was produced and became so popular that pale ale houses were established in the city in the early s a mellow beer brewed for four or five months was introduced the labouring people porters etc found its utility for drinking at breakfast or at dinner and thus it became known as porter it was a beer brewed only in the city and led directly to that class of beers known as stout brown stout double stouts irish entire or heavy wet or london particular it was particular to london also that alehouses were directly connected with commerce for many trades the only employment agency was a specific public house or house of call bakers and tailors plumbers and bookbinders congregated in one place where masters arrived to enquire when they want hands the landlord himself was often of the same trade giving credit to those out of employ chiefly in the medium of drink the tradesmen paid their employees at pay tables in the same public houses with obvious and predictable results compounded by the fact that money was not exchanged until the hours of midnight and one on a sunday morning there were other working practices which demanded the consumption of liquor entry money for a new apprentice or journeyman was spent in the alehouse and various fines for late or incomplete work were also paid in the same manner according to one great historian m dorothy george in london life in the eighteenth century the consumption of strong drink was connected with every phase of life from apprenticeship we may also infer that the spirit of trade so central to the life of london thereby remained bright and fiery drink and fire go together and distillers were accused of negligence whereby their stills gave rise to frequent and terrible fires there are some singular vignettes of drunkenness in the cityoliver goldsmith putting on his wig back to front to amuse friends in his temple lodgings charles lamb staggering home beside the new river where he had once bathed as a schoolboy joe grimaldi being carried home every night on the back of the landlord of the marquis of cornwallis there were however less happy episodes the restoration dramatist nathaniel lee drank himself into bedlam where he declared they said i was mad and i said they were mad damn them they outvoted me he was eventually released but on the day of his death he drank so hard that he dropped down in the street and was run over by a coach his body was laid in a bulk at trunkits the perfumers at temple bar till it was owned william hickey the early nineteenthcentury memoirist was found in a gutter along parliament street utterly incapable of giving any account of myself or of even articulating having no more recollection of a single circumstance that had occurred for the preceding twelve hours than if i had been dead he awoke the following day unable to move hand or foot being most miserably bruised cut and maimed in every part of my body another london particular in the eighteenth century was richard porson the first librarian of the london institution who was often seen in the morning staggering from his old haunt the cider cellars in maiden lane the editor of euripides he was a renowned scholar who could hiccup greek like a helot but preferred to boast that he could repeat from memory the whole of smolletts roderick random it was said of porson according to walfords old and new london that he drank everything he could lay his hands upon even to embrocation and spirits of wine intended for the lamp samuel rogers described him returning to the dining room after the people had gone and drinking all that was left in their glasses his usual and familiar exclamation when surprised or perplexed was whooe and on the day of his death he was heard quoting from the greek anthologia a friend noticed that on this last occasion he gave the greek rapidly but the english with painful slowness as if the greek came more naturally revived by wine and jelly dissolved in brandy and water he was taken to a tavern in st michaels alley cornhill but later died in the london institution on the stroke of midnight when the phrase spirituous liquor is applied to the citys drinking habits however the spirit is generally that of gin it was denounced by the magistrate sir john fielding as this liquid fire by which men drink their hell beforehand the demon of london for half a century it was held responsible for the deaths of many thousands of men women and children whatever the truth of mortality rates and they are open to question there is no doubting the popularity of gin concocted from grain sloe or juniper it has been estimated that in the s and s there were ginhouses the slogan copied by hogarth for his portrayal of gin lane ran drunk for d dead drunk for d clean straw for nothing these geneva shops were located in cellars or in converted groundfloor workshops they multiplied in poorer quarters making the more familiar and traditional alehouses of the city seem respectable in contrast hogarth himself said of his portrait that in gin lane every circumstance of its horrid effects are brought to view in terorem nothing but poverty misery and ruin are to be seen distress even to madnes and death and not a house in tolerable condition but pawnbrokers and the gin shop in that famous study an infant is seen falling to its certain death from the emaciated arms of its drunken mother she is sitting upon wooden stairs with ulcerated legs her countenance expressive only of oblivion beyond despair it may seem melodramatic but it is a pictorial variant upon a salient truth one judith defour took her twoyearold daughter from a workhouse for example and then strangled her in order to strip her of the new clothes with which she had been dressed she sold the babys clothes and spent the money s d on gin a new kind of drunkenness henry fielding wrote in unknown to our ancestors is lately sprung up amongst us and which if not put a stop to will infallibly destroy a great part of the inferior people the drunkenness i here intend is by this poison called gin the principal sustenance if it may be so called of more than a hundred thousand people in this metropolis there had been attempts to put a stop to this trade most notably by the gin act of which was greeted only by the execrations of the mob the act was ridiculed and evaded with gin being sold as medicinal draughts or under assumed names such as sangree tow row the makeshift or king theodore of corsica the ginshops were still filled with men and women and even sometimes of children who drank so much that they find it difficult to walk on going away the corn distillers of london claimed that they produced upward of eleven twelfths of the whole distillery of england and a contemporary lord lansdowne recognised in that the excessive use of gin hath hitherto been pretty much confined to the cities of london and westminster it offered the comfort of forgetfulness to prisoners and vagrants it provided oblivion to the poor of st giles where one house in four was a ginshop distilling was highly profitable the trade was thrown open and protected from excessive excise so the great destroyer of the poor and disadvantaged was actually created by those who wished to make a quick and easy profit only belatedly did the authorities respond to crimes of violence against property fuelled by the demand for gin and to the number of weak and sickly children who were proving a burden upon the parish authorities some ginshops were suppressed in this measure seemed to work improvements in the distilleries closer inspection of ginshops and increase in taxes eventually resulted in the observation of that we do not see the hundredth part of poor wretches drunk in the street since the said qualifications the fever passed the rage for gin subsided as quickly as it had arisen leading to the surmise that it was some climacteric of the citys history as if london itself had been seized by sudden frenzy and burning thirst yet gin and ale were not considered to be the only addictive and dangerous liquids there was also tea the grocer daniel rowlinson was the first man to sell a pound of tea in the s fifty years later congreve described the auxiliaries to the teatable as orange brandy aniseed cinnamon citron and barbadoes water j ilive author of a new and compleat survey of london in also blamed the excessive drinking of tea for enervating the stomachs of the populace as to render them incapable of performing the offices of digestion whereby the appetite is so much depravd a pamphleteer in declared teadrinking to be very hurtful to those who work hard and live low and condemned it as one of the worst of habits rendering you lost to yourselves and unfit for the comforts you were first designed for william hazlitt was popularly supposed to have died in frith street soho in from the excessive drinking of that plant infusion the emphasis once again is on the tendency of londonerseven imported citizens such as hazlittto obsession and excess so that an apparently harmless cordial can become dangerous that is also why london tea gardens soon acquired a dubious reputation suburban retreats with agreeable names such as white conduite house shepherd and shepherdess cupers gardens montpelier and bagnigge wells devoted to the drinking of tea and other pleasant pastimes became associated with loose women and with boys whose morals are depraved and their constitutions ruined and were well known for the encouragement of luxury extravagance idleness and other wicked illegal purposes it is as if the opportunity for pleasure or leisure in london was immediately transformed into excess viciousness and immorality the city can never be at peace tea and gin are still with us but one eighteenthcentury drink has utterly disappeared saloop was a hot sweet beverage made from a decoction of sassafras wood milk and sugar and sold for three halfpence a bowl the name is supposed to have been derived from the slopping sound of those drinking it in the street coffee and tea were expensive so stalls selling saloop were found in the poorer areas of london in summer saloop was sold from an open table on wheels in winter from a kind of tent made from a screen and an old umbrella it was considered to be the best possible cure for a hangover and charles lamb recalled the artisan and the chimneysweep mingling with the rake at dawn around the saloopian stalls being penniless the young sweeps will yet hang their black heads over the ascending steams to gratify one sense if possible the spectacle prompted lamb to reflection upon a city where extremes meet in the same period as lamb wrote his reflections designed for the london magazine the young charles dickens entered a public house in parliament street and ordered your very bestthe very bestale it was called the genuine stunning and the twelveyearold boy said just draw me a glass of that if you please with a good head to it the spectacle of children drinking in the streets and alehouses was familiar if not common in the early years of the nineteenth century the girls i am told wrote henry mayhew as late as the s are generally fonder of gin than the boys they took it to keep the cold out verlaine considered londoners to be noisy as ducks eternally drunk while dostoevsky noted that everyone is in a hurry to drink himself into insensibility a german journalist max schlesinger saw the inhabitants of a public house standing staggering crouching or lying down groaning and cursing drink and forget an observer closer to home charles booth noticed that drinking among women in the s had materially increased one drunken woman in a street will set all the women in it drinking he quotes one male inhabitant of the east end as saying nearly all women get drunk of monday they say we have our fling we like to have a little fuddle on monday all classes of london women seem to have been drinking largely because it was no longer considered wrong for a female to enter a public house for a nip in the evening children of the poorer classes were sent around to the local public house to have a jug filled with ale as booth reported it was constant come and go one moment to go in and get the jug filled and out again the next none of the children waited to talk or play with one another but at once hurried home gentlemen drank as deeply and freely as the poor thackeray noted those who glory in drinking bouts with bottlenoses and pimpled faces i was so cut last night is one of the phrases he recalled in each year of the nineteenth century approximately people were arrested for drunkenness in the streets yet the conditions of life often drove poorer londoners into their condition one of them a collector of pure dog excrement told mayhew that he had often been drunk for three months togetherhe had bent his head down to his cup to drink being utterly incapable of raising it to his lips so even though the gin fever had subsided and its shops closed down its spiritwe might saywas continued in the gin palaces of the nineteenth century these large establishments clad in shining plateglass windows with stucco rosettes and gilt cornices were resplendent with advertisements lit by gaslamps announcing the only real brandy in london or the famous cordial medicated gin which is so strongly recommended by the faculty the fine lettering reveals the attractions of the out and out the no mistake the good for mixing and the real knockmedown yet the exterior brightness was generally deceptive the scene within these palaces was a dismal one almost reminiscent of the old ginshops there was characteristically a long bar of mahogany behind which were casks painted green and gold with the customers standingor sitting on old barrelsalong a narrow and dirty area beside it it might be noted here too that social observers believed drink to be at the root of all the poverty and distress with which they came into contact again the emphasis is upon the unhappy conditions of the city itself literally driving men and women to drink with its relentless speed urgency and oppression of the skeletons investigated in st brides lower churchyard just under per cent had at least one fracture it is also revealed in the fascinating london bodies compiled by alex werner that almost half of these were rib fractures commonly caused by stumbling or brawling in the same period the breweries had become one of the wonders of london one of the sights to which foreign visitors were directed by the s there were twelve principal brewers producing according to charles knights london two barrels or gallons of beer per annum for every inhabitant of the metropolisman woman and child who would not want to observe all this industry and enterprise one german visitor was impressed by the vast establishment of whitbreads brewery in chiswell street with its buildings higher than a church and its horses the giants of their breed in similar fashion in the summer of a german prince turned my cab to barclays brewery in park street southwark which the vastness of its dimensions renders almost romantic he observed that steam engines drove the machinery which manufactured from twelve to fifteen thousand barrels a day ninetynine of the larger barrels each one as high as a house are kept in gigantic sheds horses like elephants transport the beer his awareness of the size and immensity of london are here reflected in its capacity for beer and in a final parallel he notes that from the roof of the brewery you have a very fine panoramic view of london that emblematic significance was recognised by painters as well as visitors and by the beginning of the nineteenth century there was established what london art historians have termed the brewery genre ten years after the princes visit for example barclays brewery was painted by an anonymous hand the entrance is depicted together with the thriving life of london all around it to the right is the great brewhouse with a suspension bridge connecting to the other side of the street in the foreground a butchers boy in the blue apron typical of his trade stands with another customer beside a bakedpotato van barrels of beer on sleds are being drawn by horses into the yard passing a dray which is just leaving in the street to the right a hansom cab is bringing in more visitors it is a picture of appetite with the meat carried on the shoulders of the butchers boy as an apt token of the london diet as well as of immense energy and industry but there are other ways of conveying the immensity of the citys drinking blanchard jerrold and gustave doré visited the same premises for their london a pilgrimagethe town of malt and hops as jerrold called it in in order to see the brewing of the beer named entire which assuaged thirsty london jerrold noted that against the great towers and barrels the working men look like flies and indeed in dorés engravings these dark anonymous shapes tend to their beermashing and beermaking duties like votaries all is in shadow and chiaroscuro with fitful gleams illuminating the activities of these small figures in vast enclosed spaces here again the life of the city is like that within some great decaying prison with the metal pipes and cylinders as its bars and gates jerrold like the german visitor before him looked over london with st pauls dominating the view from the north and apostrophises beer as the citys sacred drink we are he remarked upon classic ground the gin palace was supplanted by the public house which was the direct descendant of the tavern and the alehouse of course taverns survived in the older parts of london known to their adherents for privacy and quiet to their detractors for gloom and silence public houses continued the tradition of segregation with saloon lounge and private bars being distinguished from public bars and jug and bottle departments many pubs were not salubrious with plain and dirty interiors and a long zinctopped counter where men sat solemnly drinkingyou enter by a heavy door that is held ajar by a thick leather strap striking you in the back as you go in and often knocking off your hat instead of the gin palaces long bar the public house bar was characteristically in the shape of a horseshoe with the variously coloured bottles rising up within its interior space the furniture was plain enough with chairs and benches tables and spittoons upon a sawdusted floor by there were some public houses and beershops in the metropolis catering to half a million customers each day reminiscent of dusty miry smoky beery brewery london a stranger asking directions in according to the little world of london was likely to be told straight on till you come to the three turks then to turn to the right and cross over at the dog and duck and go on again till you come to the bear and the bottle then to turn the corner at the jolly old cocks and after passing the veteran the guy fawkes the iron duke to take the first turn to the right which will bring you to it in this period there were seventy kings heads and ninety kings arms fifty queens heads and seventy crowns fifty roses and twentyfive royal oaks thirty bricklayers arms and fifteen watermens arms sixteen black bulls and twenty cocks thirty foxes and thirty swans a favoured colour in pubs names was red no doubt complementing the analogy in london between drink and fire while londons favourite number seemed to be three the three hats the three herrings the three pigeons and so on there were also more mysterious signs such as the grave maurice the cat and salutation and the ham and windmill the variety and plentitude of the nineteenthcentury pubs continued well into the twentieth century with the basic shape and nature changing very little ranging from the munificent west end establishment to the sawdusted corner pub in poplar or in peckham then in one of those paradoxes of london life public houses became more mixed and lively places during the second world war the beer may have run out before the close of proceedings and glasses may have been in short supply but philip ziegler suggests in london at war that they were the only places in wartime london where one could entertain and be entertained cheaply and find the companionship badly needed during the war there was an odd superstition that pubs were more likely to be hit by bombs but this did not seem to affect their popularity in fact during the forced absence of men women once again began to use pubs a report of recorded that they were often to be seen there with other women or even on their own never had the london pubs been more stimulating john lehmann recalled never has one been able to hear more extraordinary revelations never witness more unlikely encounters by the end of that war in there were still some four thousand pubs in the capital and peace brought a new resurgence of interest novels and films have conveyed the atmosphere of pubs in the late s and early s from the east end where the men still wore caps and scarves and the girls danced holding cigarettes in their fingers to local saloons where what orwell described as the warm fog of smoke and beer surrounded the regulars that emphasis upon conviviality continued into the twentyfirst century with pianos and jukeboxes being steadily supplanted by video games fruit machines and eventually widescreen televisions generally devoted to football with the gradual takeover of public houses by the larger brewers and the establishment of chains in the s and s however there emerged a greater degree of standardisation and modernisation from which many london pubs have never recovered certain chains for example had the ceilings of their public houses smoked or painted brown to mimic the interior of the ancient alehouses while various nineteenthcentury objets and old books were discreetly planted to ensure an air of authenticity but of all the cities in the world artificial history does not work in london among the licensed premises now listed within central london the familiar names still exist even if there is no real comparison between london of and central london of it is at least comforting to find a significant number still of red lions and queens heads and green mans three is still a favourite number from the three compasses in rotherhithe street to the three tuns in portman mews there are no more spotted dogs or jolly sailors but instead a number of slug and lettuces there are still saints and shakespeares heads but there are now five finnegans wakes a dean swift a george orwell an artful dodger and a gilbert and sullivan the running footman is no more but there are three scruffy murphys despite justified complaints about the standardisation of both beer and the surroundings in which it is drunk there is at the beginning of the twentyfirst century a great deal more variety of public house than at any time in londons history there are pubs with upstairs theatres and pubs with karaoke nights pubs with live music and pubs with dancing pubs with restaurants and pubs with gardens theatrical pubs in shaftesbury avenue and business pubs in leadenhall market ancient pubs such as the mitre in ely passage and the bishops finger in smithfield pubs with dragacts and pubs with striptease pubs with special beers and theme pubs devoted variously to jack the ripper sherlock holmes and other london dignitaries there are gay pubs for homosexuals and pubs for transvestites and in more traditional spirit bicyclists still meet at the downs clapton where the pickwick bicycle club first met on june there is another continuity recent surveys suggest that despite varying levels of intoxication through the twentieth century londoners have returned to their old habits it is now recorded that the average consumption in the city is higher than elsewhere so that according to a survey of alcohol needs and services published in one and a half million londoners may be exceeding recommended sensible levels with a quarter of a million drinking at a dangerous level so the city manifests as always the immoderate drinking of foolish persons the names for drunkards and drunkenness in london are many and varioussoaks whets topers pissheads and piss artists are boozy fluffy wellgone legless crocked wrecked paralytic ratarsed shitfaced and arseholed they are up the monument or half seas over they are on a bender out of it or off their tits todays vagrant drinkers of spitalfields stepney camden waterloo and parts of islington are known as the death drinkers they subsist on a diet of methylated spirits jake or the blue surgical spirit surge or the white and other forms of crude alcohol it has been estimated that there are between one and two thousand downandout alcoholics in the city they congregate under arches in small parks or on open sites where building has yet to begin these places are known to their inhabitants by various names such as the caves running water or the ramp these vagrants themselves have names like notoes ginger jumping joe and black sam they are covered by scars and sores blackened by the makeshift fires conjured upon bombsites when they die as they do relatively quicklythey are interred in the city cemetery at forest gate london buries them because london has killed them chapter clubbing on the unhappy night of his drunkenness william hickey was returning from a drinking club at the red house clubbing is first used as a term in the seventeenth century in july pepys wrote that we went to woods our old house for clubbing but it was in the succeeding century that a variety of clubs emerged for a variety of members addison made the characteristic point that man is a sociable animal and we take all occasions and pretences of forming ourselves into those little nocturnal assemblies which are commonly known as clubs a club was not very different from a gang however a point which the spectator made on march in allusion to a general history of clubs then being written it is suggested that the compendium ought to include a set of men who have taken the title of the mohock club and who set out to terrorise the streets of the city where citizens are knocked down others stabbed others cut and carbonadoed in similar vein the spectator noticed signs of club spirit at the opera where the women had placed themselves in opposite boxes with various partysignals to display their loyalty to either whig or tory junta this is the context then for the drinking clubs of the eighteenth century characteristically they met weekly in a tavern to eat and sing and debate there was the kitkat club of notable whigs which met in shire lane and there was the robin hood club in butcher row which included masons carpenters smiths and others the discussions in shire lane continued well into the night but in butcher row each member has five minutes allowed him to speak there was the beefsteak club which met in a room in the covent garden theatre and was devoted to drinking and wit interspersed with snatches of song and much personal abuse the atmosphere of such a place is evoked by ned ward in the london spy he entered an oldfashioned room where a gaudy crowd of odoriferous townessences were walking backwards and forwards with their hats in their hands not daring to convert them to their intended use lest it should put the foretops of their wigs into some disorder bows and crimps of the newest mode were here exchanged they made a humming like so many hornets in a chimney corner in contrast was the poor mans twopenny club where one of the rules declared that if any neighbour swears or curses his neighbour may give him a kick upon the shins a club known as the house of lords met at the three herrings in bell yard it was made up from the more dissolute sort of barristers attorneys and tradesmen there were punch clubs cutter clubs for those with boats upon the thames and spouting clubs for burgeoning public speakers these were centres of argument in the combative london tradition combining obscene songs and egalitarian speeches in equal measure they were often known as chair clubs but there were also card clubs for gamesters and cock and hen clubs for youths and prostitutes there was a nonose club and a farting club in cripplegate where the members meet once a week to poyson the neighbourhood and with their noisy crepitations attempt to outfart one another cw heckethorn in london souvenirs intones a litany of other london clubs a surly club at a tavern near billingsgate filled with the tradesmen of that quarter who met to sharpen the practice of contradiction and of foul language a spitfarthing club which met weekly at the queens head in bishopsgate and was composed chiefly of misers and skinflints and the club of broken shopkeepers which met at tumble down dick in southwark and comprised bankrupts and others unfortunate in trade the mock heroes club met in an alehouse in baldwins gardens where each member would assume the name of a defunct hero while the lying club congregated at the bell tavern in westminster where no true word was to be uttered during its proceedings a mankilling club which met at a tavern in a backalley adjoining st clement danes admitted to membership no one who had not killed his man but there was also a humdrum club composed of gentlemen of peaceable dispositions who were satisfied to meet at a tavern smoke their pipes and say nothing till midnight when they went homeward an everlasting club was so called because its hundred members divided the twenty four hours of day and night among themselves in such a manner that the club was always sitting no person presuming to rise until he was relieved by his appointed successor the club tradition continued into the following century with members of the free and easy pub institution subscribing a shilling a week there were also tavern debating clubs characteristically to be found among such quarters of artisans as spitalfields soho clerkenwell or finsbury they were in part derived from the atheistical societies of the previous century which had met in wells street as well as the angel and st martins lane and were similarly disliked by the civic authorities many establishments flourished throughout the early nineteenth century in defiance of official policy however among them the swan in new street the fleece in windmill street the george in east harding street and the mulberry tree in moorfields these taverns became the centre of london radical dissent in the hampden club met at the anchor tavern for example from which alehouse issued the first demand for universal male suffrage there is a case for arguing that these societies and tavern debating clubs are associated in london at least with the informal debates of the early eighteenthcentury coffee house such was the formative influence of that institution however that it can be held responsible for a club quite different from those which met in windmill street or moorfields it became known as the gentlemans club which according to a nineteenthcentury account arose from the illappointed coffeehouse or tavern to effect a revolution in the constitution of society whites club the oldest of these establishments is the direct descendant of whites chocolatehouse brookss and boodles are of eighteenthcentury date but the others including the athenaeum and the garrick are all of nineteenthcentury foundation these more recent establishments combined private associations with buildings which were deemed and planned to be on a public scale they were designed by architects such as wilkins and barry and smirke and with their basrelief sculpture and elaborate modelling they resembled large country houses or italian palaces they remain impressive principally because of the essential vulgarity of their appearance in that sense they are very much the stage property of london the endless contrasts of the city can in fact be exemplified by those other gentlemens clubs of the nineteenth century the working mens clubs generally held on the first floor of the local public house where the atmosphere was one of unrefined entertainment lectures were sometimes given as in george gissings the nether worldwhat would happen to the landlords of clerkenwell if they got their due ay what shall happen my boys and that before so very longbut adult education or jolly debate often gave way to the rattle of bones the strumming of a banjo and a voice raised at intervals in a kind of whoop in arthur morrisons account of the feathers in bethnal green there is a clubroom where the singsong began for at least a score were anxious to oblige although the effect is somewhat diminished by morrisons comment that the countenances of those attending were as of a man betrayed into mirth in the midst of great sorrow here again the importance indeed the stern necessity of drink is left unstated such places were known variously according to their locations as glee clubs or mughouses between songs there were toasts and speeches the more formal of these establishments were known as saloons and generally demanded money for entrance in exchange for refreshment varying from ale inkycoloured porter or strong beer to tea and brandy tables with covers of oilcloth or leather were pushed against a wall while at the end of the room was a table and a piano or harp there was no curriculum of entertainment one customer is reported as saying in roy porters london a social history every now amp then one of the young women would say i think ill sing a song a french visitor reported how at the sound of an auctioneers hammer rapped upon the table three gentlemen as serious as anglican ministers start singing sometimes alone sometimes in chorus sentimental ballads he also noticed that in some taverns of the same type the landlords have unfortunately installed mechanical organs which grind away unceasingly so complaints about pub entertainment are as old as public houses themselves these taverns and saloons had their counterparts in night cellars such as the cider cellars in maiden lane and the coal hole in fountain court the strand where established entertainers appeared as singers or performers among the combined fumes of ale gasjets and tobacco chapter a note on tobacco all visitors to clubs and pubs saw and smelled the fume of pipes and that smoke has hovered over london taverns since sir walter raleigh according to local legend first began to smoke in islington a few years later an early seventeenthcentury german visitor noted that londoners are constantly smoking tobacco and in this mannerthey have pipes on purpose made of clay into the farther end of which they put the herb so dry that may be rubbed into powder and putting fire to it clay pipes are to be found everywhere in archaeological excavations tobacco was at first supposed to have medicinal properties and could be purchased at the shops of apothecaries as a remedy for phlegmatick people children were permitted to smoke it too and in schools substituted a tobacco for breakfast and were initiated into the trick of expelling the smoke through their nostrils by their masters one diarist in recalled an evening with his brother at garraways coffee house where he was surprised to see his sickly child of three years old fill its pipe of tobacco after that a second and third pipe without the least concern this strange drug was everywhere in seventeenthcentury london but it had its detractors who denounced it for creating idleness and stupor even the king james i wrote a counterblast to tobacco in which he describes an unctuous and oily kind of soot found in some great tobaccotakers that after their death were opened yet nothing can dissuade londoners from taking their amusements or intoxicants in a city so reliant upon excess although the medicinal properties of tobacco were advertised its addictive properties soon became evident as a charm against anxiety and isolationa companion in solitude as one observer put it an amusement in company an innocent diversion to melancholy we hear of early seventeenthcentury vagrants such as the roaring boys and the bonaventoes smoking pipes tobacco became in that sense one of the necessary pleasures of the london poor another traveller to seventeenthcentury london noted how the citizens smoked their small pipes at a play or in a tavern and how it makes them riotous and merry and rather drowsy just as if they were drunk they use it so abundantly because of the pleasure it gives it was also a matter of comment that a pipe was passed round and that london women smoked in secret there was a great trade in tobacco close to half a million pounds and so many shops sold pipes and tobacco that in themselves they formed a large city so a city of smoke was wreathed within a city of trade it has been suggested that in the s the fashion if not the habit abated but despite samuel johnsons remark in that smoking has gone out in reality pipesmoking effortlessly merged with the later use of the cigarette cigarettes entered london soon after the crimean war the first manufactory was set up in walworth in a second and third were set up in queen victoria street and leicester square respectively under the ownership of greek immigrants and the first filterknown as the cambridge cigarettewas manufactured in fag was the name applied only to the cheaper variety of cigarette the addiction was always strongly present in fact the city itself seemed to promote it i strive after tobacco lamb once wrote as other men strive after virtue the tobacco warehouse in nineteenthcentury london docks contained almost five million pounds sterling worth of that commodity and there were very many of the poor who spent time picking up the ends of cigars thrown away as useless by the smokers in the streets selling the waste product at a price of d to d per pound every aspect of london can take part in trade chapter a bad odour the smells of london linger they are always more pronounced in the heart of the city according to one late nineteenthcentury canadian writer sara jeanette duncan than in kensington for instance she went on to report that it was no special odour or collection of odours that could be distinguishedit was a rather abstract smell it has been likened to the smell of rain or of metal it may be the smell of human activity or human greed yet it has been claimed that the smell is not human at all when rain falls upon the city one of the most characteristic odours is that of refreshed stone but that dampness can also produce the tired physical smell of london it is the smell of age or rather of age restored in the fourteenth century the odours were varied and multifarious from the smell of baking meat to that of boiling glue from the brewing of beer to the manufacture of vinegar decayed vegetables competed against tallow and horsedung all of which made up a richly confected cloud of thick and heavy smell which the people had to breathe this medieval smell is at this late date difficult to identify although perhaps it lingers in stray doorways and passageways where a similar medley of odours confronts the passerby there are also parts of the world as for example the souks of north africa where it is possible to savour something of the atmosphere of medieval london every century too has its own smells in the fifteenth century the dog house at moorgate sent forth great noyious and infectyve aiers while others complained about the reek of the lime kilns situated in the suburbs the smell of sea coal in particular was identified with the smell of the city itself it was essentially the odour of trade which proved unbearable thus in the sixteenth century the foundries of lothbury were a source of much public disquiet from the north came the smell of burnt bricks while in the city itself by paternoster row emerged a nauseous smell of tallow the smell of the stocks market at the eastern end of cheapside was so strong that the worshippers in the adjacent church of st stephen walbrook were overcome by the stench of rotting vegetables those who attended church risked other olfactory perils however and the odours emanating from the burial ground of st pauls churchyard alarmed latimer in the sixteenth century i think verily that many a man taketh his death in pauls churchyard he expounded in one of his sermons and this i speak of experience for i myself when i have been there in some mornings to hear the sermons have felt such an ill favoured unwholesome savour that i was the worse for it a great while after this odour of graveyards was in fact one of the most permanent and prolonged smells of the city with complaints against it from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries but there is the smell of the living as well as of the dead references in sixteenthand seventeenthcentury dramatic literature point to the distinctive odour of a london crowd in particular what shakespeare described in coriolanus as their stinking breaths julius caesar is felled by the savour of filthy bodies which belong more to london than to rome in the eighteenth century george cheyne in the english malady recoiled from the clouds of stinking breaths and perspirations more than sufficient to poison and infect the air for twenty miles in social reports of the nineteenth century there are accounts of the noisome scents of low tenements and lodging houses which left inspectors faint and sick in a city of work and trade one of the principal inconveniences will be that of perspiration of greasy cooks at sweating work london is a kind of forcing house and within it lies the mixture of scents that arose from mundung as tobacco sweaty toes dirty shirts the shittub stinking breaths and uncleanly carcasses certainly the more refined londoner would on a still day be aware of the presence of other citizens without necessarily seeing them the image generally employed is one of close suffocating contact as if the inhabitants were pressing in on all sides with their rank bodies and dirty breath this was one of the reasons why strangers and travellers at once felt so anonymous in london suddenly they became aware of and part of the intimate yet cloying smell of human life when a sixteenthcentury report notes that the sick and infirm lie upon the streets of london where their intolerable miseries and griefs stunk in the eyes and noses of the city the olfactory sense is linked with the visual to suggest an overpowering sensory horror it is also an ageless smell to walk down a narrow and evilsmelling passage in contemporary londonand there are many such off the main thoroughfaresis to walk again down fowle lane or stinking alley to pass too close to an unwashed vagrant is to experience the disagreeable sensation of an eighteenthcentury londoner when confronted with an abraham man or a common beggar in its smells the city can inhabit many past times it should not be assumed however that the entire citizenry were unwashed there was soap as early as the fifteenth century as well as lozenges to sweeten the breath and unguents to perfume the body the real problem as with so many others in the city concerned the presence and the perceived contamination of the poor in the seventeenth century the smells of poverty intruded into fashionable areas with stinking allies and suffocating yards beside newly designed squares the smells of london were a great leveller the rushes laid upon the floors of poorer households harboured spittle vomit scraps of food and the leakage of dogs and other animals in areas such as bethnal green and stepney some of those animals were pigs in orchard street marylebone there were twentythree houses which between them contained seven hundred people together with one hundred pigs creating very nauseous smells once more the difference between smell and no smell is decided in london by money money is odourless in the city of finance poverty stinks so in the midnineteenth century an urban traveller visited the slums of agar town by st pancras which not even wind and rain could cleanse and where the stench of a rainy morning is enough to knock down a bullock in that century too other localities had their own especial odours the area around tower street smelled of wine and tea in the previous century its aroma was of oil and cheese while shadwells odour was that of the adjacent sugar manufactories from bermondsey issued the smells of beer tanyards pickle and the odour of fruits fomenting for jam while by the river itself thomas hardy lodging in adelphi terrace suffered from illness as a result of the smell of mud at low tide in nineteenthcentury islington the smell was of horsedung and fried fish while the area around fleet street and temple bar was apparently permeated by the odour of brown stout visitors recall that the characteristic aroma of the city itself was of the stables with an anticipatory stench of its cabstands the experience of walking from the monument to the thames however would unleash a series of identifiable smells from damaged oranges to herrings there were delightful smells as well as disagreeable ones in the seventeenth century at midnight when the bakers of london began to heat their ovens and when the kitchens and stoves using sea coal were finally at rest then the air begins to clear and the smoke of the bakeries which are heated with wood rather than with coal spreads a very countrylike smell in the neighbouring air there were also london streets which had a reputation for being sweetsmelling such a place in the sixteenth century was bucklersbury in simple or herb time and newly built pall mall a japanese visitor of said that the city smelled of food while at the same time commenting unfavourably on the breath of london servants the french poet mallarmé suggested that the city had the odour of roast beef as well as the scent of fog with a special smell you only find here at a slightly later date jb priestley recalled the odour of greasy little eating houses as well as that of a smoky autumn morning with a railway station smell about it the smell of transport in all its forms has always been characteristic of the city in the spring the omnibus for example had the odour of onions and in winter of paraffin or eucalyptus in the summer it was simply indescribable fog caught the throat like a whiff of chlorine rose macaulay remembered a passage off high street kensington which smelled of vaseline long acre smelled of onions and southampton row of antiseptic twentiethcentury london has been filled with odours from the smell of chocolate along the hammersmith road to the smell of the chemical works down chrisp street in the east end and along the locally named stinkhouse bridge old smells have lingered like the odour of the river and of pubs while whole areas have retained their own especial and identifiable atmosphere an account of the east end written in the late s notes an almost overpowering smell of fish and boiled cabbage together with a musty smell of old wood and crumbling bricks and stagnant air almost a century earlier in the area was similarly described in the bitter cry of outcast london as imbued with the fragrance of stale fish or vegetables and the nineteenthcentury odour of drying matchboxes the ubiquitous twentiethcentury smell however has been that of the bus and the motor car the air is tainted with their breath wrote william dean howells in which is now one of the most characteristic stenches of civilisation other persistent presences include the smell of dog excrement upon the pavements and the greasy savour emanating from fastfood restaurants and then too there is the dull acrid smell of the underground which is also the smell of london dust and burnt london hair worse however is the clinging odour of the morning rush hour below the ground with lungfuls of morning breath leaving a metallic quality at the back of the throat it is both human and inhuman like the smell of london itself chapter you sexy thing sex in the city has commonly been associated with dirt and disease if not with these then with trade the resemblance exists even within the language itself hard core is a term conventionally applied to pornography but its original meaning in a london context was that of hard rocklike rubbish used in the building of roads and houses where there is rubbish there is also death the area around the haymarket a notorious haunt of prostitutes encompasses a march of the dead it is a plaguespotthe real plague spot from its earliest days london has been the site of sexual activity a roman model of a phallus was found in coleman streetlater paradoxically a haven for lollards and puritansas well as an architrave depicting three prostitutes in the precincts of the roman temple where gracechurch street and leadenhall street now are there would have been erotic celebrations connected with saturn or priapus and beside the amphitheatre on the present site of the guildhall we might expect to find a palaestra or promenade frequented by male and female prostitutes there were brothels licensed by the roman authorities as well as fornixes or arches beneath which were located mere dirty shacks employed for the purposes of fornication ej burford in his learned london the synfulle citie has remarked that on certain street corners a herm was placed a short stone pillar of hermes with an erect penis and prepuce painted a brilliant red yet the use of arches and brothels meant that in this most commercial of cities sex had itself already been commercialised in the centuries of danish and saxon occupation young women were bought and sold like any other merchandise gif a man buy a mayden with cattle according to one saxon injunction let the bargain stand if it be without guile a thousand years later an eighteenthcentury nursery rhyme contained the line i had to go to london town and buy me a wife there are supposed to have been auctions for women in certain secret markets continuing well into the nineteenth century and the emphasis upon finance is sustained by the enquiry of the late twentiethcentury prostitute do you want any business so does the spirit of london imprint itself upon the desires of its inhabitants london is dedicated to selling but the poor have nothing to sell so they sell their bodies thus sexual lust is free to roam down every lane and alley london has always been the scene of covert debauchery those medieval chroniclers who cited london for its drunkenness and sinfulness also rebuked it for its rapists and its lechers its harlots and its sodomites in the twelfth century there is reference to bordhawe an area of brothels in the parish of st mary colechurch in the thirteenth century and probably much earlier there was a gropecuntlane in the two parishes of st pancras and st mary colechurch also known as groppecountelane and gropecontelane the context and meaning here are obvious enough in the same period there are references to love lane where yonge couples were wont to sport and maid lane socalled of wantons there beside smithfields there was also cock lane which in was assigned for sexual congress it became in a sense the first redlight district notorious for prostitutes at the approach of night they sally forth from their homes low taverns serve them as a retreat to receive their gallants the description was pertinent at any time from the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries and serves to emphasise how one small area can continue the same activity even as the city changes all around it that lane was inhabited by the very types of london such as mrs martha king a little fat woman known last winter by her velvet gown and pettecoat mrs elizabeth brown who has been a dealer in cullies young girls ever since she was fifteen modest and pleasant enough till after the third bottle and mrs sarah farmer a great twohanded strapper having no charms either in person or in humour in piers plowman c langland also commemorates clarice of cokkeslane and the clerke of the cherche in the fourteenth century there are records of proceedings against whores courtesans and bawds as well as whoremongers in june william de dalton was arrested for keeping a house of ill fame in which married women and their paramours were wont to resort and in the following month robert de stratford was arraigned for harbouring prostitutes in the following year gilbert le strengmaker of fleet street was charged with maintaining a disorderly house harbouring prostitutes and sodomites while at the same sessions two courtesans agnes and juliana of holborne were also accused of harbouring sodomites so there was in medieval london a thriving homosexual community which aligned itself with the world of brothels and bawds it would be tempting to describe it as an underworld except that it was well known and ubiquitous charges were laid against brothels in the wards of aldersgate the tower billingsgate bridge here one prostitute was known as clarice la claterballock broad street aldgate farringdon and elsewhere many of those arrested for sexual offences came from areas far from london itself however suggesting that the reports of sexual licenceand profithad spread throughout the country london had long ago become the centre of englands sinfulness a great chronicle of the period brut remarks upon ladies waerynge foxtayles sewed wythynne to hide their arses while another reports on the ladies of the town with breasts and bellies exposed there were in fact sumptuary laws which proscribed lewd women from wearing the same clothes as noble dames and damsels of the realm they were obliged to wear striped garments as a sign of their profession which indirectly suggests the level of tolerance exercised in medieval catholic london prostitution was neither banned nor excluded the level of vice was in late medieval london far higher or at least more open than at any period in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries it reached such an extent that it provoked alarm among the city authorities who in published a proclamation against the stynkynge and horrible synne of lecherie which dayly groweth and is used more than in dayes past by the means of strumpettes mysguded and idyll women dayly vagraunt there were attempts then to remove the mysguded from the more respectable thoroughfares of the city by confining the women to the areas of smithfield and southwark beyond the walls but in southwark the bankside brothels south of the river were continually placed in jeopardy by the whims or panics of the authorities and the women themselves chose to congregate in areas such as st giles shoreditch where they still can be seen and ave maria alley beside st pauls cathedral they were also to be found in the harry in cheapside the bell in gracechurch street and a score of other stews within the city the derivation of the term stews comes not from some reference to cloying meat or hot broth but from the old french for artificially stocked fishpondsestuier to shut up that sense of closeted heat stewboiled was exacerbated by the incidence of syphilis which in the sixteenth century became the object of outrage from moralists and rage from satirists the sexual life of the city continued regardless in any case with visitors remarking on the casual intimacy of the relations between the sexes a venetian of the sixteenth century commented that many of the young women gather outside moorgate to play with the young lads even though they do not know them they kiss each other a lot married females seem to have taken part in the same pursuit and in the early seventeenth century a tall flagpole was set up on the shore of the thames just past deptford to which horns of all kinds and descriptions are fixed in honour of all the english cuckolds or horn carriers and the english have much fun and amusement with each other as they pass by and doff their hats to each other and to all around it was well known as

cresswell of clerkenwell was a notorious procuress who was painted and engraved on several occasions in her house she kept beauties of all complexions from the coleblack clyngfast to the golden lockd insatiate from the sleepy eyd slug to the lewd fricatrix and she corresponded with agents all over england to discover the young and the attractive she was one of many famous london bawds in the first of his series a harlots progress hogarth pictured mother needham who owned a notorious brothel in park place but she was pelted to death in the pillory and hogarth had to substitute for her mother bentley who was equally famous in the streets of london these mothers were indeed the mothers of a city of lust some of its daughters and its sons were young indeed every ten yards a german traveller wrote one is beset even by children of twelve years old who by the manner of their address save one the trouble of asking whether they know what they want they attach themselves to you like limpets often they seize hold of you after a fashion of which i can give you the best notion by the fact that i say nothing about it boswells diary of street life in provides an account of sexual favours currently on offer on the evening of thursday november he picked up a girl in the strand and went into a court with intention to enjoy her in armour ie wearing a condom but she had none she wondered at my size and said if ever i took a girls maidenhead i would make her squeak on the night of march in the following year i strolled into the park and took the first whore i met whom i without many words copulated with free from danger being safely sheathed she was ugly and lean and her breath smelled of spirits i never asked her name when it was done she slunk off on april i took a little girl into a court but wanted vigour boswell often a moralist after the event does not regard the fact that it was a little girl as of any significance this suggests that there were many such thrown upon the streets of london when thomas de quincey met one of them ann he spent many nights with her walking up and down oxford street but she was timid and dejected to a degree which showed how deeply sorrow had taken hold of her young heart he left her for a while naming a spot at the corner of titchfield street where they should wait for each other but he never saw her again he looked for ann in vain among the thousand faces of young girls in the london crowd and called oxford street stony hearted stepmother thou that listenest to the sighs of orphans and drinkest the tears of children this compassionate attitude to the suffering of young female prostitutes rarely if ever emerges in eighteenthcentury records including that of boswell the month after taking the little girl into a court for example boswell picked up a woman and conducted her to westminster bridge and then in armour complete did i engage her upon this noble edifice this in the slang of the time was probably a threepenny upright the whim of doing it there with the thames rolling below us aroused me much to boswell she was only a low wretch and by definition unclean therefore after the event she became an object of suspicion and threat boswell was always terrified of catching venereal disease like most of his contemporaries john gay in a purview of london warned against the pursuit of the tawdry band that romp from lamp to lampfor health expect disease for fleeting pleasure foul remorse and daily nightly agonising pains such were the pains suffered by casanova who after visiting a prostitute in the canon tavern was infected with gonorrhoea casanova described how on an earlier occasion he entered another brothel the star tavern where he ordered a private room he engaged in conversation with the grave and reverend landlorda good aside touching the assumed character of many london brothelkeepersbefore turning away all the women who came to his room give a shilling for the porters and send her away said his host after the first refusal we dont trouble ourselves about ceremonies in london there was no ceremony when samuel johnson was accosted by a prostitute in the strandno no my girl he murmured it wont do richard steele was approached by another such girl newly come upon the town near the piazza in covent garden she asked if i was for a pint of wine but under the arches of the market at twilight he noticed in her countenance hunger and cold her eyes were wan and eager her dress thin and tawdry her mien genteel and childish this strange figure gave me much anguish of heart and to avoid being seen with her i went away the strand and covent garden as well as all the lanes which crossed them were known places of sexual resort there were public houses in the vicinity where posture dancers performed an eighteenthcentury version of striptease there were houses of pleasure which specialised in flagellation and there were mollie houses which were frequented by homosexuals the london journal of may discovered twenty sodomitical clubsincluding it would seem the boghouses of lincolns innwhere they make their execrable bargains and then withdraw into some dark corners to perpetrate their odious wickedness mother claps in holborn and the talbot inn in the strand were favourite meetingplaces for homosexual men and there was a male brothel by the old bailey where it was customary for the men to address each other as madam or ladyship the horseshoe in beech lane and the fountain in the strand were the eighteenthcentury equivalent of gay pubs while the area around the royal exchange was known for its cruising when as a contemporary verse put it sodomites were so impudent to ply on thexchange popes head alley and sweetings alley were all streets with a similar reputation the male owner of a tavern or brothel in camomile street was known as the countess of camomile at mother claps itself there were beds in every room with commonly thirty to forty chaps every nightand even moreespecially on sunday nights while in a beech street brothel were found a company of men fiddling dancing and singing bawdy songs there was a darker side to these festivities however when a certain club of buggerantoes was raided several of those arrested committed suicide among them a mercer a draper and a chaplain there were also many cases of blackmail so that there was danger as well as excitement in the city nevertheless london remained the centre of homosexuality where under conditions of privacy and anonymity the elect could pursue their calling city juries were in any case notoriously reluctant to pronounce the capital sentence for the crime of sodomy the usual verdict was attempted sodomy for which a fine short imprisonment or spell in the pillory was sufficient londoners are characteristically lenient in matters of sexual impropriety how can they be otherwise in a city where every form of vice and extravagance is continually available the sexual ambience of nineteenthcentury london despite the cliché of the victorian age as one of upright family values was no less lascivious than its eighteenthcentury counterpart in her london journal flora tristan wrote in that in london all classes are deeply corrupted vice comes to them early she had been shocked by an orgy in a tavern where english aristocrats and members of parliament disported themselves with drunken women until daybreak in quite a different sphere henry mayhew noted of london street children that their most remarkable characteristic is their extraordinary licentiousness as a result of his observations he guessed that the age of puberty came much earlier than most people believed he declined to give however the details of filthiness and of all uncleanness even in the areas where the more respectable working class lived it was customary for couples as young as thirteen and fourteen to live and procreate without the need for marriage vows there was a church in bethnal green for example where these cockney marriages could be performed and where you might be married for sevenpence if you were fourteen years old one curate of the east end recalled a christmas morning when he stood marrying blaspheming youths and girls to one another ghastly mockery here sexual profligacy is associated with a general irreligion or atheism which is another characteristic emblem of london life yet the major concern of nineteenthcentury urban observers lay with the extent and nature of prostitution surveysby mayhew by booth by acton and otherssuggest that it became something of an obsession there were books entitled prostitution in london or more elaborately prostitution considered in its moral social amp sanitary aspects there were tables and statistics about where prostitutes were kept lodged or resorted with divisions and subdivisions welldressed living in brothels welldressed living in private lodgings in low neighbourhoods introducing houses and accommodation houses there were detailed observations on bent and character of mind manner of passing their leisure hours moral defects spiritous liquor and good qualities strong sympathy for one another prostitution seems to have been the overwhelming consideration of victorian social reformers complementary to the efforts of other workers in matters of sanitation and housing in that sense all were concerned with the inheritance of a thousand years of unchecked urban living with a strong effort to cleanse or purify it the connection of sexuality and disease was also explicitly made william acton in prostitution in london revealed that these rouged and whitewashed creatures with painted lips and eyebrows and false hair accustomed to haunt langham place portions of the new road the quadrant the city road and the purlieus of the lyceum were on investigation more often than not found to be a mass of syphilis the characteristic metaphor of waste or refuse was also adduced as a heap of rubbish will ferment so surely will a number of unvirtuous women the prostitute then becomes a symbol of contagion both moral and physical of the eighty thousand in london in the s it was said that eight thousand would die each year in the london hospitals cases of syphilis occurred each year in children from eleven to sixteen years of age the actual number of female prostitutes was a subject of endless speculation and inventionseventy thousand eighty thousand ninety thousand or higher and in the midnineteenth century it was computed that are expended annually on this vice in london alone in that sense prostitution itself becomes a token of londons commercial rapacity as well as of the fears attendant upon the overwhelming growth of both vice and the city itself the degradation of civilisation in the very centre of london can take many different forms some of them were recorded in ryans prostitution in london published in maria scoggins aged fifteen held a situation as a staymaker on her way to her fathers house in the evening she was decoyed to a brothel kept by rosetta davis alias abrahams and turned upon the streets another girl aged fifteen was actually sold by her stepmother to the keeper of one of these houses in the eastern part of london unwary children of both sexes were merchandise leah davis was an elderly female the mother of thirteen daughters all either prostitutes or brothelkeepers the metaphor of youth being sacrificed is redolent of barbaric rituals at the altars of troy or gomorrah while the image of girls thrown turned or decoyed upon the streets suggests a vision of a dark and labyrinthine city where innocence is quickly scented and destroyed three girls of fifteen were despatched to lure many youths together so as to make their united payments considerable they were admitted to the scene of depravity which the establishment unfolded these houses were used as lodging houses for thieves vagabonds mendicants and others of the lowest grade it was well known that the most diabolical practices were constantly perpetrated within them in the midst of a dense and ignorant population men women and children of all ages were there associated for the vilest and basest purposes spreading a moral miasma around this is a record of what was considered to be the shadow of pagan darkness not in the suburbs or in welllocalised stews but in the very heart of the city but if one image of the london prostitute was of disease and contagion embodying in striking form all the anxieties and fears which the city itself may provoke the other was of isolation and alienation de quinceys account of ann daughter of stonyhearted oxford street is one of the first examples of that urban vision which sees in the plight of the young prostitute the very condition of living in the city she had become a prey to all its merciless commercial forces as well as to its underlying indifference and forgetfulness dostoevsky when wandering down the haymarket noticed how mothers brought their little daughters to make them ply the same trade he observed one girl not older than six all in rags dirty barefoot and hollow cheeked she had been severely beaten and her body which showed through the rags was covered with bruises nobody was paying any attention to her here we have an image of suffering in london amid the endlessly hurrying and passing crowd who would no more pause to consider a bruised child than a maimed dog what struck dostoevsky who himself was used to terror and hopelessness in his own country was the look of such distress such hopeless despair on her face she kept on shaking her tousled head as if arguing about something gesticulated and spread her little hands and then suddenly clasped them together and pressed them to her little bare breast these are the sights and pictures of london on another evening a woman dressed all in black passed him and hurriedly thrust a piece of paper in his hand he looked at it and saw that it contained the christian message i am the resurrection and the life but how could anyone believe the precepts of the new testament when they had witnessed the pain and loneliness of a sixyearold girl when the city was described as pagan it was partly because no one living among such urban suffering could have much faith in a god who allowed cities such as london to flourish yet perhaps the true gods of the city are of a different nature when the shaftesbury memorial fountain otherwise known as eros was unveiled in at piccadilly circus it was only a few yards from the infamous haymarket where mothers had brought their young daughters for sale eros was the first statue ever made of aluminium and in that conflation of ancient passion and newminted metal we have an emblem of desire as old and as new as the city itself eros has been drawing people ever since in a twentiethcentury novel by sam selvon entitled the lonely londoners one of the protagonists a trinidadian notices that the circus have magnet for him that circus represent life that circus is the beginning and ending of the world throughout this century piccadilly circus has been the site of nightly sexual encounters and an area where young people drift in search of adventure it is a place where all the roads seem to meet in endless disarray and it exudes an atmosphere both energetic and impersonal that is perhaps also why it has been for many decades a centre of prostitution and easy pickups both male and female it has always been the part of london most identified with casual sex there were regular places they haunted theodore dreiser wrote of london prostitutes at the beginning of the twentieth century piccadilly being the best and that sentiment has been echoed in a thousand novels and documentary reports the statue of eros has after all commanded a strange power the city itself is a form of promiscuous desire with its endless display of other streets and other people affording the opportunity of a thousand encounters and a thousand departures the very strangeness of london its multifarious areas remaining unknown even to its inhabitants includes the possibility of chance and sudden meetings to be alone or solitary a characteristic symptom of city life is to become an adventurer in search of brief companionship it also is the mark of the predator the anonymity or impersonality of london life is itself the source of sexual desire where the appetite can be satisfied without the usual constraints of a smaller society so the actual vastness of london encourages fantasy and illimitable desire that is why the general sexual condition of london has always remained the same in its voraciousness and insatiability today there are strip bars and clubs where lap dancers perform a thousand pubs and nightclubs cater for every kind of sexual perversity there are streets known for prostitutes and parks used at night for cruising whole areas of london at night assume a different face so that the city is like some endlessly fecund source which can offer alternative realities and different experiences that is why it is in itself sexy displaying its secret places and tempting the unwary to turn just one more corner or walk down one more path may bring who knows what the telephone booths are littered with advertisements for sadistic or transsexual prostitutes some of them claiming to be new in town or new to london they are reminiscent of the eighteenthcentury prostitute in covent garden newly come upon the town but nothing is ever new in london where the young still offer up their bodies for sale chapter a turn of the dice drink sex and gambling once always consorted together they were the trinity of london vice and weakness an unholy threesome which disported happily across the city they represented recklessness and defiance in the face of an uncertain life in a city bedevilled by insecurity all the commercial and financial institutions of london were established upon a giant gamble so why not participate in the same perilous but enthralling game your encounter with a prostitute might lead to a fatal disease but a turn of the dice might make you wealthy then in the face of all these hazards and difficulties you might drink to forget the social historian of eighteenthcentury london m dorothy george noted that the temptations to drink and gamble were interwoven with the fabric of society to an astonishing extent and they did undoubtedly combine with the uncertainties of life and trade to produce that sense of instability of liability to sudden ruin many men of business were ruined by dissipation and gamblingindustry and idleness charting the decline of a london apprentice through drink dice and women to eventual hanging at tyburn was a characteristic london story the first evidence of gambling in london can be adduced from the roman period with the excavation of dice carved out of bone or jet the unexpected turns of life as then experienced are also revealed in the elaborate equipment of a fortuneteller found beneath newgate street in the early medieval period hazard was played in taverns and other low houses together with another dice game known as tables in medieval brothels too gambling and drinking were part of the service quarrels over a game were sometimes fatal and after one round of tables the loser fatally stabbed the winner on the way home there was plentiful scope for fraud also and there are reports of the gaming boards being marked and the dice loaded yet the passion for gaming was everywhere an excavation in dukes place revealed a piece of medieval rooftile shaped into a gaming counter according to a report in the london archaeologist and as early as the thirteenth century there were rules in westminster for the punishment of any schoolboy found with dice in his possession a stroke of the rod was delivered for every pip on the dice playing cards were imported into london in the fifteenth century and their use became so widespread that in henry vii forebad their use to servants and apprentices except during the christmas holidays stow records that from all hallows eve to the day following candlemasday there was among other sports playing at cards for counters nails and points in every house they were found in every tavern too packs of cards had the names of various inns imprinted upon them their merits were widely advertised spanish cards lately brought from vigo being pleasant to the eye by their curious colours and quite different from ours may be had at one shilling a pack at mrs baldwins in warwick lane the business in cards became so brisk that the tax upon their sale is estimated to have furnished in the midseventeenth century an annual income of five thousand pounds which meant that some million packs of cards must have been traded fulham earned a reputation as early as the sixteenth century for its dubious traffic in dice and counters it is evoked by shakespeare in the merry wives of windsor where for gourd and fullam holds and high and low beguile the rich and poor a fullam in this context was a loaded die another recognised centre for gambling was lincolns inn fields here boys gambled for farthings and oranges one popular game was the wheel of fortune with a movable hand spinning within a circle of figures the prize being gingerbread nuts the size of a farthing these gaming fields of course attracted dissolute londoners lincolns inn fields was the recognised harbour for idle and vicious vagrants known collectively as its mummers among them were dicers and chetors and foists who specialised in gambling dice were carved out of true so that they seemed good and square yet in the forehead longer on the cater and tray than the other what shifts have they to bring this false die in and out a jolly fine shift that properly is called foisting so went a dialogue in a pamphlet entitled manifest detection which outlined a score of other tricks used by the fraternity of the shifters another pamphlet look on me london warned against the citys tricks and devices to gull the innocent or the unwary strangers and visitors were liable to be duped or defrauded by the pickerup the kid the cap and the flat nicknames which seem to span the generations and once more the language used to describe londons principal vices is one of corruption and contagion dice and cards were the green pathway to hell whereby followed a hundred gowtie dropsy diseases in a city terrified of sickness and epidemic plague the metaphors for any type of excess or pleasure become insistent the fever ran unabated when the floor of the middle temple hall was taken up in no less than a hundred pair of dice were found to have slipped through its boards during the play of previous generations in the midseventeenth century pepys observed of the players in one gaming house how ceremonious they are as to call for new dice to shift their places to alter their manner of throwing and he noticed how some old gamesters that have no money now to spend as formerly do come and sit and look on as among others these places became known in london as hells and in them pepys heard the cries of the damned so one man being to throw a seven if he could and failing to do it after a great many throws cried he would be damned if ever he flung seven more while he lived another player who had won shouted out a pox on it that it should come so early upon me for this fortune two hours hence would be worth something to me but then god damn me i shall have no such luck the london gaming houses were often characterised too as places where gentlemen and noblemen would sit down with the meaner sort to use pepyss word the same observation was made in the late twentieth century in connection with casinos and gaming clubs where the aristocracy and the underworld consorted the dissipations of london like the city itself act as great levellers lord chesterfield perhaps struck by the egalitarian mood of the city once remarked that he preferred playing with a sharper to playing with a gentleman for though he might not often win of the former he was sure when he did win to get paid by the early eighteenth century there were approximately forty gaming houses in the city known as subscriptionhouses and slaughterhouses as well as hells there were more of these infamous places of resort in london according to timbss curiosities of london than in any other city in the world they were recognisable by an ornate gaslamp in front of the entrance and a green or red baize door at the end of the hallway gaming rose in frequency and excessiveness throughout the century a century which by curious chance was the one most marked by financial uncertainty and sudden ruin thus in the age of the bubble and other panics whist was perfected by gentlemen who met at the crown coffee house in bedford row gaming was declared illegal but despite nightly raids upon certain selected hells in the city it continued to flourish there was always assembled a mixed crowd of gentlemen merchants tradesmen clerks and sharpers of all degrees and conditions ready to play at hazard faro basset rolypoly and a score of other games involving dice and cards into these hells came the puffs the flashers the squibs the dunners the flash captains with a regiment of spies porters and runners to give notice of approaching constables at almacks a famous gaming club in pall mall the players turned their coats inside out for luck they put on wristbands of leather to protect their lace ruffles and wore straw hats to guard their eyes from the light and to prevent their hair from tumbling sometimes too they put on masks to conceal their emotions at brookss the twentyfirst rule stated that there should be no gaming in the eating room except tossing up for reckonings on penalty of paying the whole bill of the members present there were other less agreeable occasions for a wager as recorded in london souvenirs a prospective player once dropped down dead at the door of whites the club immediately made bets whether he was dead or only in a fit and when they were going to bleed him the wagerers for his death interposed saying it would affect the fairness of the bet londoners according to one foreign observer violent in their desires and who carry all their passions to excess are altogether extravagant in the article of gaming another visitor offered a similar account what will you lay is the first question frequently asked by high and low when the smallest disputes arise on subjects of little consequence some of the richer class after dinner over a bottle feel perhaps an inclination for betting the one opens a nut with a maggot in it another does the same and a third immediately proposes a bet which of the two worms will crawl first over a given distance betting was of course involved in the games of violenceratcatching cockfighting female wrestlingwith which london abounded but natural phenomena also became the subject of speculation on the morning after violent tremors in the city bets were laid at whites whether it was an earthquake or the blowing up of powdermills it was indeed an earthquake one of the less predictable hazards of london life a marketworker in leadenhall made a bet that he would walk times around moorfields in twenty seven hours and did it a minister of state the earl of sandwich passed four and twenty hours at a public gaming table so absorbed in play that during the whole time he had no subsistence but a bit of beef between two slices of toasted bread which he eat without ever quitting the game this new dish grew highly in vogue it was called by the name of the minister who invented it the traditions of public gaming were continued into the nineteenth century by such places as the royal saloon in piccadilly the castle in holborn tom cribbs saloon in panton street the finish in james street the white house in soho square ossington castle in orange street and brydges street saloon in covent garden otherwise known as the hall of infamy or old mother damnables on the other side of london in the east end there were gambling rooms and gambling clubs to such an extent that one minister working among the poor of the area informed charles booth that gambling presses drink hard as the greatest evil of the day all gamble more than they drink the street urchins gambled with farthings or buttons in a card game known as darbs and betting on boxing or horseracing was carried on through the agency of tobacconists publicans newsvendors and barbers all must bet according to another informant in charles booths survey of the east end women as well as men men and boys tumble out in their eagerness to read the latest speshul and mark the winner and then of course there was the lottery it was first established in london in the passion for lucky numbers has burned for centuries aleph in london scenes and london people noted that acquaintances on a sudden meeting would talk not about the weather but the great prize just or about to be drawn and to the fortunate winner or to the blank you had just drawn and your confident belief that no would be the prize there were lottery magazines as well as lottery glovers hatmakers and teadealers who offered a small share on their ticket if you used their services the winning ticket was chosen in the guildhall by a blindfolded bluecoat schoolboy a london version of blindfolded fortuna and around the building were prostitutes thieves dirty workmen or labourers almost nakedmere children pale and anxious awaiting the announcement of the numbers in george orwells vision of a future london there is also the lottery it was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive it was their delight their folly their anodyne their intellectual stimulant orwell understood london very well and here he is suggesting some deep connection between the principle of its civilisation and the necessity of the gamble and the cheat londoners require the stimulus and the desperate hope of gain the chances are infinitesimal but in so vast and disproportioned a city that is taken for granted a wager can be shared with many millions and still be a wager the anticipation and anxiety are shared also so that gambling can be viewed as a sudden spasm of communal attention today the betting shops and casinos are full in queensway and russell square in kilburn and streatham and marble arch and a hundred other locations life in london can then be construed as a game which few can win london as crowd an etching by james gillray which caricatures sheridan as punch blowing theatrical bubbles above the heads of a cheering crowd london has always been a theatrical city and its mobs were once part of its dramatis personae chapter mobocracy in a city of rumour and of fluctuating fortune of excess in every form the london crowd has over the generations acquired an interesting pathology the crowd is not a single entity manifesting itself on particular occasions but the actual condition of london itself the city is one vast throng of people on looking into the street one seventeenthcentury observer recalled we saw a surging mass of people moving in search of some resting place which a fresh mass of sightseers grouped higgledy piggledy rendered impossible it was a fine medley there were old men in their dotage insolent youths and boys painted wenches and women of the lower classes carrying their children a medley suggests a show or spectacle and in the midseventeenth century painters began subtly to examine the london crowd it was no longer an indistinct mass seen from a safe distance but a general group of people whose particular features were differentiated there was always the noise as well as the spectacle it was very dark but we could perceive the street to fill and the hum of the crowd grew louder and louder about eight at night we heard a din from below which came up the street continually increasing till we could perceive a motion the loud indistinct hum rising to a roar and accompanied by strange general motion is the true sound of london behind this wave there was a vacancy but it filled apace till another like wave came up and so four or five of these waves passed one after another and throats were opened with hoarse and tremendous noise there is something crude and alarming about this sound it is as if the voice of the city were primeval unearthly the occasion described here in burkes the streets of london through the centuries was a late seventeenthcentury anticatholic procession down fleet street and its air of menace is enlarged by the reference to how one with a stenterophonic tube sounded abhorrers abhorrers most infernally the sound of london can be harsh and discordant yet sometimes its collective breath is charged with misery on the day of the execution of charles i january a great throng was assembled in whitehall at the instant of the blow which removed the kings head there was such a grone by the thousands then present as i never heard before amp desire may never hear again yet for the royalists of the seventeenth century the throng of london were the scum of all the profanest rout the vilest of all men the outcast of the people mechanic citizens and apprentices the crowd in other words became a tangible threat it was turning into a mob the word was coined in the seventeenth century which might become king mob the salient fact was that london had grown immeasurably larger in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and so obviously the size of its crowds was enlarged in an atmosphere of religious and political controversy too there was no model of civic polity to restrain them pepys records a crowd bawling and calling in the street for a free parliament and money and in the summer of it is said that they did in open streets yesterday at westminster cry a parliament a parliament and do believe it will cost blood in the following year there were riots in poplar and in moorfields and the new prison at clerkenwell was broken open by the people to rescue those who had been imprisoned for the old london custom of pulling down brothels but here it was said how these idle fellows have had the confidence to say that they did ill in contenting themselves in pulling down the little bawdyhouses and did not go and pull down the great bawdy house at whitehall this is the authentic radical and levelling voice of the londoner newly become a crowd or throng or mob in the heart of the city and some of them last night had a word among them and it was reformations and reducement this doth make the courtiers ill at ease to see this spirit among the people so london had become dangerous when a mob of chairmen or servants or a gang of thieves or sharpers are almost too big for the civil authority wrote henry fielding what must be the case in a seditious tumult or general riot the history of the eighteenthcentury crowd displays a gradual change of temper which was disturbing to magistrates such as fielding the scorn and insults were no longer primarily levelled at strangers or outsiders but rather at those of wealth or authority a man in court dress cannot walk the streets of london without being pelted with mud by the mob casanova wrote in the londoners hoot the king and the royal family when they appear in public in this chaos as casanova described it the flower of the nobility mingling in confusion with the vilest populace the common people affect to show their independence the most wretched porter will dispute the wall with a lord it was similarly reported by pierre jean grosley that in england no rank or dignity is secure from the insults and that no nation is more satirical or quicker at repartee especially the common people a frenchman made the acute point that this insolence is considered by many only as the humour and pleasantry of porters and watermen but this humour and pleasantry was in the hands of the long parliament one of their chief weapons against charles the first repartee and insult can in other words have political consequences in that context it is perhaps worth noting that the street urchins used the statue of queen anne outside st pauls cathedral as the target for their practice of throwing stones one of the characteristics of the london mob was its irritability and sudden changes of mood so that when a spark was struck in its depths it flared up very quickly when an offender did not arrive at a pillory in seven dials as expected the crowd erupted in a fury which principally fell upon passing hackney coaches they were pelted with filth and ordure while the coachmen were forced to cry out huzza as they went along at one controversial election meeting in westminster in a very few minutes the whole scaffolding benches and chairs and everything else were completely destroyed the rage of the crowd was random and sporadic fierce and exhilarating in equal measure one german visitor after a visit to ludgate hill noted now i know what an english mob is he was driving in a coach at a time of general rejoicing at the release from prison in of the great london politician wilkes and recalled halfnaked men and women children chimney sweeps tinkers moors and men of letters fishwives and elegant ladies each creature intoxicated by his own whims and wild with joy shouting and laughing it is as if the very restriction of the city encouraged the sudden appetite for wildness and licence the restraints imposed by a mercantile culture ruinous in its effects upon many who comprised the crowd encouraged rapid volatility of rage and exhilaration there were also too many people forced into too small a space and this massive overcrowding in narrow streets engendered strange fevers and excitements that is why the instinctive fear of the mob or crowd had as much to do with its propensity for disease as its prevalence towards violence it was the fear of touch of the unhealthy warmth of london as transmitted by its citizens which went back to the times of fever and of epidemic plague when in the words of defoe their hands would infect the things they touched especially if they were warm and sweaty and they were generally apt to sweat too the mob can also turn upon itself or upon one of its number the cry of a pick pocket in moll flanders set the crowd alight when all the loose part of the crowd ran that way and the poor boy was deliverd up to the rage of the street which is a cruelty i need not describe there is an element of sudden horror here as if a whirlpool of rage manifested itself without warning a record of the last days of a reputed astrologer and magician john lambe in the middle of june is printed in the life and death of john lambe by leva goldstein in guildhall studies in london history lambe was recognised by some boys in the fortune theatre who waited outside and followed him when he left more people joined them and lambe hired some passing sailors to form a protective bodyguard he walked down red cross street turned left into fore street and then left again to the horseshoe tavern in moor lane the crowd growing larger and louder all the time he dined in the inn while the sailors kept the crowd at bay but when he left and entered the city by moorgate the mob once more pursued him with cries of witch and devil the situation was now very serious he walked quickly down coleman street into lothbury where he took refuge in an upstairs room of the windmill tavern on the corner of old jewry his bodyguards were assaulted and both entrances to the tavern watched by the eager citizens he attempted to leave in disguise but was again marked down he took refuge in a nearby house belonging to a lawyer who called out four constables of the ward to guard him but the rage of the people so much increased that in the midst of these auxiliaries they struck him down to the ground and beat him with stones and clubs he never spoke again and was carried to the poultry compter where he died of his injuries on the following day this is an accurate report on the actions of a characteristic london crowd if you had any hope of finding a community life in london all foreigners agree that it is as if you searched for flowers in a vale of sand there was no community in london in the eighteenth century and no sense of communal life only a number of distinctive and distinguishable crowds there were crowds of women attacking bawdy houses or dishonest shops crowds of citizens alerted by a hue and cry crowds of parishioners attacking a local compter crowds watching a fire crowds of beggars and most ominously crowds of distressed or unemployed workers one eminent london historian stephen inwood has in fact remarked in his a history of london that rioters could be a form of collective bargaining between labourers and masters in there was violent rioting by frameworkknitters which presaged decades of unrest and disorder in the poor urban districts such as whitechapel and shoreditch there were riots by silkweavers and coalheavers hatmakers and glassgrinders and a host of assorted tradesmen whom creeping industrialisation and increased food prices had rendered ever more desperate indian calico was a threat to the weavers of spitalfields for example and one woman was attacked by a crowd who tore cut pulled off her gown and petticoat by violence threatened her with vile language and left her naked in the fields london channelled the energies of its citizens in the crooked shape of its lanes and thoroughfares rendering them ever more fierce and desperate that is why the process of city life itself was seen as a movement within a crowd sometimes it is indifferent and banal an aspect of the great metropolis where exists the vast unhurried audience that will still gather and stare at any new thing yet on occasions its speed and confusion were decisive as in grays poem where on the streets of the city the crowd tumultuous bears my partner from my side this is a defining image well expressed in moll flanders i took my leave of her in the very crowd and said to her as if in hast dear lady betty take care of your little sister and so the crowd did as it were thrust me away from her the impersonal crowd parts friend from friend and separates loved one from loved one those dearest to us are no longer near borne away by the surging tide in unknown directions yet for some there is comfort to be found in this anonymity i shall therefore retire to the town wrote addison in the spectator of july and get into the crowd again as fast as i can in order to be alone the crowd encourages solitude therefore as well as secrecy and anxiety the nineteenth century inherited all these propensities but in the enormous oven or wen the crowd became increasingly impersonalised engels the great observer of imperial london remarked that the brutal indifference the unfeeling isolation of each is nowhere so shamelessly barefaced as just here in the crowding of the great city by which he meant not only the crowding in the thoroughfares as the indifferent mass of people moved in preordained directions but the general overpopulation within the capital it had become dense to blackness with the number of human lives within it engels recorded again that the very turmoil of the streets has something repulsive something against which human nature rebels the hundreds and thousands of all classes and ranks crowding past each other he noticed too how each keeps to his own side of the pavement so as not to delay the opposing streams of the crowd while it occurs to no man to honour another with so much as a glance the nineteenthcentury london crowd was a new phenomenon in human history which is why so many social and political reformers chose to observe it in engelss account for example it became a mechanism imitating the financial and industrial processes of the city representing an almost inhuman force lenin rode on the top of an omnibus the better to observe the movement and nature of this strange creature he reported upon groups of bloated and bedraggled lumpen proletarians in whose midst might be observed some drunken woman with a black eye and a torn and trailing velvet dress of the same colour the pavements were thronged with crowds of working men and women who were noisily purchasing all kinds of things and assuaging their hunger on the spot in his account the london crowd became the fierce embodiment of energy and appetite with the forces of its dark life intimated by the black eye and black dress of the drunken woman when dostoevsky lost his way among the crowds what i had seen tormented me for three days afterwards those millions of people abandoned and driven away from the feast of humanity push and crush each other in the underground darkness the mob has not enough room on the pavements and swamps the whole street a drunken tramp shuffling along in this terrible crowd is jostled by the rich and titled you hear curses quarrels solicitations he sensed all the chaos of collective experience in a city which was itself a curse a quarrel and a solicitation the whole mass of nameless and undifferentiated citizens this vast concourse of unknown souls was a token both of the citys energy and of its meaninglessness it was also an emblem of the endless forgetfulness involved in urban living the children of the poor while still very young often go out into the streets merge with the crowd and in the end fail to return to their parents they achieved in other words the final destiny of city dwellersto become part of the crowd there is a short story by edgar allan poe set in london in the s entitled the man of the crowd the narrator is to be found in a coffee house beside one of the principal thoroughfares studying the nature and composition of the two dense and continuous populations passing the door many had a satisfied businesslike demeanour their brows were knit and their eyes rolled quickly when pushed against by fellowwayfarers they evinced no impatience but there also emerged a numerous class who were restless in their movements had flushed faces and talked and gesticulated to themselves if jostled they bowed profusely to the jostlers and appeared overwhelmed with confusion here then are two types of the london crowd there are the satisfied travellers in the stream of life and time and the awkward or confused who cannot join its steady progress they apologise for their confusion but only by talking to themselves can they manage any communication the narrator notices junior clerks wearing the fashions of last year and upper clerks or steady old fellows he looks upon pickpockets dandies pedlars gamblers feeble and ghastly invalids upon whom death had placed a sure hand modest young girls ragged artisans exhausted labourers piemen porters sweeps drunkards innumerable and indescribablesome in shreds and patches reeling inarticulate the london crowd of the midnineteenth century is revealed here all full of noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear and gave an aching sensation to the eye then the narrator is arrested by one countenance that of an old man which displays caution and malice triumph and avarice merriment and extreme despair he resolves to learn more about him and through the night he follows him in streets filled with people the old mans pace is quick and restless but in deserted thoroughfares he shows signs of uneasiness and vacillation he runs down abandoned streets until he finds a crowd leaving the theatrehere moving among them the intense agony of his countenance abated he joins a party of gindrinkers jostling outside the entrance to a public house and with a half shriek of joy stalked backward and forward without apparent object among the throng in the small hours of the night he walks to an area of poverty and crime where the abandoned of london are reeling to and fro then at daybreak he returns with a mad energy to a principal thoroughfare where he walked to and fro and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of the street finally the narrator understands who or what he has been following it is the embodiment of the crowd the nothing which feeds off the turbulent life of the streets the old man with a face expressive of vast mental power of coolness of malice is the spirit of london others came to the city precisely to experience this new and strange life of the crowd whenever i want to get an idea for painting or writing i always throw myself among the thickest crowds such as earls court or shepherds bush one nineteenthcentury japanese artist wrote let the crowds push me to and froi call it a human bath and mendelssohn could not disguise his delight at being plunged in a vortex where among the endless stream of people he could view shops with signs as huge as a man and stage coaches piled up with people and a row of vehicles left behind by pedestrians look at that horse rearing in front of a house where his rider has acquaintances and those men used for carrying advertisements look at the negroes and those stout john bulls with their slender beautiful daughters hanging on their arms a description of londoners in quoted in london bodies may also be apposite the appearance of the people in the streets of london john hogg wrote is one of the first things that attracts the notice of strangers the native inhabitants are somewhat under middle size but their limbs and features are generally well formed they are of spare habit but rather muscular they are characterised by firmness of carriage and an erect independent air they move with a measured step and generally at a very brisk pace the features are generally very strongly marked and pointed the eye in particular presents an openness and fullness that is remarkable the toutensemble of the countenance bears an air of keenness animation and intelligence that distinguish the londoner from his country neighbour the crowd of the nineteenth century was also aware of itself as a new form of human congregation that great representative of victorian feeling wp frith endlessly depicted crowds in paintings which themselves attracted endless crowds the london theatres were filled with melodramas in which the transient crowd was the characteristic setting for individual stories of pathos and violence there is an account by george gissing of the continuous movement of millions on jubilee day along the main thoroughfares of mid london where traffic was now suspended between the houses moved a double current of humanity a thud of footfalls numberless and the low unvarying sound that suggested some huge beast purring to itself in stupid contentment so the crowd becomes a beast contented and obedient wandering through the city which has created it but then its movements may become suddenly alarming these big crossings are like whirlpools you might go round and round and never get anywhere it is easy to see how perilous such a crowd might be the crowd aware of its identity sends signals to itself during a bad reverse for british troops during the crimean war we all stood about the streetsregardless of all appearances reading the telegrams in the newspaper with breathless anxiety there was a perfect sea of newspapers and curious faces behind intense gravity prevailed people walked along speaking in whispers and muttering the citizens of london then become one body with a corporate feeling of dismay the crowd is alive and alert responding in unison the cry of mafeking is relieved on may at nine thirty in the evening had an equally instantaneous effect upon this corporate body instantly the cry was taken up on the omnibuses and the people came clambering down in hot haste to hear the news repeated over and over again others rushed off into the byways carrying the tidings further and further away and all the time the streets became thicker with people cheering shouting and singing this mass excitement is almost as disturbing as the intense gravity of the crowd recorded four months earlier both show symptoms of that excess and overreaction close to hysteria by which city life is characterised there is something childish about the mob in action as if it had been brutalised or infantilised by the condition of living in the city in the fourteenth century the london mob greeted one supposed enemy with a savage yell and five centuries later at a chartist meeting in coldbath fields a most fearful shout burst from the lips of the crowd it is the same terrifying and implacable voice in the crowds during the burdett riots stopped all vehicles and compelled the occupants to signify their adherence to the cause in the same period a mob around a pillory resembled beasts dipped in a stagnant pool the vast and tumultuous crowds which gathered to watch the battle of sidney street in provoked similar reactions when a reporter for the news chronicle noted that the voices of these many thousands came up to me in great murderous gusts like the roar of wild beasts in a jungle yet the city itself is curiously unmoved by its crowds one of the reasons for civic peace in london as opposed to other capitals lies directly in its size its very scale determines its quietness it is at once too large and too complex to react to any local outbreaks of passionate feeling and in the twentieth century the most marked characteristic of riots and demonstrations was their failure to make any real impression upon the stonyhearted and unyielding city the disappointment of the chartist uprising in preceded by a large meeting on kennington common anticipated the inability in of oswald mosley to proceed down cable street with thousands of fascist sympathisers it was as if the city itself rebuked them and held them back the poll tax riots of the late s around whitehall and trafalgar square were another instance of a violent local disturbance which did not affect the relative composure of the rest of the city no movement could sweep through the entire capital and no mob could ever control it the city is so large too that it renders the average citizen powerless in its presence in the early decades of the twentieth century there was something curiously compliant and complacent not to say conservative about the cockneys unlike the parisians they did not want to fight the conditions of the city and were happy to live with them unchanged that happy equilibrium could not last one unwelcome novelty of the latter half of the twentieth century for example was the race riot among the most notable being those of notting hill in and of brixton in the notting hill riots began with individual harassment of black men by gangs of white youths but an incident on august provoked a fullscale riot tom vague in the aptly named london psychogeography describes a crowd of a thousand white men and some women tooled up with razors knives bricks and bottles in the following week a large mob proceeded down notting dale and beat up any west indian they could find but the worst rioting took place on monday september in the central area of notting hill gate mobs congregated in colville road powis square and portobello road before going on a smashing rampage chanting kill the niggers women hang out of windows shouting go on boys get yourselves some blacks one observer noted that notting hill had become a lookingglass world for all the most mundane objects which everyone takes for granted had suddenly assumed the most profound importance milk bottles were turned into missiles dustbin lids into primitive shields so an area of london becomes profoundly charged with the emotions of its inhabitants everything is irradiated and transformed by their hatred the accoutrements of a civilised city had suddenly been transformed into primitive weapons a youth leader remarked that those sort of boys take up any activity to break the boredom and in the twentieth century boredom had to be considered a component of any crowd behaviour the sheer daily tedium of living in impoverished and unprepossessing surroundings is enough to break the spirit of many londoners who feel themselves trapped in the midst of the city without redress or relief it creates not apathy but active tedium thus the violence starts on that monday evening the west indians collected together in blenheim crescent with an armoury of weapons including milk bottles petrol and sand for molotov cocktails the white mob entered the area with shouts of lets burn the niggers out and were greeted by homemade bombs the police arrived in force just before things could develop into outandout race war some rioters were arrested the others dispersed then by curious chance the great heat of these august days was swept away by a thunderstorm the rain falling among the debris of broken bottles and wooden clubs at their trial in september certain white rioters were told by your conduct you have put the clock back years but this would only take them back to they had in fact behaved like their medieval predecessors who swarmed upon supposed enemies or aliens with often fatal results in the spring of the young black londoners of brixton enraged by the perceived prejudice and oppression of the local police erupted in streetrioting for the first time petrol bombs were used in attacks upon the police together with the conventional deployment of bottles and bricks while a general wave of burning and looting left twentyeight buildings damaged or destroyed the depth and diversity of the disturbances suggest that they had a cause more fundamental than those of police oppression however and we may find it in the propensity among certain londoners for riot and disorder it then becomes a way of fighting structural oppression whereby the very texture and appearance of the streets are oppressive and oppressing poverty and unemployment have also been cited as the causes of sporadic violence like that in brixton certainly they confirm the character of the city as a prison confining or trapping all those who live within it what more inevitable consequence therefore than rage against its conditions and its custodians there have been other race riots there have been riots against the police there have been riots against the financial institutions in the city of london reports produced after the event characteristically refer to the collapse of law and order as well as the fragile basis of civic peace but in fact the curious and persistent feature of london life is that law and order have never collapsed and that civic peace has been maintained even in the face of grave disorder it is often wondered how in its diversity and bewildering complexity the city manages to function as a single and stable organism in a similar fashion the fabric of the city despite a variety of assaults has always been preserved its mobs have never yet dominated it chapter whats new the crowd lives upon news and upon rumour elizabeth i recalled that as a princess she had asked her governess what news was at london on being told that it was rumoured she was about to marry lord admiral seymour she replied it was but a london news so in the sixteenth century london news was considered to be fleeting and inaccurate but even so the object of much curiosity in king lear the poor rogues talk of court news who loses and who wins whos in whos out shakespeare also invoked the newes of hurly burly innovation in henry iv part one as well as the new newes at the new court in as you like it it was often observed that on entering a coffee house the first and immediate enquiry was what news what news the city is the centre of scandal slander and speculation the citizens are rumourmongers and backbiters in the sixteenth century there were handbills and pamphlets and broadsheets devoted to the more sensational events of the day and the streetsellers ensured that they were reported from door to door in a weekly pamphlet of news was published in london under the rubric of weekly newes from italy germanie hungary bohemia the palatinate france and the low countries etc its success was such that it provoked the publication of many other weekly pamphlets which went under the common title of corantos the news was treated with great suspicion however as if the reports of london were based on faction or fractiousness it was not an honest city and the editor of the perfect diurnal samuel peche was described in the s as being constant in nothing but wenching lying and drinking he was in other words a typical londoner there was one other aspect of london news which did not escape the attention of ben jonson in his the staple of newes he suggests that news ceases to be news when it is printed and distributed its essence is intelligence given in whisper or rumour the kind of report that in the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries could permeate all london within a very short period jonson had his own view then of the stationer or publisher of news who knows newes well can sort and ranke hem and for a need can make hem in the london gazette emerged as the most authoritative of the public prints it inserts no news but what is certain wrote one contemporary and often waits for the confirmation of it before it publishes it it was printed on single sheets each monday and thursday and was sold on the streets by vendors known as mercury women calling out londons gazette here in cornhill cheapside and the royal exchange macaulay described it as containing a royal proclamation two or three tory addresses notices of two or three promotions an account of a skirmish between the imperial troops and the jannissaries a description of a highwayman an announcement of a grand cockfight between two persons of honour and an advertisement offering a reward for a stray dog it may be considered certain that the highwayman the cockfight and the dog provoked the most attention it is some indication of the appetite for news in london that its first daily newspaper daily courant issued in predates by some seventyfive years the appearance of a daily in paris by the end of the eighteenth century there were newspapers journals and periodicals available in the city most of this astonishing number were published within the strand fleet street and those adjoining streets east of the present waterloo bridge and west of blackfriars fleet street is an example of the citys topographical imperative whereby the same activity takes place over hundreds of years in the same small area in this case too it was an activity that dominated the character and behaviour of those who took part in it so that it can be said that the very earth and stones of london created their own particular inhabitants in wynkyn de worde set up his printing press opposite shoe lane and in the same year richard pynson established himself as a publisher and printer a few yards down the road at the corner of fleet street and chancery lane he was succeeded as printer to henry viii by thomas berthelet who set up shop by the conduit again opposite shoe lane and in the early s william rastell began a printing firm in the churchyard of st brides william middleton printed at the george richard tottell at the hand and star john hodgets at the flower de luceall signs within the narrow and crowded thoroughfare this part of london wrote charles knight is a very temple of fame here rumours and gossip from all regions of the world come pouring in and from this echoing hall are reverberated back in strangely modified form echoes to all parts of europe so it is an echoic as well as ancient place a part of london from which that strange commodity known as news spreads in all directions in the eighteenth century news was disseminated largely by means of the daily and weekly journals provided by coffee houses and taverns what attracts enormously in these coffeehouses wrote saussure are the gazettes and other public papers all englishmen are great newsmongers workmen habitually begin the day by going to coffeerooms in order to read the latest news i have often seen shoe blacks and other persons of that class club together to purchase a farthing paper another eighteenthcentury account by count pecchio is of english working men in taverns for whom are published a number of sunday newspapers which contain an abridgement of all the intelligence anecdotes and observations which have appeared in the daily newspapers in the course of the week in the coffeehouses as soon as the newspaper arrived wrote another commentator there was the silence of the grave each person sat absorbed in his favourite sheet as if his whole life depended on the speed with which he could devour the news of the day here we have the image of the londoner as devourer of the news just as he was a devourer of food and drink it is one of the first intimations of the consumer one who can only experience the world by the act of ingestion or assimilation a city is perhaps by its nature an artificial arrangement so it creates artificial demands addison characterised as a definite london type the newsmonger that rose before day to read the postman and was avid for the dutch mails and inquisitive to know what passed in poland there were those who followed the latest case of rape or divorce in the sunday newspapers with the same avidity as their medieval counterparts purchased ballads o the newest and truest matter in london the search for fresh titillation or sensation is strong and enduring and in a city where the inhabitants are surrounded by a bewildering variety of impressions only the most recent can be entertained that is why in a city of fire the latest news is hot especially at the coffee house where it is smoking new our news should indeed be published in a very quick time commented the spectator because it is a commodity that will not keep cold it must be shouted out like fire to arrest the attention of the passersby london itself was like a newspaper as walter bagehot observed where everything is there and everything is disconnected a series of random impressions and events and spectacles which have no connection other than the context in which they were found in reading the newspaper the londoner was simply continuing with the normal perceptions of urban life he read the public prints and the city itself with the same idle curiosity as if the newspaper confirmed that vision of the world which london had already imparted to him the very form of the city was imprinted in the pages of the journalsa man called everett of fleet street sold his wife to one griffin of long lane for a threeshilling bowl of punch a boar lived off the rubbish of fleet ditch for five months a man found frozen and standing upright in the same ditch had been drunk and fallen into the mud bread and cheese were thrown to the populace from paddington steeple according to annual custom the wife of one richard haynes was delivered of a monster with nose and eyes like a lion a gravedigger was found smothered to death by his own exertions in an open grave a man stood up in the church of st sepulchre and shot at a choir of charity children a man named james boyes walked in front of the congregation in a chapel at long acre and proclaimed himself jehova jesus and so it goes on endlessly the news conveying the accidents and disasters of the city in columns of print like thoroughfares it was well known to the firemen of london as one of their greatest hazards that a crowd would spring up immediately around any great conflagration in order to witness the course of its destruction that is why in a period of growth and uproar the news itself became more strident the sale of early nineteenthcentury newspapers for example was a raucous affair bloody news horrible murder and extraordinary gazette were bellowed out with stentorian lungs accompanied by a loud blast of a long tin horn by porters and costermongers who kept editions of the papers under their hatbands the advent of the steamprinting press also allowed the newspapers to imitate the resistless force of london with all its energy and expansiveness two and a half thousand copies of the times could be printed every hour and the whole process came to the attention of charles babbage the inventor of the prototype computer who remarked that the great rollers of the steam press devoured sheets of white paper with unsated appetite charles knight noted that the courts around fleet street are bustling and vivacious with the production of more news to ever larger readershipsthe fingers of the compositors cease not the clash and clang of the steam press knows no intermission sales of newspapers amounted in to sixteen million copies thirty years later it had increased to thirty million and the figures continued to rise ford madox ford in the soul of london published in the first years of the twentieth century remarked that in the capital you must know the news in order to be a fit companion for your fellow londoner connected thinking has become nearly impossible because it is nearly impossible to find any general idea that will connect into one train of thought so the consciousness of the londoner is composed of a thousand fragments ford recalled that as a child the sunday paper was shunned by all respectable newsagents and that he had to walk two miles to pick up an observer from a dirty obscure and hidden little place but sunday sales soon became as large as if not larger than daily sales the hegemony of news in london was maintained and increased throughout the century as new techniques of printing and lithography were introduced perhaps the most significant transition however took place in when news international moved its production of the sun and the times to wapping this sudden and clandestine operation destroyed the restrictive spanish practices of london printers while the employment of new technology facilitated the expansion of other newspaper organisations which moved from fleet street to sites south of the river and to docklands itself the echoic force of fleet street has gone for ever but london news is still paramount as one twentiethcentury social observer lord dahrendorf puts it britain is run from london in virtually all respects to the history of rumour and of news must be added that of craze and of cheats again mediated by the collective agency of the crowd the popularity of fashions and delusions and false prophecies has always been most intense in the capital the gullibility of the citizens is perpetual the various bubbles of the eighteenth century encompassed the south sea financial disaster as well as a fashion for italian music how ill a taste for wit and sense prevails in the world swift wrote which politicks and southsea and party and operas and masquerades have introduced when mary tofts was believed to have given birth to a succession of rabbits in the autumn of every creature is in town both men and women have been to see and feel her all the eminent physicians surgeons and manmidwives in london are there day and night to watch her next production the seventeenthand nineteenthcentury craze for tulips in the west end was rivalled only by that for the aspidistra in the east end of the early twentieth century in the early part of that century too there was a fashion for china cats and forthwith no home was complete without a cat a living cat caught the news in it was the cat that licked a stamp at charing cross post office which then attracted crowds wanting it to perform the same feat over and over again the cat became a stunt which in the words of one journalistic practitioner represented the creation of the temporary important a captured elephant called jumbo was responsible for songs stories and a range of sweets known as jumbos chains before fading out of public memory yet all the fashions of london are transitory chateaubriand noticed this in when he remarked upon the fashions in words the affectations of language and pronunciation changing as they do in almost every parliamentary session in high society in london he remarked how the vilification and celebration of napoleon bonaparte succeeded each other with extraordinary swiftness in london and concluded that all reputations are quickly made on the banks of the thames and as quickly lost a catch word in every ones mouth one winter wrote mrs cook in her highways and byways in london is quite forgotten by next summer horace walpole remarked on the same subject that ministers authors wits fools patriots whores scarce bear a second edition lord bolingbroke sarah malcolm and old marlborough are never mentioned but by elderly folk to their grandchildren who had never heard of them to be out of sight in london was to be forgotten in berlioz wrote that in london there were a great many whom the sight of novelties only makes more stupid they watch the trajectory of events and careers with the eye of a postilion at the side of the railway track reflecting on the passing of a locomotive and so the history of london is also the history of forgetting in the city there are so many strivings and impulses which can only momentarily be entertained news rumour and gossip collide so quickly that attention to any of them is swift but shortlived one craze or fashion follows another as the city talks endlessly to itself this transitoriness of urban affairs can be traced back to the medieval period certainly by the fourteenth century ga williams noted in medieval london nothing lasted long in london and forgetfulness itself can become a tradition on the first tuesday of june ever since a benefaction in the late eighteenth century a sermon is preached at the church of st martin within ludgate upon the theme that life is a bubble it is highly appropriate that london should celebrate its transience in a permanent fashion it is a city endlessly destroyed and endlessly restored vandalised and renewed acquiring its historical texture from the temporary aspirations of passing generations an enduring myth as well as a fleeting reality an arena of crowds and rumour and forgetfulness the natural history of london a cockney flowerseller dressed in the traditional accoutrements of her trade flowersellers congregated around eros in piccadilly circus and were last seen in the early years of the twentieth century they were generally poor and dishonest chapter give the lydy a flower it may come as a surprise to those who see nothing but narrow streets and acres of rooftops that according to the latest land cover map taken from the landsat satellite over a third of londons total land area is seminatural or mown grass tilled land and deciduous woodland it has always been so one of the first delineators of london wenceslaus hollar was surprised by the contiguity of city and country his london viewed from milford stairs view of lambeth from whitehall stairs and tothill fields all dated show a city encompassed within trees and meadows and rolling hills his river views also suggest the presence of open countryside just beyond the frame of the engraving in the first years of the eighteenth century pastures and open meadows began by bloomsbury square and queens square the buildings of lincolns inn leicester square and covent garden were surrounded by fields while acres of pasture and meadow still survived in the northern and eastern suburbs outside the walls wigmore row and henrietta street led directly into fields while brick lane stopped abruptly in meadows worlds end beside stepney green was a thoroughly rural spot while hyde park was essentially part of the open countryside pressing upon the western areas of the city camden town was well known for its rural lanes hedgeside roads and lovely fields where londoners sought quietude and fresh air wordsworth recalled the song of blackbirds and thrushes in the very heart of the city and de quincey found some consolation on moonlit nights in walking along oxford street and gazing up each street which pierces northwards through the heart of marylebone to the fields and woods from the early medieval period onward almshouses and taverns schools and hospitals had their own gardens and private orchards the citys first chronicler william fitzstephen noted that the citizens of london had large and beautiful gardens to their villas stow recorded that the grand houses along the strand had gardens for profit while within the city and its liberties there were many working gardeners who produced sufficient to furnish the town with garden ware in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries gardens occupied the area between cornhill and bishopsgate street while the minories goodmans fields spitalfields and most of east smithfield were comprised of open meadows gardens and open ground were to be found from cow cross to grays inn lane as well as between shoe lane and fetter lane milton born and educated in the very centre of the city always professed an affection and admiration for the garden houses of london his own houses in aldersgate street and petty france were fine examples of that construction and it is said that at petty france the poet planted a cottonwillow tree in the garden opening into the park today there are many secret gardens within the city itself those remnants of old churchyards resting among the burnished buildings of modern finance these city gardens sometimes comprising only a few square yards of grass or bush or tree are unique to the capital they have their origin in the medieval or saxon period but like the city itself they have survived many centuries of building and rebuilding seventythree of them still exist gardens of silence and easefulness they can be seen as territories where the past may lingeramong them st mary aldermary st mary outwich and st peters upon cornhillor perhaps their lesson can be adduced from the open bibles in the hands of sculpted monks in the church of st bartholomew in smithfield the page to which they attend as they congregate around the recumbent figure of rahere reveals the fiftyfirst chapter of isaiah for the lord shall comfort zion he will comfort all her waste places and he will make her wilderness like eden and her desert like the garden of the lord the image of the garden haunts the imaginations of many londoners among the first painted london gardens is chiswick from the river by jacob knyff this urban garden is small in scale and set among other houses it is dated between and a woman walks along a gravelled path while a gardener bends down towards the earth they might have appeared in the twentieth century albert camus wrote in the middle of that century i remember london as a city of gardens where the birds woke me in the morning in the western areas of london of the twentyfirst century almost every house either has its own garden or shares a community garden in northern areas such as islington and canonbury and in the southern suburbs gardens are an integral feature of the urban landscape in that sense perhaps a londoner needs a garden in order to maintain a sense of belonging in a city where speed and uniformity noise and bustle are characteristic and where many houses are produced to a standard design a garden may afford the only prospect of variety it is also a place for recreation contemplation and satisfaction the man known as the father of english botany william turner lived in crutched friars and was buried in pepyss church of st olaves hart street in it is not at all paradoxical that the first established botanist should be a londoner since the extensive fields and marshes beyond the walls were fertile ground turner followed the intellectual practice of his time in not giving locations for the british plants he records for the first timethis is noted in the indispensable natural history of the city by rs fitterbut it has been revealed that one of them the field pepperwort was found in a garden in coleman street another sixteenthcentury botanist thomas penny lived for twenty years in the parish of st andrew undershaft and collected many of his specimens in the area beside moorfields the tower ditch was also famed for its aquatic or waterloving plants such as flote grass and wild celery while a naturalist of holborn registered wild celery from the fields of holburne neere unto graies inn and vernal whitlowgrass from the brick wall in chauncerie lane belonging to the earl of southampton if the suburbs of the west were good huntingplaces for naturalists the unlikely areas of hoxton and shoreditch became known for their nursery gardens a native of hoxton in the late seventeenth century thomas fairchild introduced many new and curious plants and wrote a treatise on how best to order such evergreens fruit trees flowering shrubs flowers exotick plants etc as will be ornamental and thrive best in the london gardens he entitled his book the city gardener and by that name he was always afterwards known another native of hoxton who lived just outside bishopsgate george ricketts brought into the area trees such as the myrtle the lime and the cedar of lebanon but there were many other gardeners in this strangely fruitful area amid the mud and rubble of the northern suburbs where grew the buddleia the anemone and the striped phillyrea it has always been said that londoners love flowers the craze for window gardening in the s represented only the most prominent manifestation of the window boxes or window pots to be seen in almost all prints of the london streets from generation to generation but the most striking sign of the london passion for flowers comes with the london flowerseller scented violets were sold upon the streets while in early spring primroses were first cried to the cockney wrote blanchard jerrold in london a pilgrimage the wallflower is a revelation the tenweek stock a new season the carnation a dream of sweet arabia they are all part of a busy london trade which began in the s before that time the only visible london flowers or rather the only flowers on displaywere the myrtle the geranium and the hyacinth then as the taste for floral decoration extended particularly among middleclass londoners flowers like everything else in the city became a commercial proposition and many of the outlying suburbs began production and distribution on a large scale the entire northwestern corner of covent garden market was given over to the wholesale vendors of roses and geraniums and pinks and lilacs which were then sold on to shops and other dealers very quickly too flowers became the object of commercial speculation the fuchsia arrived in london in the early s for example and the traders prospered the interest in flowers spread ineluctably down to the humbler classes with hawkers at street corners selling a bunch of mixed flowers for a penny while in the market were sold basketloads of cabbage roses and carnations female vendors at the royal exchange or the inns of court hawked mossroses the violet girl was to be seen on every street and the travelling gardener sold wares which were notorious for their short lives the price of commerce in london is often death and the city became natures graveyard many millions of flowers were brought into london only to wither and expire the establishment of large extramural public cemeteries located in the suburbs in turn led to an enormous increase in the demand for flowers to place upon the newly laid tombs the trees of london may also become a token we may say ford madox ford has observed that london begins where tree trunks commence to be black that is why the plane tree is londons own because of its power to slough off its sooty bark it became a symbol of powerful renewal within the citys corrupted atmosphere there was a plane tree growing some forty feet high in the churchyard of st dunstans in the east but the oldest are those planted in berkeley square in curiously enough like many londoners themselves the london plane tree is a hybrid an example of successful intermarriage between the oriental plane introduced into london in and the western plane of it has remained the tree of central london it is the single most important reason why london has been apostrophised as a city of trees with solemn shapes and glooms romantic that gloom may also descend upon londons parks from hyde park in the west to victoria park in the east from battersea to st jamess from blackheath to hampstead heath no other city in the world seems to possess so many green and open spaces for those in love with the hardness and brilliancy of london they are an irrelevance but they call to othersto vagrants to office workers to children to all those who seek relief from life on the stones when the horsedrawn omnibuses going from notting hill gate to marble arch travelled beside hyde park hands on the upper deck would greedily snatch at a twig to take to the city to be met with the cries of nuthatch and reedwarbler cuckoo or nightingale this observation is taken from neville braybrooks london green matthew arnold suggested in lines written in kensington gardens that the birds sing sweetly in these trees across the girdling citys hum immediately setting up a contrast between the quiet presence of pine elm and chestnut amid the citys jar the paradox is that london contains this peace within itself that hyde park and kensington gardens are as much a part of the city as borough high street or brick lane the city moves slowly as well as quickly it provides a history of silence as well as of noise there were also once oases of the countryside to be found in clerkenwell and piccadilly smithfield and southwark here the trades included threshing and milking the names of the streets bear evidence of londons hitherto rural nature cornhill by obvious derivation is a token of a hill where corn was grown according to ekwalls street names of the city of london and seething lane is to be interpreted as where chaff was plentiful the chaff came from corn threshed and winnowed in the lane oat lane and milk street speak of the countryside cow lane was not a place where cows were kept but a lane along which cows were driven to or from pasture addle street off wood street and a few yards up from milk street is derived from old english adela or stinking urine and eddel or liquid manure so we derive from it lane full of cow dung the huggin lanes in cripplegate and queenhithe were both known as hoggenlane in early transcripts there were no fewer than three hog lanesin east smithfield norton folgate and portsoken chicken and chick lanes occur together with duck lane goose lane and honey lanethe latter indicating that bees were formerly kept in the street the name of blanch appleton a district of aldgate comes from appeltun old english for orchard the natural life of london deserves then to be celebrated there are photographs of horse chestnuts in watford and of cedars in highgate woodpigeons nesting by the bank of england and of haymaking in hyde park insects innumerable and other invertebrates have made their homes in the stones of london while various wild plants such as charlock and mayweed broad dock and sun spurge grow luxuriously in the natural habitat of the capital while the rook and the jackdaw have been slowly driven outside the range of the city the woodpigeon and the martin have moved in to take their place the canals intersecting london have preserved territory for aquatic birds as have large water reservoirs the development of sewage farms in the s recreated the conditions of the primeval thames marshes with such inadvertent skill that many thousands of migrating birds descend upon london each year there are more than two hundred different species and subspecies of birds in the london area ranging from the magpie to the greenfinch but perhaps the most ubiquitous is the pigeon it has been suggested that the swarms of feral pigeons are all descended from birds which escaped from dovecotes in the early medieval period they found a natural habitat in the crannies and ledges of buildings as did their ancestors the rockdoves amid the seagirt cliffs they nest in small colonies one observer has written usually high up and inaccessible above the streets of london as if the streets were indeed a sea a man fell from the belfry of st stephens walbrook in while in quest of a pigeons nest while the bishop of london complained in of malignant persons who threw stones at the pigeons resting in the city churches so pigeons were already a familiar presence even if they were not treated with the same indulgence as their more recent successors a modicum of kindness to these creatures seems to have been first shown in the late nineteenth century when they were fed oats rather than the now customary stale bread from the end of the nineteenth century woodpigeons also migrated into the city they were quickly urbanised increasing both in numbers and in tameness we have frequently seen them on the roofs of houses wrote the author of bird life in london in apparently as much at home as any dovecote pigeon those who look up today may notice their flylines in the sky from lincolns inn fields over kingsway and trafalgar square to battersea with other lines to victoria park and to kenwood the air of london is filled with such flylines and to trace the paths of the birds would be to envisage the city in an entirely different form then it would seem linked and unified by thousands of thoroughfares and small paths of energy each with its own history of use the sparrows move quickly in public places and they are now so much part of london that they have been adopted by the native population as the sparrer a friend was known to cockneys as a cocksparrer in tribute to a bird which is sweet and yet watchful blessed with a dusky plumage similar to that of the london dust a plucky little bird darting in and out of the citys endless uproar they are small birds which can lose body heat very quickly so they are perfectly adapted to the heat island of london they will live in any small cranny or cavity behind drain pipes or ventilation shafts or in public statues or holes in buildings in that sense they are perfectly suited to a london topography an ornithologist who described the sparrow as peculiarly attached to man said it never now breeds at any distance from an occupied building this sociability bred upon the fondness of the londoner for the sparrow as much as the sparrow for the londoner is manifest in many ways one naturalist wh hudson has described how any stranger in a green space or public garden will soon find that several sparrows are keeping him company watching his every movement and if he sit down on a chair or a bench several of them will come close to him and hop this way and that before him uttering a little plaintive note of interrogationhave you got nothing for us they have also been described as the urchins of the streets thievish selfassertive and pugnaciousa condition which again may merit the attention and admiration of native londoners remarkably attached to their surroundings they rarely create flylines across the city where they are born like other londoners they stay and so they become associated with and characterised by their surroundings the tower sparrows were notorious as feathered murderous ruffians who kept up continual warfare with the pigeons and starlings of the building even though they had shared quarters with them for many centuries in the autumn of a bolt of lightning left the ground covered with heaps of dead sparrows at mile end turnpike there is something pitiful and yet splendid about this mass slaughter as if again they represented the spirit of the city itself these little creatures embody sheer invincible fecundity according to em nicholson the author of birdwatching in london they may be massacred perpetually and raise no obstacle only they never diminish that is the salvation of the species so their incessant and indescribable noise when congregated in a roost is the sound of collective triumph all mad and very happy fluttering and darting in the boughs as if the trees themselves had come alive gulls are now perpetual visitors although they first arrived in london as late as they came to enjoy the warmth of the city during a severe winter and their entry soon excited the attention of londoners the citizens thronged upon the bridges and the embankments in order to watch them dive and tumble in london magistrates forbade anyone from shooting them and at that point for the first time the habit of feeding the gulls appeared clerks and labourers of the s would during the free hour for lunch go down to the bridges and offer them various foods theodore dreiser walked upon blackfriars bridge one sunday afternoon in and found a line of men feeding thousands of gulls with minnows which they purchased at a penny a box a sense of awe and kindliness combined would seem to characterise the native attitude yet their success in obtaining food from humans hands led to the continual reappearance of the gulls until they acquired the reputation of being the principal scavengers of the city supplanting the services of the raven so the activity of the city can change the habits as well as the habitat of birds there are some birds such as the robin and the chaffinch which are less approachable and trustful in the city than in the country other species such as the mallard grow increasingly shyer as they leave london there has been a severe diminution of the number of sparrows while blackbirds are more plentiful swans and ducks have also increased in number some species however have all but vanished the rooks of london are perhaps the most notable of the disappeared their rookeries destroyed by building work or by treefelling areas of london were continuously inhabited by rooks for many hundreds of years the burial ground of st dunstans in the east and the college garden of the ecclesiastical court in doctors commons the turrets of the tower of london and the gardens of grays inn were once such localities there was a rookery in the inner temple dating from at least mentioned by oliver goldsmith in rooks nested on bow church and on st olaves they were venerable london birds preferring to cluster around ancient churches and ancient buildings as if they were their local guardians yet in the words of the nineteenthcentury song now the old rooks have lost their places there was a grove in kensington gardens devoted to the rooks it contained some seven hundred trees forming a piece of wild nature a matter of delight and astonishment to those who walked among them and listened to the endless cawing that blotted out the citys noise but the trees were torn down in the rooks have never returned yet other birds haunt the city these are the caged birds the canaries and the budgerigars the larks and thrushes who sing out of their confinement in a manner reminiscent of londoners themselves in bleak house dickenss novel which is so much a symbolic restatement of london vision the caged birds belonging to miss flite are a central emblem of urban imprisonment the occupants of newgate were known as the nightingales of newgate or newgate birds in down and out in paris and london orwell noted that the inhabitants of dosshouses or low lodginghouses kept caged birds tiny faded things that had lived all their lives underground he recalled in particular one old irishman whistling to a blind bullfinch in a tiny cage suggesting that there is a strange affinity between the luckless in london and the incarcerated birds on the stone wall of the beauchamp tower in the tower of london was inscribed with a nail epitaph on a goldfinch where raleigh pind within a prisons gloom i cheerful sung nor murmurd at my doom but death more gentle than the laws decree hath paid my ransom from captivity beneath it are engraved the words buried june by a fellowprisoner in the tower of london the names of miss flites imprisoned birds were hope joy youth peace rest life dust ashes waste want ruin despair madness death cunning folly words wigs rags sheapskin plunder there was a trade in caged birds of course with streetmarkets in st giles and spitalfields devoted to selling them most in demand was the goldfinch with a regular supply of trapped and caught birds offered at sixpence to a shilling each their attraction lay in their longevity upwards of fifteen years and in the possibility of crossbreeding chaffinches and greenfinches were also popular although the latter bird was described by one street vendor to henry mayhew as only a middling singer freshly caught larks were sold at between sixpence and eightpence mayhew witnessed the restless throwing up of the head of the caged lark as if he were longing for a soar in the air yet he was trapped in a small and dirty cage in a nineteenthcentury slum the nightingale had also become a favourite of londons bird dealers by the midnineteenth century but again according to mayhew shows symptoms of great uneasiness dashing himself against the wires of his cage or aviary and sometimes dying in a few days where there are birds there are cats they were ubiquitous throughout london at least as early as the thirteenth century and cateaton street was named in their honour now called gresham street it was in the thirteenth century known variously as cattestrate and cattestrete and in the sixteenth as catlen strete or catteten cats were considered to be the bearers of good luck as the fourteenthcentury legend of richard whittington and his cat attests so there is every reason to believe that they were treated as welcome and perhaps even useful pets but the london cat is also associated with strange superstitions there is evidence of ritual cat sacrifice where the unfortunate animal has been walled in an alcove and often preserved in mummified form a significant example was discovered in the autumn of behind a cornice in the tower of st michael paternoster royal which is the church in which richard whittington was buried in thus the continuance of a london legend was deemed worthy of a sacrifice in the rebuilt wren church of no doubt the dead beast was once one of that army of animals known collectively as the city cats the night of the capital was their domain where they sat upon old walls or slunk down dilapidated alleys they were the guardians of london patrolling streets and territories down which their distant ancestors once trod on quiet paws there were other cat streets in the metropolis most notably in the area of clerkenwell green and the obelisk in st georges fields as well as the lanes and alleys behind drury lane here according to charles dickens the cats took on all the characteristics of the people among whom they lived they leave their young families to stagger about the gutters unassisted while they frouzily quarrel and swear and scratch and spit at streetcorners it is sometimes observed that pets come to resemble their owners but it is also possible that a peculiarly london type of animal is produced by urban conditions by the close of the nineteenth century it was estimated that there were some threequarters of a million cats in london and they were of course variously treated in late nineteenthcentury whitechapel an ancient prostitutea frowzy debauched drunkenlooking creature as described by charles boothdistributed meat from a basket to every passing stray kindness of this nature seems to have emerged in the late nineteenth century one old resident remarked to booth the day was when no cat could appear in the streets of bethnal green without being hunted or maltreated now such conduct is rare if there were ever to be written a history of moral emotions it could do worse than study londoners treatment of animals dogs appear in almost every depiction of a london streetscene prancing on the road and mingling joyfully with horses and pedestrians alike there have been dogs at every stage of the citys history accompanying families in their walks along the fields barking at passing processions eager and fierce during riots growling at and fighting each other in obscure disputes over london territory in the twelfth century a royal edict declared that if a greedy ravening dog shall bite a royal beast then its owner forfeited his life so we may imagine the inhabitants of early medieval london nervously taking out their dogs for sport or pastime or hunting in any of the fields and meadows beyond the walls of the city yet the dogs which were taken to these areas had to be expeditated their claws were cut down to the balls of their feet to stop them from running after deer a proclamation was made in that dogs shall not wander in the city at large yet in the same order a distinction was made between wild or wandering dogs and household dogs so the concept of the pet existed in medieval london the most prized of london dogs was the mastiff many were sent as gifts to prominent persons abroad and a german traveller of the sixteenth century noted that some of those dogs are so large and heavy that if they have to be transported long distances they are provided with shoes so that they do not wear out their feet they were also used as guard dogs and in the records of london bridge there are payments made in compensation to those who had been bitten or hurt by the mastiff hounds the major problem in the city however has always been that of strays a notice at the newly built st katherine docks by the tower of london dated september warned that the gate keepers will prevent the admission of dogs unless the owners shall have them fastened by a cord or handkerchief the principal complaint against the animals was that they wreaked considerable injury upon goods but the age of commerce was also the age of philanthropy in the midnineteenth century a home for lost and starving dogs was established in london this is the first instance of canine welfare in the city when it first opened there was a disposition to laugh aleph wrote in but subscribers were found and the asylum flourishes removed to battersea in after complaints in the neighbourhood about the noise it flourishes still as the battersea dogs home the flea is as ancient as the dog but its part in the natural history of london is shrouded in obscurity the bed bug was first noticed publicly in while the cockroach was reported by we may infer however that lice and fleas of every kind have infested london from the beginning of its recorded history to such an extent that its condition has often been taken to resemble them london according to verlaine was a flat black bug if animals in london were not used for labour or for food they were characteristically employed for the purposes of entertainment ever since the first lions were placed in the tower of london in the thirteenth century to be joined later by a polar bear and an elephant animals have provided a spectacle for the restless and voracious crowd the first performing elephant in the london streets was recorded by robert hooke in londoners could see the animals at exeter change a building of three floors at the corner of wellington street and the strand it was known in the s as pidcocks exhibition of wild beasts the animals were kept on the upper floors in a small den and cages in rooms of various size the walls painted with exotic scenery in order to favour the illusion the menagerie went through the hands of three separate owners and an engraving of shows the old house jutting above the strand with pictures of elephants tigers and monkeys daubed upon its front between two grand pillars of corinthian design its popularity was very great largely because apart from the tower zoo it was the only menagerie of exotic species in london the less dangerous animals were on occasions led through the streets as a living advertisement wordsworth mentions a dromedary and monkeys and jt smith in his book for a rainy day writes of an elephant being led by its keeper between ropes along the narrow part of the strand on february this elephant named chunee could stand his restraint no longer and in violent anger was about to burst out of his cage a firing squad of soldiers from neighbouring somerset house could not dispatch him and a cannon was deployed to no effect eventually his keeper killed him with a spear and he expired with bullets found inside his body then the commercial spirit of london pursued him after his death his carcass was on display to the crowds for some days until it became noisome at which point it was sold off as pounds of meat the skeleton was displayed thereafter until it became part of the hunterian museum of the royal college of surgeons chunee was finally obliterated by a bomb in the second world war from his promenade along the strand in to his destruction by fire in his story has an authentic london flavour the spirit of the city may also explain the passion for performing animals and circuses in the streets of the capital rats danced on ropes and cats played dulcimers performing bears were ubiquitous from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries while performing monkeys and horses were part of the standard repertoire in rings and arenas in the s daniel wildman specialised in riding upon a horse with a swarm of bees covering his face like a mask half a century later the zoological society was given a few acres of land in regents park for the erection of various pits and cages in a zoological garden which was opened to the public two years later in and soon became a principal attraction of london there are many prints showing the citizens enjoying the antics of the imprisoned creatures in fact serious scientific research was soon overtaken by the demands of entertainment it is the very place for quiet easy talk in the open air blanchard jerrold wrote in with the animals to point the conversation will pass all london in review in the course of the season a shop by the bear pit was opened for the sale of cakes fruits nuts and other articles which the visitor may be disposed to give to the different animals and a long stick was provided for feeding buns to the bears themselves many visitors had their favourites some preferring the monkey to the lynx or the hippopotamus to the wombat and would come back each week to mark their condition but together with pleasurable sympathy there was always some anxiety that these creatures might break out of their imprisonment and wreak havoc among their captors that is why both dickens and thackeray joined by interest in public hangings were also fascinated by the snakes held in confinement curiously enough both of them depicted the same scene at feeding time this is part of thackerays account an immense boa constrictor swallowing a live rabbitswallowing a live rabbit sir and looking as if he would have swallowed one of my little children afterwards so the zoo takes on symbolic importance in the life of a violent and dangerous city here is violence tamed and danger averted in the green surroundings of the park here sits the lion which in the words of a poem by stevie smith is weeping tears of ruby rage it would be the merest commonplace to note that the citizens all dressed alike and walking through the zoo with well proportioned steps are themselves imprisoned in the city it was a trite comment even in the nineteenth century when gustave doré depicted the londoners by the monkey cage or in the parrots walk as equivalent to the animalsanimals which in turn seem to be observing them yet there is a resonance between the zoo and the city in terms of noise and in terms of madness the confused or shrill sound of the crowd was often compared with the sound of animals while the deranged at bedlam were in said by the quarterly review to resemble the fiercer carnivores at the zoological gardens the comparison is obvious enough the mad were kept in cages where they were visited by curious observers for the sake of entertainment said to sound like ravens screechowls bulls and bears the deranged were as ravenous and unsatiable as wolves or as drenched by compulsion as horses the deranged londoner in other words is an animal this definition spills over into descriptions of the crowd or mob as a beast the city itself becomes a vast zoo in which all of the cages have been unlocked chapter weather reports when boswell and johnson were tasting all the delights of rural life in greenwich park the following conversation ensued j is this not very fine b yes sir but not equal to fleet street j you are right sir robert herrick celebrated his return to london from devon in and declared that london my home is though by hard fate sent into a long and irksome banishment to live in the country is a form of melancholy exile if these are comforting for a wife a sixteenthcentury poem suggests defend defend me from a country life when a young west indian boy from notting hill of the s was given a weeks holiday in a wiltshire village he was asked how he had enjoyed the change i like it he replied but you cant play in the streets as you can in london i love walking in london mrs dalloway remarks in virginia woolfs novel really its better than walking in the country to the city dweller the country may not come as a revelation but as a restriction it is dreadful slow one nineteenthcentury cockney girl is reported as saying no swings no rahndabarts nor origins oranges no shops no nothinkjest a great bare field only the city is more beautiful than the country because it is rich in human history milton in his blindness remarked sadly that he was destined never more to look upon the sights of this fair city here he anticipated wordsworths famous reflection upon london from the vantage of westminster bridge in earth has not any thing to shew more fair the great poet of the nineteenthcentury natural world wonders upon the beauty of the morning as it irradiates ships towers domes theatres and temples never did sun more beautifully steep in his first splendor valley rock or hill it is a vivid urban testimony from one whose poetic vision is always associated with landscape the london suburbs too can be so beautiful vincent van gogh wrote in the s when the sun is setting red in the thin evening mist the beauty and symmetry of the city are manifest in another sphere also as exemplified by aristotles remark that a man that is by nature and not merely by fortune citiless is either low in the scale of humanity or above it which is to say that humankind belongs to the city as much as fish belong to water the city is the natural element for all those people who feel a compulsion to look upon the earth for contemporaries and companions if the city is not natural then let us say with henry james that it has recreated nature as the great city makes everything he wrote it makes its own system of weather and its own optical laws the city is hotter and dryer than other parts of the country because the pollution that it creates has the effect of trapping warmth within the streets and buildings while paradoxically at the same time obscuring the suns rays many dark buildings retain their heat and the vertical surfaces of the rising city are also better equipped to catch the lowlying sun the materials of which london is made also retain the circumambient warmth yet another explanation for the perceptible increase of heat in the capital may be found in the sheer congregation of people within so relatively small an area the body heat of the citizens pushes up the temperature so that on modern satellite maps the city is a pale island among the brown and the green two hundred and fifty years ago a seventeenthcentury observer made the same point the torrent of men women and children carts carriages and horses from the strand to the exchange is so strong that it is said that in winter there are two degrees of fahrenheit difference between this long line of street and that of the west end londons weather shows other variations much of westminster and the adjacent areas are built upon primeval swamps and in these quarters the exhalation of damp and mist seems more palpable than elsewhere cornhill built upon a summit seems crisper and drier in the sixteenth century the london climate impressed itself upon the scholar and alchemist giordano bruno as more temperate than anywhere else beyond and on this side of the equinoctial snow and heat being banished from the subjacent earth as well as the excessive heat of the sun which the perpetually green flowery ground witnesses and so enjoys a perpetual spring there is an alchemical or magical tendency within his vocabulary which points to the image of london as embodying a mild chemical flame but then there was the rain now in contiguous drops the flood comes down threatening with deluge this devoted town thus jonathan swift celebrates a city shower in the autumn of annual amounts of rainfall were calculated from and they demonstrate that londons showers and deluges declined in frequency towards the end of the eighteenth century only to rise again in the period from to even in however a french traveller noted the humidity of the city climate which required fires to be lit when it might be most easy to do without one he noted that as late as may all the apartments of the british museum had fires within them to preserve from damps and humidity the books the manuscripts the maps but there have also been great floods in london bridge was carried away by a tumultuous river and in the waters rose so high that boats could be rowed in the middle of westminster hall there too in a number of fish were left stranded after a flood the walbrook became a rushing torrent in the autumn of sweeping away a young man attempting to cross it and in the waters of the thames were so raised that the like had never been known in the memory of man in less than five hours the contemporary report goes the water rose twelve feet in vertical height and people were lost in the high roads even at the beginning of the twentieth century lambeth was so inundated by the waters of the thames that the houses of the area had to be visited by boats so the air of london has always been laden with vapours and rains londoners are also more accustomed to the cold than to the heat of summer days theres nothing left but london once its winter says a character in elizabeth bowens the heat of the day london becomes more purely itself in the cold harder and brighter and far more cruel in the winter of tramps froze to death birds dropped stiff from the sky bread hardened into rocks on market stalls thirty years later according to the annual register of february a poor boy who on tuesday night had crept into a dunghill at a stable yard in london in order to preserve himself from the cold was found dead by the ostler while a poor woman also with a child at her breast and another about three years old lying by her was found in rag fair the cold weather could be so intense that the thames itself froze regularly over the centuries some twentythree times between and because the old london bridge impeded the movement of the water until it became so sluggish that in the colder conditions it could not move in men passed over the thames between westminster and lambeth and in thys yere was the grete frost and ise and the most sharpest wenter that ever man sawe and it duryd fourteen wekes so that men might in dyvers places both goo and ryde over the temse in and the river was again frozen so that carts and horses and carriages could travel easily from one bank to the other as early as such sports as archery and such entertainments as dancing took place at a frost fair on the frozen river stow and holinshed record that on the eve of some plaied at the football as boldlie there as if it had been on the drie land diverse of the court being then at westminster shot dailie at pricks set upon the thames and the people both men and women went on the thames in greater numbers than in anie street of the city of london so the thames becomes a newly populous thoroughfare in the greatly expanding city the emphasis here is upon excitement and recreation but fortyfour years later in the general atmosphere of trade and commerce in london had exploited even the weather and many set up booths standing upon the ice as fruitsellers victuallers that sold beere and wine shoe makers and a barbers tent again in the thames before london was still planted with booths in formal streets all sorts of trades and shops furnished so that another city as it were was erected thereon the city spawns its own replica with all the characteristics of its own turbulent lifebull baiting horse and coach races puppet plays and interludes cookes tipling and other lewd places so that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph or carnival on the water the perilousness of london life too was enacted upon the river when within hours the ice had melted and swept the whole carnival away a century later in a sudden breaking up of the ice occasioned a fearful scene of damage and fatality the cold winters of london impeded the course of trade as well as that of the river in the winter of the wax and glue froze in their pots leaving tailors and shoemakers without the means of work silk deteriorated in freezing conditions so the silkmakers of spitalfields and elsewhere were also severely affected porters and cabmen street traders and labourers were unable to pursue their livelihoods the price of coal and the price of bread were dramatically increased the master of a school in st giles reported that of the seventy children in his school sixty had not eaten any food that day until he gave them some at noon in the severe winters of and there were bread riots and in the latter year mobs of the unemployed looted the shops of central london in the city there was a direct correlation then between weather and social unrest there is a connection too between outer and inner weather in the winter there is a vague smell of alcohol in the streets since everyone drinks heavily and incessantly to combat the aching and intrusive cold the drink excites and urges on the rabble to vicious practices this account written in describes the rain falling like liquid mud the yellow shadows of the fog which render breathing painful and difficult and the darkness at midday the description of a physical fact conveys an immense psychological charge vile weather at christmas according to henry james darkness solitude and sleet in midwinter within a murky babylon november was the worst month for suicides in london and during the blitz of the winter of londoners were more depressed by the weather than by the airraids the sky in london like its weather seems to have different orders of magnitude in some streets which are the canyons of the city it seems infinitely remote it becomes a distant prospect continually crowded by rooftops and towers yet in the large squares of islington where the houses are low and in the council cottage estates of the western districts the sky is a vast canopy encompassing all the adjacent areas in this low damp city as vs pritchett put it the sky means a great deal to us the quality of cloud cover which may or may not bring rain and the subtle gradations of blue and violet in the evening sky are sensible reminders of the unique atmospherics of london a panorama of london from southwark c is the first view that grants the city its sky the westward passage of grey and white clouds gives the painting enormous space and lightness and in this novel brightness the city itself seems to breathe it is no longer the tangle of dark buildings beneath a narrow strip of sky but an open city whose towers and spires beckon towards the empyrean these are the vertiginous skies when at sunset the west is all on fire reflected in the shifting mass of cloud on one january evening at approximately five oclock in the year the cloud cover was rosered striated with patches of dark blue sky yet the lights of the sky also reflect the lights of the city and the very brightness of the modern city obscures the brightness of the stars that is why the typical london sky seems low damp and tactile part of the city itself and its thousand stray lights and gleams it is the sky which inspired turner living in maiden lane and constable in his lodgings in hampstead according to gk chesterton all the forces which have produced the london sky have made something which all londoners know and which no one who has never seen london has ever seen the prevailing wind is westerly or southwesterly the south and west façades of st pauls cathedral show marked deterioration in the face of wind or rain and the stone itself is washed clean and exhibits a whitened and weatherbeaten aspect yet these winds kept the western areas of the city relatively free of the fog or smog which settled over the central and eastern part indeed an eastern wind was a token of harm since all the smoke and stench of the industries situated in the east end filtered over the rest of the capital london was and is a very windy city by the eleventh century there were seven windmills erected in stepney while the earliest maps show windmills in moorfields and finsbury fields there was a windmill in the strand and one by leather lane there was one in the whitechapel road and one beside rathbone place great windmill street is still at the top of the haymarket and there were many windmills along the south side of the river in waterloo bermondsey battersea and the old kent road in february the wind was so high that in deptford it drove a windmill with such velocity that it could not be stopped and took fire and was entirely consumed besides a large quantity of flour john evelyn recorded that the town of bowe had continual winds which mitigated the effects of atmospheric pollution and charles dickens wondered why metropolitan gales always blew so hard at deptford and peckham in addition i have read of more chimney stacks and housecopings coming down with terrific smashes at walworth yet in a city established upon extremes there will also be an extremity of weather in six hundred houses and a score of churches were overthrown by a mighty wind the spectacle of bow church rafters impaled twenty feet deep within the mud and stone of cheapside inevitably led to demands for public penance and humiliation to avert the further wrath of god but the pious citizens of london were not able to turn away the further calamities of their history in there came a grete wynd that dyd a moch harme in many placys it tore off the lead roof of the grey friars and it blew almost dovne the ton side of the old change knocking down so many grete long trees that nether horss ne cart myght pass thorow the streete in a terrible storm of rain and hail with a very great thunder and lightning knocked down the wall of the churchyard of st andrew and exposed many coffins in the crash it says something about the attitude of londoners to death that thereupon the ruder sort lifted up the lids of the coffins to see the posture of the dead corps lying therein during this storm a strange mist emerged above the turbulent waters of the thames in a round circle of a goodbigness above the waters which eventually ascended higher and higher till it quite vanished away there was immediately talk of conjuring and black magic pepys described the great storm of january the wind being very furious whole chimneys nay whole houses in two or three places blowed down in november a storm of nine hours descended upon the city all the ships in the river were driven ashore and the barges smashed against the arches of london bridge the towers and spires of certain london churches fell to the ground and in many areas whole houses were lifted up before falling upon the earth the lead on the roofs of the highest building was rolled up like paper and more than twenty nightwalkers were killed by falling chimneys or tiles daniel defoe published an account of the late dreadful tempest in which he revealed that the shriek and frenzy of the wind were such that nobody durst quit their tottering habitations for it was worst without and many thought the end of the world was nigh over the next sixty years london was ravaged by several hurricanes the last being in when the copper covering of the new stones buildings lincolns inn was blown off in one sheet and hung over the front like a large carpet or mainsail on the night of october londons hurricane hit the capital it had been preceded by two years of unnaturally cold and windy weather in january fifteen inches of snow fell on the higher parts of london the chimes of big ben stopped and the river thames iced over from runnymede to sunbury in march of that year sands from the sahara fell with the rain upon morden then in that october the great wind visited the city the balconies of highrise flats collapsed walls were ripped down roofs stripped of their tiles market stalls were thrown through the air and thousands of trees were destroyed by the effects of the gales extraordinary climatic change is not at all unusual in london if the city can attract plague and fire then it also can attract tempest and earthquake there were three earthquakes during the reign of elizabeth i the first of which did not exceed a minute but the shock of which was so severe that many churches and houses were much shattered and several people killed one of the incidental features of this catastrophe was the fact that the great bells of the city were so shaken that they began to ring of their own accordthe westminster clock bell for example spoke of itself against the hammer with shakingas if the city itself were heralding its own disaster there also seems to have been some method in the mayhem the two further earthquakes of queen elizabeths reign both occurred on christmas eve four years apart the next most notable tremor occurred in february when two shocks were felt some hours apart the second being preceded by a strong but confused lightning darting its flashes in quick succession people flocked into the street in panic that their houses were about to fall upon them and the most powerful forces were visible and audible in the west end near st jamess park here it seemed to move in a south and north direction with a quick return towards the centre and was accompanied by a loud noise of a rushing wind so london has been visited by elemental forces invading its central areas the last record of such a visitation at least notable in its effects occurred in the spring of and then there came the fog chapter a foggy day tacitus mentions it in his account of caesars invasion so its spectral presence has haunted london from earliest times the fog was originally generated by natural means but soon enough the city was taking over from nature and creating its own atmosphere as early as eleanor of provence wife of henry iii complained about the smoke and pollution of london and in the sixteenth century elizabeth i was reported to have been herself greatly grieved and annoyed with the taste and smoke of seacoals by the sixteenth century a pall of smoke hung over the capital and the interiors of the more affluent london houses were dark with soot one of the contributors to holinsheds chronicles noted that the number of domestic chimneys had greatly increased throughout the latter decades of the sixteenth century and that interior smoke was considered a preventative against wood decay and a preservative of health it is as if the city enjoyed its own darkness at the beginning of the seventeenth century numerous and various complaints issued from the polluted city in hugh platt wrote a ballad a fire of coalballes in which he claimed that the fumes of sea coal damaged plants and buildings seventeen years later james i was moved with compassion for the decayed fabric of st pauls cathedral near approaching ruin by the corroding quality of coalsmoke to which it had long been subjected there was also the prevalent fear of fire there can be no doubt that the sight and smell of smoke aroused instinctive fears of flame in the thoroughfares of the city john evelyn in his treatise entitled fumifigium or the inconvenience of the air and the smoak of london lamented the condition of a city covered by a hellish and dismal cloud of seacoal here the invocation of hell is significant as one of the first manifestations of that connection between the city and the lower depths the dark and dismal cloak of london comes from few funnels and issues belonging to only brewers diers limeburners salt and sopeboylers and some other private trades one of whose spiracles alone does manifestly infect the aer more than all the chimnies of london put together besides here rising with the sulphurous smoke is the spectre of infection the city is literally a deadly place it is the same image conjured by a contemporary character of england which described london as enveloped in such a cloud of seacoal as if there be a resemblance of hell upon earth it is in this volcano in a foggy day this pestilent smoak which corrodes the very yron and spoils all the movables leaving a soot on all things that it lights and so fatally seizing on the lungs of the inhabitants that cough and consumption spare no man it was in this period that in meteorological observations there emerged the incidence of great stinking fog as well as that consistent cover of smoke which has become known as the urban plume it might be said that the industrial city emerged from this terrible childbed despite written records of great fogs in previous eras it is commonly believed that nineteenthcentury london created the foggy darkness certainly victorian fog is the worlds most famous meteorological phenomenon it was everywhere in gothic drama and in private correspondence in scientific reports and in fiction such as bleak house i asked him whether there was a great fire anywhere for the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen oh dear no miss he said this is a london particular i had never heard of such a thing a fog miss said the young gentleman o indeed said i half a million coal fires mingling with the citys vapour partly arising from imperfect drainage produced this london particular rising approximately to feet above street level opinions varied concerning the colour of the fogs there was a black species simply darkness complete and intense at mid day bottlegreen a variety as yellow as peasoup which stopped all the traffic and seems to choke you a rich lurid brown like the light of some strange conflagration simply grey orangecoloured vapour a dark chocolatecoloured pall everyone seemed to notice changes in its density however when it was sometimes interfused with daylight or when wreaths of one colour would mingle with another the closer to the heart of the city the darker these shades would become until it was misty black in the dead centre in there were seven hundred extra deaths nineteen of them the result of pedestrians walking into the thames the docks or the canals the fogs sometimes came and went rapidly their smoke and gloom blown across the streets of the city by the prevailing winds but often they lingered for days with the sun briefly seen through the cold yellow mist the worst decade for fogs was the s the worst month was always november the fog was denser than ever wrote the author nathaniel hawthorne on december very black indeed more like a distillation of mud than anything else the ghost of mud the spiritualised medium of departed mud through which the departed citizens of london probably tread in the hades whither they are translated so heavy was the gloom that gas was lighted in all the shop windows and the little charcoal furnaces of the women and boys roasting chestnuts threw a ruddy misty glow around them again the condition of the city is likened to that of hell itself but with the additional association that somehow the citizens are privately enjoyingand indeed are rather proud oftheir hapless condition fog was called a london particular with some measure of satisfaction since it was a unique emanation from what was then the largest and most powerful city on the earth darwin wrote that there is a grandeur about its smoky fogs james russell lowell writing in the autumn of remarked that he was living within a yellow fogthe cabs are rimmed with a halo and the people in the street like fading frescoesbut at the same time it flatters ones selfesteem he was proud to survive such an extreme condition of the city in turn the fog itself conjured up images of immensity everything seems to be checked wrote a french journalist of the nineteenth century to slacken into a phantomlike motion that has all the vagueness of hallucination the sounds of the street are muffled the tops of the houses are lost hardly even guessed the openings of the streets swallow up like tunnels a crowd of foot passengers and carriages which seem thus to disappear for ever the people in this fog are innumerable a compact army these miserable little human creatures the struggle for life animates them they are all of one uniform blackness in the fog they go to their daily task they all use the same gestures so the fog renders the citizens indeterminate part of a vast process which they themselves can hardly understand one other aspect of this darkness severely affected the inhabitants of london every observer noticed that the gaslights were turned on throughout the day in order to afford some interior light and noticed too how the streetlamps seemed like points of flame in the swirling miasma but the ambience of the dark fog settled upon many streets which had no lighting at all thereby affording cover for theft violence and rape on an unprecedented scale in that sense the fog was indeed particular to london because it intensified and emphasised all the darker characteristics of the city darkness is also at the heart of the notion of this black vapour as an emanation of sickness if all smell is disease as the victorian social reformer edwin chadwick thought then the acrid smell of the london fog was a sure token of contamination and epidemic fear it is as if the contents of a million lungs were being disseminated through the streets the very texture and colour of the city carried all the marks of its fog the author of letters from albion written as early as noticed that above the level of the ground you see nothing but the naked brick fronts of the houses all blackened by the smoke of coal while an american traveller remarked on the uniform dinginess of london buildings heinrich heine was the author of one of the most evocative and instructive remarks upon the citythis overworked london defies the imagination and breaks the heart and he himself observed that the streets and buildings were a brown olivegreen colour on account of the damp and coal smoke so the fog had become part of the physical texture of the city this most unnatural of natural phenomena leaving its presence upon the stones perhaps in part the city defied the imagination in heines phrase because in that darkness which seems neither to belong to the day nor to the night the world itself was suspended in the fog it became a place of concealment and of secrets of whispers and fading footsteps it can be said that fog is the greatest character in nineteenthcentury fiction and the novelists looked upon fog as might people upon london bridge peering over the parapets into a nether sky of fog with fog all round them as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds when carlyle called the fog fluid ink he was rehearsing the endless possibilities of describing london through the medium of the fog as if only in the midst of this unnatural darkness could the true characteristics of the city be discerned in the narratives of sherlock holmes written by arthur conan doyle from to the city of crime and of unsolved mysteries is quintessentially the city of fog on one foggy morning in a study in scarlet a duncoloured veil hung over the housetops looking like a reflection of the mudcoloured streets beneath in the steamy vaporous air of a dense drizzly fog in the sign of four dr watson soon lost my bearings sherlock holmes was never at fault however and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous bystreets london becomes a labyrinth only if you soak up the atmosphere in the cliché of travellers and sightseers will you not become bewildered and lost the greatest novel of london fog is perhaps robert louis stevensons the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde in which the fable of changing identities and secret lives takes place within the medium of the citys shifting insubstantial mists in many respects the city itself is the changeling its appearance altering when the fog would be quite broken up and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths where good and evil live side by side and thrive together the strange destiny of dr jekyll does not seem quite so incongruous then for a moment the mist melts and the curtain lifts revealing a gin palace an eatinghouse a shop for the retail of penny numbers and two penny salads all this life continuing beneath the canopy of darkness like a low murmur of almost inaudible sound then once again the fog settled down again on that part as brown as umber and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings this also is the condition of living in londonto be cut off isolated a single mote in the swirl of fog and smoke to be alone among the confusion is perhaps the single most piercing emotion of any stranger in the city elizabeth barrett browning wrote of the great towns weltering fog as somehow erasing all the signs and tokens of the city blurring spires bridges streets and squares as if a sponge had wiped out london fear of this invisibility actively assisted the programme of building and decoration that marked the victorian city building news in discussed the fact that the smoky atmosphere has done its best to clothe our most costly buildings in a thin drapery of soot they soon become dark and sombre masses all play of light and shade is lost that is precisely why architects decided to clothe their buildings in bright red brick and shining terracotta so that they would remain visible the features of nineteenthcentury building which may seem vulgar or gaudy were attempts to stabilise the identity and legibility of the city of course there were some who extolled the virtues of the fog dickens despite his lugubrious descriptions once referred to it as londons ivy for charles lamb it was the medium through which his vision in every sense was conceived and perfected where some saw only the amounts of sulphate deposited in the bowels of the fog particularly in the city and the east end others saw the murky atmosphere as clothing the river and its adjacent areas with poetry as with a veil and the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky and the tall chimneys become campanile and the warehouses are palaces in the night this devoted invocation is from whistler the painter of mist and smoke at twilight and it contrasts sharply with a comment about the building of the embankment in the same period as his atmospheric works of art who would think of promenading along the channel of a great hazy aguegiving river in any case but whistlers opinions were shared by other artists who saw the fog as londons greatest attribute the late nineteenthcentury japanese artist yoshio markino noted that perhaps the real colours of some buildings in london might be rather crude but this crude colour is so fascinating in the mists for instance that house in front of my window is painted in black and yellow when i came here last summer i laughed at its ugly colour but now the winter fogs cover it and the harmony of its colour is most wonderful it is sometimes observed that the buildings of london look best in the rain as if they had been built and coloured especially for the sake of showers a case can be made then that even the private houses of londoners are designed to be pleasing in the fog when monet stayed in london between and he had come to paint the fogs then in london above all what i love is the fog it is the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth those massive regular blocks become grandiose within that mysterious cloak here he is repeating in more delicate tones a conversation which blanchard jerrold held with that gothic delineator of fog gustave doré i could tell my fellow traveller that he had at last seen one of these famous darknesses which in every strangers mind are the almost daily mantle of the wonderful and wonderworking babylon here the fog contributes to the citys splendour and awfulness it creates magnificence yet with the suggestion of babylon it represents some primeval and primitive force which has lingered over the centuries for monet the london fog became a token or revelation of mystery in his depictions of its subtle atmospheres and everchanging colours there is also a strong impression that the city is about to dissolve or be hidden for ever in that sense he is trying to capture the essential spirit of the place beyond particular epochs and phases his paintings of charing cross bridge for example give it the brooding presence of some elemental force it might be a great bridge constructed by the romans or a bridge built in the next millennium this is london at its most shadowy and powerful powerful precisely because of the shadows which it casts ancient shapes loom out of the foggy darkness or the dim violet light yet these shapes also change quickly in a sudden shaft of light or movement of colour this again is the mystery which monet presents this shrouded immensity is instinct with light it is prodigious in the early years of the twentieth century there was a marked diminution in the frequency and severity of foggy weather some attribute this change to the campaigns of the coal smoke abatement society and the various attempts to substitute gas for coal but the very expansion of the capital might paradoxically have lowered its levels of fog industries and people were now more widely dispersed and the intense heatladen centre of smoke and fog was no longer burning so brightly the whole phenomenon has been ably reported in an essay the mysterious disappearance of edwardian london fog by ht bernstein in which it is claimed that coalburning was not directly related to the incidence of fog some of the great london fogs appeared on sundays for example when no factory chimneys were in operation if fog was in part a meteorological phenomenon it exhibited local and specific characteristics it particularly affected parks and riversides for example as well as areas with low wind speed it might swallow up paddington where no one could see their way but leave kensington less than a mile away to its brightness it has been said that the last real fog was presented on or about december it was pure white in colour and the hansom cabmen were leading their horses lamps went before the crawling omnibuses and some guests went past one of the biggest london hotels without seeing it in fact throughout the s and s peasoupers descended without warning hv morton in his in search of london remembered one such fog which reduces visibility to a yard which turns every lamp into a downward v of haze and gives to every encounter a nightmare quality almost of terror here once more there is intimation of fog carrying fear into the heart of the city it is perhaps no wonder that when the easterly wind sent the clouds of yellow haze away from the city the berkshire farmers called it blight others less distant also suffered from early twentiethcentury fogs the stoll film studios at cricklewood had to close during the winter because according to colin sorensens london on film the fog got into the studio for about three months the element of intrusiveness or of invasion also emerges here many people recall how upon the opening of a front door draughts of smokeladen fog would eddy through a private house and curl up in corners the eternal smoke of london found other pathways not least through the vent holes of the underground system where arthur symons noticed how its breath rises in clouds and drifts voluminously over the gap of the abyss catching at times a ghastly colour from the lamplight sometimes one of the snakes seems to rise and sway out of the tangle a column of yellow blackness but perhaps the worst of all london fogs were the smogs of the early s when thousands died of asphyxiation and bronchial asthma in some of the theatres the fog was so thick that the actors could not be seen upon the stage on the afternoon of january there was almost total darkness people who experienced the phenomenon said it seemed as if the world was coming to an end a clean air act was passed in as a result of public disquiet but in the following year another smog caused death and injury then again in the winter of a lethal smog killed sixty people in three days there was nil visibility on the roads shipping at a standstill trains cancelled a newspaper report put the facts plainly the amount of smoke in the london air was times higher than normal for a winter day yesterday the amount of sulphur dioxide was times higher than normal six years later there followed a more extensive clean air act and this legislation marked the end of london fog in its ancient form electricity oil and gas had largely taken the place of coal while slum clearance and urban renewal had reduced the level of closepacked housing but pollution has by no means disappeared like london itself it has simply changed its form the city may now be in large part a smokeless zone but it is filled with carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons which together with toxic secondary pollutants such as aerosols can produce what is known as a photochemical smog high concentrations of lead in the london air and a general increase of sunshine in the cleaner air have in turn inspired more contamination there is a problem with ozone at ground level and the effects of temperature inversion mean that the emissions from traffic and power stations for example cannot be released into the upper atmosphere so they linger at the level of the streets the fog that tacitus described in the first century ad still hovers over london night and day a depiction by gustave doré of poor vagrants huddled on westminster bridge on a starry night in the s it was said that the number of such vagrants could fully populate an average city chapter let there be light the high death rate in london has been blamed in part upon the lack of natural light the prevalence of rickets for example has been noted in this connection it is revealed in werners london bodies that in st brides lower churchyard over per cent of childrens skeletons dating from the nineteenth century showed signs of that disorder while those who did not succumb spent their lives upon badly bowed limbs so there was a yearning for light or rather an instinctive need for light if it could not be found naturally then it must be artificially created to satisfy the appetite of the londoner as early as the fifteenth century lights were established by statutory decree in every house beside the main thoroughfare had to display a light at the christmas watch and ten years later the mayor ordered that the same dwellings bear lamps or lights in the dark evenings between october and february in the hours from dusk until nine oclock these lanterns were of transparent horn rather than of glass but medieval london remained in relative obscurity except perhaps for the light spread by those who carried torches to guide pedestrians or by servants who used the flare of flaming brands to accompany the passage of some great lord or cleric in the early years of the seventeenth century linkboys bearing lights also became a source of brightness the great change in the street lighting of the capital did not occur however until when a projector named edward heming obtained letters patent conveying to him for a term of years the exclusive right of lighting up london he stipulated that for a fee he would fit a light in front of every tenth door from six to twelve on nights without a moon hemings patent was not ultimately satisfactory however and nine years later the aldermanic authorities gave permission to the convex light company to illuminate the city the name of the company itself suggests the development from the horn lantern to more subtle and sophisticated means of lighting with lenses and reflectors light had become fashionable indeed in the first decades of the eighteenth century as part of the general improvements in the condition of london the illumination of the streets became of paramount importance it was still a matter of securitythe kensington road a notorious haunt of highwaymen was the first to introduce oillamps with glazed lights as early as in an act was passed permitting the city authorities to implement a special lighting rate or lamp rate so that all the streets could be properly illuminated each night as stephen inwood has suggested in a history of london this gave the city around hours of lighting a year compared to or before and from to suburban parishes also began to levy special rates for lighting so gradually and by degrees of illumination london at night became a different city in the early decades of the eighteenth century observers and strangers remarked upon its glare and upon its white ways by archenholz reported that as the english are prodigal of their money and attention in order to give everything that relates to the public an air of grandeur and magnificence we might naturally expect to find london well lighted and accordingly nothing can be more superb it seemed that as every year passed the nights of the city became steadily brighter in boswell noted the glare of shops and signs while in another observed that not a corner of this prodigious city is unlighted but this innumerable multitude of lamps affords only a small quantity of light compared to the shops it is entirely appropriate that in these two accounts of londons brightness the shops the centre of trade and commerce shine brightest of all yet if it is an attribute of london that it becomes continually brighter at first starting at a slow pace but then gradually increasing momentum until by the late twentieth century it had become almost overbrightthe brightness of one generation will also be the dimness of a succeeding one the light of eighteenthcentury london the glory of the world forty years later was dismissed as little more than a toy in his memoirs published in the middle of the nineteenth century john richardson declared that forty years ago the lighting of the streets was effected by what were called parish lamps the lamp consisted of a small tin vessel half filled with the worse train oil in this fluid fish blubber was a piece of cotton twist which formed the wick in those days therefore the lamplighter became a familiar figure in the streets of london there is a portrait of one in hogarths a rakes progress lighting a lamp at the corner of st jamess street and piccadilly his face has an oafish if not bestial cast and he is spilling oil on the wig of the rake beneath this must have been a familiar enough mishap upon the streets richardson has his own description of the lamplighters a set of greasy fellows redolent of greenland dock were employed to trim and light these lamps which they accomplished by the apparatus of a formidable pair of scissors a flaming flambeau of pitched rope and a rickety ladder to the annoyance and danger of all passersby the oil vessel and wick were enclosed in a case of semiopaque glass which obscured even the little light it encircled these lamps were rarely if ever cleaned and so by all accounts the great brightness of eighteenthcentury london seemed at least to later londoners to be an illusion the streets did not seem illlit to their inhabitants at the time however because the brightness of london exactly conformed to their sense of the social milieu the light is relative to the expectations and preoccupations of the city that is why the great change came at the beginning of the era of the imperial city when in oil gave way to gas it was first employed in beech street and whitecross street where now the barbican stands but a year later it was used to light up pall mall there is a cartoon by rowlandson dated and entitled a peep at the gas light in pall mall one gentleman points a cane towards the new lamp and explains that the smoke falling thro water is deprivd of substance and burns as you see while a less expert citizen protests aarh honey if this man bring fire thro water we shall soon have the thames burn down in the same print a quaker declares what is this to the inward light as if the progress of technology were itself a kind of profanity while a prostitute tells her client if this light is not put a stop towe must give up our business we may as well shut up shop to which he replies true my dear not a dark corner to be got for love or money in westminster bridge was the first to be illuminated by the new fuel the highly intellectual hester thrale declared in towards the end of her life that such a glare is cast by the gas lights i knew not where i was after sunset old father thames adorned by four beautiful bridges will hardly remember what a poor figure he made eighty years ago i suppose when gay folks went to vauxhall in barges an attendant barge carrying a capital band of music playing handels water musicas it has never been played since so the river quite changed by the gaslight became the object of surprise or bewildermenti knew not where i was even the music upon the water seemed changed there were many illustrations of streetlights in all their variety modelled in baroque and classical styles with additional representations of gasometers and elaborate retorts the old epoch of the lamplighter was mocked in the process but the less advantageous aspects of the new lighting were also depicted a series of cartoons depicting a london nuisance has one of a lamplighter on the top of his ladder spilling oil over an unfortunate pedestrian in the old style while another shows a gas explosion in a chemists shop that prospect of combustion was one of the reasons why the domestic use of gas was not fully in place until the s yet by there were four private companies vying for trade much of which along the two hundred miles of gas mains laid just beneath the surface of the streets was once more devoted to the lighting of the principal shops the shops of the eighteenth century with their narrow windows and panes of bulging glass were lit inside by tallow candles or blinking oillamps with the modern shops of the next century the encroaching darkness of twilight was suddenly the herald of such a light such as the sun never darts into the nooks and crannies of traffic broad streams of gas flash like meteors into every corner of the wealthcrammed mart the new gaslighting would not only banish vice and crime from the streets it would also materially increase the speed and volume of trade truly london light but it is really at night that london must be seen wrote flora tristan in her london journal of london magically lit by its millions of gas lights is resplendent its broad streets disappearing into the distance its shops where floods of light reveal the myriad sparkling colours of all the masterpieces conceived by human industry a similar enthusiasm is evinced in an account of the strand where the shops were all brightness and wonder and of another thoroughfare where the shops seem to be made entirely of glass you might be forgiven for thinking that the great new brightness was the brightness of burgeoning commerce yet there were other attitudes towards the new light for some it was harsh and unnatural the lurid emanation of an artificial city to other londoners however the gas was most glorious for the shadows which it cast it created a city of softness and mystery with sudden pools of light fringed by blackness and silence so in certain areas londons ancient presence stifled its new light the shadows and the mystery returned this may perhaps account for the speed with which london became accustomed to higher levels of brightness when they ceased to be dazzled by the illumination of gas the old presences of london began to reassert themselves the author of the little world of london noticed down one lane that the glass of the gaslamp has been wantonly pelted away to the last fragment the flame flickers in the nightbreeze and casts its fitful gleams upon every form of poverty and wretchedness and vice here huddled together as in a common asylum gas instead of being the incandescent banisher of vice and crime here compounds the misery of the dispossessed in a poem of the s by arthur symons there is a description of the dim wet pavement lit irregularly with shimmering streaks of gaslight faint and frayed where once again it is the flickering inconstant and insubstantial nature of the city light that is manifested it is as if the city has swallowed up the light or rather fundamentally changed its nature in the night paintings of late victorian london for example the dark shapes of the city beneath the moon are only momentarily illuminated by lines of gaslamps paradoxically that which had seemed most new and revolutionary in lighting soon became identified with all that was overburdened with age and history who has not in imagination seen the gaslamps in the fog it is the very permanence and longevity of london which transform even the most recent invention into an aspect of its ancient life the yellow gas in the old square lamps was replaced by green incandescent gases dancing like so many glowworms in their glass bottles but these in turn were replaced by a new force the first employment of electric light was upon the embankment in followed by the illumination of billingsgate and the holborn viaduct as well as two or three theatres since london was then the great centre of world power it is appropriate that the first power station in the world should be at holborn viaduct it was constructed by thomas edison in and less than ten years later according to that commercial imperative which is by now so familiar the first electric advertising signs were placed in piccadilly circus the city exploited this new brightness from the beginning and once more the golden tint of the electric light was apostrophised when the gold and silver lamps emerge from the twilight the shops shine bright anew there seems to be no escape from the conjunction of light and trade like other forms of light before it however electricity was said to render the city unreal and unfamiliar one londoner suggested that the novel light lent a corpselike quality to the skin while in the floodlit streets the crowd looks almost dangerous and garish this particular light was also more cruel and clinical than its predecessors those who became accustomed to electricity however soon looked back upon gas with the same nostalgic contempt as those living in gaslight regarded the old days of the oillamp arthur machen in the early s recollected that gaslit london was all glorious and glittering but that now i should find it sombre and gloomy an abode of shadows and dark places illlit with flickering and unsteady yellow flames the electricity moved down oxford street and kensington high street knightsbridge and notting hill it spread from piccadilly by means of overhead cable to regents park and the strand by there were seventy power stations operating within the metropolis turning it into a generator of energy and power the variety of lighting supplies at first had the effect of turning london into an unevenly lit city each of its twentyeight boroughs made their own arrangements with the suppliers of electricity which means that a car travelling at speed in the s might pass from one street bathed in a very high light intensity to one shrouded in comparative darkness but this had always been the case since the city of contrasts had relied upon contrasted light as arthur symons wrote in london a book of aspects in london we light casually capriciously everyone at his own will and so there are blinding shafts at one step and a pit of darkness at the next the many accidents in the s however created a demand for a level standard of illumination which in turn led to a standardisation of lampposts with columns feet high and feet apart it is one aspect of london life which even the most knowledgeable citizens scarcely notice and yet the uniformity of lighting in the major streets is perhaps the most significant aspect of the modern city in the autumn of certain public buildings were illuminated by floodlighting for the first time so great was the interest and excitement that the streets were filled with spectators it is as if london is always revealing itself anew nine years after the floodlighting however the night city was plunged into profound darkness during the blackout when in certain respects it reverted to medieval conditions in the streets themselves as reported in philip zieglers london at war it seemed sinister to have so many people shuffling around in the blackness familiar roads became impenetrable mysteries leaving londoners frightened and confused one recalled finding her destination but only after becoming damp with perspiration and quite exhausted storms were welcomed since in the instantaneous lightning flash a wellknown corner or crossing could be glimpsed this sense of bewilderment and panic could have emerged in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries no less than during the second world war but this latterday darkness served only to confirm how frightening and mysterious london might still become when the blackout was lifted in the autumn of the relief was palpable it is no longer inky black but all softly lit up and shining and all the little beams of light are reflected most charmingly in the wet streets those little beams in later years gave way to neon mercury and general fluorescence so that at the beginning of a new century the city lights up the sky for many miles around and has become a greater source of brightness than the moon and stars for some this is a source of anger as if the artificial city were somehow contaminating the cosmos itself yet there are still many streets which are only partly illuminated and many small passages and byways which are scarcely lit at all it is still possible to cross from a brightly lit thoroughfare into a dark street just as it has been for the last three hundred years and to feel afraid but does london have its own natural light henry james noted the way the light comes down leaking and filtering from its cloud ceiling there is a sense of damp and misty brightness which other observers have recorded as if everything were seen through tears but james also noticed the softness and richness of tone which objects put on in such an atmosphere as soon as they begin to recede buildings and streets dissolve into the distance therefore without the clarity of the light in paris or new york it has been said that nowhere is there such a play of light and shade such a struggle of sun and smoke such aerial gradations and confusions richard jefferies who in his apocalyptic novel after london depicted the city as a miasmic wasteland had an eye for just such aerial gradationsfrom a yellow sunset to an indefinite violet in the southwest from the dazzling light of summer to the redness of the winter sun when the streets and buildings are suffused with a fiery glow the faint bluegreen mist was known as the light that london takes the day to be softening and blending the cityscape while in the parks there hovers a lovely pearlgrey haze soft and subdued yet there is also a coldness in the light of the streets which may be glimpsed in the grey of winter and the blue mist of spring the haze of summer and the orange sunsets of autumn it is derived from the immensity which the light of london reflects so that as hippolyte taine put it it becomes the emanation of a huge conglomeration of human creation when the shimmering of river waves the scattering of the light imprisoned in vapour the soft whitish or pink tints which cover these vastnesses diffuse a sort of grace over the prodigious city that sense of immensity is glimpsed in virginia woolfs account of london as a swarm of lights with a pale yellow canopy drooping above it there were the lights of the great theatres the lights of the long streets lights which indicated huge squares of domestic comfort lights that hung high in the air no darkness would ever settle upon these lamps as no darkness has settled upon them for hundreds of years the lights of london blaze perpetually from the air the lights shine for miles like a vast web of brightness the city will never cool down it will remain incandescent yet where there is light there is also shadow and the darkness of night chapter night in the city there have been many accounts of the london night books entitled city nights and night life have been entirely devoted to the subject james thomson called it the city of dreadful night it may be that the city is truly itself and becomes truly alive only at night that is why it exercises a constant fascination the effect begins at twilight in that crepuscular hour with the dusky multitude of chimney pots and the small black houses of muddy ways and slatternly passages when in the words of julian wolfreyss writing london the sinister the threatening monstrous inhumanity of the limitless city becomes apparent these are all accounts from the nineteenth century but night terrors of earlier centuries are no less substantial from earliest times the streets of the city have never been safe at night curfew was rung at nine and in theory the alehouses were closed and citizens were meant to stay indoors in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries however drama verse epistles and satires came to emphasise the nature of the city night with lines such as these quoted in thomas burkes the streets of london frightening of cullies and bombastine whores wringing off knockers and from posts and doors rubbing out milk maids and some other scores scowring the watch or roaring in the streets lampblacking signs with divers other feats these were the pranks of the roaring boys which were juvenile enough compared with the more violent excesses of the gangs or the thieves or the rapists under cover of darkness thomas shadwell the late seventeenthcentury dramatist remarked how at approximately two in the morning comes the bellman and in a dismal tone repeats worse rhymes than a cast poet of the nursery can make after him come those rogues that wake people with their barbarous tunes and upon their tooting instruments make a more hellish noise than they do at a playhouse when they flourish for the entrance of witches from the evidence of the drama and reports such as this it seems clear that at night the city was almost as noisy as day with the difference only that the sounds at night were more frantic and desperate among yells and screams and shouts and whistles punctuating the early hours with their own uneasy refrain if you were to listen intently you might hear whos there or your purse or dog are you dumb speak quickly my ears were so serenaded on every side wrote ned ward at the beginning of the eighteenth century with the grave musick of sundry passing bells the rattling of coaches and the melancholy ditties of hot bakd wardens and pippins nothing could i see but light and nothing hear but noise the unnaturalness of the london night is emphasised here filled as it is with light and sound rather than the silence and darkness celebrated in the poetry of the evening landscape when samuel pepys accompanied lady paulina montague through the nocturnal streets she was terrified every step of the way the reasons for her fear are outlined in john gays poem of walking the streets by night which is part of his triviatrívium being the point where three streets meet the word generally used to characterise public thoroughfares of every description in the busie street at night planks and ladders and low awnings offered continual obstacles to progress now all the pavement sounds with trampling feet amid the neighing of horses and the lowing of bullocks the coachmen hustled each other and lashed each other with whips there were fights in the streets also till down they fall and grappling roll in mud gay noticed one notorious spot for night traffic jams by st clement danes in the strand where the church itself acted as a massive impediment the streets upon either side of it had no posts to distinguish road from pavement so the result was a confusion of coaches horses and pedestrians worse compounded by the fact that loaded wagons were brought from the thames through the narrow sidestreets which led on to the main thoroughfare to be caught in the mob or throng was dangerous indeed if the solitary walker was not pushed and jostled and cursed his wig or cambric handkerchief or watch or snuffbox were likely to be stolen to the raucous sounds of the night then was added the cry of stop thief the pedestrian risked being crushed by carriage wheels or pushed aside by chairmen but more dangerous were the open cellars from which goods were sold there was thick mud in the streets and from above empty chamberpots come pouring down from garret windows you have cause to bless the gentle stars if you come off with piss it was wise to pay no attention to the sound of blows being exchanged or the cries for help yet at night even the houses of londoners were not necessarily havens from the anxiety and unrest of the streets about two oclock in the morning on march boswells candle went out at his lodgings in crown street westminster he went down to the kitchen in order to find a tinderbox but he could see nothing of the kind there i was now filled with gloomy ideas of the terrors of the night so the darkness without spread fear within i was also apprehensive that my landlord who always keeps a pair of loaded pistols by him might fire at me as a thief the dangers of vandalism and theft were very great then if the owner of the house must keep pistols by his bed it resembles the practice of samuel johnson who always took a stout cudgel with him before he ventured upon the streets so boswell went up to my room sat quietly till i heard the watchman calling past three oclock i then called to him to knock at the door of the house where i lodged he did so and i opened it to him and got my candle relumined without danger here is a vignette of london life which despite its brevity is arrestingthe call of the watchman the instruction from boswell and the hurried lighting of the candle the night of nineteenthcentury london has a less intimate aspect the victorians were fascinated and appalled by it it is the period when the genre of night painting emerged among the artists of london while in the theatre there were melodramas such as london by night and after dark a tale of london life the poetry of the age is filled with intimations and images of the dark city from dowson and lionel johnson to george meredith and tennyson it is as if the inhabitants of nineteenthcentury london were haunted by the night city so that in the words of rudyard kipling recalling his early experience of london in lodgings here for the first time it happened that the night got into my head in the middle of the nineteenth century there came a vogue for night walks sketches or essays in which the solitary pedestrian made his way across the dark city marking significant moments and scenes in a journey of unknown destination for charles dickens walking at night was a way of allaying private miseries as a child he had walked through the city and even in its nocturnal aspect it offered him a strange comfort and reassurance it was if whatever his own personal unhappiness it the thing known as london would always be there both solid and tangible it was his true home after all and somehow it was incorporated within his own being so dickens walked under the pattering rain walk and walk and walk seeing nothing but the interminable tangle of streets save at a corner here and there two policemen in conversation this was now a guarded and supervised city its corners manned by officers of the law no longer the anarchy and exuberance recorded by john gay in the s the silence is the silence of its vastness dickens crossed waterloo bridge paying a halfpenny to the tollkeeper wrapped up in his booth where the thames had an awful look of blackness and reflected light and where the very shadow of the immensity of london seemed to be oppressively upon the river this is what is most noticeable about the nineteenthand twentiethcentury city at night its immensity a vast capital stretching outwards into the darkness having crossed the bridge dickens passed the theatres of wellington street and the strand with the rows of faces faded out the lights extinguished and the seats all empty here is a representation of london in miniature as one great darkened theatre it is significant that charles dickens next made his way to newgate prison in order to touch its rough stone london is both theatre and prison at night its true aspects are outlined clearly shorn of the vagaries of the day he visited the courts of law then at westminster before moving on to the abbey where it became for him a solemn consideration what enormous hosts of dead belong to one old great city and how if they were raised while the living slept there would not be the space of a pins point in all the streets and ways for the living to come out into not only that but the vast armies of dead would overflow the hills and valleys beyond the city and would stretch away all round it god knows how far this is perhaps what one inheritor of dickenss urban vision george gissing meant when he exclaimed london by night rome is poor by comparison it is the presence of the past or the presence of the dead which lends the night images of london their peculiar intensity and power of all cities london seems most occupied by its dead and the one which most resounds to the tread of passing generations it is not as if the physical fabric of the old city has survived intact gissings comparison with rome is again appropriate here the eternal city has so many ruins of its greatness that the spirit of the past has had no room in which to flourish in london the past is a form of occluded but fruitful memory in which the presence of earlier generations is felt rather than seen it is an echoic city filled with shadows and what better time to manifest itself than at night another night voyager of the midnineteenth century charles manby smith noticed in an essay entitled twenty four hours of london streets that the slightest sound reverberated between the great walls of houses and public buildings with his own footsteps echoing as if some invisible companion dogged our march he heard the silence in the old walled city which is all the more fearful and oppressive after the humming booming surgelike sound of the day it represents a great change in the nature of city life which over the years spread wider and wider beyond the old city that which was most populous during the day is now the least populated at night few people lived in the cityand fewer now at the start of the twentyfirst centuryand the old centres of habitation have been steadily abandoned for life upon the perimeters it is the single most important reason for the relative silence and peacefulness of london over the last century this midnineteenthcentury pedestrian anticipated the later environment and atmosphere of london when he observed the apparently numberless and interminable rows of streets lying in the voiceless silence and distinctly mapped out by the long and regular lines of lamps on either side of the way this is a vision of the city as part of an inhuman mechanical alignment there is no other spectacle that we know of that intimates so significantly the huge extent of this overgrown metropolis the dead dumbness that reigns in these long empty avenues appals the mind and sends the imagination of the pedestrian wandering for ever onwards and onwards so at night london becomes a city of the dead the silence of the nineteenth century continuing through the twentieth into the twentyfirst in london nights published in it is remarked that the past has a stronger hold on the night than it has on the day while walking beneath the thames in the tunnel which connects the north and south banks for example you might be exploring the tombs of buried london thousands of years hence in this sense it then becomes an infinite citylondon is every city that ever was and ever will bewhich in its illimitable regions manifests the true nature of the human community that is why at night the most visible inhabitants of the city are those without a home in all manner of holes and corners the homeless may be found sleeping in winter nights mid the ruin of halfdemolished houses on the stairs leading from viaducts in corners of the blackwall tunnel in recesses in massive buildings in porches of churches that reality has not changed in the intervening years then as now the embankment remains a central place for the vagrants to gather despite the cold and damp air coming from the thames it is almost as if at night the river calls them there are certain streets which in the present century seem never entirely empty at nightone may name old compton street in soho upper street in islington and queensway in bayswater as examplesand there are as there have been over the centuries allnight restaurants such as those in st john street and in the fulham road but the general impression of contemporary london at night is of a dull silence there is no feeling of real danger only the awareness that one can walk until dawn and then a further dawn without coming to the end of interminable streets with houses on either side the shopping malls and some of the thoroughfares are monitored by surveillance cameras so that it is impossible ever to feel completely alone the cameras represent one way in which modern london has changed it has become selfconscious forever watchful of its own citizens almost daring them to manifest the energy and violence of their predecessors there is never complete silence however it is punctuated by the humming of neon lamps and by the sirens of police cars or ambulances that low and remote sound is of the traffic perpetually passing through while in the east the glow of the lamps becomes paler with the approaching dawn chapter a city morning god give you good morrow my master past five oclock and a fair morning that is how the watchman of the seventeenth century heralded the dawn the time when most of the citizens were waking and preparing for the work of the day then as now the eastern suburbs of the city went to bed earlier and rose earlier than their western counterparts the markets were busy and the produce had already been brought from the surrounding countryside in wagons one of the complaints of londoners was that they were perpetually being woken while it was still dark by the clatter of the wheels and the neighing of the horses as fruits and vegetables were transported to leadenhall or covent garden the essayist richard steele has a fine description august of the gardeners who sailed down the river with their produce to the various markets of the city i landed with ten sail of apricock boats at strandbridge after having put in at nineelms and taken in melons consigned by mr cuffe of that place to sarah sewell and company at their stall in coventgarden they unloaded the cargo at strandbridge at six that morning at the time when the hackneycoachmen of the previous night were just going off duty some passing sweeps engaged in raillery with the fruit girls about the devil and eve the details of the wit are not recorded there are other descriptions of the carthorses steaming and stamping in the market as the dawn breaks of the carters sleeping upon their sacks of the lines of porters carrying fruits and vegetables to their various stalls by six oclock the apprentices were already pulling up the shutters lighting the fires or putting out the wares for sale and display they washed down the pavement outside while the maids swept the steps of the more fashionable houses the street vendors and sweeps and other itinerants were soon making their way through the thoroughfares which grew more crowded as the day advanced and as the years progressed the street activity seemed to increase in the eighteenth century it was suggested that cheesemongers should not set out their butter and cheese so near the edge of their shopwindows nor put their firkins in the pathways by which many a good coat and silk gown may be spoiled here was one indication of the general lack of room the sheer crowdedness of the daytime city is always a paramount feature of its life and there were remarks that barbers and chimney sweepers have no right by charter to rub against a person welldressed and then offer him satisfaction by single combat there were other traders whom it was wise to avoid including the baker with his apron covered in flour and paste the smallcoal man the butcher with his bloody leather apron and the chandler from whose basket spots of tallow might fall there were constant complaints about carmen using the pavement rather than the road to carry their charges and about workmen carrying ladders or pieces of timber upon their shoulders in the middle of crowded thoroughfares so there was of necessity an art of walking the streets by day as well as by night there were certain rules which were generally observed the wall was surrendered to females so that they would not be jostled on to the road while it was considered a duty to direct the groaping blind never ask directions from an apprentice because these young and lively londoners were known to delight in sending any stranger in the wrong direction it was always best to ask assistance from a shopkeeper or tradesman if you wished to urinate go into some court or secret corner avoid watling street and ludgate hill because of the crowds that throng there much better to walk along the broader pavements of the strand or cheapside but in every main street nevertheless full chargd with news the breathless hawker runs shops open coaches roll carts shake the ground and all the streets with passing cries resound in the early nineteenth century as occupations and areas began to be differentiated on social lines various formal urban types appear at eight oclock and ten oclock the postman in scarlet tunic made his deliveries in the west end while the musicians and oldclothessellers made their way from the east end towards the centre the commercial clerks walked down the strand towards the admiralty and somerset house while the government clerks tended to ride down to whitehall and downing street in broughams this was the morning tide of the citizens the nineteenthcentury journalist ga sala knew them well you may know the cashiers in the private banking houses by their white hats and buff waistcoats you may know the stockbrokers by their careering up ludgate hill in dogcarts and occasionally tandems you may know the jewish commission agents by their flashy broughams you may know the sugarbakers and soapboilers by the comfortable doublebodied carriages and the warehousemen only by their wearing gaiters between nine and ten the omnibuses arrived at the bank with thousands of occupants while on the thames itself a large number of swift grimy little steamboats had picked up passengers from the piers at chelsea and pimlico hungerford bridge and southwark waterloo and temple before disgorging them to the piers by london bridge thames street both upper and lower was invaded by an anthill swarm of spruce clerks who mingle strangely with the fishwomen and the dockporters the london morning hungered for its crowds and equally voracious the insatiable counting houses soon swallow them not just the countinghouses were filled but also all the workshops warehouses and factories of the metropolis the bars of the public houses were opened the bakedpotato men and the owners of coffee stalls were engaged in their brisk business in the west end the shoecleaners and commercial travellers were already at their work while in the adjacent courts and alleys the vast army of the poor swarmed out of doors there was a nineteenthcentury phrase that you can hardly shut the street door for them and even in the poor quarters the morning brought a desperate ferocious levity as if the opening of each days misery could elicit only an hysterical response there is indeed an insistent rhythm to the routine of london the exchange opens and closes its gates the banks of lombard street are filled with and then emptied of customers the glare of the shops brightens and then fades in the later decades of the nineteenth century the trains as well as the omnibuses brought in the multitudes from the suburbs but what the city takes in during the morning it spews forth at evening so that there is a general pulse of people and power which keeps its heart beating this is what charlotte brontë meant when she recorded that i have seen the west end the parks the fine squares but i love the city far better the city seems so much more in earnest its business its rush its roar are such serious things sights sounds at the west end you may be amused but in the city you are deeply excited she was deeply excited by the process of urban life itself fulfilling in its own fashion the rhythms of night and day by the time the post office had barred up its letter boxes on the stroke of six oclock the businessmen and their clerks had left the city to its shopkeepers and dwindling number of householders the full tide of the citizens ebbed and through a thousand different streets returned homeward and at the close of dickenss little dorrit as they passed along in sunshine and shade the noisy and the eager and the arrogant and the froward and the vain fretted and chafed and made their usual uproar all to return on the following morning and if they had woken up fifty or a hundred years later no doubt they would still have been able to follow the instinctive movement of the rush hour yet there is one distinction if a nineteenthcentury londoner were to be set down in the city of the twentyfirst century perhaps at twilight in cheapside when the office workers and computer operators are returning homeward he would be astonished by the orderliness and uniformity of their progress he might recognise a type or an expression of thoughtfulness or anxietyhe might also be familiar with those who mutter to themselves but the general quietness together with a lack of human contact and of friendly exchange might be unnerving londons radicals the sessions house on clerkenwell green part of the ritual of riot and punishment which has marked this small area for many hundreds of years chapter where is the well of clerkenwell there is a story by arthur machen in which he describes an area in stoke newington where on occasions an enchanted landscape can be glimpsed and sometimes even entered perhaps we may locate it near abney park a somewhat desolate cemetery beside stoke newington high street this is the street where defoe lived and where edgar allan poe went unwillingly to school few people have seen this visionary place or even know how to see it but those who have can speak of nothing else machen wrote this story n in the early s but as the century progressed other enchanted areas of london have emerged into the light these remain powerful and visible to anyone who cares to look for them one of these districts finds its centre upon clerkenwell green it is not green at all it is a small area enclosed by buildings with a disused public lavatory in the middle on both sides are narrow streets which in turn lead off into alleys or other streets the green has its restaurants two public houses commercial premises and offices for architects or public relations consultants it is in epitome a typical area of central london but there are other signs and tokens of a different city just beyond the green are the relics of the eleventhcentury church and hospital of st john where the knights templar and knights hospitaller had their headquarters the crypt survives intact a few yards to the south of the crypt in the early sixteenth century was erected st johns gate this also still remains just on the northern edge of the green itself can be found the original site of the medieval well from which the district derives its name in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries it was simply a broken iron pump let into the front wall of a tenement building but since that time it has been restored and preserved behind a thick glass wall it marked the site of the stage where mystery plays were performed for centuries beyond the memory of man and in fact for many hundreds of years clerkenwell was notorious for its dramatic representations the yard of the red bull inn to the east of the green is reputed to be the first theatrical venue where women appeared on stage it is one example of the many continuities that charge clerkenwell and its environs with an essential presence but perhaps it is best to begin at the beginning on clerkenwell green the remains of a prehistoric settlement or encampment have been discovered suggesting that this area of london has been continuously inhabited for many thousands of years perhaps the melancholy or ancientness which writers as diverse as george gissing and arnold bennett have intuited in this location derives from the weariness of prolonged human settlement with all the cares and woes which it brings the area itself is first noticed in the early records of st pauls when in the seventh century it became part of the property of the bishop and canons of that institution in the eleventh century william i awarded the land to one of his most successful supporters ralph fitz brian who in the proper terminology became lord of the fee of clerkenwell held of the bishop of london within the manor of stepney by knight service it is important to note here that from the beginning clerkenwell was beyond the bars of london and effectively part of middlesex the heirs of ralph became lords of the manor of clerkenwell and they in turn granted land and property for the maintenance of two religious foundations the convent of st mary in clerkenwell was established roughly where the present church of st james now stands and the priory of the knights templarknown as st john of jerusalema little to the southeast on the other side of the green so from the medieval period clerkenwell became known and identified through its sacred or spiritual affiliations since the priory was first in the ownership of the order of st john of jerusalem it was a mustering point for the crusaders gradually it grew in size and extent over the adjacent area the convent of st mary was similarly extensive but as always the life of the city kept on breaking through in the prioress of clerkenwell petitioned edward i to provide and order a remedy because the people of london lay waste and destroy her corn and grass by their miracle plays and wrestling matches so that she has no profit of them nor can have any unless the king have pity for they are a savage folk and we cannot stand against them and cannot get justice by any law this is one of the first reports that the londoners were indeed savage and it is intriguing to note that the miracle plays were their own it throws a wholly new light upon the presumed sacredness of early drama two generations later an even more savage and violent assault was mounted against the priory of st john when in the stone buildings of the order were put to the torch by wat tylers followers the priory was badly damaged but not entirely destroyed while the prior himself was beheaded on the spot because of his role as richard iis principal taxcollector tylers followers camped upon clerkenwell green watching the hall and dormitory of the knights go up in flame together with the countinghouse the distillery the laundry the slaughterhouse and very many other apartments or stables it seemed as if the whole of clerkenwell were on fire one of the most notorious lanes in the neighbourhood was turnmill street so named because of its proximity to the many mills which harnessed the current of the fleet also known as turnbull street because of the lines of cattle which crossed it in order to reach smithfield by the late thirteenth century the salubriousness of the area had been under threat from filth and ordure and rubbage thrown into the fleet and a century later henry iv ordered that it be cleansed anew he also obliged the authorities to repayre a stone brydge over the flete neare unto trymyllstreate the remote ancestor of the bridge over the underground line which was once more repaired in the late s yet public works could not affect the public reputation of clerkenwell since it was beyond the bars it became the harbour for the outcast and those who wished to go beyond the law so from the beginning it has been the home of groups who wish to be separate and separated in turnmill street one william the parchmenter in harboured the lollard sir john oldcastle and was subsequently hanged drawn and quartered for his hospitality clerkenwell also became the home of jesuits and other recusants and the district was notorious as a centre for papists three suspected papists were hanged drawn and quartered on clerkenwell green in the late sixteenth century the catholics moved out under the threat of persecution although they returned in another guise years later when clerkenwell became an italian quarter in the interim other proscribed religious groups such as the libertarian quakers the brownists the familists and the schismatics congregated in the area of the green here is further evidence then of continuity in persecutions and outlawry in more recent years the freemasons have entered the area with their headquarters in the sessions house upon the green but if turnmill street began life as a haven for heretical lollards and other radical proselytisers it soon acquired a more dissolute reputation it was marked down for condemnation in an ordinance of for the abolition of stewes within the city but since it was literally without the walls few public measures touched it in cardinal wolsey raided houses in turnmill street and the aptly named cock alley now farewel to turnbull street writes the anonymous author of the merrie mans resolution in for that no comfort yields ej burford in london the synfulle citie has reconstructed the topography of the street itself with no less than nineteen rentsalleys yards or courtsissuing off it their conditions were generally described as noysome which in the context of sixteenthcentury london suggests a degree of nastiness which is perhaps not now imaginable one of them was only twenty feet long and two feet six inches wide so that there was not room to get a coffin out without turning it on edge turnmill street appears very often in city records as the haunt of crime as well as prostitution in bakers hause turnmyll street was known as a harbouring house for masterless men and for such as lyve by thiefte and other such lyke sheefts while seven years later a pamphlet entitled kinde hartes dreame cited turnmill street as a place in which the owners charged forty shillings yearly for a little room with a smoky chimney where several of these venereal virgins are resident the association of clerkenwell and turnmill street in particular with prostitution did not end in the sixteenth century in joan cole and three more turnbull street whoares were sentenced to be carted and whipped through the streets one of them helen browne had been arrested while concealed in a lewd house in turnbull street in a dark cellar if you come out of farringdon road underground station and walk a few feet to the left you will find yourself in the very same turnmill street its lefthand side makes up the dead wall of the railway tracks laid where the fleet river once flowed while on the other side are office premises and warehouses of a generally unprepossessing nature there are one or two alleys which act as a reminder of its interesting past turks head yard formerly known as bull alley broad yard on the site of frying pan yard and benjamin street first laid down in are still to be seen yet echoes of a more distant past also survive at the very top of turnmill street was until recent years a twentyfourhour nightclub of equivocal reputation known as turnmills mad frank the memoirs of frankie fraser a member of a notorious london gang begins the independent had it wrong when their reporter said id been shot dead outside turnmills night club in i was only in hospital for two days that time streets such as this are reminiscent of henry jamess description of craven street which runs down from the strand as packed to blackness with accumulations of suffered experience and if there is a continuity of life or experience is it connected with the actual terrain and topography of the area is it too much to suggest that there are certain kinds of activity or patterns of inheritance arising from the streets and alleys themselves clerkenwell green is notable in other respects the invasion of clerkenwell by wat tyler and his followers is an example of its continuing radicalism while the popular obloquy directed against the wealthy nuns of the priory beside the green speaks for the individual and the dispossessed but the ramifications of these actions are rich and complex indeed that great populist and demagogue john wilkes commemorated in the phrase wilkes and liberty was born just off the green in st jamess close in one of the first meetingplaces of the egalitarian london corresponding society was established at the bulls head in jerusalem passage just east of the green and in clerkenwell crowds attacked recruiting offices at battle bridge and at mutton lane at the foot of the green with no doubt the same intensity as early fourteenthcentury londoners showed in attacking the clerkenwell priory a group of radical plotters the united englishmen were seized at a low public house at clerkenwell in the spring of and then a year later a number of united irishmen were arrested in the nags head st johns street which leads away from the green towards smithfield here undoubtedly is a catchment area of dissent and possible radical disruption in henry hunt one of the leaders of the chartist movement which called for universal suffrage spoke to a crowd of above the merlins cave tavern just north of clerkenwell green ten years later william cobbett addressed a meeting on the green itself in opposition to the corn laws then in the national union of the working classes advertised a meeting in coldbath fields north of the green preparatory to a national convention the only means of obtaining and securing the rights of the people on the day itself a man wearing a new white hat excited passersby by reciting passages from a publication called the reformer and loudly proclaiming that people in such an emergency ought to carry arms openly a sentiment which had already been heard many times over many centuries in this neighbourhood the mass meeting was held and an affray took place in which a policeman was killed all this in the immediate vicinity of coldbath prison one of a number of penal institutions in the area on roques map of london delineated in the s and s the area of clerkenwell is seen to be exceedingly well regulated indeed and as the editor of the history of london in maps noticed clerkenwell green has a watchhouse for policing a pound for felons a pillory to put them in and a turnstile to provide a check on people passing through as a known centre of radical activity there was a strong emphasis on official surveillance on roques map too can be seen the outline of clerkenwell gaol just to the east of the green it was a notorious prison built in part of which comprised a number of underground tunnels lined with cells many radicals and schismatics were incarcerated there and it became known as a jail for hereticks of the inmates it was observed in wj pinkss history of clerkenwell that they were lamentably ignorant and superstitious and took great delight in sitting in a ring and telling their adventures and relating their dreams they tell stories of spirits we find in the new prison of clerkenwell one john robins who said that he was god almighty richard king said his wife was with child of him that should be the saviour of all those that shall be saved joan robins said she was with child and the child in her womb was the lord jesus christ richard brothers the selfstyled prophet of the lost tribe and slain lamb of revelation was imprisoned a few yards up the road in the madhouse of ashby street the quakers who in the mideighteenth century went naked for a sign met in peel court off st john street while in was instituted a freethinking christian meeting house in st john square in the centre of the old templar priory there is evidence once more of a continuity the radical history of clerkenwell did not end with the riot of five years later the tolpuddle martyrs on their return from botany bay were first greeted on the green and a year later there was a great chartist meeting on the same spot in prime minister peel banned meetings on clerkenwell green but in the same period the chartists met each week in lunts coffee house at clerkenwell green there were other radical meetingplaces close by such as the northumberland arms at clerkenwell green the unions too met in public houses in precisely the same area the silver spoonmakers at the crown and can st john street the carpenters at the adam and eve st john street row and the silversmiths at st john of jerusalem altogether the trade union directory lists nine separate unions meeting regularly in clerkenwell the disturbances and meetings in that area continued throughout the s and s with marches leaving from the green while an additional strength was lent to the area by the profenian irish radicals of the patriotic society who used regularly to meet at the kings head in bowling green lane a few yards north of clerkenwell green itself at the time of the paris commune in a red flag surmounted by a cap of liberty crowned a lamppost in the green these events may provide an explanation why in the press and on the musichall stage the area became a synonym for radical change yet not all the forces at work there were violently libertarian john stuart mill was one of a number of subscribers who set up a fund to endow a place for political lectures and discussions independent of coerced tavern keepers and licensing magistrates a location was chosen in a neighbourhood well known to the democracy of london and the hall was established at a clerkenwell green which had once been a school for the children of welsh dissenters it became known as the london patriotic club and its history of twenty years is a history of radical issues eleanor marx aveling bradlaugh and kropotkin all used it as a centre for demonstrations and mass meetings but perhaps the most interesting occupant was one of the last a socialist press had been founded at the premises in the s and in vladimir ilyich lenin walked every day from his lodgings in percy circus to clerkenwell green in order to edit an underground revolutionary journal entitled iskra the spark which was meant to ignite russia it might be mentioned here that in the seventeenth century the printers of clerkenwell were denounced for issuing blasphemous and seditious literature that prolonged pattern or alignment of activities continued well into the twentieth century when the communist newspaper the morning star had its offices just west of the green in farringdon road in the s the magazine for the homeless and the unemployed the big issue took up residence a few yards south of the green in the same area where wat tyler had led his army of radical protesters more than six hundred years before so over a period of time in one tiny part of the city at first outside the bars and then within the ever expanding capital the same forms of activity have taken place it may simply be coincidence that lenin followed in the path of the seventeenthcentury printers it may have been in conformity to habit custom or some kind of communal radical memory that the chartists the london corresponding society and the unions chose the same area for their meetings and demonstrations it may be chance that the nineteenthcentury affrays took place in the same vicinity as those of the fourteenth century the editor of the big issue has assured the present author that he had no notion of clerkenwells radical history when he decided to situate the office of his magazine in the area but other territorial clusters abound the emergence of clerkenwell as an instigator or abettor of radical activity is paralleled for example by the gradual identification of bloomsbury with occultism and marginal spiritualism when the great london mythographer william blake was completing his apprenticeship in great queen street an elaborate masonic lodge was being constructed opposite his employers workshop it was the first city headquarters for what was then a controversial occult order of adepts who believed that they had inherited a body of secret knowledge from before the flood before the erection of their great hall they had congregated at the queens head in great queen street and in the same street less than a century later the occult order of the golden dawn held their meetings the theosophical society met in great russell street while around the corner opposite bloomsbury square exists the swedenborg society two occult bookshops can be found in the vicinity while the seven dials close by marks the convergence of astrologers in the seventeenth century so here again there seems to be a congregation of aligned forces by coincidence or design remaining active within the neighbourhood of a very few streets one street and a particular church also throw a suggestive light upon london itself according to stephen inwood in a history of london st stephens coleman street was an old lollard stronghold in the early sixteenth century it became a centre of incipient lutheranism where heretical texts were placed on sale in the five members of parliament whom charles i rashly tried to arrest on charges of treason took refuge in coleman streeta loyal street to the puritan partywhich was their stronghold six years later oliver cromwell met with his supporters in the same street as can be gathered in the trial of hugh peters after the restoration counsel mr gunter what can you say concerning meeting and consultation at the star in coleman street gunter my lord i was a servant at the star in coleman street that house was a house where oliver cromwell and several of that party did use to meet in consultation during this period too the parish and local congregation were also of strongly puritan sympathies then in there were weekly public lectures near coleman street established by women proselytisers and characterised by confusion and disorder during discussions subsequent to the lectures a few years later in a conventicle in an alley off coleman street that dangerous fanatic venner a winecooper and millenarian preached to the soldiers of king jesus and urged them to commence the fifth monarchy during the rising of the anabaptists we read that these monsters assembled at their meeting house in coleman street where they armed themselves and sallying thence came to st pauls in the dusk even after the restoration coleman street maintained its puritan allegiances the old dissenting preacher who had been presented with the living of st stephens in opened a private conventicle after the destruction of the commonwealth from which he ministered to the tootoo credulous soulmurdered proselytes of coleman street and elsewhere we read of radical independents inhabiting the same quarter among them mark holdesby of st stephen coleman street so there is evidence here of a broad continuity over several centuries from the lollards to the anabaptists suggesting once again a certain destiny or pattern of purpose among the streets of the capital arthur machen was only one commentator who recognised that the stones and regions of the great wilderness have their destinies and that these destinies are fulfilled thus there are certain quarters which are appointed as sanctuaries so the secret life of clerkenwell like its well goes very deep many of its inhabitants seem to have imbibed the quixotic and fevered atmosphere of the area somehow by being beyond the bars of the city strange existences are allowed to flourish mrs lewson lived in coldbath square until her death at the age of in the early nineteenth century she still wore the dress of the s thus earning herself the nickname of lady lewson she lived in one room of a large house which for thirty years was only occasionally swept out but never washed in addition it is revealed in wj pinkss the history of clerkenwell that she never washed herself because she thought those people who did so were always taking cold or laying the foundation of some dreadful disorder her method was to besmear her face and neck all over with hogs lard because that was soft and lubricating and then because she wanted a little colour on her cheeks she bedaubed them with rose pink her house was lined with bolts and boards and iron bars so that no one might enter and she never threw anything away even the cinder ashes had not been removed for many years they were very neatly piled up as if formed into beds for some particular purpose the case of lady lewson has other parallels in london history there are many instances of old women for whom time has suddenly come to a halt and who characteristically wear white as some emblem of death or virginity it may be that for those whose lives have been damaged by the turbulence and inhumanity of the city it is the only way of withstanding chance change and fatality another lady of clerkenwell living outside london time was the duchess of newcastle known as mad madge she rode in a black and silver coach with her footmen all in black in addition she had many black patches because of pimples about her mouth wrote samuel pepys may and a black justeaucorps this lady in black wrote books of experimental philosophy the most famous being the description of a new world called the blazing world you will find my works she told a friend like infinite nature that hath neither beginning nor end and as confused as the chaos wherein is neither method nor order but all mixed together without separation like light and darkness pepys having read some of them called her a mad conceited ridiculous woman but if an area such as clerkenwell can engender activity of a certain kind perhaps a single street or house might exert its own influences in the same house where the duchess of newcastle once resided lived another crazed duchess just fifteen years later the duchess of albemarle on the death of her husband was so immensely wealthy that pride crazed her and she vowed never to marry anyone but a sovereign prince in the earl of montague disguising himself as the emperor of china won the mad woman whom he then kept in constant confinement but she outlived him by thirty years and to the end remained insane with pride she insisted for example that all her servants knelt while ministering to her and then walked backwards in her presence it is suggestive perhaps that the house which contained these two mad women was located on the same site as the cloister of the black nuns of the medieval period in pentonville road in the parish of clerkenwell lived that most notorious miser thomas cooke who did not care to pay for his food and drink but when walking the streets he fell down in a pretended fit opposite to the house of one whose bounty he sought with his powdered wig and long ruffles he seemed a respectable citizen so he was promptly taken in given some wine and nourishing victuals a few days after he would call at the house of his kind entertainer just at dinner time professedly to thank him for having saved his life he begged his ink from the various countinghouses he visited and according to pinks his writing paper was obtained by purloining pieces which he saw upon the counter of the bank on his daily visits here is a true london original taking advantage of the urban world to float himself he turned his flower garden into a cabbage patch which in order to waste nothing he enriched with his own and his wifes excrement on his deathbed in the summer of he refused to pay for too much medicine since he was convinced that he would live only six days he was buried at st marys islington and some of the mob who attended the funeral threw cabbage stalks on his coffin when it was lowered into the grave yet it was a life consistent to the point of perfection that of a native of clerkenwell who rarely strayed beyond its bounds yet perhaps the most curious and notable resident of clerkenwell was thomas britton known everywhere as the musical smallcoal man he was an itinerant vendor of coals who lived above his coalshed in jerusalem passage between clerkenwell green and st johns square despite his humble trade in the words of walfords old and new london he cultivated the highest branches of music and drew round him for years all the great musicians of the day including even the giant handel the musicians met every thursday evening in his room above the coalshed to reach this temporary concert hall they had to climb a ladder or as britton put it in his invitations vpon thursdays repair to my palace and there hobble up stair by stair ned ward described brittons house as not much higher than a canarypipe and the window of his stateroom but very little bigger than the bunghole of a cask he himself played the viol di gamba in the company of his excellent musicians and afterwards served coffee to his distinguished visitors at a penny a cup then in the mornings he would take up his sack of coal and tread the familiar streets calling out his trade brittons death was no less fanciful than his life a ventriloquist named honeyman or talking smith threw his voice and announced that unless britton recited the lords prayer immediately he would expire within hours britton fell on his knees and prayed but the chord of his life was unstrung by this sudden shock he died a few days later in the autumn of it was rumoured that he was a rosicrucian one of the sects which haunted clerkenwell and naturally believed in the efficacy of invisible spirits so the trick of the ventriloquist or the atmosphere of the area deeply affected a credulous mind another native of clerkenwell christopher pinchbeck may also throw a curious light upon the neighbourhood he proclaimed himself in the summer of as the inventor and maker of the famous astronomicalmusical clocks for showing the various motions and phenomena of planets and fixed stars solving at sight several astronomical problems he has been denominated the nearalchemist yet his was the alchemy of time which bore strange fruit in the vicinity by the end of the eighteenth century some seven thousand artisansalmost half the parishwere dependent upon watchmaking clerkenwell itself produced some watches each year in almost every street there were private houses which had as doorplates the sign of escapementmaker engineturner springer finisher and so on these were modest but solid properties with the workshop generally constructed at the back but not all the tradesmen were so fortunately placed and a nineteenthcentury essay upon clocks in charles knights cyclopaedia of london remarks that if we wish to be introduced to the workman who has had the greatest share in the construction of our best clocks we must often submit to be conducted up some narrow passage of our metropolis and to mount into some dirty attic where we find illiterate ingenuity closely employed in earning a mere pittance the passages closets and attics may be compared with the wheels and dials of the clocks themselves so that clerkenwell itself becomes a vast mechanism emblematic of time and the divisions of time the census of listed manufacturers of clocks and watches in this small parish but why here the historians of horology have pondered the question and arrived at no satisfactory conclusion the commencement of that remarkable localisation is not certain according to one authority cited by charles knight except that it appears to have made a noiseless progress another remarks nor have we heard any plausible reason assigned by those who residing on the spot and carrying on these branches of manufacture might be supposed to be best informed on the matter so we may say it just happened it is one of those indecipherable and unknowable aspects of london existence a certain trade emerges in a certain area and that is all but in clerkenwell we have learned perhaps to find larger patterns of activity did the presence of skilled artisans in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries actively promote the cause of radicalism by the manufacture of the watch was being used as the best example of the division of labour so that one might say that the creation of timepieces formed the paradigm of industrial capitalism here every alley is thronged with small industries george gissing wrote of clerkenwell in the nether world here you may see how men have multiplied toil for toils sake have worn their lives away imagining new forms of weariness lenin and eleanor marx had found fertile ground or was it that the creation of the division and subdivision of time was an obvious neighbourhood idol to be smashed by those patriotic radicals who wished to return to an earlier polity and a more innocent state of society nevertheless the clockand watchmakers are there still the mystery of the place remains the marx memorial library is still to be found on clerkenwell green within which is preserved the small office where lenin once edited iskra beside it are a snack bar and a restaurant which have been owned by the same italian family for many years until recent days clerkenwell green and its vicinity retained that dusty faded look which was a direct inheritance of its past it was secluded out of the way of the busy areas to the south and west something of a backwater which few londoners visited except those whose business it was to be there the green harboured printers and jewellers and precisioninstrument makers as it had done for many generations st johns street was dark and cavernous lined with empty or dilapidated warehouses then in the s all was changed clerkenwell became part of a social revolution in the process of which london seemed once more able to renew itself the great transition occurred when londoners decided that they would rather live in lofts or shell spaces than in terraced houses these were not the same as parisian apartments since the loft offered inviolable privacy as well as proximity since clerkenwell itself was noticeable for its warehouses and commercial properties it became part of that movement of refurbishment and modernisation which had begun in the warehouses of docklands before reaching other parts of inner london st johns street and the lanes around it have now been extensively redeveloped with floors of glass attached to old structures and new buildings rising so fast that parts of the area are now almost unrecognisable as one character says in arnold bennetts riceyman steps a novel set in early twentiethcentury clerkenwell youd scarcely think it but this district was very fashionable once it was indeed fashionable in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as even the presence of the mad duchesses testifies and now perhaps that period has returned yet that same speaker when alone had another realisation of the ruthless stoney total inhospitality of the district even in the middle of its restoration and rebuilding st johns street is curiously empty from dusk to dawn it affords echoic effects rather than the energy of any real movement or business one is reminded of the fact that in the eighteenth century travellers felt obliged to walk together down this road guarded by linkboys bearing lights in case they were harassed or attacked whether it was wise of property speculators and developers to choose the street as a great site of renovation is an interesting question therefore since it may not be easy to impose a new method of living upon a thoroughfare with so ancient and violent a past clerkenwell persists in londons history as a kind of shadowland therefore complete with its own recognisable if ambiguous identity but it is also important to realise that the same effects may be found almost anywhere within the city of violence for example there is no end violent london an anonymous engraving of the gordon riots in london in here the mob attacks and fires newgate prison one of the most hated symbols of the citys oppressive authority chapter a ring a ring london has always possessed a reputation for violence it stretches back as far as the written records in a signal instance of city savagery the coronation of richard i in for example was marked by the wholesale murder of the jews in london men women and children were burned and cut to pieces in one of the first but not the last pogroms against resident foreigners under cover of the general savagery of the peasants revolt which was also a london revolt apprentices and others fell upon the flemings and butchered many hundreds while the cries of the slayers and slain went on long after sunset making night hideous but the violence was not directed at aliens alone the record of bloody attacks upon taxraisers like william de aldgate stabbed to death and john fuatara finger bitten off by a woman emphasises what one historian ga williams in medieval london has called the londoners reputation for reckless violence in the latin records of londons courts in the early thirteenth century that violence is vividly depicted roger struck maud gilberts wife with a hammer between the shoulders and moses struck her in the face with the hilt of his sword breaking many of her teeth she lingered until wednesday before the feast of st mary magdalen and then died while he was conducting him to the sheriffs the thief killed him they dragged him by the feet on to the stairs of the solar beating him severely about the body and under the feet and wounding him in the head violence was everywhereendemic is the word used by one scholar robberies assaults and manslaughters are recorded with predictable frequency quarrels degenerated quickly into fatal affrays while street fights often turned into mass riots random brutality was common and at times of political crisis the crowd to the wellknown cry of kill kill would set upon perceived enemies with unmatched ferocity many of the tradesnotoriously those of saddler goldsmith and fishmongerwere prone to periodical gusts of homicidal rage while the guilds fought one another in the most pugnacious way the religious orders were not immune from violence the prioress of clerkenwell took barley from disputed land belonging to the prior of st bartholomews with force and arms to wit with swords bows and arrows the memoirs of every century are filled with blood lust there was also violence against animals when a horse being baited by dogs seemed likely to be spared a seventeenthcentury london crowd cryed out it was a cheat and thereupon began to untyle the house and threatened to pull it quite down if the horse were not brought again and baited to death whereupon the horse was again brought to the place and the dogs once more set upon him but they not being able to overcome him he was run through with a sword and dyed cockfighting was the shrove tuesday sport of schoolboys so that the young londoner could acquire an early taste for blood and death bears and bulls were often baited together and at such times you can see the breed and mettle of the dogs for although they receive serious injuries from the bears are caught by the horns of the bull and tossed into the air so frequently to fall down again upon the horns one is obliged to pull them back by the tails and force open their jaws evelyn a more fastidious citizen than most complained about the barbarous cruelties as well as the rude and dirty pastimes of the people he remarked on visiting the famous bear garden by the bankside that one of the bulls tossed a dog full into a ladys lap as she sate in one of the boxes at a considerable height from the arena two poor dogs were killed and so all ended with an ape on horseback it might be remarked that blood sports are common to every culture and to every city nevertheless this form of london violence is described as something intrinsic and particular as dryden put it in the seventeenth century bold britons at a brave beargarden fray are rouzd and chattring sticks cry play play play mean time your filthy foreigner will stare and utter to himself ha gens barbare this was indeed how europeans considered londonersas barbarous peoplealthough as drydens couplets intimate that ferocity was perhaps a matter of civic pride if two little boys quarrel in the street one seventeenthcentury french traveller observed the passengers stop make a ring round them in a moment and set them against one another that they may come to fisticuffs during the fight the ring of bystanders encourages the combatants with great delight of heart the fathers and mothers of the boys let them fight on as well as the rest a ring a ring was one of the perennial cries of the london street the lower populace is of a brutal and insolent nature another traveller remarked and is very quarrelsome should two men of this class have a disagreement which they cannot end up amicably they retire into some quiet place and strip from their waists upwards everyone who sees them preparing for a fight surrounds them not in order to separate them but on the contrary to enjoy the fight for it is a great sport to the lookerson the spectators sometimes get so interested that they lay bets on the combatants and form a big circle around them this is congenital to the character of londoners according to yet another foreign reporter which suggests how unfamiliar and alarming these street fights in fact were to nonlondoners combats between men and women were also frequenti saw in holbourn a woman engaged with a man having struck her with the utmost force he retreated back the woman seized these intervals to fall upon his face and eyes with her hands the police take no cognizance of these combats of individuals by the police is meant the watch in each ward which took no notice of these fights because they were common and familiar yet it did not end there if a coachman has a dispute about his fare with a gentleman that has hired him and the gentleman offers to fight him to decide the quarrel the coachman consents with all his heart this pugnacity could and often did have fatal consequences two brothers fought and one killed the other outside the three tuns tavernhis brother intending it seems to kill the coachman who did not please him this fellow stepped in and took away his sword who thereupon took out his knife and with that stabbed him a diversion of the english according to many reports was female combat in places of resort and amusement such as hockleyinthehole it was recorded that the women fought almost naked with two handled swords which at the points were sharp as razors both combatants were frequently cut with these weapons and retired briefly to have their wounds sown up without the benefit of any anaesthetic other than their own animosity the fight continued until one of the participants swooned or was so badly wounded that she could fight no more on one occasion one combatant was twentyone and the other sixty it became a highly ritualised if bloody affair the two female warriors would bow to the spectators and salute each other one was decked in blue ribbons the other in red each carried a sword about three and a half feet in length with a blade approximately three inches wide with these fierce weapons and only a wicker shield for defence they attacked each other in one fight a swordswoman received a long and deep wound all across her neck and throat some coins were thrown to her from the crowd but she was too badly hurt to fight any more the introductory chaff between the two women one declaring for instance that she beat her husband every morning to keep her hand in was also echoed in the advertisements or notices which preceded each fight i elizabeth wilson of clerkenwell having had some words with hannah highfeld and requiring satisfaction do invite her to meet me on the stage and box with me for three guineas each woman holding half a crown in each hand and the first woman that drops her money to lose the battle the coin was held to prevent the participants scratching each other to which a reply was printed i hannah hyfeld of newgate market hearing of the resolution of elizabeth will not fail to give her more blows than words desiring home blows and from her no favour the london journal reported in june that they maintained the battle with great valour for a long time to the no small satisfaction of the spectators men also fought one another with swords each with a second bearing a large wooden club to ensure fair play and again the struggle ended only when the participants wounds were too disabling for them to continue on many occasions the audiences joined in the battle but lord pepys wrote to see in a minute the whole stage was full of watermen to revenge the foul play and the butchers to defend their fellow though most blamed him and there they all fell to it to knocking down and cutting many on each side it was pleasant to see but that i stood in the pit and feared that in the tumult i might get some hurt this account emphasises the almost tribal loyalties engaged in civic violence the effect of which could be witnessed in even the most polite circles when the speculator barebone engaged some workmen to build upon red lion fields the lawyers of the adjacent grays inn took notice of it and thinking it an injury upon them went with a considerable body of one hundred persons upon which the workmen assaulted the gentlemen and flung bricks at them and the gentlemen at them again so a sharp engagement ensued the tribalism of the city was manifested in a no less unhappy way with the exploits of a group of young people known as the mohocks named after a sort of cannibals in india according to the spectator who subsist by plundering and devouring all the nations about them these young londoners would rush down the streets with linked arms for the pleasure of fighting and sometimes maiming harmless foot passengers and even defenceless women streetbrawling has an ancient history within the city and similar gangs of youths were known in previous generations as muns and tityretus then hectors and scourers and then nickers and hawkubites the mohocks themselves began the evening by drinking too much before tumbling on to the streets with their swords ready the consequences are revealed in walfords old and new london as soon as the savage pack had run down their victim they surrounded him and formed a circle with the points of their swords one gave him a puncture in the rear which very naturally made him wheel about then came a prick from another and so they kept him spinning like a top that is why they became known as sweaters and also as slashers since in more ferocious mood they took pleasure in tattooing or slashing peoples faces with as gay wrote new invented wounds another poet of london has memorialised their exploits in more expressive verse and in luxurious cities where the noise of riot ascends above their loftiest towers and injury and outrage and when night darkens the streets then wander forth the sons of belial flown with insolence and wine so did john milton place the violence of london within the context of myth and eternity within the context of the streets the mohocks were not alone in their depredations in the s william shenstone wrote that london is really dangerous at this time the pickpockets formerly content with mere filching make no scruple to knock people down with bludgeons in fleet street and the strand and that at no later hour than eight oclock at night but in the piazzas covent garden they come in large bodies armed with couteaus and attack whole parties here is a graphic illustration of how at night the city without an adequate police force could become terrifying sir john coventry had his nose slit by a street gang a courtesan named sally salisbury displeased by an admirers speeches seized a knife and plunged it into his body she was conveyed to newgate surrounded by plaudits now it is the general complaint of the taverns the coffeehouses the shopkeepers and others wrote the city marshal in that their customers are afraid when it is dark to come to their houses and shops for fear that their hats and wigs should be snitched from their heads or their swords taken from their sides or that they may be blinded knocked down or stabbed nay the coaches cannot secure them but they are likewise cut and robbed in the public streets etc by which means the traffic of the city is much interrupted traffic is as much in goods as in vehicles and this is one of the indications that the prosperity of the city was being threatened by the violent propensities of some of its citizens in this period too the apprentices would go to temple bar in the evening set up a shouting and clear the pavement between that and fleet market of all the persons there the boys all knew boxing and if anyone resisted one or two would fall upon him and thrash him on the spot nobody interfered james boswell was very observant of the streets in the decade after fieldings death the rudeness of the english vulgar is terrible he confided to his diary in december this indeed is the liberty which they have the liberty of bullying and being abusive with their blackguard tongues on many occasions he would have heard the familiar shouts of marry come up and damn your eyes a month later he was reporting that i was really uneasy going home robberies in the street are now very frequent and then in the summer of he recorded that there was a quarrell between a gentleman and a waiter a great crowd gathered round and roared out a ringa ring it may also be that in that cry there is a folk memory of the chant a ringa ring of roses which commemorated the period of the plague when scarlet tokens upon the flesh were harbingers of death in the streets of london fear and violence are fatally mingled in the eighteenth century there are accounts of mobs with lighted torches and sticks or clubs their leaders would read out the names of people or of specific streets in order to direct the violence against local targets houses and factories and mills could be literally pulled down looms were cut apart sometimes we can hear them shoutinggreen you bugger why dont you fire we will have your heart and liver there is also a remarkable collection of threatening letters which testifies to the spirited and violent language of londoners when addressing one another sir damn your blood if you do not ryes your works too pence a pair moor we well blow your braines out for we will bllow your brans out if you doo not do itt you slim dog we shall sett you houes on fier if you do not lay the money at the place that we shall mention we will set your house and all that belongs to you on fire for it is in my power for to do it mr obey we gave you now an egg shell of honey but if you refuse to comply with the demands of yesterday well give you a gallon of thorns to your final lifes end it is perhaps significant in the context of the violent language of london that much cockney dialect springs immediately from pugilism breadbasket for stomach kisser for mouth conk for nose pins for legs and knockaht for a sensation many of the words for beating such as hammer lick paste whack and scrap also derive from the ring suggesting that the vernacular of confrontation and pugnacity remains very much to the taste of the londoner fights took place off the streets as often as upon them and the printed records testify to the fact that the lower drinking clubs and alehouses were characterised by violence as well as liquor william hickey reported upon his visit to a den called wetherbys in little russell street off drury lane where the whole room was in an uproar men and women promiscuously mounted upon chairs tables and benches in order to see a sort of general conflict carrying on upon the floor two shedevils for they scarce had a human appearance were engaged in a scratching and boxing match their faces entirely covered with blood bosoms bare and the clothes nearly torn from their bodies for several minutes not a creature interfered between them or seemed to care a straw what mischief they might do each other and the contest went on with unabated fury here it is the indifference and callousness of the crowd that are most evident an indifference which it can be presumed was carried over into their general demeanour at work or upon the streets the phrase never mind it was a frequent one another phrase in hickeys account promiscuously mounted also if no doubt inadvertently introduces the element of sexual excitement and sexual congress into this account of bloody combat sex and violence are in the city indissolubly connected hickey watched another beating in a corner of wetherbys where an uncommonly athletic young man of about twenty five seemed to be the object of universal attack hickey then experienced naturally enough an eager wish to get away but was stopped at the door no no youngster he was told no tricks upon travellers no exit here until you have passed muster my chick not until he had paid his reckoning in other words or had his purse stolen he was then called a sucker a word which lingered for more than two hundred years hickey was literally imprisoned within this absolute hell upon earth which then itself became a very emblem of the city as a prison no biography of london would be complete without reference to the most violent and widespread riot of its last thousand years it started as a demonstration against legislation in favour of roman catholics but quickly turned into a general assault upon the institutions of the state and the city on june lord george gordon assembled four columns of his supporters in st georges fields in lambeth and led them to parliament square in order to protest against the catholic relief act gordon himself was a quixotic figure of strange and marginal beliefs but one who managed to inspire the vengeful imagination of the city for five days he always protested in later confinement that he had never meant to uncork the fury of the mob but he never properly understood the moods and sudden fevers of the city his supporters were described as the better sort of tradesmen and gordon himself had declared that for the march against parliament they should be decent and dressed in their sabbath days cloaths but no crowd in london remains unmixed for long soon more violent antipapist elements such as the weavers of spitalfields bred from huguenot stock merged with the general crowd charles dickens in barnaby rudge has given an account of the riots the novel is fired by his interest in violence and by his fascination with crowds but it is also conceived after much reading and research from the annual register of for example he could have learned that the day was intensely hot and the sun striking down his fiercest rays upon the field those who carried heavy banners began to grow faint and weary yet they marched in the heat three abreast the main column some four miles in length and when they converged outside westminster they raised a great yell the heat now inflamed them as they invaded the lobbies and passages of parliament so great was the crowd that a boy who had by some means got among the concourse and was in imminent danger of suffocation climbed to the shoulders of a man beside him and walked upon the peoples hats and heads into the open street now this great multitude threatened the government itself their petition was carried into the chamber of the house of commons while outside the crowd screamed and yelled in triumph they even threatened to invade the chamber but even as they threw themselves against the doors a rumour spread that armed soldiers were advancing in readiness to confront them fearful of sustaining a charge in the narrow passages in which they were so closely wedged together the throng poured out as impetuously as they had flocked in in the ensuing flight a body of horse guards surrounded some of the rioters and escorted them as prisoners to newgate this removal was as events demonstrated an unfortunate one the mob dispersed among a hundred rumours which resounded through the city only to gather itself again as evening approached doors and windows were barred as the nervous citizenry prepared itself for further violence the crowd had diverted its energies from westminster to lincolns inn fields where a notorious mass house was situated it was in fact the private chapel of the sardinian ambassador but no diplomatic nicety could assuage the temper of the mob which burned it down and demolished its interior according to a contemporary report the sardinian ambassador offered five hundred guineas to the rabble to save the painting of our saviour from the flames and guineas not to destroy an exceeding fine organ the gentry told him they would burn him if they could get at him and destroyed the picture and organ directly so opened a path of destruction which would burn its way across london the next day saturday was relatively quiet on the following morning however a mob met in the fields near welbeck street and descended upon the catholic families of moorfields there they burned out houses and looted a local catholic chapel on monday the violence and looting continued but now it was also directed against the magistrates involved in confining some of the anticatholic rioters to newgate as well as against the politicians who had inaugurated the procatholic legislation wapping and spitalfields were in flames it was not a no popery protest now but a concerted assault upon the established authorities yet in promoting disorder they had themselves fallen out of all order or preconcerted arrangement when they divided into parties and ran to different quarters of the town it was on the spontaneous suggestion of the moment each party swelled as it went along like rivers as they roll towards the sea each tumult took shape and form from the circumstances of the moment workmen putting down their tools apprentices rising from their benches boys running errands all joined different bands of rioters they believed that because they were so many they could not be caught many of the participants were in turn motivated by poverty by ignorance by the love of mischief and the hope of plunder this is again according to dickens but he was one who knew the temper and atmosphere of london he understood that once one breach had been made in the security and safety of the city others would follow the city enjoyed a very fragile equilibrium and could be rendered unsteady in a moment the contagion spread like a dread fever an infectious madness as yet not near its height seized on new victims every hour and society began to tremble at their ravings the image of distemper runs through londons history when it is combined with the imagery of the theatre where each incendiary incident becomes a scene we are able to glimpse the complicated life of the city on tuesday the day of parliaments reassembly the crowds once more gathered at westminster it is recorded in lord george gordons narrative that when the members of the commons were informed that people from wapping were just then arriving with large beams in their hands and seemed determined to make an attack upon the soldiers it was decided that the session should be adjourned there were now mobs all over the city most citizens wore a blue cockade to signal their allegiance to the rioters and houses displayed a blue flag with the legend no popery inscribed upon their doors and walls most of the shops were closed and throughout london there was fear of violence the like of which had never been beheld even in its ancient and rebellious times troops had been stationed at all the major vantage points but they also seemed to be sympathetic to the cries and demands of the mob the lord mayor felt unable or was unwilling to issue direct orders to arrest or shoot the rioters so fires and destruction started up in various areas a contemporary account in a letter by ignatius sancho written from charles street dated this tuesday june and reprinted in xavier barons exhaustive london complains that in the midst of the most cruel and ridiculous confusion i am now set down to give you a very imperfect sketch of the maddest people that the maddest times were ever plagued with there is at this present moment at least a hundred thousand poor miserable ragged rabble from twelve to sixty years of age with blue cockades in their hats besides half as many women and children all parading the streets the bridge the park ready for any and every mischief gracious god whats the matter now i was obliged to leave off the shouts of the mob the horrid clashing of swords and the clutter of a multitude in swiftest motion drew me to the door where every one in the street was employed in shutting up shop it is now just five oclock the ballad mongers are exhausting their musical talents with the downfall of popery sandwich and north this instant about two thousand liberty boys are swearing and swaggering by with large sticks thus armed in hopes of meeting with the irish chairmen and labourers all the guards are out and all the horse the poor fellows are just worn out for want of rest having been on duty ever since friday thank heavens it rains the letter is interesting because of its rush and immediacy and it is worth noting for example that the correspondent writes of the demonstrators being poor miserable ragged in more scathing terms dickens describes them as the scum and refuse of the city so here we have a vast army of the disadvantaged and the dispossessed turning upon the city with fire and vengeance if ever london came close to a general conflagration this was the occasion it was the most significant rebellion of the poor in its entire history a postscript to the letter from charles street has equally interesting news there is about a thousand mad men armed with clubs bludgeons and crows just now set off for newgate to liberate they say their honest comrades the firing of newgate and the release of its prisoners remains the single most astonishing and significant act of violence in the history of london the houses of certain judges and lawmakers had already been burned down but as the various columns of rioters descended upon the prison to the cry of now newgate something more fundamental was taking place one of these leading the riot described it as the cause on being asked what this cause was he replied there should not be a prison standing on the morrow in london clearly this was not simply an attempt to release the no popery rioters incarcerated a few days before this was a blow against the oppressive penal institutions of the city and those who watched the spectacle of the fire received the impression that not only the whole metropolis was burning but all nations yielding to the final consummation of all things the columns marched on the prison from all directions from clerkenwell and long acre from snow hill and holborn and they assembled in front of its walls at a little before eight oclock that tuesday evening they surrounded the house of the keeper richard akerman which fronted the street beside the prison a man appeared on the rooftop asking what it was that they wanted you have got some friends of ours in your custody master i have a good many people in my custody one of the mob leaders a black servant called john glover was heard to cry out damn you open the gate or we will burn you down and have everybody out no satisfactory answer was given and so the mob fell upon akermans house what contributed more than any thing to the spread of the flames one eyewitness thomas holcroft reported was the great quantity of household furniture which they threw out of the windows piled up against the doors and set fire to the force of which presently communicated to the house from the house to the chapel and from thence by the assistance of the mob all through the prison it seems to have been the actual sight of the prison with its great walls and barred windows which roused the mob to fury and instilled in them a determination as fiery as the brands which they flung against the gate that great door was the focus of their early efforts all the furniture of the keepers house was piled against it and smeared with pitch and tar was soon ablaze the prison door became a sheet of flame burning so brightly that the clock of the church of the holy sepulchre could clearly be seen some scaled the walls and threw down blazing torches upon the roof holcroft went on to report that a party of constables to the amount of a hundred came to the assistance of the keeper these the mob made a lane for and suffered to pass until they were entirely encircled when they attacked them with great fury broke their staffs and converted them into brands which they hurled wherever the fire which was spreading very fast had not caught the poet george crabbe watched the violence and recalled that they broke the roof tore away the rafters and having got ladders they descended not orpheus himself had more courage or better luck flames all around them and a body of soldiers expected they defied and laughed at all opposition crabbe was one of four poets who observed these events johnson cowper and blake comprising the others it has been suggested that all the defiance and laughter of the incendiary mob are represented in one of blakes drawings of this year albion rose which shows a young man stretching out his arms in glorious liberation yet the association is unlikely the horror and pathos of the nights events instilled terror not exultation in all those who observed them when the fire had taken hold of the prison for example the prisoners themselves were in peril of being burned alive another witness frederick reynolds recalled that the wild gestures of the mob without and the shrieks of the prisoners within expecting instantaneous death from the flames the thundering descent of huge pieces of building the deafening clangour of redhot iron bars striking in terrible concussion on the pavement below and the loud triumphant yells and shouts of the demoniac assailants on each new success formed an awful and terrific scene eventually the gate charred and still in flames began to give way the crowd forced a path through the burning timbers and entered the gaol itself holcroft noted that the activity of the mob was amazing they dragged out the prisoners by the hair of the head by arms or legs or whatever part they could lay hold of they broke the doors of the different entrances as easily as if they had all their lives been acquainted with the intricacies of the place to let the confined escape they ran down the stone passages screaming exultantly their cries mixing with the yells of the inmates seeking release and relief from the burning fragments of wood and the encroaching fire bolts and locks and bars were wrenched apart as if the strength of the mob had some unearthly vigour some were carried out exhausted and bleeding some came out shuffling in chains and were immediately taken in triumph to a local blacksmith to the shrieks of a clear way a clear way from the multitude who surrounded with joy those who had been released more than three hundred prisoners were liberated some had escaped from imminent execution and were like men resurrected others were hurried away by friends others habituated to the prison wandered in astonishment and bewilderment through the wreckage of newgate other prisons were fired and opened that night and it was for that night at leastas if the whole world of law and punishment had been utterly demolished in subsequent years the londoners of the area recalled the unearthly light which seemed to shine from the very stones and streets of the city the city was momentarily transformed it was appropriate therefore that the crowd should then make its way from the burning ruins of the prison to the home of the lord chief justice lord mansfield in bloomsbury square it is one of the aspects of eighteenthcentury london that the house of every notable or notorious citizen was well known the serried spearpoint railings were torn down and hurled within the windows were broken the mob entered the house went through all of its rooms broke or set fire to its furniture mansfields paintings and manuscripts were consigned to the fire together with the contents of his law library this in vivid form was the burning of the law a curious episode might be mentioned here as all the power and oppression of the city are despatched to the flames from the window of the burning house one demonstrator exhibited to the roaring mob a childs dolla poor toy as the image of some unholy saint on reading this account dickens immediately assumed that it was a token of that which the late occupants had worshipped but in fact this strangely anonymous almost barbaric object can be seen as the deity of the crowd on the following morning samuel johnson toured the scene of that nights riots on wednesday i walked with dr scot to look at newgate and found it in ruins with the fire yet glowing as i went by the protestants were plundering the sessionshouse at the old bailey there were not i believe a hundred but they did their work at leisure in full security without sentinels without trepidation as men lawfully employed in full day he added a curious statement such is the cowardice of a commercial place by this he meant no doubt that there was no communal spirit or civic pride abroad to avert or prohibit these outrages london as a commercial city had no defences except those of fear and oppression when those twin guarantors of security were lifted then theft and violence naturally and inevitably emerged in their stead a commercial place is an arena of rapine and anxiety under another name samuel johnson who understood the pleasures and virtues of the city also understood its debilitating faults better than any of his contemporaries but that day witnessed more than the smoking ruins of the law horace walpole termed it in a phrase that was not then a cliché black wednesday it might almost have been termed red wednesday that morning the cowardice of london was manifest in the closed shops and shuttered windows many of the citizens were so dismayed and astounded by the destruction of newgate and the complete failure of the city authorities to punish or apprehend those who were responsible that it seemed to them that the whole fabric of reality was being torn apart before their eyes and round the smoking ruins people stood apart from one another and in silence not venturing to condemn the rioters or to be supposed to do so even in whispers there was another curious aspect of this lawlessness some prisoners lately released sought out their gaolers preferring imprisonment and punishment to the horrors of such another night as the last while others actually returned to newgate in order to wander among the smoking ruins of their erstwhile place of confinement they were brought there by some indescribable attraction according to dickens and they were found talking eating and even sleeping in the places where their cells had once stood it is a curious story but somehow all of a piece with the greater story of london where many will dwell upon the same stones for the whole of their lives troops had been stationed throughout the city but the energy and purpose of the rioters were not significantly diminished in fact the burning of the night before seemed only to have increased their rage and resentment threatening letters were posted up outside those prisons which had remained secure including the fleet and the kings bench assuring their keepers and gaolers that they would be fired that night the houses of prominent legislators were similarly picked out the leaders of the riot declared that they would take and fire the bank the mint and the royal arsenaland that they would occupy the royal palaces a rumour spread that the demonstrators would also throw open the gates of bedlam thus contributing a curious terror to the general fear of the citizens truly then the city would become a hell with the desperate the doomed and the distracted wandering its streets against buildings collapsing and houses on fire that night it seemed that the fire of had come again the rioters emerged upon the streets like a great sea and it seemed their purpose to wrap the city in a circle of flame thirtysix major fires were startedthe prisons of the fleet the kings bench and the clink were all alightwhile the soldiers fired upon the crowds with sometimes fatal effect some of the greatest conflagrations were in the vicinity of newgate itself beside holborn bridge and holborn hill as if the destruction of the previous night had somehow magnetised the area so that it drew more vengeance upon itself the image of the blankfaced doll as some anonymous and infernal deity of the riotous city seems appropriate samuel johnson wrote to mrs thrale that one might see the glare of conflagration fill the sky from many parts the sight was dreadful and from horace walpole i never till last night saw london and southwark in flames this spectacle of the burning city again according to johnson created a universal panick there were sporadic riots on the next day thursday but the incandescent scenes of the day before seem to have exhausted that lust for violence which had so suddenly visited the streets of london the military had been posted at all the appropriate sites while bands of soldiers were actively seeking out and arresting rioters so that by friday the city was quiet many of those who had left london in fear of their lives still remained apart and the majority of shops were closed but the insurrection had passed as quickly and as generally as it had gathered just a week before two hundred were dead more lying badly and often fatally injured while no one was able to compute the numbers of those who had burned to death in cellars or hidingplaces lord george gordon was arrested and taken to the tower of london and hundreds of rioters were confined in the prisons that had not already been destroyed by fire twentyfive were hanged on the spots where their crimes had been committed two or three boys were suspended before lord mansfields house in bloomsbury square so ended the most violent internecine episode in the citys history like all london violence it burned brightly but quickly the stability and reality of the city being distorted by the heat of its flames before once more settling down the violence upon the broadwater farm estate in north london in suggests a prevalent instinct towards riot which has never been suppressed it is necessary only to look into the inner courtyards of a councilhouse estate with graffiti on every wall the windows covered with metal grilles and the doors padlocked to understand that state of siege in which part of london still lives the anxiety is still palpable in certain districts and along certain roads where the forces of repressed anger and fear are overwhelmingly present an additional and unpredictable element in the general level of city violence is added in those parts of london that are infected with drug gangs the broadwater farm disruption began in the autumn of upon a predominantly black council estate where for several months there had been rumours of riots a series of separate incidents in the early autumn had exacerbated already emerging tensions but the death of mrs cynthia jarrett on the night of october allegedly while the police were searching her flat precipitated the disturbances upon the estate the official report broadwater farm enquiry includes the statements of witnesses as well as descriptive analysis of the violence itself so i thought oh my god they down there and those children are there the actions of the police were reported in similar fashion there was cries of wait until we get in there and get you get back in there you bastards get back in there the only people who may not have been pushed back were a few of the older ones a lot of people said no dont go back why should we go back it was a general state of confusion there were young girls there with young children and then a lot of screaming a lot of shouting these could be the voices of any angry crowd scattered across london over the past centuries but it is incarnated here within a group of black youths confronted by lines of police in riot gear attempting to force them back upon the council estate as if they were prisoners being driven back into their cells some of the youths then began to turn over cars and missiles were thrown at a line of police two cars were turned over and burned close to the junction they attempted to turn over another car but were stopped soon after a wall at the corner of willan road and the avenue was knocked down and dismantled for ammunition to throw at the police line the fighting had started it spread rapidly in characteristic fashion and from the estate came constant volleys of dangerous missiles slabs of pavement were broken up and thrown when the available slabs from nearby were used up young people were seen rushing through the estate carrying missiles in various containers a shopping trolley a milk crate and a large communal rubbish bin were all mentioned to us as being used at a later stage tins stolen from the supermarket became a common form of ammunition once more the common reality of the city was being disrupted and changed crude and often ineffective petrol bombs were hurled at the encroaching police two people both black started shouting orders at the others we need more ammunition immediately five or six responded by running round the houses gathering up empty milk bottles while four others turned over a car for petrol in less than five minutes i counted more than petrol bombs completed curiously and perhaps significantly this testimony came from michael keith a research assistant at st katherines college oxford who had been preparing a history of rioting so the historical dimension or historical resonance is confirmed by one who witnessing the events of had other riots in his head perhaps the gordon riots provided an echo or parallel many of the demonstrators wore masks or scarves in order to conceal their identity but as in previous incidents over the centuries some emerged who took command of the riots it was like when you look at ants one witness on broadwater farm explained you see how ants move and you identify which ones are the workers because you see them from high now what i saw was three or four people moving and giving signs to each other with their hands and they were moving like a group you could see they were white by the hands one of the characteristics of accounts of the gordon riots was the allegation that secret managers exploited the violence and mayhem for their own ends on broadwater farm the same phenomenon emerged they were outsiders doing it to our estate a witness explained suggesting in turn that there are some people who relish urban conflagration for its own sake or as a means of affecting the entire social and political system the fact that these strange organisers were apparently white as witnessed by others may suggest that sixth columnists wanted to inflame hatred against the black londoners who lived upon the estate yet the general movement of the crowd was as ever one of controlled confusion the historian of rioting noted that most of the people were united by a sense of anger which regularly escalated to fury in this situation a dramatic cast representative of any crosssection of society was clearly evident here his understanding of the patterns of riot comes into play with his reference to a dramatic cast as if it were part of londons theatre he mentioned those too who attempted to compete in their bravery and aggression against the ranks of the police many more spent most of their time giving moral support joking with each other but no less committed in occasional forays he noticed some who tried to establish a plan of concerted action and impose order upon incipient chaos but they were not wholly successful in this sense he concluded organisation was extemporised these are precisely the sentiments expressed by those who watched the unfolding of the gordon riots and they suggest a great truth about violence in the city another witness observed that when people thought that their lines were a bit thin then they went to reinforce the lines running from one point to another there were no generals this suggests another aspect of london riots they are rarely orchestrated but patterns emerge from within the crowd itself it might also be construed as part of that egalitarian spirit of the city that there can be no generals or leaders one observer on the broadwater farm speaking of the rioters was struck by how young they were she saw kids of and it may be recalled here that children were hanged in the aftermath of the gordon riots after the first confrontation there was no sustained attack but intermittent forays cars were overturned and shops looted i discovered he was an irish boy and he said that its the first time he has had so much food in six months because hes unemployed yet the most violent incident took place in the tangmere precinct of the estate one of the policemen despatched to guard the firefighters putting out a blaze in a newsagents shop pc keith blakelock slipped and fell in the face of a pursuing mob d rose in a climate of fear takes up the narrative the rioters came at blakelock from all sides he was kicked on the ground and stabbed again and again here we have an example of the sudden viciousness of a london mob in the words of pc richard coombes the mob were like vultures pecking at his body as his arms rose and fell to death with their blows another observer described them as a pack of dogs inadvertently using a simile which has become customary in dealing with the threatening crowd older than shakespeares line in coriolanus what would you have you curs it suggests the wildness and the untamed savagery latent within the civic order the instruments were going up and down being flayed at him the last i saw of pc blakelock was he had his hand up to protect himself blakelocks hands and arms were cut to ribbons his head seems to have turned to one side exposing his neck there he took a savage cut from a machete and there he died it was another terrible episode in the history of london violence where all the rituals of blood and vengeance have their place the tangmere precinct itself is a big squat building shaped in conscious imitation of a babylonian ziggurat babylon is ever associated with paganism and savagery there were gunshots and sporadic fires started upon the estate but by midnight the rioters had begun to disperse it started to rain the violence ended as quickly and as suddenly as it had begun except that is for examples of brutality among the police towards various unnamed and still unknown suspects that same pattern of vengeance was no doubt also part of the aftermath of the gordon riots it would be absurd to declare that these two events separated by two hundred years are identical in character and in motive the fact that one was on a general and the other on a local scale for example is a comment on londons huge expansion over that period one travelled along the streets and the other was confined to the precincts of a council estate this also testifies to changes within the society of london yet both sets of riots were against the power of the law symbolised by the walls of newgate prison in the one case and by the ranks of police officers in riot gear in the other it might be said that both therefore reflect a deep unease about the nature and presence of authority the gordon rioters were generally poor part of the forgotten citizenry of london and the inhabitants of the broadwater farm estate were according to stephen inwood predominantly homeless unemployed or desperate there may again be a connection in both cases however the riots burned themselves out fierily and quickly they had no real leaders they had no real purpose except that of destruction such is the sudden fury of london black magic white magic a woodcut from the title page of astrologaster or the figure casterby john melton londoners were notoriously fearful and superstitious so astrologers and seers of every variety were readily available many astrologers congregated in lodgings around seven dials chapter i met a man who wasnt there and in this dark city whom or what would we expect to see in richard of devizes records that a sacrifice of the jews to their father the devil was commenced in the city of london and so long was the duration of this famous mystery that the holocaust could scarcely be accomplished the ensuing day but then it truly became a city of devils as the citizens fell upon and slaughtered the innocent inhabitants of old jewry in london the home of pride and wealth the devil was always greatly feared in according to the chronicles of london that ys to say vpon seynt lukys day ther blewe a grete wynde out off the north est that ouerthrewe many an house and also turrettes and chirches and fferde ffoule with the woddes and mennys orcherdes and also fyrye dragons wykked spyrites weren many seyn merveyllously ffleynge in the eyre a similar vision of flying fiends was vouchsafed at a much later date in londons history in stopford brookes diary oct england was in sunshine till we came to the skirts of london and there the smoke lay thick i looked down to the streets below filled with the restless crowd of men and cars it was like looking into the alleys of pandemonium and i thought i saw thousands of winged devils rushing to and fro among the mad movement of the host i grew sick as i looked upon it in medieval london many noble personages were buried within the precincts of blackfriars suitably robed because it was believed that to be interred in the habit of a dominican monk was a certain means of warding off the devil yet there were some who were so far beaten down by the city that they identified with the fiend when one london thief and beggar was taunted for his infamy on his way to the tyburn gallows he replied what would the devil do for company if it was not for such as i a straunge sighted traueller of coming to london in a poem by samuel rowlands visited the whores of shoreditch and the statue of king lud and swore in london he had seene the deuill a real devil was supposed to have appeared at a performance of marlowes doctor faustus in the belle sauvage inn on ludgate hill yet when the devil does emerge in london he is often according to folklore gulled and outwitted by the cheating citizens who are more than his match in dishonesty and doubledealing in jonsons the devil is an ass the foul fiend is first shown the city as a kind of inferno child of hell this is nothing i will fetch thee a leap from the top of pauls steeple to the standard in cheap but within twentyfour hours he has been cheated robbed cudgelled thrown into prison and

interior of the cell set aside for solitary confinement byron called london the devils drawingroom he has his guests and his familiars there is a tradition of witches in london with the names of old mother red cap and old mother black cap still used upon shops and signs perhaps the most notorious was mother damnable of camden town whose cottage lay at a fork in the road where the underground station is now to be found in the midseventeenth century she was known as a healer and fortuneteller with her forehead wrinkled her mouth wide and her looks sullen and unmoved her story is told in the ghosts of london by ja brooks on the day of her death hundreds of men women and children were witnesses of the devil entering her house in his very appearance and state and although his return was narrowly watched for he was not seen again mother damnable was found dead on the following morning sitting before the fire place holding a crutch over it with a teapot full of herbs drugs liquid and what a sight that must have been the devil making his way through camden town stranger still is the case of springheeled jack he appeared in the streets during the s and was soon known as the terror of london one statement given by jane alsop at lambeth street police office describes how the unfortunate girl encountered him on her doorstep she returned into the house and brought a candle and handed it to the person who appeared enveloped in a large cloak and whom she at first believed to be a policeman the instant she had done so however he threw off his outer garment and applying the lighted candle to his breast presented a most hideous and frightful appearance and vomited forth a quantity of blue and white flame from his mouth and his eyes resembled red balls of fire this may seem the merest fantasy and yet the particulars are confirmed in an account of another attack by a tall thin man enveloped in a long black cloak in front of him he was carrying what looked like a bulls eye lantern with one bound he was in front of her and before she had a chance to move he belched blue flames from his mouth into her face the entire grotesque history is narrated by peter haining in the legend and bizarre crimes of spring heeled jack jane alsops testimony had other equally disturbing elements from the hasty glance which her fright enabled her to get at the person she observed that he wore a large helmet and his dress which appeared to fit him very tight seemed to her to resemble white oilskin without uttering a sentence he darted at her and catching her part by the dress and the back part of her neck placed her head under one of his arms and commenced tearing her gown with his claws which she was certain were of some metallic substance she screamed aloud and her sister came to the door but in her police statement that sister mary alsop admitted that although she saw a figure as already described she was so alarmed at his appearance that she was afraid to approach or render any assistance a third sister then ran down and dragged jane away from the terrible assailant yet his grip was so strong that a quantity of her hair was torn away she slammed shut the door but notwithstanding the outrage he had committed he knocked loudly two or three times at the door this knocking at the door so strange that it could scarcely have been invented is perhaps the most alarming moment in an entire alarming episode it is as if to saylet me in i have not finished with you yet it is not at all surprising that in the popular urban imagination springheeled jack was identified as the offspring of the devil and described by witnesses as possessing horns and cloven feet in february he was reported to have been seen in limehouse with blue flames issuing from his mouth and in the same year was said to have thrown a prostitute into the water at jacobs island in bermondsey peter haining has suggested that the perpetrator was a fireeater who wore a helmet or mask to protect his face the great leaps and bounds that were also ascribed to him were perhaps the effect of springs concealed in the heels of his shoes the metallic claws have yet to be fully explained yet the point is that springheeled jack became a true london myth because he was so fantastic and artificial a monster with his helmet and white oilskin suit breathing fire like a circus performer he is a london devil curiously resembling the fiends portrayed in the clerkenwell mystery plays accounts of his appearance and behaviour spread very rapidly all over the city he was seen or was reported to have been seen in various locations it is almost as if this bizarre figure emerged from the streets themselves like a golem which is supposed to be made from the mud and dust of a certain vicinity the fact that jack like a later and more notorious jack was never apprehended serves only to deepen that sense of anonymity which suggests the monstrous figure to be some token or representation of london itself for the city is seen by many to be a kind of hell it became a cliché in the poetry of the nineteenth century its citizens resembled a satanic throng while the atmosphere was that of a brown plutonian gloom the sulphurous smell of coal dust and smoke provoked images of satan while the manifold and manifest vices of the city represented all the works of the devil incarnate images of babel and sodom abound therefore yet there is a more profound sense in which the city represents hell it is the ultimate place of degradation and despair where solitude is sought as an escape from the exactions of pity or compassion and where the only fellowship found is the fellowship of misery of all writers perhaps george orwell possessed that sense of the city most strongly and in keep the aspidistra flying gordon comstock surveying the brightness of piccadilly circus in remarks that the lights down in hell will look just like that often the fantasy returned to him that he was a damned soul in hell ravines of cold evilcoloured fire with darkness all above but in hell there would be torment was this torment there are still in this city places where suffering seems to linger on a small garden or patch of waste ground near the intersection of tottenham court road and howland street solitary people sit in postures of despair it was close by at howland street that verlaine composed his wonderful poem il pleure dans mon coeurcomme il pleut sur la ville it weeps in my heart just as it rains upon the city all the loneliness and sorrow of london are caught in this image of the grey and falling rain the cemetery garden behind the hawksmoor church of st georgesintheeast beside wapping attracts the lonely and the unhappy the garden of another church christ church spitalfields by chance by the same architect was for many years a resting place for the vagrant and the deranged it was known as itchy park there was a famous area known as poverty corner along the waterloo road by the corner of york road here outofwork actors artistes and musichall turns used to wait in the generally forlorn hope of being seen or chosen by the musichall agents that corner has remained an anonymous and transient locale between the bridge and the station with its own peculiar sense of desolation whole areas can in their turn seem woeful or haunted arthur machen had a strange fascination with the streets north of grays inn roadfrederick street percy street lloyd baker squareand those in which camden town melts into holloway they are not grand or imposing nor are they squalid or desolate instead they seem to contain the grey soul of london that slightly smoky and dingy quality which has hovered over the city for many hundreds of years he observed those worn and hallowed doorsteps even more worn and hallowed now and i see them signed with tears and desires agony and lamentations london has always been the abode of strange and solitary people who close their doors upon their own secrets in the middle of the populous city it has always been the home of lodgings where the shabby and the transient can find a small room with a stained table and a narrow bed a true londoner will tell you that there is no need to travel when you have the unexplored mysteries of the city all about you a walk down farringdon road or leather lane will give you as much cause for wonder and surprise as any street in paris or rome i do not understand my own city you might say so why travel elsewhere in search of novelty there is always a sense of strangeness in london to be experienced around unexpected corners and in unknown streets as arthur machen said it is utterly true that he who cannot find wonder mystery awe the sense of a new world and an undiscovered realm in the places by the grays inn road will never find those secrets elsewhere not in the heart of africa it has often been observed that certain streets or neighbourhoods carry with them a particular atmosphere over many generations an air of emptiness or ennui for example can be sensed along those thoroughfares that have been created by municipal edict and have taken away much of older london in their constructionvictoria street and new oxford street artificial creations of the nineteenth century remain anonymous unhappy places kingsway cut through ancient dwellings in the early twentieth century is merely dull the essex road and the unluckily named balls pond road are areas of manifest greyness and misery another cold spot over many years has been shepherds bush green it was described as bald arid detestable at the beginning of the twentieth century and has remained thus ever since there were nineteenthcentury alleys and courts which gave an immediate sensation of penury and wickedness the air was poisonous with miasma and nauseous with dank and dismal stenches remarked charles manby smith in the little world of london rags and brown paper substitute half the glass of the windows and what is left is so crusted with dirt that it shuts out the light it was intended to admit andrew mearns in his bitter cry of outcast london records that you have to ascend rotten staircases which threaten to give way beneath every step you have to grope your way along dark and filthy passages swarming with vermin who can say what mark such places leave upon the city in that close corner where the roofs shrink down and cower together as if to hide their secrets from the handsome street hard by there are such dark crimes such miseries and horrors as could hardly be told in whispers the area in the vicinity of prisons has a strangely oppressive and clandestine atmosphere this is perhaps why the entire area of southwark and the borough has for centuries conveyed an impression of meanness and mournfulness there have been many prisons in the vicinity the marshalsea and the kings bench among them and there is no place like this in the suburbs of london according to walfords old and new london a spot that looks so murderous so melancholy and so miserable there is a smell of past ages about these ancient courts like that which arises from decaya murky closeness and all old things had fallen and died just as they were blown together and left to perish and so it remains today with an atmosphere quite unlike that of any other part of london the area of east acton beside the prison of wormwood scrubs is an example of a modern neighbourhood that is enveloped by the shadow of the gaol death can cast its own shadow over a specific locale viaducts and crossroads can also be objects of inexplicable gloom one young londoner of the early twentieth century richard church recalled a crossroads south of the river near the battersea road a crossroads called the latchmere a sinister junction that always filled me with dread there are other streets and areas that seem to emanate misery along the embankment there have always been iron seats at regular intervals and here in the evening or at night you will find solitary figures sitting and looking down at the river or up at the sky in hg wells walked beside them and noticed a poor old woman with a shameful battered straw hat awry over her drowsing face now a young clerk staring before him at despair now a filthy tramp and now a bearded frockcoated collarless respectability i remember particularly one ghastly long white neck and white face that lopped backward choked in some nightmare the tramps are still there but more disquieting are the young who often sit in some daze of not belonging anywhere there are middleaged men in respectable clothes so worn down that their compulsion to wear them provokes pity and there are old women with their worldly possessions in plastic carrier bags the embankment is a haven for them all and will no doubt continue to be so for many centuries the small streets beside drury lane were renowned for their misery summer gardens in winter was a picture of urban desolation with its gutters filled with frozen dirt it was the abode of costers and the narrow road was littered with paper wrappings from the oranges upon their barrows charles booth noted that in one street is the body of a dead dog and near by two dead cats which lie as though they had slain each other all three had been crushed flat by the traffic which has gone over them and they like everything else are frozen and harmless there was also a great quantity of scraps and bread crumbs strewn over the road which according to booth is the surest sign of extreme poverty all over london there was also the notorious whitecross street once whitecross place with its gaol blighting the vicinity it is said god made everything i dont believe it he never made whitecross place and if god did not who did who is the author of filthy lanes and deathbreeding alleys of cliffords inn in chancery lane long known for its legal obfuscation and delay walford states i should say that more misery has emanated from this small spot than from any one of the most populous counties in england only a gate and passage now remain some flats were built over the ancient quadrangle which in virginia and leonard woolf found to be incredibly draughty and dirty and all night long there fell a slow gentle rain of smuts so that if you sat writing by an open window a thin veil of smuts covered the paper before you had finished a page the vicinity of old st pancras with the graveyard as its centre has been an area of dereliction for many centuries norden in the sixteenth century cautioned not to walk there late in the early years of the twentyfirst century it is encompassed by railway arches within which small garages and car repairers have set up their trades much of it remains waste ground swains lane leading down to the great mound known as parliament hill on hampstead heath from the walls of highgate cemetery is considered to be unfortunate the local press and local historians have investigated the condition of the place without notable success except for certain inexplicable or at least unexplained sightings i have seen what appeared to be a ghost like figure inside the gates at the top of swains lane in the weeks after this report appeared in the hampstead and highgate express in february other local correspondents conveyed their apprehension my fiancee and i spotted a most unusual form about a year ago it just seemed to glide across the path i am glad somebody also has spotted it to my knowledge the ghost always takes the form of a pale figure and has been appearing for several years a tall man in a hat who walks across swains lane suddenly from the corner of my eye i saw something move which seemed to be walking towards us from the gates sent us running up swains lane as fast as we could i have also had a strange happening at the lower end of swains lane my advice is to avoid swains lane during dark evenings if at all possible yet there are also areas of peacefulness and care the old foundling hospital in coram fields has long been demolished but on the perimeter of its site is now the great ormond street hospital for sick children wakley street a short and narrow thoroughfare between goswell road and the city road has on one side the headquarters of the national childrens bureau and on the other the national canine defence league in another context it is perhaps encouraging to note that the pitches of puppetshows were set upon a fixed local abode for decades and that together they form a kind of charmed circle around the centre of londonholborn bridge lincolns inn fields covent garden charing cross salisbury change and the fleet bridge on the perimeter of this circle lies fountain court amid the buildings of the temple there has been a small fountain there for three hundred years commemorated by writers as diverse as dickens and verlaine while the softness and serenity of this small spot have been experienced by many generations the fountain and its pool were once squarefenced with palisades then encircled by iron railings but now stand unbarred whether in a square or a round or open on all sides the fountain plays on and its atmosphere has remained constantly evocative one londoner came here as a schoolboy with no knowledge of its history or its associations and immediately fell under the spell of its enchantment it was as if innumerable good acts or kind words had emerged here as calmly and as quietly as the little fountain itself at last in these pages he has the chance of recording his debt if persistence through time can create harmony and charity then the church of st bridesonly a few yards from fountain courthas some claim to good fortune a prehistoric ritual site as well as evidence of a roman temple and wooden saxon church have been found within its grounds so the various forms of divinity have been venerated on one spot for many thousands of years london is blessed as well as cursed chapter knowledge is power there was in the city another way of opening the gate of heaven the pursuit of knowledge has always been one of the citys defining characteristics even though it may take unfamiliar forms in the reign of edward iii a man was taken practising with a dead mans head and brought to the bar at the kings bench where after abjuration of his art his trinkets were taken from him carried to tothill and burned before his face during the reign of richard i one raulf wigtoft chaplain to the archbishop of york had provided a girdle and ring cunningly intoxicated wherewith he meant to have destroyed simon the dean of york and others but his messenger was intercepted and his girdle and ring burned at this place before the people this place was again tothill which is supposed to have been the site of druid worship the tools of conjurors and alchemists were no doubt traditionally destroyed here because it was considered an area of more powerful magic but in london it is impossible to distinguish magic from other versions of intellectual and mechanical aptitude dr dee the great elizabeth magus of mortlake for example was an engineer and a geographer as well as an alchemist in raymond lully attracted by its scientific reputation came to london where he practised alchemy both in westminster abbey and the tower the magician cornelius agrippa arrived in the city at the end of the fifteenth century in order to associate with the great divines and philosophers of the period he struck up a particular friendship with john colet dean of st pauls and founder of st pauls school who had become interested in magic during his italian travels an alchemist named hugh draper was imprisoned within the salt tower of the tower of london for sorcery and magic he inscribed upon his cell wall a great horoscope which he dated on may and then added that he had made this spheer with his own hands by chance or coincidence many astrologers came to inhabit lambeth the name itself however may have drawn them bethel was in hebrew the name for a sacred place here fortuitously connected with the lamb of god at tradescants house in south lambeth dwelled elias ashmole who convinced john aubrey of the powers of astrology the interment of simon forman the great elizabethan magus is entered within the lambeth parish registers lully stated that forman wrote in a book found among his possessions this i made the devil write with his own hand in lambeth fields in june or july as i now remember captain bubb who was a contemporary of forman dwelled in lambeth marsh where he resolved horary questions astrologically a pursuit which led him eventually to the pillory at the northeast corner of calcott alley in lambeth lived francis moore an astrologer and physician who has now entered the realm of the immortals as the author of the almanac which bears his name in lambeth there were many rare devices in the collection of tradescant later to become a museum in the area were gathered salamanders and easter egges of the patriarchs of jerusalem dragons two inches long and two feathers from a phoenix a piece of stone from the tomb of john the baptist and blood that rained in the isle of wight attested by sir jo oglander a white blackbird and halfe a haslenut with seventy pieces of household stuffe in it those were once the sights of lambeth the close associations between alchemy and the beginnings of science were also present in the very heart of london when newton came up to the city in order to purchase the material for his researches he took the coach to the swan tavern in grays inn lane before walking or riding to little britain here through a bookseller called william cooper he bought such texts of alchemical knowledge as zetners theatrum chemicum and ripley revivd by the london alchemist george starkey in the process newton became acquainted with a secret group of london magicians and astrologers many of the original founders of the royal society which in later days was explicitly associated with modern scientific research and knowledge were in fact part of the invisible college of adepts who practised alchemy as well as mechanical philosophy they were part of that tradition adumbrated by john dee which saw no necessary disparity between the various forms of occult and experimental understanding samuel hartlib was the prime mover among a group of london experimenters who wished to marry rationality and system with alchemy in order to create a practical magic among his friends and supporters were robert boyle kenelm digby and isaac newton himself they corresponded by means of codenames and used pseudonyms in the publication of their work that of newton was jeova sanctus unus yet there emerged out of this a society which was in the words of macaulay destined to be a chief agent in a long series of glorious and salutary reforms the royal society held its first meetings in gresham house in bishopsgate before removing to crane court off fleet street and beside fetter lane on the nights upon which the members met a lamp was hung out over the entrance to the court from fleet street the pragmatism and energy of their consultations are evident in some of their earliest laboursto promote inoculation electrical experiments on fourteen miles of wire near shooters hill ventilation apropos of gaol feaver discussion on cavendishs improved thermometers not all the experimenters were of london and not all of them lived in london but the city became the chief centre of that empirical philosophy and practical experiment which developed out of alchemical research the pragmatic spirit of london science must be emphasised in all these varied and various areas it is the spirit that has pervaded its learning ever since there were experiments in agriculture and in horticulture medicine became an experimental and progressive science and the example of the pestilence of led the members of the society to examine the defective architecture draining and ventilation of the capital sir william petty created the science of political arithmetic so that we might plausibly suggest london as the nurse of statistical enquiry it was another form of understanding and controlling the population yet in a city of commerce the introduction of statistics also had a financial advantage the board of customs in represented to the treasury the need they felt to collect certain basic material if they were able to make a balance of the trade between this kingdom and any part of the world newton himself spent many of his latter years as warden of the mint in which capacity he refined and ordered the currency of the kingdom he brought to the manufacture of coin all the precision and thoroughness of his experimental work thus creating the scientific economy which exists still in turn he became the prosecutor of anyone who defied his inexorable laws despatching to the gallows all who clipped the coins or counterfeited the currency science in london truly was power in the fields of induction and mathematical demonstration both relying upon a close observation of particulars the london genius was most successful john wallis placed the whole system of statics on a new foundation again according to macaulay while edmond halley investigated the principles of magnetism and the flow of the sea so from crane court in the city issued lines of thought which connected the earth to the sea and the sky it may seem fanciful to suggest that any one city can affect the cast of thought or the science of its inhabitants but voltaire himself announced that a frenchman arriving in london finds things very different in natural science as in everything else in paris they see the universe as composed of vortices of subtle matter in london they see nothing of the kind for a cartesian light exists in the air for a newtonian it comes from the sun in six and a half minutes your chemist performs all its operations with acids alkalis and subtle matters once more the theoretical spirit of parisian enquiry is implicitly opposed to the practical bent of london science where finds philosophy her eagle eye cowper wrote and then answered his own question in london where her implements exact with which she calculates computes and scans all distance motion magnitude and now measures an atom and now girds a world it is sometimes suggested that by the end of the eighteenth century the climate and pace of industrial development had shifted away from london to the manufacturing towns of the north but this is to misunderstand and certainly to underestimate the force of practical intelligence within the capital one of the founders of the royal society robert hooke was the direct inspiration behind advances in the technology of time while henry maudslays exceedingly accurate machine tools were produced in lambeth in john harrison came to london in order to develop his marine chronometer which for the first time fixed degrees of longitude that spirit was maintained by the mechanical engineers of the nineteenth century who in the workshops of lambeth produced the steamhammer and the automatic spinning mule lambeth was then still a centre of transformation yet in london the pursuit of knowledge was not confined to the search for technical proficiency from his lodgings in great marlborough street after his famous voyage charles darwin wrote that it is a sorrowful but i fear too certain truth that no place is at all equal for aiding one in natural history pursuits to this dirty smokey town after travelling around the world darwin considered london to be the most appropriate place for his research as if the whole of evolutionary nature could be viewed and studied there he wrote this in and his insight was confirmed fortyseven years later when the prime meridian of zero degrees longitude was established upon a brass rail in greenwich in true london tradition science also was turned into theatre with lectures and demonstrations all over the capital the early nineteenth century in particular witnessed a great public demand for scientific knowledge the london institution of moorfields the surrey institution of blackfriars bridge the russell institution in bloomsbury and the city philosophical society in dorset street were only some of the many clubs and societies devoted to disseminating the new understanding there were societies all over the city founded in the s and s among them geological astronomical zoological medicobotanical statistical meteorological and british medical in the capital there were also many inventors and theorists who were able to meet and to work together the contributors to scientific london in london world city remark that london was a crucial instrument for forging new specialist disciplines it was as if new commodities were being produced and traded in this intensely heated atmosphere bessemer developed his steelmaking process in st pancras while hiram maxim invented the machinegun in his clerkenwell workshop the pragmatism and practicality of london science were then disseminated into its teaching in the first university college in london was established in bloomsbury with specifically utilitarian aims its purpose was not to educate scholars and divines on the model of oxford and cambridge but to train engineers and doctors it was a true london institution its founders comprising radicals dissenters jews and utilitarians it is not at all surprising therefore that it should be infused with a radical egalitarian spirit which began with the inclusion of nonanglican students it became a university in opening its gates to women twelve years later and from the s creating evening classes for working londoners the university also began to teach science as a separate discipline and created the first faculty of science in there was also established a school of medicine which reached into practical areas as diverse as mathematics and comparative anatomy it was a progressive enquiring energy which animated all of these concerns it has been termed the energy of empire since the vast power and resourcefulness of nineteenthcentury london at the centre of the imperial world had somehow managed to infiltrate all aspects of its life in the early nineteenth century statisticians mathematicians and engineers again according to london world city saw the city as a potentially universal centre of calculation whence trade and machinery would link worldwide networks of british power charles babbage together with colleagues such as herschel established the astronomical society in during a meeting at the freemasons tavern in great queen street in his workshop babbage created the difference engine which is the harbinger of the modern computer and so it may be suggested that information technology itself was created in london in the process of invention he had employed precision engineers and of course skilled workmen so that once again the capital became the home of major technical innovation and technological progress london has often been apostrophised as the city of gold it is a home of golden dragons and golden cocks while the golden cross and golden ball on the dome of st pauls have become a symbol of londons energy on a summer morning when the shimmering brightness envelops the city in a haze and all is quiet then it might be transformed tis el doradoel dorado plain the golden city it is all before you its vistas unexplored and becomes in the words of wordsworth the great city an emporium then of golden expectations the golden city has been built out of the will and desire of a human community and that is why in the verse of we henley it burns so brightly and why trafalgar square the fountains volleying golden glaze shines like an angelmarket and as the sun descends in the secret agent the very pavement under mr verlocs feet had an oldgold tinge in that diffused light mr verloc was going westward through a town without shadows in an atmosphere of powdered gold this is a gleam of brightness in an otherwise dark novel and the effect is that of the alchemist creating gold out of base materials alchemy and science provide the seeds of light and knowledge in a dark city so that as it seemed to don juan looking at london from the heights of highgate each wreath of smoke appeard to him but as the magic vapour of some alchymic furnace dryden too had the same vision methinks already from this chymic flame i see a city of more precious mould now deified she from her fires does rise it is the magical energy of london visible in every one of its giant transformations like that after the great fire when empirical knowledge and practical genius helped to rebuild the city this magical energy survives still a fever of building a drawing by george scharf which illustrates the building of carlton house terrace in the early s part of nashs original grand design to embellish london note that the workmen are wearing hats chapter london will soon be next door to us from the middle of the eighteenth century london expanded in a fitful and almost feverish manner according to a cycle of profit and profiteering the metaphor of fever was taken up by henry kett who in suggested that the contagion of the building influenza has extended its virulence to the country where it rages with unabating violence the metropolis is manifestly the centre of the disease mansions daily arise upon the marshes of lambeth the roads of kensington and the hills of hampstead the chain of buildings so closely unites the country with the town that the distinction is lost between cheapside and st georges fields this idea struck the mind of a child who lived at clapham with so much force that he observed if they go on building at such a rate london will soon be next door to us by the time he grew to be a man his words had come to pass the hills of hampstead were in part threatened by the new road from paddington to islington upon which work began in it acted as a bypass avoiding the congerie of narrow and unpaved roads which led to the centre of the city and for a while was considered to be a northern perimeter road acting as a barrier between the city and the countryor rather between the city and the assortment of brickfields tea gardens orchard gardens cowyards tentergrounds allotments and sodden marshlike fields which were always a feature of the land immediately surrounding the capital but then the city almost in a bound travelled to its other side with the erection of somers town and pentonville camden town and kentish town the new road became a road within rather than outside the city and as such it remains the marshes of lambeth were invaded by a more deliberate act of policy designed to increase the speed of business within the city and to open up the capital to its outer regions until only london bridge acted as a conduit between the northern and southern areas of the thames the river itself was at the centre of all traffic but the construction of westminster bridge over a period of twelve years entirely changed the relationship between the northern and southern sections instead of being isolated and apart almost like different countries sharing the same border they became interrelated a new road was built from the bridge into lambeth for some half a mile where it then touched existing roads which were in turn extended and widened in order to create a freeflowing route for promoting the intercourse and commerce between both parts of the city in the process both kent and surrey became so accessible that much open country disappeared beneath streets and squares the experiment was so profitable that four other bridges followed at blackfriars vauxhall waterloo and southwark london bridge itself was stripped of its houses and shops in order to render it suitable for the faster movement of a new age everyone was going faster everything was going faster the city was growing faster too and the traffic within its bounds was moving ever more rapidly starting a momentum which has never stopped by the latter half of the eighteenth century the evidence of londons commercial power and future imperial status was already present it was about to burst its bounds completely and become the first metropolis of the world so almost by instinct the old boundaries and gateways were destroyed in a symbolic act of relinquishment london prepared for its future the roads of kensington then found the city to be advancing upon them in the early eighteenth century the area of mayfair south of oxford street and east of hyde park was established in a series of streets and squares in its immediate vicinity the portland estate laid out the territory north of oxford street cavendish square fitzroy square and portman square arose grosvenor square was completed in and at a size of six acres remains londons largest residential square it was followed by the building of berkeley square only three streets away so that the entire area was given a uniform discipline and appearance the idea of the square and its surrounding streets took possession of london the bedford estate in bloomsbury moved beyond its origin in covent garden to establish bedford square in and twentyfive years later this was succeeded by russell square tavistock square gordon square woburn square and their network of interconnecting terraced streets in its turn the portman estate established dorset square portman square and bryanston square square upon square giving london its now familiar appearance but the city did not stop there the districts of shoreditch whitechapel and bethnal green in the east continued their steady growth while south of the river areas such as southwark walworth kennington and st georges fields grew up beside the new thoroughfares fields were filled with terraced streets rather than corn the population itself expanded to meet londons demands so that a figure of in had reached over a million fifty years later it was not until that baptisms exceeded burials but from that time forward the momentum could not be stopped in each of the five succeeding decades after the population would rise by per cent by the end of the eighteenth century the city of london was only part of the city instead of being essentially london it had turned into an enclave within london this led to no diminution in its power the dispersal of its population and the attendant removal of various trades and occupations allowed it to focus its energies even more fiercely upon commercial speculations the city became purely a place of business it remained the financial capital of the world even if it was not in itself the capital of england for that purpose it was continually recreating itself in each generation many of the great livery halls were rebuilt or refaced the largest commercial enterprises private banks and insurance companies established their premises on a grand scale imitating or in some cases anticipating the construction of the bank of england and the stock exchange it truly became a city of mammon with precincts and labyrinths and temples devoted to that deity there was a new custom house a new excise office a new stocks market while sir john soane and george dance exercised all their gifts for a neoclassicism not untouched by an acquaintance with the mysteries of piranesi and of egyptian form the destruction of the old walls allowed more development upon the northern perimeters of the city where moorfields and finsbury circus were laid out the hospitals and prisons were rebuilt or refurbished although it is not clear which of the two institutions imitated the other we might speak of religious architecture such as hawksmoors wonderful if barbaric st mary woolnoth except that by this date christianity itself had little impact upon the momentum or atmosphere of the newly resurgent city but even as london grew it maintained and deepened its coherence there were road acts lighting acts and pavement acts the building act of had a greater effect upon london than any other legislative measure it standardised and simplified houses into four categories thereby recreating large areas in a uniform image it may not be too fanciful to suggest that this method of identifying and controlling london in the course of its immense expansion represented a means of purging all the excess and theatricality of the city in order to make it fit for its imperial destiny such an exercise in architectural uniformity however could never succeed london was too large to be dominated by any one style or standard of all cities it became the most parodic and the most eclectic borrowing architectural motifs from a score of civilisations in order to emphasise its own position as the grandest and most formidable of them all indian persian gothic greek and roman motifs vied for position along the same thoroughfare it says much for the heterogeneity of its development in this period for example that architects as unalike as robert adam and william chambers were working within a few hundred yards of each other on strikingly different projects which leave their mark upon london still chambers was presiding over somerset house while adam was working upon adelphi where adelphi had a light and extravagant aspect somerset house was solid and conservative in feeling one is the work of innovative genius the other of academic solemnity both architects found a place within the city the only successful and permanent attempt to bring uniformity and order to londons chaos was the grand scheme to link st jamess park in the south with regents park in the north with the creation of regent street and waterloo place it remains the single most important exercise in city planning within the metropolis that it worked is not in doubt the combination of the genius of john nash with shrewd speculation was perhaps unstoppable in such an opportunistic age and city nash formulated the plans for trafalgar square he created the conditions for piccadilly circus he designed the reconstruction of buckingham palace he laid out the terraces on the perimeter of regents park he created oxford circus london wrote prince pücklermuskau in is extremely improved now for the first time it has the air of a seat of government and not of an immeasurable metropolis of shopkeepers to use napoleons expression but this air of government was only achieved by demarcating poorer and richer areas in effect cutting off the rich from the sight and odours of the poor nash himself declared that he wished to create a line or barrier between the streets and squares occupied by the nobility and gentry and the narrow streets and meaner houses occupied by mechanics and the trading part of the community it has been suggested that nashs achievement was out of keeping with the history and atmosphere of the city but he was a londoner by birth probably homosexual who became prosperous through a legacy from a merchant uncle here was a man who understood in every sense the workings of the city from these roots sprang his genius for theatricality for example and it has been observed that the curve of regent street resembles that of an amphitheatre the great designs of trafalgar square buckingham palace and oxford circus have been in turn seen as a form of popular stageset combining all the energy and spectacle of london in a great work of cunning artifice when nash took advantage of the reversion of marylebone park to the crown in and fashioned regents park out of an undistinguished patch of land all his skills as a theatre designer were used to project a grand double circus with what was described as a national valhalla rising in the centre financial restrictions however made such a scheme implausible and impossible what emerged from the wreckage of nashs ambition were eight villas and the ring of terraces which still possess what sir john summerson has described as an extravagant scenic character dream palaces full of grandiose romantic ideals but behind the scenes comprising identical houses identical in their narrowness their thin pretentiousness their poverty of design he concludes that the terraces of the park are architectural jokes an odd combination of fantasy and bathos yet in that sense they convey the sheer vulgar theatricality and opportunism of the city and of nash himself that is why the great tourist attractions of buckingham palace and trafalgar square seem in a sense to be a joke upon their visitors themselves in other respects the pressures of commerce and property speculation have damaged nashs dream city beyond repair regent street had been first constructed on a purely commercial basis with the selling of prime sites along the road but what is born in commerce dies in commerce the famous colonnade lasted for thirty years before being removed on the grounds that business was being lost in its obscurity while the street itself was extensively remodelled in the s and s the dereliction or damage also suggests a more general truth about london where grand and largescale developments have rarely been successful the finest of londons public buildings like the bank of england are somehow secret and withdrawn as if not wishing to overstate their case in the same way grandiose projects failed because as andrew saint has observed in london world city any but the most pragmatic approach to planning was doomed to failure once again that note of pragmatism so intrinsic to the intellectual and social life of the capital is struck the improved london of the early nineteenth century had acquired a momentum of its own the national gallery the british museum the marble arch westminster palace the royal college of surgeons the law courts the screen and arch at hyde park corner the general post office at st martins le grand london university the inner and middle temples as well as various theatres hospitals prisons and gentlemens clubs completely changed the external aspect of london for the first time it became a public city the detailed drawings of george scharf throughout this period provide a significant account of the work itself a great mobile crane stands before a halfcompleted marble arch while a man in a top hat is perched upon a wooden scaffolding making notes a new portico is being constructed and scharf notes the iron rod which is being cased within brick to form a pillar plasterers are at work standing upon wooden stalls while two workmen strain upon a rope to raise a beam these are views of building sites which could have been taken in london in any period over the last six hundred years there is always building and rebuilding yet scharf emphasises the human scale of this new london before the advent of the victorian megalopolis he shows citizens in small groups or as couples rather than crowds people are seen talking from upstairs windows and scharf is very interested in particular trades and in the names of individual shops or shopkeepers yet he still manages in this compendium of local and specific detail to capture a sense of progress and renewal there is something distinctly and distinctively inspiriting in the air of these drawings the city had lost something of its old packed intensity but it had recaptured its sense of the marvellous talleyrand arriving in london in after an interval of thirtysix years described it as much more beautiful while an american visitor believed it to be a thousand times more beautiful a visiting italian general wrote in that london has become an exceedingly beautiful and magnificent city it is in short the leading capital of the world but had there been any concomitant improvement in the lives of its citizens some contemporaries believed that there was a true connection francis place the london radical and democratic reformer declared that the progress made in refinement of manners and morals seems to have gone on simultaneously with the improvement in arts manufactures and commerce it moved slowly at first but has been constantly increasing in velocity we are much better people than we were then in the s better instructed more sincere and kindhearted less gross and brutal this enthusiastic report may seem surprising in the light of subsequent denunciations of the victorian city by writers as diverse as engels and booth but it cannot be dismissed place was very close all his life to the actual conditions of the city and he had seen a clear diminution in mob violence open licentiousness and the intermittent savagery of ordinary life he was a moral as well as a social reformer and noticed with satisfaction an abatement of observable vice and squalor in fact the improvements with the new roads as well as the changes in transportation had a general and profound effect upon the nature of the city as one historian of london donald olsen has put it in the growth of victorian london the nineteenth century saw the systematic sorting out of london into singlepurpose homogenous specialised neighbourhoods strict social segregation became a prerequisite for success in any new development in addition the shift from multipurpose to singlepurpose neighbourhoods reflected the pervasive move towards professionalisation and specialisation in all aspects of nineteenth century thought and activity the generalisation is perhaps too broad since there continued to be areas where rich and poor were obliged to mingle but it hits upon an important truth it is the truth which francis place in part expressed albeit unwittingly the vices of the poor could no longer be seen and therefore there must have been an improvement in fact they had departed into areas of misery created by the slum clearances of the new city they had moved behind the scenes of the newly dramatised london chapter nothing quite like it of london areas there is no end the vibrancy of walthamstow the mournful decay of pimlico and mornington crescent the confusion of stoke newington the intense and energetic air of brixton the watery gloom of wapping the bracing gentility of muswell hill the excitement of canary wharf the eccentricity of camden town the fearfulness of stepney the lassitude of limehouse can all be mentioned in the vast oration of london every londoner has his or her own favourite location whether it be victoria park in hackney or rolling long lane in southwark although it must also be admitted that most inhabitants of the city rarely know or visit anywhere beyond their own neighbourhood most citizens identify themselves in terms of their immediate locale there is a passage in gk chestertons the napoleon of notting hill where he envisaged a city with its own assertive districts as for example clapham with a city guard wimbledon with a city wall surbiton tolling a bell to raise its citizens west hampstead going into battle with its own banner of the eponymous region of the book he writes there has never been anything in the world absolutely like notting hill there will never be anything quite like it to the crack of doom in this at least he will be proved correct where notting hill gate now stands a beacon was situated in the roman period part of a roman sarcophagus was found in st johns vicarage off ladbroke grove the districts name comes from a band of saxons sons of cnotta for years it remained in open countryside with a reputation for springs and healthy air there were in the eighteenth century however colonies of brickmakers and irish pigkeepers apparently marring the sylvan peace of the neighbourhood complaints were lodged but nothing ever done one of the peculiar characteristics of notting hill is that it was attached to the city but not of it and so was characterised by a mixed atmosphere at once urban and suburban hence its ambivalent air in the s for example the east end of notting hill high street was inhabited by private people foreigners adventurers or respectable confidential employés of westend commercial houses while almost fifty years later percy fitzgerald complained that the grand terraces and houses were mixed up with flashy shops and all the vulgar incidents of traffic a racecourse was opened in where kensington park gardens and ladbroke grove now meet it was known as the hippodrome and was advertised as a racing emporium more extensive and attractive than ascot or epsom it was not a success and from the s onward houses and villas were being constructed over the entire area so by degrees it assumed its present shape but not before a cycle of speculations and bankruptcies lent the neighbourhood another of its characteristic tones in the s james ladbroke tried but failed to develop the area in the boom of the s great developments were undertaken before the speculators went bankrupt in the bust of the s in the s notting hill was described in building news as a graveyard of buried hopes naked carcasses crumbling decorations fractured walls slimy cement all who touch them lose heart and money by the venture ever since that period there has been a persistent pattern of decay and recovery in the s for example there was a resurgence of activity and habitation but by the next decade some of the imposing novelty of the site had diminished as urban development began to hesitate and falter at earls court always a wilderness there was a resurgent tide in favour of notting hill which gathered strength in the s by the early decades of the twentieth century however the stucco mansions of kensington park gardens and its environs once more began to fade and peel the great houses were turned into flats by the s less than a century after they had been erected and in the place of what was once termed the upper middle class came viennese professors and indian students and bedsitter business girls this description is by osbert lancaster who lived in the area during the slow decline of its edwardian propriety in the late s and the s however notting hill declined into slumdom with broken windows and racketeering landlords during the s immigrants from the west indies congregated in the area like the irish before them which in turn led to riots in the s and early s precisely because of this mixed and heterogeneous past it became a haven for those who like the hippies of the period required a kind of louche informality in which to pursue their lives the peeling streets the grimy balconies were combined with the streetmarket along the portobello road to produce an atmosphere of happy dereliction in the s there were festivals here in miniature we see the passage of many different london cultures then again in one of the strange and instinctive processes of urban life the conditions of the area seemed slowly to change the harbinger of that change might be found in when large areas of notting hill were protected by a conservation act so that the original streets of the s and s became privileged territories beyond the reach of speculators and developers by the late s this special status began to attract back the wealthy londoners who had deserted the neighbourhood fifty years before the area was itself gradually restored to its former state of lambent stucco to walk down kensington park gardens in is to experience that wide thoroughfare as it had emerged years before the area in recent years has acquired a certain solidity and strength of purpose it is no longer as fluid and as heterogeneous as once it was situated between the bewildering cosmopolitanism of queensway where the tower of babel might once more be constructed and the mournful region of shepherds bush it is an enclave of quiet urban solidity accepting its past notting hill has incorporated it within its being so that now the summer notting hill carnival is a truly mixed urban celebration of course there are still areas of relative poverty and deprivation within its boundstrellick tower of the kensal estate for example dominates the northern skyline and lends an atmosphere of old and poor communal living to the market of golborne road within its shadow here too are the first intimations of the maze of west kilburn to the north of the harrow road but notting hill itself has retrieved its charm and good humour principally because it has come to terms with its destiny go to the northeast and discover mournful paddington which has always been blasted as a place of transit and of transience in that it resembles the other gateways into the city the area around the railway terminus at kings cross for example has acquired a wandering population which takes advantage of travellers and tourists who venture into the immediate streets the area around victoria station is anonymous and unhappy but paddington has a desolation all of its own it is a place of transit in more than one sense since one of its main sites was once the gallows of tyburn lord craven also donated some land now covered by craven gardens which if london should once more be touched by pestilence will be made available as a burial pit presumably the current inhabitants of craven gardens are not aware of this noble intention the hospital is beside the station and the gloomy brown brick exterior of the original institution still exudes in its own way the recognition of transit and mortality the message of paddington in the words of william blake which predate the railway and the hospital mournful everweeping seems to be that we are all travellers passing through if we travel further northeast over cato street where the conspirators met in over the then new road which is now the marylebone road and the euston road past the broken columns of the old euston arch in front of the modern station past bleak and windy kings cross past penton hill where the druids may once have met past the tribal trackway which exists beneath the modern layout of the angel we will arrive at islington the romans fought their battles there against boudicca there is evidence of a roman encampment at barnsbury and the area of kings cross was once known as battle bridge a now forgotten track hagbush lane exists beneath the liverpool road an ancient british settlement lies to the immediate southeast of islington green the saxon king aethelbert granted islington to the canons of st pauls hence the name canonbury and it appears in the domesday book that the ecclesiastical authorities owned approximately five hundred acres of territory fitzstephen depicts the area as fields for pasture and open meadows very pleasant into which the river waters do flow and mills are turned about with a delightful noise beyond them an immense forest extends itself beautified with woods and groves and full of the lairs and coverts of wild beasts and game stags bucks bears and wild bulls the theme of the waters here is significant since it dominated islingtons subsequent history as a source of health and refreshment the pursuit of sport and hunting in the area outside the confines of the city is again a persistent one so that for some thousand years it was a haven of relaxation and entertainment for those ordinarily trapped within the city in the time of henry ii reigned citizens played ball exercised on horseback and took delight in birds such as sparrow hawks goss hawks and in dogs for following the sports of the fields of iseldon in the sixteenth century stow described islington as a place of fields commodius for the citizens therein to walke shoote and otherwise to recreate and refresh their dulled spirits in the sweete and wholesome ayre immediately south of the angel fields were set aside for target practice on eighteenthcentury maps almost two hundred marks can be discerned with the most proficient archers being awarded titles such as the marquis of islington the marquess of clerkenwell and the earl of pancridge it was in islington that sir walter raleigh first smoked tobacco the site of his house later became an inn for the citizens seeking refreshment of another kind islington was famous for its hostelries among them the three hats copenhagen house white conduit house and the angel itself which gave its salubrious name to an entire district here also were sadlers wells islington spa the new wells the pantheon in spa fields the english grotto in rosoman street the london spa merlins cave hockleyinthehole bagnigge wells st chads well in grays inn road and pennys folly on the pentonville road the entire area was covered by tea gardens walks and entertainments charles lamb the great romantic antiquary of london settled here in and according to william hazlitt took much interest in the antiquity of merrie islington the ancient hostelries were also visited and he smoked his pipe and quaffed his nut brown ale at the old queens head the air of liberation which islington induced was still with lamb two years later when he remarked that it was like passing from life into eternity now when all is holyday there are no holydays pleasuring was for fugitive play days mine are fugitive only in the sense that life is fugitive freedom and life coexistent that is why there are so many ballads about islington the bailiffs daughter of islington and tom tom of islington among them for many centuries it remained a haven of carelessness but charles lambs residence colebrook cottage became attached to other houses then they became a terrace then became part of a row of terraces as london crept northward in the early s houses of a very small and slight character were built in the environs of colebrook cottage only to become slums in the s the northampton estate built cheap tenements on its vacant ground while sixteen years later the packington estate constructed a network of wide streets in the area which still bears its name soon the entire region was covered with terraces villas and the general ribbon development which characterised the tentacular stretch of london an issue of building news in named islington as an area of trumpery allotments which have been dealt out to builders and the closely packed streets and terraces which have arisen and all those who lived in these new terraces moved daily to the centre of their being dickens noticed them in one of his early sketches the early clerk population of somers and camden towns islington and pentonville are fast pouring into the city or directing their steps towards chancery lane and the inns of court middleaged men whose salaries have by no means increased in the same proportion as their families plod steadily along apparently with no object in view but the countinghouse knowing by sight almost everybody they meet and overtake for they have seen them every morning sundays excepted during the last twenty years but speaking to no one small office lads in large hats milliners and staymakers apprentices all of them can be imagined walking into the city acquiring a settled anonymity as they steadily approach it dickens was very interested in islington he placed several of his characters in that vicinity denominating most of them as clerks potters and smithers and guppy are all clerks of islington and pentonville for example as if those areas adjacent to the centres of finance and power had themselves a subsidiary clerkly function the more affluent londoners moved further out to sydenham or penge even as the poor travelled north so by stages islington itself became poor rows of terraced houses of two or three or four storeys can be seen in early photographs their grimy stucco is matched by the darkness of their brick and they seem to stretch on interminably in orwell depicted the area as having become one of vague browncoloured slums he was walking up a cobbled street of little twostorey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes there were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles in and out of the dark doorways and down narrow alleyways that branched off on either side people swarmed in astonishing numbers perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up this is taken from a novel of the future but the details are based directly on orwells observation of the streets beside essex road it is as if the dereliction had entered his soul and he had come to believe that london somehow will always be sordid and grimy and squalid islington will always be islington certainly it entered the postwar era in an impoverished state it has been recorded that three quarters of its households did not even have running water an inside lavatory nor a bath one resident recalled that we had sixteen people using one toilet islington once a village in the environs of london had been transformed into a central core of slum conditions a familiar pattern then reasserted itself swathes of victorian and georgian terraces were razed in order to accommodate councilhouse estates and tower blocks the urge to destroy however was quickly succeeded by the need to conserve islington may stand as representative of london in this respect where the fashion for wholesale redevelopment was displaced by a no less urgent desire for preservation and improvement it is as if an amnesiac had suddenly recovered his memory a process of gentrification then ensued whereby generally middleclass couples attracted by the prospect of improvement grants from the civic authorities of islington settled in the neighbourhood and began to restore or rejuvenate their properties they were the direct successors of those who had arrived in the s and s and in fact the newly refurbished streets acquired their original characteristics there were of course disadvantages the poorer locals were now congregated upon the housing estates of islington or had dispersed what has been lost in the process certainly that sense of belonging to a small patch of local territory however squalid disappeared or perhaps it is better to say that it had changed hands the poor colonised the area for a hundred years they had driven out the more affluent residents of islington in the s and s but now in turn they were being driven away but a larger pattern has also been introduced where there was once a rooted and identifiable community in islington there is now a greater sense of transience like the rest of london it has grown more mobile but also more impersonal another paradox has emerged in the process however emphasising the unique conditions of each urban area in the course of its present changes islington has reacquired its principal or original identity where once it was known for its inns and tea gardens it is now celebrated for its bars and restaurants along the central highway of upper street there are now proportionally more restaurants than in any other part of london with the possible exception of soho and so the area has regained its reputation for hospitality and conviviality which it possessed long before it ever became part of london the old presence lingers beneath every change of appearance the city road emanating from islington directly approaches the site of londons old wall before its arrival there it crosses old street where to the east shoreditch and spitalfields beckon these once forlorn areas still bear the marks of their past in the midseventeenth century shoreditch was a disreputable place frequented by courtesans the female prostitutes still ply their trade at the upper end of commercial street a dismal thoroughfare between the two areas while shoreditch high street is notorious for its strip pubs catering for local residents as well as gentlemen from the city who symbolically pass beyond the old walls of london through bishopsgate in order to indulge themselves in the late nineteenth century violent street gangs issued out of the slums of old nichol a congerie of streets around old nichol street which might have been named after old nick himself violence flares still a murder or a suicide awakens memories of the not so recent past the name itself derives from soerditch a ditch issuing into the thames but the idea of a sour ditch is suggestive the later addition of shore suggests something stranded or laid up in turn the name spitalfields detached from its origin in spital a house for the sick suggests spittlesomething spat out violently ejected thus it became a haven for refugees the wrong etymology is often accurate about the nature of an area so we may move on to the hunting grounds of soho soho or sohoe being the call of the huntsmen who originally rode across its fields now with its sex shops and strip clubs the hunt is on for another kind of game of all the regions of london this is the one that has most fully preserved its appearance gerrard street may have been transformed into the centre of chinatown but the house in which john dryden lived is still recognisable in soho every street is a memorial here is where marx lived here casanova here canaletto and here de quincey there are deeper continuities too since the area had a reputation for its cuisine long before it was ever populated in stow wrote of the conduit in soho fields that the lord mayor aldermen and many worshipful persons rode to the conduit according to custom and then they went and hunted a hare before dinner and killed her and thence went to dinner at the banqueting house at the head of the conduit where a great number were handsomely entertained by the chamberlain so the air of dining and conviviality has always been part of the neighbourhood on the same patch of ground where sixteenthcentury dignitaries ate the modern traveller can still dine at the gay hussar quo vadis or lescargot there was a parish located here by and in certain people were described as living at the brick kilns near soho but the area first began to flourish in the s when gerrard street old compton street greek street and frith street emerged as part of a development north of leicester fields a proclamation from the court dated as early as april forbade the erection of small cottages and other tenements in the windmill fields dog fields and the fields adjoining sohoe but as usual the social and commercial imperatives of the city overruled royal proclamations how soho itself acquired its raffish flavour is obscure the area just to its east beside st martins lane was already inhabited by artists or artisans who catered to the rich or the fashionable art studios and art schools also began to cluster there alongside the inevitable taverns and coffee houses but they did not directly affect soho itself a sudden influx of french residents was of more consequence in the area of newport market and old compton street it was remarked by maitland that many parts of the parish abound with french so that it is an easy matter for a stranger to fancy himself in france by over eight hundred of the empty and newly built houses had been filled with huguenots who characteristically transformed the ground floors into genuine french shops cheap cafés and restaurants like those near the barrier in paris so by degrees this emerging region of london came to be compared with the french city it maintained that ambience for more than years and as late as soho was still being described as a sort of petty france it was recorded that most of the shops are thoroughly french and they evidently have been established solely for the supply of the foreign colony here are french schools for the education of the young and wineshops and restaurants where an englishman who entered would be looked on with surprise perhaps the most notable institution in the early days of twentyfirstcentury soho is the york minster or french pub known colloquially as the french it is said to have been the meetingplace of the french resistance during the second world war again a small area of london no more than a few streets and a market has retained its traditional culture for more than three hundred years but the presence of the french immigrants in a place where the arrival of an englishman would be a surprise in turn created an odd air of strangeness or unfamiliarity which encouraged natives of other countries to feel more secure in its environs in certain respects it was not english of all quarters in the queer adventurous amalgam called london galsworthy wrote in the forsyte saga soho is perhaps least suited to the forsyte spirit untidy full of greeks ishmaelites cats italians tomatoes restaurants organs coloured stuffs queer names people looking out of upper windows it dwells remote from the british body politic from the start it was a mixed area both in terms of demography and of trade this district according to one handbook is also a principal rendezvous for foreigners in london many of whom here ply their avocations as artists and mechanics there were emporia of furniture acquired from various eras and various cultures curiosity shops filled with multifarious relics of the romans or the habsburgs musicalinstrument makers and printsellers china manufacturers booksellers and taverns where artists and literary gentlemen gathered modern institutions such as the french pub and the colony room club still attract poets and painters the phenomenon of transference from age to age is in certain respects inexplicable it may be that the previous reputation of an area attracts its new residents so that there is a kind of advertised continuity but this does not apply to other districts which simply flare and fade away or is it that an atmosphere of freedom and unfamiliarity first created by the huguenots liberated from the cruelty of their compatriots has continued to linger certainly immigrants arrived in their wake from russia and from hungary italy and greece in the churchyard of st annes soho there was a tablet with the following inscription near this place is interred theodore king of corsica who died in this parish december immediately after leaving the kings bench prison by the benefit of the act of insolvency in consequence of which he registered his kingdom of corsica for the benefit of his creditors he had accepted his crown in march but could not raise enough money to pay for his army so he travelled to london where finding himself in debt he was soon arrested and consigned to prison on his release on december he took a sedan chair to the house of a tailor and acquaintance in little chapel street soho but he died the next day and his funeral expenses were paid by an oilman in old compton street so a foreign king is buried in the middle of soho thus emphasising its reputation as a foreign land in the heart of london this penniless exile might almost be considered the true monarch of the area its reputation for heterogeneity and freedom was also associated with liberties of another sort and by the end of the eighteenth century it was notorious for courtesans a celebrated member of that order mrs cornelys arranged weekly assemblies in carlisle house on the south side of soho square there was a notice outside in which she begs the chairmen and hackneycoach drivers not to quarrel or to run their poles through each others windows which suggests that the spirit of disorder affected anyone who came within the parish in carlisle house were held masquerades and promenades which featured scantily dressed ladies in violation according to one observer of the laws and to the destruction of all sober principles mrs cornelys was one of those redoubtable london characters holding court to thieves and nobility alike who dominated all company with a quick wit and a loud if vulgar manner she was enterprising irrepressible charming and scathing in equal measure she created a great stir in the s and s until after the failure of one of her fashionable schemes she retired into private life she started selling asses milk in knightsbridge and in died in the fleet prison she was the very type of the london club hostess a figure so much larger than life that no onenot even the most drunken or aristocratic customer would dare to cross her kate hamilton and sally sutherland both managed dubious nighthouses of the s and kate was described as presiding as a sort of paphian queen over her scantily clad dancers there is a wonderful description of her weighing some twenty stone with a countenance that had weathered countless convivial nights mrs hamilton presented a stupendous appearance in the low cut evening dresses which she always wore from midnight to dawn she sipped champagne and with her foghorn voice knew how to keep her clients of both sexes in order her establishment was in leicester square which by the midnineteenth century had become associated with the delinquencies of neighbouring soho and her twentiethcentury successor was muriel belcher who ran the colony room club a drinking room in dean street she also kept her clients in order with a voice as piercing if not as loud as a foghorn and specialised in a form of obscene badinage which only the vulgar mistook for wit from its beginning in fact soho has been associated with demonstrative and sometimes difficult women in a lewd woman anna clerke was bound over for threteninge to burne the houses at soho for reasons unknown a once famous inn known as the mischief in charles street had as its sign a drunken courtesan straddling a mans back while holding a glass of gin with the legend shes as drunk as a sow inscribed beside her the female and male prostitutes of the area were well known by the middle of the nineteenth century once more the relative foreignness of the neighbourhood ensured that it would be the context for more relaxed sexual behaviour than in lombard street for example or in pimlico the proximity of the rookeries in st giles and elsewhere also meant that there was no shortage of fresh bodies for the clients only the recommendations of the wolfenden report in managed to keep the girls off the streets but they migrated instead to small rooms and attic spaces in the same area there were the argyll rooms laurents dancing academy the portland rooms and a score of other venues the nighthouses and flashhouses changed into nightclubs the penny gaffs and cheap theatres into striptease joints the gaming clubs into bars but despite the external alterations governed by time and fashion the essential atmosphere and purpose of soho have remained the same it was estimated that in there were some premises used as part of the sex industry more recent legislation has attempted to mitigate the business but at the beginning of a new century soho remains the centre of a flourishing trade in prostitution the spirit of the area has also asserted itself in another guise with old compton street becoming in the s and s a centre of gay pubs and clubs the narrow thoroughfares of soho are always crowded now with people in search of sex spectacle or excitement it has retained its queer adventurous spirit and seems a world away from the clubs of pall mall or the shops of oxford street which lie respectively to its south and north this is only to be expected however each area of london has its own unmistakable character nurtured through time and history together they resemble a thousand vortices within the general movement of the city it is impossible to look at them all steadily or envisage them as a whole because the impression can only be one of opposition and contrast yet out of these oppositions and contrasts london itself emerges as if it sprang into being out of collision and paradox in that sense its origins are as mysterious as the beginning of the universe itself londons rivers an engraving by charles grignion after francis hayman of the insalubrious fleet river since it was the last resting place of dead dogs corpses human waste and noxious refuse it is hard to believe that anyone actually swam in it chapter you cannot take the thames with you it has always been the river of commerce the watercressgrowers of gravesend the biscuitbakers and storeshippers of tooley street the shipchandlers of wapping the blockmakers and ropemakers of limehouse all owe their trades to the thames the great paintings of its business with its warehouses refiners breweries and builders yards all bear testimony to its power and authority its predominance within the city was understood long before the romans came copper and tin were transported along it as early as the third millennium bc as a result of commerce upon the river the area comprising london acquired by bc supremacy over the region of wessex that is perhaps why ceremonial objects were thrown into its waters where they lay hidden until recent archaeological discoveries the city itself owes its character and appearance to the thames it was a place of crowded wharfs and peoplepestered shores the water continually in motion with shoals of labouring oars the movement and energy of london were the movement of horses and the energy of the river the thames brought in a thousand argosies venetian galleys and threemasted ships from the low countries vied for position by the riverside while the water itself was crowded with wherries and ferries transporting the citizens from one shore to the other the other great commercial value of the thames lay in its fish and in the fifteenth century we read of barbille fflounders roaches dace pykes tenches all caught in nets with baits of cheese and tallow there were eels and kipper salmon mullet lamprey prawn smelt sturgeon and white bayte a vast range of vessels also plied their trades upon the water barges and barks sailed beside chalkboats they were joined by cocks or small work boats by pikers rushboats oysterboats and ferryboats by whelkboats and tideboats most londoners earned their living directly off the river or by means of the goods which were transported along it documents of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries reveal a host of thames employees from the conservators who were in charge of river safety to the tidemen whose work on embanking or building upon the river depended upon the state of the tide there were boatmen and chalkmen eelmen and baillies gallymen or garthmen ferriers and lightermen hookers and mariners petermen and palingmen searchers and shipwrights shoutmen and piledrivers trinkers and waterbailiffs and watermen there are recorded no fewer than fortynine ways of trapping or catching fish from nets and weirs to enclosures and wickerbaskets but there were many other activities such as the erection of dams and barriers the construction of landingstages and jetties the repairing of watergates and causeways quays and stairs we may call this the early stage of the thames when it remained the living centre of the citys development and trade but then it first touched the imagination of poets and chroniclers it became the river of magnificence used as a golden highway by princes and diplomats barges were freshly furnished with banners and streamers of silk while other boats were richly beaten with the arms or badges of their craft there were many covered with awnings of silk and silken tapestry while around them the wherries took their course heavily weighted with merchants or priests or courtiers this was a time when in the early years of the sixteenth century the oars of the london watermen might become entangled in water lilies while they kept stroke to the tune of flutes which made the water which they beat to follow faster the thames has always been associated with song and music beginning with the watermens chant of heare and how rumblelow or row the boat norman row to thy lemen dated respectively to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries more formal music beating not to the ebb and flow of the current but rather to its history could be heard on diplomatic or nuptial occasions when in henry viii and anne of cleves his fourth wife removed to westminster by water on their bridal day they were accompanied by instruments sweetly sounding in barges gorgeously garnished with banners pennons and targets richly covered on the previous ceremonial entrance of henrys second wife anne boleyn from greenwich into london in there were trumpets shawms and other divers instruments all the way playing and making great melody her welcome provided one of the richest pageants upon the thames ever recorded with the state barge of the mayor leading the procession adorned by flags and pennons hung with rich tapestries and ornamented on the outside with scutcheons of metal suspended on cloth of gold and silver it was preceded by a flat vessel rather like a floating stage upon which a dragon pranced about furiously twisting his tail and belching out wildfire here the freedom of the river inspires extravagance as well as music the barge of the mayor was followed by fifty other barges belonging to the trades and guilds all sumptuously decked with silk and arras and having bands of music on board here commerce makes its own music upon the water which was itself the conduit of its wealth it is clear however that the thames can harbour and accommodate supernatural forces as well as more conventional goods it was typically described as the colour of silver the great alchemical agent the silver streaming thames in spenser is followed by the silverfooted thamesis in herrick and the silver thames in pope herrick introduces nymphs and naiads but his central tone is one of mournful regret upon being forced to abandon the river in leaving london for the countryno more sweet evenings of summer bathing no more journeys to richmond kingston or hampton court no more departures and landing here or safely landing there drayton invokes the silver thames also and uses the familiar metaphor of a clearest crystal flood where pope describes old father thames whose shining horns diffused a golden gleam it has often been suggested that rivers represent the feminine principle within the general masculine environment of the city but with the thames this is emphatically not the case it is the old father perhaps in a somewhat menacing or primeval way equivalent to william blakes vision of nobodaddy it looked from a distance as if it were a forest of masts there were approximately two thousand ships and boats each day upon the water as well as three thousand of the then notorious watermen who transported goods and people in every direction the pool of london the area between london bridge and the tower was filled to capacity with barges and barks and galleons while a map of the middle sixteenth century shows boats moored beside the various stairs which were the transportation stops of the capital upon this map the streets are depicted as almost devoid of activity while the river is a hive of business it was a pardonable exaggeration designed to emphasise the paramount importance of the thames there is a london story which is appropriate one sovereign more than usually irate about the reluctance of london to subsidise his adventures threatened to move his court to winchester or oxford the mayor of london replied your majesty may with ease move yourself your court and your parliament wheresoever you wish but the merchants of london have one great consolationyou cannot take the thames with you when wenceslaus hollar arrived in england in december he travelled to london by barge from gravesend he was given lodgings in arundel house beside the thames so that his first and earliest views were of the river his sketches and etchings are filled with its breadth and light while its continual activity spills over upon its banks and embarkation points the wherries and barges are crowded seeming to skim the water before the small quiet buildings which line its shores it is the river which breathes life within his great panorama of the city the streets and houses seem deserted as if all london were gathered by the riverside the names of each wharf are prominently displayedpaulus wharfe queen hythe the cranes stiliard cole harbour the old swanwhile their stairs and landingstages are busy with the activity of tiny human figures the great sheet of bright water is lent depth and interest by the numerous craft some of which are named the eel ships lie among barges carrying vegetable produce while small boats with two or three passengers voyage from shore to shore below london bridge many great ships are moored while around them teems the marine business of the port in the righthand corner of this engraving the figure of a water god father thames holding an urn from which pour a multitude of fish completes an image of the river as the source of power and life just as its swans were in the prechristian era under the protection of apollo and of venus so the river itself lies under divine tutelage it is of some significance too that the classical deity depicted by hollar as pointing to the cartouche of london is mercury who is the god of commerce hollars prospect is taken from a high point south of the river and just west of london bridge it was a real location on top of st mary overy now southwark cathedral but it also became a conventional or idealised vantage point an earlier etching by claes jansz visscher takes approximately the same position but from a theoretical high locality further westward this allowed him to suggest a great central sketch of the busy river and he emphasised the point with the latin inscription of london emporium que toto orbe celeberrimum the most famous market in the entire world the power and persuasiveness of this slightly fictionalised topography affected many later artists and engravers who kept on borrowing each others mistakes and false perspectives in their continuing effort to celebrate the thames as representing the commercial destiny of the city just as the river had been the great subject of sixteenthand seventeenthcentury london poetry so it became the central theme of london painting as trade and commerce increased so did the significance of the river it has been estimated that the volume of business grew three times between and there were thirtyeight wharves on both sides of the river from the bridge to the tower and nineteen further below it has been estimated that even by the london quays were handling per cent of the entire countrys imports and per cent of its exports within the rivers banks sailed tea and china as well as cotton and pepper from the east indies from the west indies came rum and coffee sugar and cocoa north america brought to the thames tobacco and corn rice and oil while the baltic states offered hemp and tallow iron and linen when daniel defoe wrote of trade flowing in and out of london he was using the river as a metaphor for londons life it rare to find a picture of london that does not contain a glimpse of the river there are views from westminster pier and from lambeth as well as from southwark three very popular collections of river prints were published in the latter part of the eighteenth centuryboydells collection of views irelands picturesque views of the thames and boydells history of the thames in which the most usual views were those west of london bridge where the newly renovated city was matched by images of a dignified and elegant river of course canaletto is the master of these riverscapes in which he creates a city aspiring towards magnificence two companion portraits in particular the thames from the terrace of somerset house westminster in the distance and the thames from the terrace of somerset house the city in the distance take the measure of london as essentially a noble european city it seems likely that canaletto came to london in the s specifically to paint the recently constructed westminster bridge and to give an aesthetic imprimatur to the citys latest public building but his is an idealised city and an idealised river the sky is free of fog and soot so that the buildings shine with expressive clarity the river itself is luminous its surface iridescent while the activity upon it is so calm and bright that it is no longer a picture of commerce but of contentment a more direct and intimate depiction of the eighteenthcentury thames is found in what is generally classified as the british school but might as well be termed the london school william marlows fresh wharf london bridge and the london riverfront between westminster and the adelphi for example acquire much of their strength from their detail the view of fresh wharf shows the work of the wharf with its wooden barrels and olive jars and bales of merchandise being inspected or unloaded scaffolding and fencing on the north side of london bridge are an indication that the shops and houses which were once located there have been only just removed the painting of the london riverfront also acquires its power from its specificity here can be seen buckingham street and adam street together with the tower and chimneys of the york buildings waterworks company in the foreground are displayed all the multifarious activities of a messy and grubby river a coal barge is being unloaded by men in dirty smocks while a woman surrounded by a pile of baskets is being ferried towards the shore it was in just such a place and among just such activity that the youthful imagination of turner born in in maiden lane first moved towards the thames in modern painters john ruskin describes the painters early life as involved intimately with the working of citycommerce from endless warehouses towering over thames to the back shop in the lane with its stale herrings here he ventured into the world of barges and ships that mysterious forest below london bridgebetter for the boy than wood or pine or grove of myrtle turner was in other words a child who derived his inspiration from the city and its river rather than from more conventional and pastoral settings how he must have tormented the watermen ruskin goes on to suggest beseeching them to let him crouch anywhere in their bows quiet as a log so that only he might get floated down there among the ships and by the ships and under the ships staring and clamberingthese the only quite beautiful things in the world the great world itself was for turner contained within the city and its river the thames flowed through him giving him light and movement as a child he walked down from his birthplace in maiden lane and crossed the strand to wander among the myriad small streets which led to the river as an old man he died looking over the thames in cheyne walk for most of the intervening years he lived on or within easy reach of its banks so we must consider turner more than canaletto or whistler as the true child of the riveror rather one through whom the spirit of the river emerged most clearly and abundantly on certain occasions he clothed it with classical beauty invoking the gods and nymphs which once haunted its banks while in other paintings he depicted all the immediate and instinctive life of its waters one of his early sketches was of old blackfriars bridge where he emphasised the tide of the river by painting the piers of the bridge as if they were still dark and wet an early watercolour of old london bridge exhibited the same intense and absorbed observation here the water wheel of the london waterworks company is the central focus with the force of the water rushing upstream at precisely twentyfive to eleven according to the clock of st magnus the martyr just beyond the bridge vessels were moored side by side with each ship being assigned its place on its arrival barges or smaller boats came alongside in order to receive the goods which were then rowed upstream to the various official quays and wharves it was a cumbersome procedure given the general overcrowding of the pool and one which obviously led to theft and dishonest dealing on a large scale as a result of various parliamentary inquiries however a decision was eventually taken to build proper docks where cargo could be more expeditiously handled and enclosed so began the great scheme of the wet docks in the west india dock company act was passed and the whole isle of dogs began its transformation into its home it was followed by the london dock at wapping the east india dock at blackwall and the surrey dock at rotherhithe it was the largest single privately funded enterprise in the history of london great fortresslike structures with gates and high walls were built beside what were essentially artificial lakes covering some three hundred acres of water the isle of dogs formerly a wasteland of marsh was turned into something like an elegant prison island the sketches and aquatints of a contemporary artist william daniell show grand avenues of brick warehouses a new road was built connecting the docks to the city of london from aldgate to limehouse hundreds of houses were demolished in its path and it entirely changed the aspect of east london the commercial road was in that sense aptly named since this transformation of the city was done solely in the name of profit the foundation stone of the west india dock was inscribed with the motto an undertaking which under the favour of god shall contribute stability increase and ornament to british commerce further changes followed with the building of the regents canal to connect the docks with the greater world by means of a waterway going westward until it met the grand union canal at paddington basin once again the city was opened up to more transport and traffic the whole enterprise was considered at the time to be an almost visionary undertaking and the apotheosis of successful commercialism the tobacco warehouse at wapping was celebrated for covering more ground under one roof than any public building or undertaking except the pyramids of egypt many of these wapping warehouses were the work of daniel asher alexander who also built the huge prisons of dartmoor and maidstone we may see here the association between money and the nature of power one architectural historian has compared the edifices of alexander with the architectural engravings of piranesi while coleridge turned the plates of the opere varie and young de quincey drugged himself into piranesian frenzy sir john summerson wrote in georgian london alexander built these reminiscences of the carceri into gaols and warehouses here money and power are given visionary or mythic potential the drawings and engravings which display the dock works in progress also command grand vistas and vast numbers of workmen to emphasise the scope of the enterprise there were crowds when the work was completed crowds when the waters of the thames were allowed to flow into the basins crowds when the first vessels were admitted these were schemes of immensity and resembled the hydraulic works of ancient river civilisations suggesting that londons great riverine adventure revived memories of ancient empires the docks are impossible to describe verlaine wrote in they are unbelievable tyre and carthage all rolled into one he and his companion rimbaud spent hours in the vast region noting the myriad goods and the myriad types of humanity jostling together they heard strange languages spoken enid starkie wrote in her biography of rimbaud and saw printed on the bales of goods mysterious signs that they could not read james mcneill whistler is generally considered to be the painter who evokes the poetry of the thames when it is subdued by mist and occluded light but that opinion neglects half of his achievement as a painter of the river in his early sketches of the thames between tower bridge and wapping the central images are of wharves and warehouses where work and trade are the persistent essential london element these etchings in fact elicited a remark from baudelaire that they manifested the profound and complex poetry of a vast capital here the experience of confusion is compounded by the sense of mysteryof something living and alienthat lies at the heart of the citys life this is also the effect manifested in gustave dorés engravings of the docks where the carters and the porters the sailors and labourers become darkly anonymous figures tending to the trade of london like ancient votaries the warehouses and custom houses are generally enmeshed in shadow and chiaroscuro like the thick netting of sails and masts which dominates the foreground fitful gleams can be seen upon the dark water black with coal blue with indigo brown with tides white with flour stained with purple wine or brown with tobacco these are the ranges of colours which doré knew at first sight to be one of the grand aspects of your london again his scenes conjure up images of piranesi with the rigging and the spars and the ropes and the land bridges and planks blending together to form a picture of endless turmoil a whole people toil at the unloading of the enormous ships another french observer gabriel mourey wrote swarming on the barges dark figures dimly outlined moving rhythmically fill in and give life to the picture in the far distance behind the interminable lines of sheds and warehouses masts bound the horizon masts like a bare forest in winter finely branched exaggerated aerial trees grown in all the climates of the globe since the docks had become one of the wonders of creation many travellers felt obliged to visit them it was necessary to obtain a letter of introduction for the captain of each dock and then hire a boat from one of the stairs to take advantage of the ebbing tide you see shipping at anchor on both sides many dutch danes swedes with licences i suppose and many americans this is from the diary of a french visitor a german had pronounced upon the same subject in it is an area of restless activity he wrote of constant noise and of the hubbub of people broad quays large splendid warehouses like palaces this visitor also commented that nearby rural pleasures seem to be very far away since those pleasures at greenwich and gravesend were themselves upon the thames the sheer imposition of the citys trading machinery seemed to have obliterated their presence when prince herman pücklermuskau visited the docks in he conceded astonishment and a sort of awe at the greatness and might of england everything is on a colossal scale with sugar enough to sweeten the whole adjoining basin and rum enough to make half england drunk he might have commented too that nine million oranges arrived each year together with twelve thousand tons of raisins the peripatetic prince had just visited the great breweries of the city and after his journey to the docks he went to a freakshow so the spectacles of london merge into an unnatural phantasmagoria the history of the docks is in fact the central story of the commercial thames in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it is the story of a riverside thoroughfare busy for years in commercial road and thames street and a score of narrow streets between them descending to the riverside there were wagons and vans miles lane ducks foot lane and pickleherring street were filled with the sound of carts horses cranes and human voices mingling with the whistles of the railway on the banks themselves there was a profusion of commercial activity with factories and warehouses approaching as close to the water as they dared while its wharves and mills and landingstages pulsated with the energies of human life and activity further upriver between southwark bridge and blackfriars bridge the riverside scene subtly changed the warehouses and houses here were older and more dilapidated they leaned towards the river narrow and lopsided while between them were the openings of little alleys through which sacks and barrels were taken from the river into the city by ludgate a huge steam flourmill could be seen while on the other bank lay a whole range of factory chimneys this was a true avenue of commerce with its institutions on both sides but there was also less serious business upon the thames there were halfpenny steamers penny steamers and twopenny steamers going to greenwich or gravesend ramsgate and margate there was a dover boat and a boulogne boat an ostend boat and a rhine boat there were coasters to ipswich yarmouth and hull and steamboats to southampton plymouth and lands end there were slower boats which made the journey to kew richmond and hampton court complete with musical bands then beyond the shoreline itself lay a whole host of commercial properties dependent upon the river and its tidesship yards sailors lodgings and public houses marine stores the hovels of porters apple stalls and oyster shops waiting for custom the whole panoply of street life attended the river then with a group of sailors getting out of hansom cabs to descend upon a public house a breakdown of a wagon in the streets attracting a crowd of spectators the endless chaff of speech resounding against the walls and bridge go it i can come it slap she can be very choice by the port and docks of london gave employment to a hundred thousand people and carried thirtyfive million tons of cargo within their seven hundred acres there were in addition almost two thousand riverside wharves in this period too heavy industries such as gas production and food processing clustered around the river as if in homage to its ancient mercantile past other industries such as timber and chemicals made use of the regents canal and the river lea as avenues to and from the thames in the following decade the business of the river was amplified by rapid handling methods which lifted cargo by forklift trucks and fastmoving cranes but by the s the equally rapid changes in the industrial process left the docks almost literally high and dry the new phenomenon of containerisation whereby goods were transported in vast boxes from ship to truck precluded the system of warehousing the vessels were too large for the original early nineteenthcentury docks to handle the docks are silent now and within memory the great buildings of the early nineteenth century have become a wasteland the east india dock closed in while the london dock and st katherines dock followed just two years later the west india dock survived until but by then the active and busy life of the region seemed to have gone for ever the economy of the east end was severely depleted and unemployment among the population reached very high levels yet out of this dereliction ten years later rose the shining edifices and refurbished warehouses known as docklands confirming that pattern of deliquescence and renewal which is at the heart of londons life as mrs cook said of the thames in highways and byways of london nothing destroys antiquity like energy nothing blots out the old like the new in place of a derelict st katherines wharf a new hotel and a world trade centre were constructed the latter at least an appropriate edifice beside the ancient river which had for two thousand years carried the trade of the world the restoration of other dock areas continued in a similar manner although the greatest scheme of all was the regeneration of what became known as the east thames corridor between tower bridge and sheerness there will be no diminution in the mysterious ability of the commercial thames to attract money and enterprise in the twentyfirst century the building of great offices upon the isle of dogs can be compared only with the original development of the west india dock upon the same site in both cases that of and that of the enormous scale of the enterprise was noted in typical london fashion both giant works were funded by the private money of speculators and businesses with discreet public help in the nature of taxincentives and on both occasions new forms of transport had to be provided the docklands light railway in its size and character is the late twentiethcentury equivalent of the commercial road on the western quay of the brunswick dock built in the late eighteenth century stood a great masthouse of some feet which for many years dominated and symbolised the area as one of marine commerce and londons maritime power now only a little distant the canary wharf tower fulfils a similar function in the celebration of power and commerce the thames runs softly or powerfully according to the tidal currents and its dark magniloquent song is not over chapter dark thames from early times it was a river of the dead to which the bodies of the local population were consigned the number of human skulls found in chelsea has given it the name of our celtic golgotha as joseph conrad said of another stretch of the thames and this also has been one of the dark places of the earth the derivation of its very name preceltic in origin is tamasa dark river how can so many influences and associations be denied when in modern times lonely and unhappy people are often to be seen staring down into its turbulent depths the german poet heinrich heine in described the black mood which once came over me as toward evening i stood on waterloo bridge and looked down on the water of the thames at the same time the most sorrowful tales came into my memory the river has embraced many such tales as the old dead houses along its banks might testify here were brought the bodies of those who in the words of the ubiquitous posters were found drowned three or four suicides or accidents every week were laid upon a shelf or within a wooden shell to await the attentions of beadle and coroner heine went on to declare that i was so sick in spirit that the hot drops sprang forcibly out of my eyes they fell down into the thames and swam forth into the mighty sea which has already swallowed up such floods of human tears without giving them a thought it might be said that the river had swallowed them already the tollkeepers upon the bridges were well known for their willingness to discuss the suicideshow many they were how difficult to stop them how difficult indeed to find them once they jumped the river can in that sense become a true emblem of londons oppression it can carry away all of lifes hopes and ambitions or deliver them up quite changed the river banks mark that point where the stone of the city and the water meet in perpetual embrace with the scattered debris of ships and urban waste mingling together here are found sheets of metal planks of rotten wood bottles cans ash bits of rope pieces of board of no identifiable purpose or origin the river also affects the fabric of the city with what dickens described in our mutual friend as the spoiling influences of waterdiscoloured copper rotten wood honeycombed stone green dank deposit there were small communities beside it which became a picture of urban dereliction the area of deptford was described in the nineteenth century as quite the worst part of the great citys story it is a record of that citys decay when its commercial life has departed with the muddy melancholy banks the desolation of empty silent yards this in the words of blanchard jerrold was the dead shore yet not so dead that there were not inhabitants of the area living off the detritus which the thames offered these were the people of the river they lived too in shadwell the well of shadows here in the early twentieth century the houses of the people are square and black and low the walls of storages are sheer and blind upon the narrow streets the darkness of the river against the darkness of the surrounding buildings renders it invisible on the other bank close to rotherhithe can be found jacobs island which was also black with the dust of colliers and the smoke of closebuilt lowroofed houses where once the bright water reflected and illuminated the brightness of the buildings along its banks in the nineteenth century darkness called to darkness jacobs island too was the filthiest the strangest the most extraordinary of the many locations that are hidden in london wholly unknown even by name to the great mass of its inhabitants it is those elements of anonymity and of secrecy which the river accommodates within itself conrad compared the buildings that lined the shores to the matted growths of bushes and creepers veiling the silent depths of an unexplored wilderness they hide the depths of londons infinitely varied vigorous seething life dark and impenetrable at night like the face of a forest in the london waterside sometimes it becomes almost too black and sad to bear examination the author of london nights stephen graham describes his pilgrimages within the long strange passages under the thames in east london where one is descending one is going back one is bearing all london just as heine spoke of his instinctive and intuitive sorrow at the sight of the dark river so in stephen grahams book the thames itself and all its submerged secrets told of an enigma which would never be solved the enigma of londons sorrow her burden her slavery the river has brought london money and power but at the cost of the citys being enslaved to those insidious principles one late twentiethcentury writer iain sinclair has described the thames in his novel downriver as breathless cyclic unstoppable it offers immersion blindness a poultice of dark clay to seal our eyes for ever from the fear and agony of life passions reduced to silt no wonder the watermen of the thames from the thirteenth century to the nineteenth were known for their insulting and foul language the violent and blasphemous abuse they used was known as waterlanguage to which anyone could be subject monarchs were often reviled in this manner when they took to the water and hv morton in in search of london notes that remarks which on land would have been treasonable were regarded as a joke upon the thames it has even been suggested that handels watermusic was composed in order to drown the torrent of abuse that would have greeted the new king george i during his first riverprogress it may be that the antiquity of the thames has given its watermen licence to speak without fear in that sense the river can be considered the essence of that radical and egalitarian temper so often associated with london but that sense of darkness continually moving upon the face of the water also acts as a toughening and coarsening presence for all those who work there nathaniel hawthorne wrote of the muddy tide of the thames reflecting nothing and hiding a million of unclean secrets within its breasta sort of guilty conscience as it were unwholesome with the rivulets of sin that constantly flow into it when samuel johnson gave the injunction to boswell to explore wapping as one way of understanding the wonderful extent and variety of london he could not have guessed the curious construction that might have been applied to his words in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by the early decades of the twentieth century wapping was as much blasted by decay as shadwell or jacobs island where the banks of the seine are open and approachable there are stretches of the thames which actively deter visitors the area of wapping was itself hard to find with its high street running beneath the great walls of the old warehouses while the adjacent streets seemed to wish to conceal themselves behind gasworks and tenements it had always been a lawless area beyond the jurisdiction of the city but its dereliction at the beginning of the century was also an echo of the shame and waste of the shorttime labouring system at the docks crowds of men seeking work would gather outside the gates while only a few were ever selected by the foremen the rest slunk back to that life of poverty drink and oblivion so well documented by charles booth as well as sidney and beatrice webb indeed it is a sight to sadden the most callous according to henry mayhew to see thousands of men struggling for one days hire to look in the faces of that hungry crowd is to see a sight that must be ever remembered for weeks many have gone there and gone through the same strugglethe same cries and have gone away after all without the work they had screamed for so the thames the begetter of commerce is also the most visible harbour for the misery which commercial principles can impose in the forlorn graveyard of st georges in the east one of the unhappy and illfavoured places of london over many generations lay the sailors women inured to immorality from childhood rotten with disease wapping was also a place of death at execution dock where those accused of crimes upon the high seas were summarily despatched into eternity in the police station at wapping was kept what has been described as one of the saddest books in the world it is a journal of the narratives of attempted suicides with the events and circumstances which led each towards the river the author of unknown london walter george bell wandering through the area in observed the reeking drink shops inexpressible in their squalor and dirt the natural home for every kind of abomination with the inner recesses of the hive being a gloomy slum area so we may take to heart samuel johnsons injunction to explore wapping in order to understand london chapter they are lost there are other rivers of london which lie concealed encased in tunnels or in pipes occasionally to be heard but generally running silently and invisibly beneath the surface of the city to name them in order west to eaststamford brook the wandle counters creek the falcoln the westbourne the tyburn the effra the fleet the walbrook neckinger and the earls sluice the peck and the ravensbourne it has always been said that enchantment is bought in the burying alive of great waters yet the purchase may be a perilous one the lost rivers can still create stench and dampness the fleet river at times of storm can still reach beyond its artificial containment and flood basements along its route at its source in hampstead it was the expediter of agues and fevers the valleys of these rivers many now converted into roads or trainlines were subject to fog as well as damp according to the author of the lost rivers of london nicholas barton rheumatism was unusually common both sides of counters creek from shepherds bush to chelsea while the london ague of the seventeenth century has been suggestively associated with streams and rivulets now sunk beneath the earth the lost rivers may provoke allergies also one recent investigation of patients in london hospitals revealed that out of the allergic patients ie per cent lived within yards of a known watercourse while among asthmatics out of the were living within yards of a watercourse in most cases the buried tributaries of the thames the reasons for this strange correlation are still unknown although those who understand the various powers of london places may have their own theories but the enchantment white or black does not end there a study published in the geography of london ghosts by gw lambert has found that approximately per cent of these disturbances occurred in houses significantly close to watercourses where perhaps the spirit as well as the sound of buried waters may be asserting themselves we may take the fate of the fleet river as characteristic as befits an ancient river it has gone by many names it was christened the fleet in its lower reaches from the anglosaxon term for a tidal inlet in its upper reaches it was known as the holebourne and in its middle section as turnmill brook it has in a sense been the guardian of london marking the boundary between westminster and the city from ancient times it has always been used as part of londons defences during the civil war for example great earthworks were built on either bank of all the citys lost rivers therefore it is the one which is best documented and most often depicted it has shared in the defilement of london as a repository of its discarded and forgotten objects an anchor was discovered as far north as kentish town which may provide some indication of its width and depth at this far point but more generally it has been the last resting place for the more local and immediate items of urban existencekeys daggers coins medals pins brooches and the detritus of such riverine industries as tanning it needed continually to be cleansed of its mud and general filth so the scouring of the river took place every twenty or thirty years those who wished to rail against london and all its squalor inevitably chose the fleet river as their example it epitomised the way in which the city fouled water once sweet and clear it carried the savour of each street readily identifiable it was full of dung and dead things it was london in essence the greatest good that i ever heard it did was to the undertaker ned ward wrote who is bound to acknowledge he has found better fishing in that muddy stream than ever he did in clear water the fleet like the thames its father was a river of death it has always been an unlucky river once it moved through the regions of kentish town and st pancras melancholy still with the touch of the water then at battle bridge it entered the pleasure grounds of giant despair according to william hone where trees stand as if not made to vegetate clipped hedges seem willing to decline and weeds struggle weakly upon unlimited borders it then moved around clerkenwell hill and touched the stones of the coldbath prison passed saffron hill whose fragrant name concealed some of the worst rookeries in london and entered the path of turnmill street the vicious reputation of which has already been chronicled then it flowed down into chick lane later known as west street which was for many centuries the haven of felons and murderers the river here became the dumping ground of bodies slain or robbed when dead drunk once more it became the river of death before flowing in front of the noxious fleet prison prisoners died of its stench and of the diseases which it carried with it in the valley of the fleet wrote a doctor in and in its stinking lanes there died most in london and were soonest inflicted and were longest continued as twice since i have known london i have marked it to be true in later testimony quoted in the lost rivers of london it was revealed that in every parish along the fleet the plague stayed and destroyed it might be asked why the area was always so fully populated therefore were it not for the fact that the river seemed to draw certain people towards its banks by some form of silent contagion it attracted those who were already dirty and silent and evilsmelling as if it were their natural habitat it was treacherous too in its natural state in stormy weather it was liable to sudden increase of volume causing inundation of its surrounding areas at times of thaw or in periods of heavy rain it became a dangerous torrent tearing down streets and buildings the deluge of carried away many citizens as well as their houses and sheds in the fifteenth century the parishioners of st pancras were moved to plead that they could not reach their church when foul ways is and great water every attempt to render it clean or noble failed after the great fire when the wharves along the thames were utterly destroyed with all their merchandise within them its banks were raised upon brick and stone while four new bridges were constructed to maintain its formal harmony but the refurbishment of the new canal as it was then called was not successful the waters once more became sluggish and noxious while the neighbouring streets and banks continued their notorious lives as harbours for thieves pimps and malingerers so within fifty years of the grand development the river itself was bricked over it is almost as if it represented a flow of guilt which had to be concealed from public view the city literally buried it in it was bricked in from fleet street to holborn bridge and then thirtythree years later it was bricked in from fleet street to the thames at the beginning of the next century its northern reaches were buried underground so that no trace of this once great guardian of london remained yet its spirit did not die in it blew up its rancid and foetid gas trapped within brick tunnels bursting out into the streets above three posthouses were swept away by a tidal wave of sewage and a steamboat was crushed against blackfriars bridge the waters of the fleet ditch then actively hampered the efforts to construct an underground railway beneath it its waters filled the tunnels with dark and fetid liquid and for a while all work was abandoned it is now employed only as a storm sewer with its outfall into the thames by blackfriars bridge but it still manifests its presence in storms it may still flood the roadway while building works upon its old course have regularly to be pumped out so the waters from ancient streams and wells collect themselves in their old courses and run along the familiar beds of the now enclosed main rivers the rivers themselves are not wholly dead then and occasionally emerge into the light the course of the westbourne river can be observed rushing through a great iron pipe above the platform of sloane square underground station the tyburn is also carried in great pipes at the tube stations of baker street and victoria in february the tyburn was observed flowing at the bottom of a bomb crater the westbourne was not covered until the lost rivers of london reveals that in meard street soho is a grate in the basement beneath which waters can be seen running in a southward direction the phenomenon is mysterious but it has been suggested that this water is pursuing the course of a seventeenthcentury sewer and has created an unknown stream as nicholas barton has put it once a channel has been made they cling to it with great persistence it raises the possibility of other streams and tributaries still flowing beneath the streets of the city replete with their own underground ghosts and nymphs under the ground a portrait of a sewerhunter taken from henry mayhews london labour and the london poor theirs was a dangerous and despised occupation but the city has always been characterised by the search for profit of any kind chapter what lies beneath there are always rumours of a world under the ground underground chambers and tunnels have been reported one linking the crypt of st bartholomew the great with canonbury another running a shorter distance between the priory and nunnery of clerkenwell there are extensive catacombs in camden town beneath the camden goods yard roman temples have been discovered within hidden london statues of ancient deities have been found in a condition which suggests that for reasons unknown they were deliberately buried at all hallows barking a buried undercroft and arch of a christian church were constructed with roman materials a cross of sandstone was also found with the inscription werhere of saxon date it is somehow strangely evocative of we are here lost beneath cheapside and found only after the bombing of london was the figure of the dead christ laid horizontally in a stratum of london soil evidence of the passage of generations themselves buried in the clay and gravel was found on the corner of ray street and little saffron hill thirteen feet below the surface in the workmen came upon the pavement of an old street consisting of very large blocks of ragstone of irregular shape an examination of the pavingstones showed that the street had been well used they are worn quite smooth by the footsteps and traffic of a past generation beneath these ancient stones were found piles of oakthick hard and covered with slimeinterpreted as fragments of a great mill beneath the oak in turn were crude wooden water pipes the great weight of the past had pressed all this material of london into a hard and almost solid mass and it is curious to observe that near the old surface were great numbers of pins the mystery of the pins remains the author of unknown london has remarked i have climbed down more ladders to explore the buried town than i have toiled up city staircases which may lead to the impression that there is more beneath than above one of the characteristic drawings of the city is that of its horizontal levels from the rooftops of its houses to the caverns of its sewers bearing down upon and almost crushing one another with their weight it was well said in one guide to the citys history that certain it is that none who know london would deny that its treasures must be sought in its depths it is an ambiguous sentence perhaps with a social as well as a topographical mystery associated with it another great london historian charles knight suggested that if we were to imagine that this great capital of capitals should ever be what babylon isits very site forgottenone could not but almost envy the delight with which the antiquaries of that future time would hear of some discovery of a london below the soil still remaining we can fancy we see the progress of the excavators from one part to another of the mighty but for a while inexplicable labyrinth till the whole was cleared open to the daylight and the vast systems laid before them it is a stupendous conception but no more stupendous than the reality there is indeed a london under the ground comprising great vaults and passageways sewers and tunnels pipes and corridors issuing into one another there are great networks of gas and water pipes many long since disused but others being transformed into conduits for the thousands of miles of coaxial cables which now help to organise and control the city walter george bell the author of london rediscoveries noticed how in the early s post office workmen were laying earthenware conduits for their telephone cables within a trough created by the wall of a roman villa lying in gracechurch street so that as he said our messages go whispering through rooms where once the citizens of a lost london spoke in an alien tongue there are deeplevel tunnels for british telecom and for the london electricity board with national grid cables carried in conduits and trenches a great system of post office tunnels was inaugurated after complicating the topography of this subterranean region there are more tunnels under the thames than under the river of any other capital citytunnels for trains for cars for foot passengers as well as for the supplies of public utilities the whole area under the river and indeed under the whole of the city is a catacomb of avenues and highways mimicking their counterparts above ground yet something happens when you travel beneath the surface of london the very air itself seems to become old and sorrowful with its inheritance of grief the thames tunnel built between and was for example established only at the cost of much labour and suffering its history is recorded in london under london by richard trench and ellis hillman marc brunel began the tunnel at a depth of sixtythree feet using a great shield to take out the earth while the bricklayers continually formed the walls of the tunnel itself there were often eruptions of earth and deluges of water the workmen were like labourers in a dangerous coalmine in constant terror from either fire or water one labourer fell down the great shaft while drunk and died some drowned in floods others died of ague or dysentery and one or two suffocated in the thick and impure air marc brunel himself suffered a paralytic stroke yet insisted upon continuing his work he left a diary which is sufficiently compelling to need no description may inflammable gas men complain v much may heywood died this morning two more on the sick list page is evidently sinking very fast i feel much debility after having been some time below may bowyer died today or yesterday a good man the metaphor of sinking is instructive in this context as if the whole weight of the underground world were fatal the air of dream of hopelessness and dreariness seems to have haunted this tunnel the very walls were in a cold sweat the times reported upon its opening in it is suggestive that marc brunel discovered his unique way of tunnelling underground while incarcerated in a debtors prison in london here he noticed the activities of a worm teredo navalis which itself is a natural tunneler the atmosphere of prison too is incorporated within the very structure of these tunnels nathaniel hawthorne descended into the depths of the thames tunnel after its completion down a wearisome succession of staircases until we behold the vista of an arched corridor that extends into everlasting midnight here is a depiction of melancholy anxiety transformed into brick and stone gloomier than a street of upper london yet there were some londoners who soon became acclimatised to the depth and the dankness hawthorne observed in the dusk stalls or shops in little alcoves kept principally by women they assail you with hungry entreaties to buy their merchandise it was his belief that these subterranean women spend their lives there seldom or never i presume seeing any daylight he describes the thames tunnel therefore as an admirable prison it was for this reason precisely that it never succeeded as a pathway for vehicles or pedestrians the gloomy associations and connotations were just too strong so it was little used after its inception and in it was taken over by the east london railway in that capacity it has existed ever since and now forms the underground connection between wapping and rotherhithe the other tunnels under the thames have not lost their overpowering sense of gloom of the rotherhithe road tunnel built between stepney and rotherhithe iain sinclair has written in downriver if you want to sample the worst london can offer follow me down that slow incline the tunnel drips with warnings do not stop and he goes on to suggest that the tunnel can achieve meaning only if it remains unused and silent that silence can be forbidding the greenwich foot tunnel opened in can seem more lonely and desolate than any other part of london yet there are some like the female shopkeepers pleading in the dusk of the thames tunnel who seem to belong to this subterranean world an eighteenthcentury german traveller observed that one third of the inhabitants of london live under ground we may date this inclination to the bronze age when underground tunnels were built a little to the west of where the greenwich observatory is now situated it has been suggested that the wells or pits which ventilate them were themselves early forms of stellar observation which may once more suggest that continuity for which london is notable the german traveller was in fact remarking upon the curious basements or cellar dwellings of eighteenthcentury london which had already been a feature of the city for two hundred years they were let to the very poor who entered by steps from the street down a well which was supposed to be closed at nightfall by a flap in the transcripts of the poor we have some brief glimpses of this subterranean lifei am a cobbler i live in a cellar i am a shoemaker i keep a kitchen basement dwelling in monmouth street i do not know the landladys name i pay my money every monday but these traps of dampness and darkness also had more nefarious uses i keep a public cellar seems to have meant that vagrants or drunks or debauchees had access to a buried life this tendency to seek refuge beneath the city became most noticeable in the twentieth century it has been estimated that during the first world war onethird of a million londoners went underground in february to shelter in the tube stations which extended below the capital they became accustomed to their buried life and even began to savour it indeed according to philip ziegler in london at war one of the principal fears of the authorities was that a deep shelter mentality might grow up and result in paralysis of will among those who succumbed to it it was also suggested that the underground londoners would grow hysterical with fear and would never surface to perform their duties in the autumn of londoners were once more buried they flocked to underground shelters or the crypts of churches and certain people lived underground and saw less of the sky than any miner in each of the deep shelters more than a thousand people might congregate lying closer together than the dead in any graveyard while those in the crypts sought shelter amongst the dead this is a constant image in descriptions of the subterranean life it is like being dead buried alive beneath the great city the most famous of these caverns under the ground was the tilbury beneath commercial road and cable street where thousands of east enders sheltered from the bombs the tube stations were the most obvious locations of safety henry moore wandered among their new inhabitants and made preliminary notes for his drawings dramatic dismal lit masses of reclining figures fading foreground chains hanging from old cranes mud and rubbish and chaotic untidiness everywhere the stench of urine was noticeable as well as fetid human smells this is a picture of london in almost primeval state as if in the journey under ground the citizens had gone back centuries i had never seen so many reclining figures and even the train tunnels seemed to be like the holes in my sculpture and amid the grim tension i noticed groups of strangers forming together in intimate groups and children asleep within feet of the passing trains he compared it to the hold of a slave ship except that its passengers were sailing nowhere once again as in the previous episodes of wartime bombing in london the vision of a subterranean population alarmed the authorities in michael moorcocks mother london a late twentiethcentury hymn to the city the narrator had once sought the safety of the tubes during the blitz and had since that time become obsessed with lost tube lines and the whole world under the surface of the city i discovered evidence that london was interlaced with connecting tunnels home of a troglodytic race that had gone underground at the time of the great fire others had hinted of a london under london in a variety of texts as far back as chaucer it is a wonderful fantasy but in the early s there was a genuine fear that these subterraneans would become a reality we ought not to encourage a permanent day and night population underground herbert morrison stated in the autumn of if that spirit gets abroad we are defeated the prospect of defeatism was not the only concern it was also noticed that the experience of living underground encouraged an antiauthoritarian and egalitarian spirit as if the conditions above the ground could be reversed here out of sight radicalism might flourish one newsletter which circulated among the subterraneans denounced the wartime authorities for indifference amounting almost to callousness neglect soulless contempt for elementary human decencies so those under the ground instilled an element of fear in those who remained above it it resembles the ancient superstitious fear of the miner as an emblem of the dark world in which he works it is the fear of the depths that is why the figure of the underground man is so potent known over the centuries as the fermor the raker and the flusher whose employment it was to clean out the sewers and clear them of obstruction there were sewerhunters as well also known as toshers who wandered through the sewers looking for articles which they could sell many wondrous tales are still told among the people henry mayhew wrote of men having lost their way in the sewers and of having wandered among the filthy passagestheir lights extinguished by the noisome vapourstill faint and overpowered they dropped down and died on the spot other stories are told of sewerhunters beset by myriads of enormous rats in a few days afterwards their skeletons were discovered picked to the very bones these alarming stories testify to the fear associated with the underground passages of london and there were indeed real dangers in this enterprise of converting rubbishiron copper rope boneinto money the brickwork was often rotten and liable to crumble or to fall the air was noxious and the tides of the nineteenthcentury thames swept through the sewers leaving some victims quite dead battered and disfigured in a dreadful manner they worked silently and stealthily closing off their bullseye lanterns whenever they passed beneath a streetgrating for otherwise a crowd might collect overhead they wore greasy velveteen coats with capacious pockets and trousers of dirty canvas they were in the words of one londoner not meaning to make a pun the lowest of the low there are more recent accounts of the honest flushers and gangers who are gainfully employed to clear the sewers of soft mud and grit a newspaper account of reports of a piccadilly sewer which drained into the tyburn that it was like crossing the styx the fog had followed us down from the streets and swirled above the discoloured and strongsmelling river like the stream of hades so the descent conjures up mythological imagery eric newby descended into the sewer of the fleet and seen fitfully by the light of miners lanterns and special lamps it was like one of the prisons designed by piranesi again the imagery of the prison emerges one sewerman told an interested guest below you should see some of em under the city theyre medieval they dont show em to visitors in that medieval spirit we read then of a cavernous chamber with pillars arches and buttresses like a cathedral undercroft it is a strange city beneath the ground perhaps best exemplified by worn manhole covers which instead of reading self locking spell out elf king no account of underground london however could be complete without the underground itself it is a great subterranean metropolis covering an area of square miles miles of railway connecting this extraordinary profusion of tunnels and stations with their mysterious names such as gospel oak white city angel and seven sisters the scheme for transport under london had been broached in the s and s but had met with serious objections it was feared that the weight of traffic overhead which an underground system was meant to relieve would crush any tunnels beneath and that the houses above the proposed routes would shiver and fall from the vibrations eventually in one scheme was accepted the metropolitan railway was constructed from paddington to farringdon street within three years by means of the cut and cover method and immediately proved a great success the enterprise represented a triumph of midvictorian energy and ingenuity there is an engraving of the trial trip on the underground railway in which the open carriages are filled with men waving their stovepipe hats in the air as they pass beneath a tunnel on opening day the crowd at the farringdon street station was as great as at the doors of a theatre on the first night of some popular performer and in fact the sheer vivacity and theatricality of the undertaking were a large part of its popularity the spectacle of steam trains disappearing under the ground like demons in a pantomime satisfied the london appetite for sensation by the early twentieth century the shape of the contemporary underground network was beginning to emerge the city and south london railway opened in for example because the route from king william street to stockwell was created by means of tunnelling rather than the older cut and cover method it has the distinction of being the first named the tube it had the further distinction of being the first electrically operated underground system in the world after years of steam the carriages had no windows on the understandable principle that there was nothing particular to see and the luxurious furnishings gave them the nickname of padded cells the tube was followed by the central line in the bakerloo and the piccadilly in and the hampstead or northern line in it had ceased to be a spectacular or even surprising innovation and had become an inalienable part of londons quotidian life by slow degrees too it acquired the familiar characteristics and aspects of the city or perhaps it is the case that the city above ground has made a replica of itself below the underground has its streets and avenues which the pedestrians quickly recognise and follow it has its short cuts its crossroads its particular features no escalators at queensway deep lifts in hampstead long escalators at the angel and just like the city itself areas of bright lights and bustle are surrounded by areas of darkness and disuse the rhythms of the city are endlessly mimicked beneath the city as well as its patterns of activity and habitation like the great city too the thoroughfares of the underground have their own particular associations and connections the northern line is intense and somehow desperate the central line is energetic while the circle is adventurous and breezy the bakerloo line however is flat and despairing the gloom of lancaster gate sits between the bustle of bond street and the brightness of notting hill gate where disasters have occurred such as moorgate and bethnal green the air is still desolate but there are stations like baker street and gloucester road which lift the spirit the air itself becomes quite different as the passengers travel towards the oldest sections of london in the city as the circle line moves from edgware road and great portland street towards the ancient centre it travels through ever deeper levels of anonymity and oblivion on one stretch of that line gk chesterton noticed that the names of st jamess park westminster charing cross temple blackfriars are really the foundation stones of london and it is right that they should as it were be underground since all bear witness to an ancient religion these images are entirely appropriate for an enterprise which in its operations has descended so deeply that it has reached the levels of the old primeval swamp which once was london beneath victoria underground station some fossils fifty million years old were uncovered these ancient depths may indeed account for the peculiar sensation and atmosphere which the underground evokes there are accounts of ghosts or presences in the subterranean depths certainly there are ghost stations with longforgotten platforms some of them still retaining their faded hoardings and posters there are some forty of them remainingbritish museum city road south kentish town york road marlborough road and king william street among themsilent and generally invisible the underground is also a place of chance meeting and coincidence but it generates greater fear and anxietyof strangers of thieves and of the mad who haunt its endlessly running trains yet it has become familiar ford madox ford in the soul of london wrote that i have known a man dying a long way from london sigh queerly for a sight of the gush of smoke that on a platform of the underground one may see escaping in great woolly clots up a circular opening by a grimy rusted iron shield into the dim upper light here is a true londoner wishing on his deathbed once more to see and savour the smoke of the underground like a prisoner dreaming once more of his confinement and still the work goes on as london expands so does its buried counterpart grow and stretch beneath it if in the last days of the twentieth century you sat in the shadow of the great tower of canary wharf you would have seen hundreds of workmen hurrying around the track of the jubilee line extension the work was endless and noisy with great arcs of light and gleams of silver fire charging the night air with power in alliance with some unknown future city victorian megalopolis victorian london as it might be seen from the window of a passing train in certain areas the view has hardly changed testimony to the conservatism of londoners in their love for a house and back garden chapter how many miles to babylon by the mids london had become known as the greatest city on the earth the capital of empire the centre of international trade and finance a vast world market into which the world poured at the beginning of the twentieth century the sanitary historian henry jephson considered this megalopolis in other terms of that period he wrote it is to be said that there is none in the history of london in which less regard was shown for the conditions of the great mass of the inhabitants of the metropolis charles dickens henry mayhew and friedrich engels are three of the victorian citydwellers who cried havoc over the exhaustive and exhausting city in contemporary photographs and drawings the most striking images are those of labour and suffering women sit with their arms folded hunched over a beggar family sleep upon stone benches in a recess of a bridge with the dark shape of st pauls looming behind them as blanchard jerrold put it the aged the orphan the halt the blind of london would fill an ordinary city this is a strange conception a city entirely composed of the maimed and injured but that is in part what london was the number of children and tramps too sitting resignedly in the street is infinite infinite also are the streetsellers generally depicted against a dull background of brick or stone the poor interiors of the victorian city are generally crepuscular and filthy with rags hanging among reeking tallow lamps many of the inhabitants seem to have no faces since they are turned towards the shadows around them dilapidated wooden beams and staircases in crazed confusion many outdoors and indoors seem hunched up and small as if the very weight of the city had crushed them down yet there is another aspect of the victorian city that photographs and images evoke of vast throngs innumerable the streets filled with teeming and struggling life the great inspiration for the work of nineteenthcentury mythographers such as marx and darwin there are also flashes of feelingof pity anger and tendernessto be observed upon passing faces and all around them can be imagined a hard unyielding noise like an unending shout this is victorian london victorian london is of course a general term for a sequence of shifting patterns of urban life in the early decades of the nineteenth century for example it still retained many of the characteristics of the last years of the previous century it was still a compact city draw but a little circle above the clustering housetops the narrator of dickenss master humphreys clock suggests and you shall have within its space everything with its opposite extreme and contradiction close by it was still only partially illuminated by gas and most of the streets were lit by infrequent oillamps with linkboys bearing lights to escort late pedestrians home there were charleys rather than policemen walking their beats it was still hazardous the outskirts retained a rural aspect there were strawberry fields at hammersmith and at hackney and the wagons still plied their way among the other horsedrawn traffic to the haymarket the great public buildings with which the seat of empire was soon to be decorated had not yet arisen the characteristic entertainments were those of the late eighteenth century too with the dogfights the cockfights the pillory and the public executions the streets and houses all contained plastered and painted windows as if they were part of a pantomime there were still strolling pedlars hawking penny dreadfuls and balladsingers with the latest air there were cheap theatres and printshops displaying in their windows caricatures which could always catch a crowd there were pleasure gardens and caves of harmony mughalls and freeandeasies and dancing saloons it was a more eccentric city the inhabitants had had no settled education and no social system a word which itself did not spring into full life until the s and s had yet been introduced so it was a more varied more unusual and sometimes more alarming city than any of its successors it had not yet been standardised or come under the twin midvictorian agencies of uniformity and propriety it is impossible to gauge when this transformation occurred certainly london took on quite another aspect when it continued to grow and stretch itself through islington and st johns wood in the north then through paddington bayswater south kensington lambeth clerkenwell peckham and all points of the compass it became the largest city in the world just at the time when england itself became the first urbanised society in the world it became the city of clocktime and of speed for its own sake it became the home of engines and steamdriven industry it became the city where electromagnetic forces were discovered and publicised it also became the centre of mass production with the impersonal forces of demand and supply profit and loss intervening between vendor and customer in the same period business and government were supervised by a vast army of clerks and bookkeepers who customarily wore uniform dark costumes it was the city of fog and darkness but in another sense too it was packed to blackness a population of one million at the beginning of the century increased to approximately five million by its close by it had risen to seven million everything was becoming darker the costumes of the male londoner like those of the clerks switched from variegated and bright colours to the solemn black of the frockcoat and the stovepipe hat gone too was the particular gracefulness and colour of the early nineteenthcentury city the decorous symmetry of its georgian architecture was replaced by the imperialist neogothic or neoclassical shape of victorian public buildings they embodied the mastery of time as well as that of space in this context too there emerged a london which was more massive more closely controlled and more carefully organised the metropolis was much larger but it had also become much more anonymous it was a more public and splendid city but it was also a less human one thus it became the climax or the epitome of all previous imperialist cities it became babylon there was in the twelfth century a part of london wall called babeylone but the reasons for that name are unclear it may be that in the medieval city the inhabitants recognised a pagan or mystical significance within that part of the stone fabric it was unwittingly echoed by a piece of late twentiethcentury graffiti by hackney marsh with the simple scrawl babylondon there was of course the mysterious song how many miles to babylon three scores miles and ten can i get there by candle light yes and back again if your heels are nimble and light you may get there by candle light although the derivation and meaning of the verse are unclear the image of the city seems to assert itself as a potent beckoning force in a variant of this song bethlehem takes the place of babylon and may point to the madhouse in moorfields rather than any more remote destination in the eighteenth century too london was considered cette babilone le seul refuge des infortunés in which the association of size and power is coloured by the invocation of the infortunés or refugees this indeed is the other connotation of london as babylon a city loud with many disparate and unintelligible voices to name london as babylon then was to allude to its essential multiplicity so william cowper the eighteenthcentury poet spoke of this increasing london as more diverse than babylon of old yet the association or resemblance became pressing only in the nineteenth century when london was continually described as modern babylon henry james referred to it as this murky babylon and for arthur machen london loomed up before me wonderful mystical as assyrian babylon as full of unheardof things and great unveilings so babylon has many associations it conjures up images of magnitude and darkness but also intimations of mystery and revelation in this great conflation even the gardens of park lane became known as the hanging gardens although some echo may be found here of the tyburn tree which was once located beside them by the sheer quantity of life in the city was overwhelming every eight minutes of every day of every year someone died in london every five minutes someone was born there were forty thousand costermongers and winter tramps there were more irish living in london than in dublin and more catholics than in rome there were public houses visited by customers eight years later there were more than half a million dwellings more than sufficient to form one continuous row of buildings round the island of great britain it is perhaps not surprising that midnineteenthcentury londoners were themselves struck with awe admiration or anxiety at the city which seemed without any apparent warning to have grown to such magnitude and complexity how could it have happened nobody seemed quite sure frederick engels in his the condition of the working classes in england in found his own considerable intellectual faculties to be strained beyond use a town such as london he wrote where a man may wander for hours together without reaching the beginning of the end is a strange thing the strange city is indescribable and so engels could only resort to continual images of immensity he writes of countless ships endless lines of vehicles hundreds of steamers hundreds of thousands of all classes the immense tangle of streets hundreds and thousands of alleys and courts together with nameless misery the sheer incalculability of the mass seems to render it also unintelligible and therefore induces fear so great was london that it seemed to contain within itself all previous civilisations babylon was then joined with other empires the naves and transepts of westminster abbey were compared to the city of the dead beyond cairo while the railway terminus at paddington invoked images of the pyramid of cheops nineteenthcentury architects in their fantastic images of london created pyramids for trafalgar square and shooters hill while also designing great pyramidal cemeteries beside primrose hill here we see the power of imperial london creating a cult of death as well as of magnificence in rees cyclopaedia of the docks once more arouse primitive imagery the climate and atmosphere of london in turn create startling hieroglyphics that are written by soot and smoke upon its surface so the stones of london became ancient by association somehow the spectacle of the metropolis encourages intimations of unfathomable agepetrified to have been turned into stone may also be covertly introduced into this vision in its contemporary sense of great fear and beyond egypt there was rome the subterranean vaults beneath the adelphi reminded one architectural historian of old roman works while the sewer system of joseph bazalgette was often compared with the roman aqueducts it was the sense of magnificence combined with the triumphalism of empire which most notably impressed these observers of the nineteenthcentury city when hippolyte taine ventured into the thames tunnel itself compared with the greatest feats of roman engineering he described it as enormous and dismal as the gut of some babel then the association of ideas and civilisations became too strong for him i am always discovering that london resembles ancient rome how heavy this modern rome as did the ancient one bear down upon the backs of the working classes for every monstrous agglomeration of building babylon egypt the rome of the caesars represents an accumulation of effort an excess of fatigue then he described the roman machine which made slaves of those who toiled for it this was another truth then about london as rome it turned its citizens into the slaves of the machine as a model for the archway leading to the bullion yard of the bank of england sir john soane chose the roman triumphal arch the walls of lothbury court beside it were inscribed with allegorical figures taken from roman mythology the massive corner of the bank between lothbury and princes street was based upon the temple of vesta at tivoli the interiors as well as the exterior of the bank had roman antecedents many halls and offices constructed within like the dividend office and the bank stock office were designed from models of the roman baths in addition the chief cashiers office fortyfive feet by thirty was built in homage to the temple of the sun and moon at rome here then in direct form is the worship of money based upon roman originals when the association is made with that ancient city it is essentially one of barbaric triumphalism but there were other associations verlaine suggested that it was a biblical city ready for the fire of heaven to strike it carlyle described it in as an enormous babel and the flood of human effort rolls out of it and into it with a violence that almost appals ones very sense so in one context it is compared with the greatest civilisations of the past with rome or egypt and yet in another it is quickly broken down into a violent wilderness a savage place without pity or restraint of any kind when carlyle adds that london is also like the heart of all the universe there is a suggestion that london is an emblem of all that is darkest and most extreme within existence itself is it the heart of empire or the heart of darkness or is one so inseparable from the other that human effort and labour become no more than the expression of rage and the appetite for power in one sense london has always been known as a wilderness or jungle a desert or primeval forest whoever considers the cities of london and westminster with the late vast increases of their suburbs henry fielding wrote in the great irregularity of their buildings the immense number of lanes alleys courts and byeplaces must think that had they been intended for the very purpose of concealment they could not have been better contrived upon such a view the whole appears as a vast wood or forest in which the thief may harbour with as great security as wild beasts do in the deserts of arabia and africa he described another aspect of this wilderness in tom jones where he dwelled upon the difficulties of london life for as you are not put out of countenance so neither are you cloathed or fed by those who do not know you and a man may be as easily starved in leadenhall market as in the deserts of arabia fieldings contemporary tobias smollett had the same vision london being an immense wilderness in which there is neither watch nor ward of any signification nor any order or police affords thieves and other criminals lurking places as well as prey the images of jungle and desert are used as if they were alike precisely because they both suggest the wilderness of untamed and uncharted human nature london represents some primeval force or habitat in which the natural instincts of humankind are allowed free expression in the nineteenth century the connotations of wilderness changed from unconstrained and uncurtailed life to one of barren desolation the city is what mayhew called a bricken wilderness and the image of dense cover is replaced by one of hard stone with its profuse rank undergrowth of low mean houses spreading in all directions this is the nineteenthcentury desert far larger and far more desolate than that of the eighteenth century it is what james thomson in the doom of a city published in described as the desert streets within a buried citys maze of stone the endlessness of the city streets so well evoked by engels is here associated with the coldness and hardness of stone itself it represents not the wilderness of burgeoning life but the wilderness of death without sorrow or pity wilderness yes it is it is a character says in nicholas nickleby it is a wilderness says the old man with such animation it was a wilderness to me once i came here barefooti have never forgotten it and little dorrit cries out and london looks so large so barren and so wild so in turn london has recalled pompeii another wilderness of stone after the bombardments of the second world war for example it was remarked that london already looked as ancient as herculaneum but london has not been buried or overwhelmed by the lavaflow of time all the constituents of its life return an italian visitor perhaps more astute than those who preferred the conventional analogies described london as the land of the cyclops in a survey of late twentiethcentury docklands we find a great cyclops wharf there is a photograph of south quay in the same vicinity where the tower of south quay waterside is surmounted by a pyramid the great tower of canary wharf is adorned with a pyramid in similar fashion suggesting that the associations with that empire have never really faded even the pumping station for storm water in the docklands has been constructed like some guardian of the waters in the image of an egyptian monument yet there is one more salient aspect to this continual analogy of london with ancient civilisations it is the fear or hope or expectation that this great imperial capital will in its turn fall into ruin that is precisely the reason for londons association with prechristian cities it too will revert to chaos and old night so that the condition of the primeval past will also be that of the remote future it represents the longing for oblivion in dorés vivid depiction of nineteenthcentury londonlondon essentially as rome or babylon there is an endpiece it shows a cloaked and meditative figure sitting upon a rock beside the thames he looks out upon a city in awful ruin the wharves derelict the dome of st pauls gone the great offices simply piles of jagged stone it is entitled the new zealander and derives its inspiration from macaulays vision of a colonial returning to the imperial city after its destiny and destruction were complete he wrote of the distant traveller as one who shall take his stand on the broken arch of london bridge to sketch the ruins of st pauls it is a vision which paradoxically emerged during the period of londons pride and greatness towards the end of the eighteenth century horace walpole described a traveller from lima marvelling at the ruins of st pauls shelley looked towards that faroff time when st pauls and westminster abbey shall stand shapeless and nameless ruins in the midst of an unpeopled marsh in his imagination rossetti destroyed the british museum and left it open for the archaeologists of a future race ruskin envisaged the stones of london crumbling through prouder eminence to less pitied destruction the vision is of a city unpeopled and therefore free to be itself stone endures and in this imagined future stone becomes a kind of god essentially it is a vision of the city as death but it also represents the horror of london and of its teeming life it is a cry against its supposed unnaturalness which can only be repudiated by a giant act of nature such as a deluge there may then come a time when london is recognisable only by grey ruin and mouldering stone sunk deep into night gothic night yet the term gothic has associations of its own which are no less powerful than those of rome or babylon nineveh or tyre the author of the london perambulator james bone has suggested that the shapes and textures of london stones might reveal a gothic genius loci of london fighting against the spirit of the classic but what then is this spirit of london place it brings with it suggestions of excess and overpowering amplitude of religious yearning and monumentality it suggests ancient piety and vertiginous stone in the eighteenth century gothic acquired connotations of horror then horror combined with hysterical comedy all this the city can encompass nicholas hawksmoor the great builder of london churches defined a style which he termed english gothick it was marked by dramatic symmetries and sublime disproportion when george dance designed the guildhall in the late s with an elegant amalgam of indian and gothic elements he was restoring a form of extravagance and vitality in homage to the great age of the city but if gothic was an intimation of antiquity it was also an aspect of veneration that is why the churches of hawksmoor provide such a powerful statement in the places where they are located among them the city spitalfields limehouse and greenwich as one eighteenthcentury artist flaxman remarked of the tombs within westminster abbey they are specimens of magnificence which forcibly direct the attention and turn the thoughts not only to other ages but to other states of existence there is that within london which compels recognition as not of this earth its most extravagant and notable manifestations were in the nineteenth century however when the spirit of neogothic infused london it found its first significant incarnation in the rebuilding of the houses of parliament after the great fire of but by gothic was the recognised language of all leading architects it has been suggested that the gothic style embodied the influence of londons past that is why the law courts were constructed in gothic style as a way of instilling the authority of time upon the judicial deliberations of the present it is also the reason why london churches of the midnineteenth century were invariably in the gothic style ironwork was fashioned in the same manner and suburban villas were rendered in what was known as wimbledon gothic the area of st johns wood in particular is known for its toy or ornamental gothic anything which might be considered too recent or too newly made was covered with a patina of false age so in the nineteenthcentury city gothic possessed the consolation of supposed antiquity in a city which seemed to be careering beyond all familiar or predictable bounds it offered the reassurance of some theoretical or presumed permanence but sacred images have the strangest way of showing another face the power of gothic originals can also be associated with the presence of the pagan or the barbaric that is why the city of empire was also known as a city of savages chapter wild things as there is a darkest africa is there not also a darkest england may we not find a parallel at our own doors and discover within a stones throw of our cathedrals and palaces similar horrors to those which stanley has found existing in the great equatorial forest these are the words of william booth in the s he notes in particular dwarfish dehumanised inhabitants the slavery to which they are subjected their privation and their misery in this sense the city has created and nurtured a wild population the poor of the slums and tenements were characteristically described by other observers as savages and even at the time of great national religious revival among the middle classes when england was supposed to be the quintessentially christian nation the working class of london remained outside the church a report of concluded that the poor of london were as utter strangers to religious ordinances as the people of a heathen country or as mayhew put it religion is a regular puzzle to costers how could there be devotion or piety in such an oppressive commercial city where there was little chance of beauty or dignity let alone worship the city of empire and commerce contained dens and lodginghouses in the midst of a dense and ignorant population where the most diabolical practices were constantly perpetrated i have seen the polynesian savage in his primitive condition thomas huxley wrote before the missionary or the blackbirder or the beachcomber got at him with all his savagery he was not half so savage so unclean so irreclaimable as the tenant of a tenement in an east london slum the paradox here is that the imperial city the city which maintained and financed a world empire contained within its heart a population more brutish and filthy than any of the races it believed itself destined to conquer he thought he was a christian mayhew wrote of a young mudlark or river scavenger but he didnt know what a christian was the poorest irish immigrants sensed the atmosphere the irish coming to london seem to regard it as a heathen city according to thomas beames in the rookeries of london and to give themselves up at once to a course of recklessness and crime so the savagery was endemic and also contagious the inhabitants of the city were brutalised by its conditions verlaine believed that after paris in london he was living among the barbarians but his commentary is on a wider scale he is referring to the fact that in the alien city the only worship was that of money and power again the name of babylon emerges to encompass this great pagan host as dostoevsky expressed it in on his journey to london it is a biblical sight something to do with babylon some prophecy out of the apocalypse being fulfilled before your very eyes you feel that a rich and ancient tradition of denial and protest is needed in order not to yield and not to idolise baal he concluded that baal reigns and does not even demand obedience because he is certain of it the poverty suffering complaints and torpor of the masses do not worry him in the slightest his heathen slaves and worshippers are in that sense powerless as with the break of each day the same proud and gloomy spirit once again spreads its lordly wings over the gigantic city if midvictorian london was indeed a city of heathenism and pagan apocalypse as dostoevsky suggests then what more appropriate monument for it than the one erected in an obelisk dating from the egyptian pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty was brought in a sealed ship to london it had previously stood before the temple of the sun in on or heliopolis where it had remained for years it looked down upon the meeting of joseph and jacob and saw the boyhood of moses in bc it had been moved to alexandria but was never erected there lying prone in the sand until its removal to london the monolith of rosecoloured granite hewn in the quarries of southern egypt by bands of slaves now stands beside the thames guarded by two bronze sphinxes on its side are hieroglyphics naming thothmes iii and rameses the great this stone known as cleopatras needle has become a tutelary presence as one french traveller noted of the thames at this point the atmosphere is heavy there is a conscious weight around above a weight that presses down penetrates into ears and mouth seems even to hang about the air tennyson on contemplating the pagan monument of a pagan london gave it a voice i have seen the four great empires disappear i was when london was not i am here the granite has slowly disintegrated through the perpetual influence of fog and smoke and the hieroglyphics have begun to fade there are chips and gashes where a bomb fell in the autumn of yet it has survived still buried beneath it in jars sealed in are a mans suit and a womans costume illustrated newspapers and childrens toys cigars and a razor most significant however for the imperial obelisk is a complete set of victorian coinage embedded in its base other pagan associations are intimately linked with the nineteenthcentury city here the minotaur made its appearance in pagan myth the monster in the labyrinth was each year given seven youths and seven maidens both as food and tribute so victorian crusaders against poverty and prostitution were in the public prints given the name of theseus who killed the monster yet it did not wholly die one journalist in the pall mall gazette of july compared the nightly sacrifice of virgins in london to the victims of the athenian tribute to the minotaur and it seemed that the appetite of the minotaur of london is insatiable it was also described as the london minotaur moving about clad as respectably in broad cloth and fine linen as any bishop this indeed is a vision of horror worthy of poe or de quincey but the suggestion of a pagan beast alive and rampant is one curiously aligned to the nineteenthcentury perception that the city had indeed become a labyrinth to rival anything upon the cretan island in response to these articles on child prostitution in london george frederic watts depicted the horned beast half man and half bull gazing over a parapet of stone across the city in his remaines of john aubrey wrote that on the south side of tooley street a little westward from barnaby street is a street called the maes or maze eastward from the borough another name for labyrinth i believe we received these mazes from our danish ancestors less than two hundred years later however new labyrinths emerged arthur machen reaching what he believed to be the outskirts of the city would say i am free at last from this mighty and stony wilderness and then suddenly as i turned a corner the raw red rows of houses would confront me and i knew that i was still in the labyrinth of the labyrinth as a device the architectural theorist bernard tschumi has stated one can never see it in totality nor can one express it one is condemned to it and cannot go outside and see the whole this is london when de quincey wrote of searching for the young prostitute ann whom he had befriended he described their passing through the mighty labyrinths of london perhaps even within a few feet of each other a barrier no wider than a london street often amounting in the end to a separation for eternity this is the horror of the city it is blind to human need and human affection its topography cruel and almost mindless in its brutality the fact that the young girl will almost certainly be betrayed into prostitution once more conjures up the beast at its centre for de quincey oxford street was made up from neverending terraces and innumerable groans here the streets tease and bewilder of the city it has been written that a stranger would soon lose his way in such a maze and in fact the old centre is characterised by its curious serpentine passages its secluded alleys and its hidden courts hg wells noted that if it were not for the cabs in a little while the whole population so vast and incomprehensible is the intricate complexity of this great city would be hopelessly lost for ever this is curiously suggestivea population lost in its own city as if it had been swallowed up by the streets and the stone a writer at the beginning of the nineteenth century robert southey had a similar vision with his realisation that it is impossible ever to become thoroughly acquainted with such an endless labyrinth of streets and as you may well suppose they who live at one end know little or nothing of the other the image is of a labyrinth which is constantly expanding reaching outwards towards infinity on the maps of england it is seen as a dark patch or stain spreading slowly but inexorably outwards chapter if it wasnt for the ouses in between in many works of nineteenthcentury fiction characters stand upon an eminence such as primrose hill or fish street hill and are struck into silence by the vision of the citys immensity macaulay acquired the reputation of having walked through every street in london but by the year of his death in it was unlikely that anyone would have been able to reproduce that feat of pedestrianism here was a source of anxiety for an indigenous londoner he or she would never know all of the city thoroughly there would always be a secret london in the very act of its growth it can be mapped but it can never be fully imagined it must be taken on faith not on reason it grew so large in the nineteenth century that donald olsen has remarked in the growth of victorian london that most of the london we enjoy is victorian either in its fabric or its layout or at least its inspiration and what is that inspiration a passage in building news of put the case that it is the duty of our architecture to translate our character into stone the great rebuilding and extension heralded an equally great destruction of the past that too was part of the victorian character its improvements destroyed the old gabled shops and tenements the quaint inns and galleried courtyards the churches and the curious streets that were the existing records of the life of another century yet just as the church yielded to commerce so the narrow streets gave way to wide and ever wider thoroughfares lined by new dwellings great hotels office buildings and blocks of flats in brilliant limestone or burnished brick or terracotta rose above the city shaftesbury avenue northumberland avenue holborn viaduct queen victoria street charing cross road all were driven through the capital so that a reporter in could observe that old london the london of our youth is becoming obliterated by another city which seems rising up through it there was a disconcerting sensation much remarked upon that a strange city was emerging ineluctably like a phantom in a mist and it was changing everything that it touched the concerted impulse to create a gigantic londonto widen streets to put up great monuments to create museums and law courts to drive huge new thoroughfares from one part of the capital to anothermeant a chaos of demolition and reconstruction with entire areas becoming building sites complete with hoardings and heavy machinery the holborn viaduct was built to span the valley of the fleet linking holborn circus with newgate street the great enterprise of the victoria embankment transformed the northern bank of the river and was extended into the heart of the city by queen victoria street victoria street transformed all of westminster while shaftesbury avenue and charing cross road created the west end as it is commonly understood the city itself was steadily being depopulated as bankers and merchants moved out to kensington or belgravia until it became nothing but a countinghouse this monster london is really a new city charles eliot pascoe wrote in new as to its life its streets and the social conditions of the millions who dwell in them whose very manners habits occupations and even amusements have undergone as complete change within the past halfcentury as the great city itself this is one aspect of london which the nineteenth century thoroughly revealed the city itself changes its inhabitants for better or worse and actively intervenes in their lives from that of course may spring a sense of oppression or imprisonment yet there was a genuine feeling of awe concerning the vast extent of the city as if a quite new thing had been created in the world where some saw only poverty and deprivation others saw intelligence and industry where some recognised only shabbiness and ugliness others noted the blessings of trade and commerce in effect london was now so large that practically any opinion could be held of it and still be true it was the harbinger of a consumer society it represented energy and zeal and inventiveness but it was also the great wen a monstrous growth filled with the bitter tears of outcast london another aspect of its size therefore was the fact that it contained everything when henry mayhew ascended above london in a balloon he observed that vast bricken mass of churches and hospitals banks and prisons palaces and workhouses docks and refuges for the destitute all blent into one immense black spot a mere rubbish heap containing vice and avarice and low cunning as well as noble aspirations and human heroism but in such a vast metropolis forever growing vice and heroism become themselves unimportant the sheer size of london creates indifference this in a sensitive mind such as that of henry james can lead to acute depression or feelings of estrangement up to this time he wrote to his sister in i have been crushed under a sense of the sheer magnitude of londonits inconceivable immensityin such a way as to paralyse my mind the place sits on you broods on you stamps on you that is another aspect of its unimaginable size it acts as a giant weight or burden upon each individual life and consciousness it is not simply that the citizens were literally dwarfed by the huge blocks and intricate machinery of the victorian city but rather that the sheer scale of london haunted its inhabitants no one could ever memorise a map of victorian london with its streets packed so tightly together that they could hardly be made out it was beyond human capacity but a place of such vastness without limit is also horrifying it weighs upon the mind it may lead to desperation or release energy disraeli remarked upon this illimitable feature as the special character of london but in turn it resulted in the citys becoming very monotonous that is another paradox of this paradoxical city sheer size may arouse not sensations of awe and admiration but rather those of dullness and ennui disraeli was possessed by a vision of flat dull spiritless streets stretching in all directions so that london overpowers with its vastness and its sameness if it was the largest city in the world it was also the most impersonal spreading its dull life everywhere one of the characteristics of london faces was the appearance of tiredness to journey through the city was itself fatiguing enough it had grown too large to be manageable the londoner returned home exhausted spiritless dead to the world so london wears out its citizens it drains them of their energies like a succubus yet for some this senseless bigness as henry james described it was a source of fascination disraelis vision of a vast uniformity was reversed in that context because the absence of limits could also mean that everything is there there were myriad shapes to be discerned an endless profusion and prodigality of scenes and characters when i came to this great city an african traveller wrote i looked this way and that way there is no beginning and no end he could have walked through kennington and camberwell hackney and bethnal green stoke newington and highbury chelsea and knightsbridge and kensington without ceasing to marvel between and the development rivalled that of the preceding two hundred years by the latter date streets and terraces had reached victoria edgware the city road limehouse rotherhithe and lambeth in the next sixteen years alone the city conquered belgravia hoxton poplar deptford walworth bethnal green bow road and st pancras by it had expanded exponentially again to encompass waltham green kensal green hammersmith highgate finsbury park clapton hackney new cross old ford blackheath peckham norwood streatham and tooting all of it growing and coming together beyond any civic or administrative control the roads and thoroughfares were not planned by any parliament or central authority that is why the citys development was often compared to some remorseless instinctive process or natural growth london colonised each village or town as it encompassed them making them a part of itself but not necessarily changing their fundamental topography they were now london but they retained streets and buildings of an earlier date their old structure can just be recognised in the remains of churches marketplaces and village greens while their names survive as the titles of underground stations it was often said that all england had become london but some considered london to be an altogether separate nation with its own language and customs for others london corresponded to the great globe itself or the epitome of the round world as one nineteenthcentury novelist put it it is an indication of its prodigiousness when such a great mass exerts its own form of gravity and attractionlines of force thomas de quincey called them in an essay entitled the nation of london ordinary human existence seems uninteresting or unimportant in this place where everything is colossal no man ever was left to himself for the first time in the streets as yet unknown of london de quincey continued but he must have been saddened and mortified perhaps terrified by the sense of desertion and utter loneliness which belongs to his situation nobody regarded de quincey nobody saw or heard him the people rushing past bent upon their own secret destinations and contemplating their own hurried business seemed like a mask of maniacs or a pageant of phantoms against the magnitude of stone the city dwellers are like wraiths replacing others and in turn to be replaced it is a function of londons size and of its age that all of its citizens seem merely its temporary inhabitants within the immensity of london any individual becomes insignificant and unnoticed this is a tiring condition too and may also help to explain the weariness and lassitude which mark many london faces to be perpetually reminded that the single human life is worth very little that it is reckoned merely as part of the aggregate sum may induce a sense of futility to live in the city is to know the limits of human existence in many victorian streetscenes the city dwellers seem lonely and unregarded trudging along the crowded avenues with their heads lowered carrying their burdens patiently enough but isolated none the less this is another paradox of victorian london there is an appearance of energy and vitality in the mass but the characteristic individual mood is one of anxiety or despondency what is the centre of london for any purpose whatever de quincey asked and of course the city has no centre at all or rather the centre is everywhere wherever the houses are built that is londonstreatham highgate new cross all as characteristically and indefinably london as cheapside or the strand they were part of the malodorous coruscating city awakened from its grandeur and rising into shabby daylight as a wilderness of roofs and tenements not all were stable not all were noble this was another aspect of the ever expanding city there were areas which were only of fragile growth the various classes and subdivisions of classes were broadly segregated in distinct neighbourhoods the difference between workingclass lambeth and genteel camberwell both south of the river for example was immense but there were areas of more uncertain nature where the chances of going up or down were precariously balanced pimlico was one such neighbourhood it could have become grand or respectable but was constantly on the verge of shabbiness this in turn reflected a general anxiety among middleclass city dwellers it was easy to go under through drink or unemployment and the tense respectability of one year might be succeeded by wretchedness in the next will this newly built terrace along the walford road become the dwellings of ambitious city workers or will it degenerate into a set of tenements this was the unspoken question about much of londons development and then there was the immensity registered by its endless crowds that is why the urban fiction of the nineteenth century is filled with chance encounters and coincidental meetings with sudden looks and brief asides with what hg wells called a great mysterious movement of unaccountable beings travellers were frightened at streetcrossings where the sheer number and speed of pedestrians created the effect of a whirlpool a londoner jostles you in the street a german journalist observed without ever dreaming of asking your pardon he will run against you and make you revolve on your own axis without so much as looking round to see how you feel after the shock workers walked to the city from islington and pentonville but now they came in from deptford and bermondsey hoxton and hackney as well it has been estimated that in the s people walked into the city each day as roy porter has put it in london a social history dislocation and relocation were always occurringnothing ever stood still nothing was constant except mobility itself to be engaged in a process of perpetual growth and change for their own sake and to be sure of nothing but uncertainty may be discomfiting yet as the city expanded so continuously and so rapidly there was no possibility of walking over its vast extent as it grew so did other forms of traffic emerge to steer a way through its immensity the most extraordinary agent of innovation came with the advent of the railway nineteenthcentury london in the process of its great transformation was further changed by the building of euston in followed by waterloo kings cross paddington victoria blackfriars charing cross st pancras and liverpool street the entire railway network which is still in use almost years later was imposed upon the capital within a space of some twentyfive years between and the termini themselves became palaces of victorian invention and inventiveness erected by a society obsessed by speed and motion one consequence was that the city became truly the centre of the nation with all the lines of energy leading directly to it together with the electric telegraph the railways defined and maintained the supremacy of london it became the great conduit of communication and of commerce in a world in which railway time set the standard of the general hurry the influence was also felt much closer to the capital itself with the proliferation of branch or suburban lines in the northern and southern suburbs by the s there were connections between willesden and walthamstow dalston junction and broad street richmond and clapham junction new cross and london bridge the whole perimeter of the city being ineluctably drawn into its centre with characteristic stone arches on both sides of the river when william powell frith exhibited his painting of paddington station the railway station in the work had to be protected by railings from enthusiastic crowds they were fascinated by the crowds depicted upon the canvas itself conveying all the magnitude and immensity of the great railway enterprise nineteenthcentury londoners were drawn to the spectacle of themselves and of the achievements wrought in their name it was indeed a new city or at least the quality of experience within it had suffered a change somehow the great heavy urban mass had been controlled the new lines of transport which crossed it also managed to hold it down to elucidate it in terms of time and distance to direct its palpitating life the journey between vauxhall or charing cross and cannon street wrote blanchard jerrold presents to the contemplative man scenes of london life of the most striking description he is admitted behind the scenes of the poorest neighbourhoods surveys interminable terraces of back gardens alive with women and children london had become viewable and therefore legible there was the phenomenon of railwaymania too when the stocks and shares of the variously competing companies traded high in the city by parliament had agreed the building of railway tracks nineteen in london itself and it could be said that the whole country was transfixed by the idea of rail travel the railway even managed to recreate london in its own image thousands of houses were demolished to make way for its new tracks and it has been estimated that people were displaced in the process the opening of a new railway station provided mixed benefits older suburban retreats such as fulham and brixton came within range of the new commuters previously unable to live at such a distance from their place of work city dwellers poured in and small or cheap houses were constructed for them the growth of the railway system actually created new suburbs with the cheap trains act of materially assisting the exodus of the poorer people from the old tenements to new railway suburbs such as walthamstow and west ham areas such as kilburn and willesden became flooded with new population creating the vague monotony of terraced housing which still survives in these latter two districts lived the colonies of navvies who were themselves involved in the building of more railways but railways were by no means the only form of transportation within the capital it has been estimated that in the junction of cheapside and newgate was passed by an average of twenty three vehicles a minute during working hours this was the great roar like that of niagara by which the city dwellers were surrounded this vast crowd of moving vehicles comprised omnibuses and hansoms carts and trams horses and early cars broughams and motor buses taxis and victorias all somehow managing to manoeuvre through the crowded granite streets a wagon might break down and bring a long line of carriages to a halt a cart a carriage a dray and an omnibus might follow each other in slow procession while the quicker cabs darted between them in early moving pictures of londons traffic you see the boys running among the vehicles to clear up horsedung while pedestrians make sorties into the road with the same courage and defiance as they do still in photograph or on film it is a scene of indescribable energy as well as confusion it might be a bacterium or an entire cosmos so instinctive its movement seems a photograph of regent street in the nineteenth century with its relatively new phenomenon of the sandwich man as well as the horsedrawn omnibuses the porters at billingsgate were well known for their characteristic attire in a city of appearances and street theatre it was important to be dressed for the part no man whatever his trade was seen without a hat old houses in bermondsey at the end of the nineteenth century they were swept away or bombed while in their place arose one of the great council estates of south london clerkenwell green this inoffensive and often overlooked green in the middle of clerkenwell has been the site of more riots and more radical activity than any other part of london what is its secret river scavengers these were the real tradesmen of the city earning a meagre living by combing the banks of the tidal river women sifting dust mounds in a city where everything had its price there was money to be made out of refuse of every kind these women sometimes known as bunters inherited their noxious trade a wheel at the exhibition in the s and a similar wheel at bartholomews fair in the seventeenth century anticipated the modern wheel of the london eye in the year in a similar echoic spirit the modern lloyds building was erected on the site of the old london maypole william whiffins marvellous photograph of children following a water cart many london children went barefoot in all weathers however the stance and attitude of this ragged boy epitomise the defiance and independence of london children who were often brought up on the stones the miracle is that they survived at all a photograph of a millwall street taken in street games have been characteristic of london children ever since london was established and somehow the most barren districts have become areas of play not all streets however are shadowed by great ships the london particular was the name given to the characteristic fogs of the city which descended without warning and created darkness at noon this gaily dressed citizen is attempting to protect himself against what was considered to be a bearer of disease the smog of the fifties and sixties was a miasma of fog and smoke a paraleytic woman géricault visited london in the s and was at once intrigued and horrified by the predicament of the poor in a city based upon money the indigent and the vagrant are the sacrificial victims stanley green protein man walked up and down oxford street for many years parading the same dietary message he was commonly ignored by the great tide of people who washed around him and thus became a poignant symbol of the citys incuriosity and forgetfulness the ruins of paternoster row beside st pauls photographed during the airraids of the second world war by cecil beaton it had been a street of stationers and publishers for three hundred years but is now only a name don mccullins photograph taken near spitalfields in provides an image of anger and helplessness the poor and the desperate have always been a part of londons history and it might be said that the city is most recognisable by the shadow they cast the omnibus first emerged upon the streets of london in and twentyfive years later there were some three thousand of them each one carrying approximately three hundred passengers a day there is a painting of by james pollard entitled a street scene with two omnibuses which vividly recalls the transport of that period each of the two buses is being pulled by two horses in the first bus eight gentlemen in stovepipe hats are sitting on the open roof behind the driver while other passengers can be glimpsed sitting within the bus is painted green and in large letters along the side it is advertised as part of the favorite group a board on a post attached to the back proclaims that it drives between euston and chelsea while on the side are painted its other destinations the original fares were sixpence rising to a shilling so this form of transport was not favoured by the labouring classes of london yet steady competition reduced the prices of tickets to twopence or a penny the first journey of the day was filled with office clerks and a second with their employers the merchants and the bankers towards midday the ladies entered the bus for shopping expeditions together with mothers taking their children for a ride in the evening the vehicles were filled with all those returning to the suburbs from the city while in the other direction travelled those who were out for the night at the theatres or supperclubs a traveller in noted that the omnibus is a necessity and the londoner cannot get on without it and added that the word bus is rapidly working its way into general acceptation he remarked upon the prepossessing appearance of these carriages brightly painted red or green or blue as well as the high spirits of conductors and drivers alike the former shouted out all right and banged the roof of the vehicle to signal that it was time to move on and all through the journey he was never silent but calling out destinations continuallybank bank the london horses deserve attention and celebration also because their training in the streets and their natural sagacity meant that they could proceed through the crowded thoroughfares at a good pace without causing accidents one late victorian recalled that at one of those moments when traffic came to a halt he could see hundreds of horses which tossed their heads and blew air from their nostrils while their drivers shouted and bellowed greetings and pleasantries to one another of all vehicles however the hansomcab became most closely associated with victorian london introduced in it was a fourwheeled vehicle with an interior more comfortable than that of the previous twowheeled cab and with the driver at a more impersonal distance behind the carriage once again the changing appearances of transport reflected the changing culture of london but if the form of the cabs was altered the appearance and manner of their drivers remained constant they were well known for their chaff or insolence and their dishonesty whenever a stranger is bold enough to hail a cab not one but half a dozen come at once this german travellers observation is supported by other accounts of the violent competitiveness of cabdrivers all over the capital they became the tutelary spirits or imps of the road although there were statutory fees they would attempt to bargain with the customary phrase what will you give they were also notorious for their drunkenness and in turn for their argumentativeness an old londoner only may venture to engage in a topographical or geometrical disputation with a cabman for gentlemen of this class are not generally flattering in their expressions or conciliating in their arguments and the cheapest way of terminating the dispute is to pay and have done with the man the drivers of the hansom cabs were as full as exacting and impertinent as their humbler brethren the drivers of the growlers or fourwheeled cabs but they had more spirit most skilful in winding and edging their light vehicles through the most formidable knot of wagons and carriages londons cabdrivers epitomise the spirit of the cityfast restless audacious with a propensity for violence and drunkenness they are closely related to the butchers and the streetcriers whose trades are also intimately attached to the life of the city all part of londons family by the end of the nineteenth century there were more than ten thousand cabs of various kinds and even the new thoroughfares could scarcely accommodate the onrushing flood of vehicles of every description sometimes the crush grew too great and there was a stop or lock in the twentieth century a jam nevertheless it is a matter for astonishment that through the centuries the city has managed to keep its avenues and thoroughfares open to the ever increasing demands of its traffic at the beginning of the twentyfirst century the endless stream of cars and buses and taxis and lorries is coursing along roads which were built in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for quite different forms of transport the city has the ability to recreate itself silently and invisibly as if it were truly a living thing londons outcasts géricaults engraving entitled pity the sorrows of a poor old man emphasises the isolation and misery of the london outcasts the companionship of a dog continues to be a token of the wandering life in the city chapter they are always with us mrs ambrose understood that after all it is the ordinary thing to be poor and that london is the city of innumerable poor people this sentence from virginia woolfs the voyage out expresses a great truth about the nineteenth century in which she was born the poor have always been part of the texture of the city they are like the stones or the bricks because london has risen from them their mute suffering has no limits in the medieval city the old the crippled the deformed and the mad were the first poor those who could not work and thus had no real or secure place in the social fabric became the outcast by the sixteenth century there were poor sections of the city such as east smithfield st katherine by the tower and the mint in southwark it could be said that by some instinctive process the poor clustered together or it might be concluded that parts of the city harboured them they were hawkers or pedlars or criers or chimneysweeps but they belong to that underclass which defoe described as the miserable that really pinch and suffer want in eighteenthcentury accounts we read of squalid courts and miserable houses of dirty neglected children and slipshod women of dirty naked unfurnished rooms and of men who stayed within them because their clothes had become too ragged to submit to daylight scrutiny those who lacked even this primitive accommodation slept in empty or abandoned houses they sheltered in bulks or in doorways in london life in the eighteenth century m dorothy george estimated that by that centurys end there were in london above twenty thousand miserable individuals of various classes who rise up every morning without knowing how they are to be supported during the passing day or where in many instances they are to lodge on the succeeding night this has been plausibly related to the general uncertainty of life and trade characteristic of the period so we may say that the underlying nature of london is most visible or most sharply manifested in the lives and appearance of its poorest inhabitants other city dwellers rendered fearful shunned the poor the very presence of the poor increased the morbid nervousness and restlessness of all londoners we see the shape of the city from the shadow that it casts that shadow can be traced within the contours of charles booths poverty map of where blocks of black and dark blue denoting the lowest class vicious semicriminal and the very poor casual chronic want creep among the red and gold bars of the affluent a largerscale map outlining the districts of the poor identified poverty in areas each of about inhabitants here the dark blue areas cluster around the banks of the thames but elsewhere there is a pattern of concentric rings with the most uniform poverty at the centre they were londonborn and londonbred in paddington and in pimlico in whitechapel and in wapping in battersea and bermondsey travellers noticed impoverishment everywhere and commented how degrading and degraded were the london poor quite different from their counterparts in rome or berlin or paris in hippolyte taine remarked that he recalled the lanes which open off oxford street stifling alleys thick with human effluvia troops of pale children crouching on filthy staircases the street benches at london bridge where all night whole families huddle close heads hanging shaking with cold abject miserable poverty in a city based upon money and power those who are moneyless and powerless are peculiarly oppressed in london of all cities they are literally degraded stripped of all human decency by the operations of a city that has no other purpose except greed that is why the poor were abject in the streets of nineteenthcentury london and as the city increased in power and magnitude so did the numbers of the poor increase they represented almost a city within the city and such a large aggregate of human misery could not be ignored john hollingsheads ragged london published in suggested that onethird of the urban population lived in unwholesome layers one over the other in old houses and confined rooms which themselves were to be found in filthy ill constructed courts and alleys the atmosphere of disgust and menace here is only barely suppressed in london mrs cook concluded in highways and byways of london misery is strangely prolific which suggests that the fear of the poor derived from the fact that they were likely to multiply indefinitely she was speaking of the borough there poverty and misery seemed to have grown to such an extent that southwark was overcome by it but she could have been referring to a hundred other parts of the city the places of the poor were pestilential according to the author of the bitter cry of outcast london in thus confirming the fear that this kind of abject poverty and degradation was in the conditions of london somehow contagious the futility and the despair might spread throughout the rookeries where tens of thousands are crowded together amidst horrors it is as if the streets themselves engendered these huddled masses a newspaper report of named nichols street new nichols street half nichols street turville street comprising within the same area numerous blind courts and alleys here the litany of street names itself is meant to conjure up degeneration where the outward moral degradation is at once apparent to any one who passes that way so the houses and lanes themselves are guilty of moral degradation does the city reflect its inhabitants or do its inhabitants mimic the conditions of the city dwellers and dwelling places become inexact metaphors for one another as in this passage from jack londons the people of the abyss everything is helpless hopeless unrelieved and dirty the people themselves are dirty while any attempt at cleanliness becomes howling farce when it is not pitiful and tragic the father returning from work asks his child in the street where her mother is and back the answer comes in the buildings observers were generally agreed that the life of the poor had reached such a level of hopelessness and squalor that a new race has sprung up and further that it is now hereditary to a very considerable extent if victorian london was itself so changed as to have become a new city here was the new population with which it was filled this was the urban phenomenon which engels diagnosed and which he watched closely in st giles the extent to which these filthy passages are fallen into decay beggars all description the walls are crumbling the door posts and window frames are loose and rotten marx lived a few yards away in soho so the condition of the midnineteenthcentury city directly inspired the founders of communism it might be said that their creed issued out of the slums of london and those victorian observers who believed that some great or alarming new reality would emerge from the pervasive presence of the poor were not wholly wrong the london poor did indeed generate a new race or class but in countries and civilisations far distant in long acre engels noticed the children are sickly and halfstarved he conceded that the worst forms of poverty were not visited upon all london workers but every working man without exception may well suffer a similar fate through no fault of his own this was one of the most tenacious visions of poverty as a palpable threat this the despair that the city could breed precisely because the conditions of london itself were enough to drive people into the slums the uncertainty of employment for example was one of the most pressing reasons why people broke to use an early nineteenthcentury word and were reduced to beggary a cold winter meant that dockers and building workers were thrown out of work or in the phrase of the period turned off to turn someone offin an age when all the talk was of energy and of electricity this was the ultimate dehumanising and degrading force areas where the poor lived were also turned off the city had grown so large that they could be concealed in its depths engels quotes one clergyman who declared that i never witnessed such thorough prostration of the poor as i have seen since i have been in bethnal green but who reiterated that this area was quite unknown to and unvisited by other londoners in other quarters of the city about as little was known of this destitute parish as the wilds of australia or the islands of the south seas the image of the wilderness once more emerges but now with connotations of darkness and impenetrability here again was another monstrous feature of the great metropolis where rich and poor could live side by side without noticing each others existence engels quotes from an editorial in the times of october which suggested that within the most courtly precincts of the richest city of gods earth there may be found night after night winter after winter famine filth and disease from this vantage engels looked at the whole society of london and concluded that it was not sane or whole the more that londoners are packed into a tiny space the more repulsive and disgraceful becomes the brutal indifference with which they ignore their neighbours and selfishly concentrate upon their private affairs so london has created a new phase in human existence itself its poverty has in a real sense impoverished all who in the mad pursuit of getting and spending have created a human society of component atoms a new race was therefore being created not only in the tenements of st giles but over the whole face of london where the vast majority have had to let so many of their potential creative faculties lie dormant stunted and unused engels suggests that this is the real poverty within the city which only a revolution could extirpate nineteenthcentury london then created the first characteristically urban society on the face of the earth what now we take for grantedthey rush past each other as if they had nothing in commonwas then greeted with distaste for anyone who marvelled at the greatness and vastness of the victorian city there were others who were disturbed and horrified here in the streets of london real social conflict the war of all against all actually existed it was a harbinger of the future world a cancer that would not only spread throughout england but eventually cover the great globe itself one of the great studies of poverty in late nineteenthcentury london was and remains charles booths life and labour of the people in london it ran to seventeen volumes and went through three editions like the city that it was examining it was on the largest possible scale a monumental work it is filled with suggestive details and suffused by a curious pity it is in fact the vision of london lives which renders booths work so significant the last occupant of the back room was a widower scavenger to board of works a man who would not believe in hell or heaven at no lives a carman in brokendown health he fell off his cart and being run over broke his leg on the floor above is a very poor old lady living on charity but a happy soul expectant of heaven in the neighbourhood lived a man who was a notorious atheist one who holds forth on behalf of his creed under railway arches saying that if there be a god he must be a monster to permit such misery as exists this man suffers from heart disease and the doctor tells him that some day in his excitement he will drop down dead these are the permanent inhabitants of london on the ground floor live mr and mrs meek meek is a hatter and was engaged in dyeing childrens hats in a portable boiler a cheery little man at the back lives mrs helmot whose husband formerly an optician is now at hanwell suffering from suicidal melancholia all the variety of human experience is revealed here the cheerful hatmaker and the suicidal optician are more suggestive than any characters in nineteenthcentury urban fiction it is as if the city had become a sort of desert island upon which its occupants picked their way but there was another life which against all the odds kept on breaking through how the poor live a nurse told booth when they are helpless remains a mystery save for their great kindness to each other even to those who are strangers this is the great explanation a nonconformist preacher also told him that it is only the poor that really give they know exactly the wants of one another and give when needed a roman catholic priest informed him to each other their goodness is wonderful here is another reality lying concealed beneath all the descriptions of filth and squalor the intimate experience of shared suffering did not necessarily injure the spirits of the very poor the conditions of urban life could lead to despair and drunkenness and death but there was at least the possibility of another form of human expression in kindness and generosity to those trapped within the same harsh and noisome reality booth ends his account with a memorable paragraph the dry bones that lie scattered over the long valley that we have traversed together lie before my reader may some great soul master of a subtler and nobler alchemy than mine disentangle the confused issues reconcile the apparent contradictions in aim melt and commingle the various influences for good into one divine uniformity of effort and make these dry bones live so that the streets of our jerusalem may sing with joy it is an astonishing revelation charles booth more than any other man understood the horror and the misery of nineteenthcentury london yet he invoked the image of a joyful jerusalem to conclude his discourse by the time he had completed his labours which took eighteen years booth recognised that the very worst conditions had been alleviated but only the very worst many of the slums had been removed some of their erstwhile inhabitants moving to model dwellings or to the newly established council houses on council estates improved sanitation and a more general concern with urban hygiene also affected the lot of the poor in marginal ways but where would the city be without its poor a survey conducted in the late s the new survey of london life and labour calculated that per cent of londoners were still living in poverty the same figure however has been reestimated in other contexts as percent and per cent this illustrates the problems in any discussion of povertylevels of deprivation are relative but relative to what the depression of the s for example led to the creation of what were then known as the new poor and another survey in reported that per cent of london families lived beneath the poverty line there was no famine but there was malnutrition there were fewer rags but still a plethora of ragged clothes the first decades of the twentieth century were marked by hunger marches and marches of the unemployed the effects of which were mitigated by the introduction of unemployment benefit and more enlightened use of the poor laws yet poverty never leaves london it merely changes its form and appearance in a recent survey into measures of deprivation the highest counts were in southwark lambeth hackney and tower hamlets formerly bethnal green and stepney these are precisely the areas where the poor of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries congregated so there is a continuity of need or distress clustering around significant localities asian children now play in old nichol street and turville street and the area is curiously silent after its raucous and terrible life as the jago the area of shoreditch immortalised in arthur morrisons a child of the jago poverty has now become less noisy and noisome than in any of its previous incarnations but it is present nonetheless an intrinsic and instinctive part of the city were there no poor then there would be no rich like the women who accompanied eighteenthcentury armies dependent and defenceless so do the poor accompany london on its progress it created the poor it needed the poor not least for the purpose of cheap or casual labour now they have become the shadows which follow it everywhere chapter can you spare a little something the most visible manifestations of poverty came to london in the form of mendicants and beggars they were arguing with each other at the end of the fourteenth century john dray in his own person denied the charge and said that on the day and in the place mentioned he and the said ralph were sitting together and begging when john stowe a monk of westminster came by and gave them a penny in common ralph received the penny but would not give dray his share a quarrel arose and ralph assaulted him with a stick such a scene could have occurred centuries before or centuries after where else could a beggar find a better plot than london itself filled with people and according to legend replete with money there were religious mendicants or hermits mumbling in stone alcoves beside the principal gates of the city there were lame beggars on street corners there were prison beggars calling out for alms from the gratings which held them there were old women begging outside churches there were children begging in the street in the early twentyfirst century some of the principal thoroughfares are lined with beggars young and old some lie huddled in doorways wrapped in blankets and stare up with imploring faces with the customary cry spare any change the older of them tend to be drunken vagrants existing altogether out of time which is as much to say that they uncannily resemble their counterparts in previous ages of londons history sir thomas more recalled the crowds of beggars who swarmed around the gates of the monasteries of london and in the late medieval city it was common practice for servants of great houses and institutions to gather up the broken bread and meat of a public feast in order to distribute them to the supplicants begging for dole outside the doors in one of his english works more wrote i se somtyme my selfe so many poore folke at westmynster at the dolys that my self for the preace of them haue ben fayn to ryde another waye but though he would have preferred to ride in another direction avoiding the press and the smell of them he alighted and spoke to one of them when more praised the generosity of the westminster monks he drew the retort that it was no thanks to them since their lands had been given to them by good princes the beggars were desperate but not destitute of resentment or a certain type of moral clarity the position of a beggar in london is that of a supplicant but through the ages it has always been compounded by bitterness or anger at the condition to which he or she has been reduced citizens gave them money out of embarrassment as much as pity there were already shamming beggars who counterfeited deformity or sickness but it was not yet a trade of shame some of their names have come down to us from the twelfth century among them george a greene robert the devil and william longbeard reputed to be the king of london beggars in the reign of henry ii william longbeard sought sanctuary in st mary le bow after causing disturbances in cheapside eventually he was smoked out by the officers of the court but he was one of those early outcasts whose dispossession was a mark of pride they were people wedded to poverty and isolation who therefore became symbols of unaccommodated humankind doe we not all come into the worlde like arrant beggars without a rag upon us thomas dekker wrote in the early seventeenth century doe we not all go out of the worlde like beggars saving an old sheete to cover us and shall we not all walke up and downe in the worlde like beggars with an old blankett pinned about if god made humankind in his own image then what curious brokendown divinity did these men and women display this was the superstitious awe which the beggars provoked in those who passed them in the sixteenth century first emerged brotherhoods of beggars who went by such names as the roaring boys the bonaventoes the quarters and the bravadoes they collected in whitefriars and moorditch and hoxton the field of lincolns inn and the porch of st bartholomew the great the last two locations are still used by vagrants today all of them smoked pipes as an emblem of their status and were well known for their violence and their drunkenness in coplandes hye way to the spitel hous he depicts beggars dolefully singing along the approach to st pauls from the east and reports one beggar asking him to make this farthyng worth a halfpenny for the fyve joyes of our blessed lady thomas harman published accounts of london beggars in pamphlet form emphasising their more sensational attributes and exploits of one richard horwood a londoner he writes well nigh eighty years old he will bite a sixpenny nail assunder with his teeth and a bawdy drunkard to boot in the spring of henry viii issued a proclamation against vagrants and beggars who haunted the bancke and such like naughtie places they were to be whipped or burned or imprisoned upon a diet of bread and water but nothing could stop their coming the pace of enclosures in the countryside left many unemployed and homeless and the return of soldiers from foreign wars increased that turbulent element to these were added the native unemployed or unemployable maisterless men as they were called to denote very firmly the fact that they were not part of the social fabric established upon hierarchy in some thousands of maisterless men were imprisoned and in the same year the citizens manned their gates in order to prevent the entry of any groups of beggars all the barges from gravesend and other likely points of departure were searched from this period may date the doggerel hark hark the dogges do bark the beggars are coming to town in a city of wealth the insurrection of the poor is that which is most feared in elizabeth i was riding by aldersgate bars towards the fields of islington when she was surrounded by a group of sturdy beggars which gave the queen much disturbance that evening the recorder fleetwood scoured the fields and arrested seventyfour of them eight years later a band of five hundred beggars threatened to sack bartholomew fair at the same time they held their own fair durrest fair where stolen goods were sold by it was estimated that there were beggars inhabiting the city a large group of disaffected people who alternately cajoled or threatened the other citizens one method of assault was the whining chorus complete with wooden clappers and doleful songs such as one small piece of money among us all poor wretches blind and lame for his sake that gave all pitiful worship one little doit their technique depended upon their terrible appearance and their whining words yet the city can harbour many forms and many disguises in the middle of the seventeenth century thomas harman observed one vagrant genings who begged about the temple he described how his body lay out bare a filthy foul cloth he wear on his head being cut for the purpose having but a narrow place to put out his face having his face from the eyes downward all smeared with blood as though he had new fallen and had been tormented with his painful pangs his jerkin being all bewrayed with dirt and mire surely the sight was monstrous and terrible harman suspicious of his manner hired two boys to watch and follow him they discovered that after his days work at the temple he would return to the fields behind clements inn where he renewed his stains from a bladder of sheeps blood and daubed fresh mud over his legs and arms apprehended by the parish watch he was found to have a large sum of money on his person he was forcibly washed and seen to be a handsome stalwart with a yellow beard and astonishingly fair skin his genius for disguise served him well in a city enthralled to spectacle and enamoured by appearances how else could he make his mark upon the swiftly passing scene without being theatrical to the highest degree there emerged beggars who posed as madmen otherwise known as lurkers on the abram sham they would stand on street corners showing the mark of bedlamerupon their arms master good worship bestow your reward on a poore man that hath lyen in bedlam without bishopsgate three years four moneths and nine days bestow one piece of your small silver towards his fees which he is indebted there they would stick pins and nails into their flesh as a symbol of their lunacy they would roar imprecations or speak madly of themselves as poor tom characteristically they wore the same garmenta jerkin with hanging sleeveswith their hair tangled in knots they carried with them a stick of ashwood with a piece of bacon tied to the end of it this in turn suggests that their mad medley became something of a theatrical routine and that their presence on the london streets became an integral part of its scenery of suffering yet mingled with them also were the genuinely mad it has been supposed that the beggars brotherhoods of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries were quite formal affairs with their own rites of initiation ceremonies and rules of procedure each beggar was given a nickname on joining their fellowshipgreat bull madam wapapace hye shreve and so onand recited a list of beggar commandments these included such admonitions as thou shalt share all winnings and thou shalt not divulge the secret of the canting tongue this tongue was not in fact unknown to londoners who incorporated some of its terms into cockney but it was unique nevertheless it was composed of various tags and terms from other languageswelsh irish dutch cockney and latin among them so it was in one sense an international argot in canting speech pannass was bread and patrico a priest solomon an altar and prat a buttock chete was variously applied to different things so crashing chetes were teeth grunting chetes were pigs and lullaby chetes were children life itself it might be said was a chete the canting tongue was said to have been invented somewhere about and its originator to have been hanged in all the pamphlets and books of beggars certain key individuals emerge as types or emblems of beggary there was london meg of westminster who in the early seventeenth century became barmaid of the eagle inn and was very soon notorious as a receiver of stolen goods and protector of stray vagabonds she was the first of the roaring girls one of a number of roistering and redoubtable females who walked a fine line between vagabondage thievery and thuggery she was of quick capacitie and pleasant disposition of a liberall heart and such a one as would be sodainely angry and soone pleased she liked nothing better than at night to dress as a man and wander through the streets of london in search of adventure she became one of those pure urban types who are filled with the excitement and spirit of the city the fact of her crossdressing serves only to emphasise the crude theatricality of her exploits in a crude and theatrical setting in her life however the emphasis clearly shifts from beggary to criminality the historians of the subject led astray by contemporary pamphleteers often fail to distinguish between vagrants and villains thus compounding the original misperceptions which labelled every beggar a potential criminal the fact that not all beggars were villains however is suggested by the available records of the parish registers to a poore woman and her children almost starved for a shroude for hunters child the blind beggar man given to a poore wretch name forgot to mr hibbs daughter with childe and likely to starve to william burneth in a sellar in ragged staffyard being poore and verie sicke on a statistical as well as a personal level the poverty and beggary of london reached crisis proportions in the s so the beggars filled the streets it was no longer a question of brotherhoods with sanctuaries in cold harbour or southwark or white friars but something altogether more basic and desperate a seventeenthcentury report a discourse of trade noted that the poor were in a most sad and wretched condition some famished for want of bread others starved with cold and nakedness it has been suggested that the industrial expansion of the eighteenth century materially helped to lessen the number of beggars more specifically in the latter part of the century changes in parish systems and the diminution of gindrinking after the s are supposed to have thinned their numbers but there is no real evidence of this there was simply a change in the nature of beggary itself in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries the characteristic pattern was of beggars forming crowds or groups or settlements in their place emerged the solitary or individual beggar of which one fictional example was moll flanders i dressd myself like a beggar woman in the coarsest and most despicable rags i could get and i walkd about peering and peeping into every door and window i came near but moll learns the lesson which is imparted in time to every beggar that this was a dress that every body was shy and afraid of and i thought every body lookd at me as if they were afraid i should come near them least i should take something from them or afraid to come near me least they should get something from me what should they get from her abuse spittle or more likely disease beggars were the representatives of the citys depths and the citys dirt so although in the early nineteenth century there were still reports of bands or gangs of beggars roaming within the metropolis particularly after the ending of the napoleonic wars the general focus of interpretation was upon the individual figure it is a strange reversal of the dominant mood when classes were emerging from the heterogeneity of eighteenthcentury london and when the whole emphasis came to rest upon the systems of the city yet this process itself rendered the individual beggar more isolated and in a literal sense déclassé in jt smith published vagabondiana or anecdotes of mendicant wanderers through the streets of london with portraits of the most remarkable drawn from the life which emphasised the postures and expressions of the blind and the crippled one example is that of a legless jewish mendicant of petticoat lane in which an aged patriarch with a battered hat sits in a kind of wooden cart upon wheels behind him is a wall with a graffito of a grinning man or skeleton a hundred years before the hordes of vagrants would have defied individual representation four years later the french painter théodore géricault depicted two scenes of poverty and beggary on the streets it was the year after he had exhibited the raft of the medusa in the egyptian hall off piccadilly and all the tenderness of his nature found expression in pity the sorrows of a poor old man whose trembling limbs have born him to your door and a paraleytic woman in the first of them the helpless old man leans against a wall he is accompanied by a dog with an old twisted rope for a lead the dog the bufe in beggars cant has always been the companion of the london outcast its presence not only suggests a wandering life but also marks a type of friendlessness and isolation the dog is the beggars only companion in this world of need it has connotations too of blindness and general affliction in géricaults second sketch a young mother and child look back at the paralysed old woman with a gaze both of pity and of apprehension once more her solitude is being emphasised quite different from the solidarity and conviviality of the beggar brotherhoods there is another aspect of this isolation in the sense that no one wishes to come too close the fear of contagion proves too strong it is not just the contagion of disease however but that of fear and anxiety what if i were to become like you the records of nineteenthcentury streetlife are filled with memories and recollections of these phantoms perhaps some of my readers mayhew once wrote may remember having noticed a wretchedlooking youth who hung over the words i am starving chalked on the footway on the surrey side of waterloo bridge he lay huddled in a heap and appeared halfdead with cold and want his shirtless neck and shoulders being visible through the rents in his thin jean jacket shoe or stocking he did not wear the author of highways and byways of london recalled an old man who had a particular corner along oxford streetfeeble pitiful wizened who carried an empty black bag and stretched it out to me appealingly the contents if any of the black bag i never discovered but i often gave him a penny simply because he was so unutterably pathetic he is gone now and his place knows him no more but he always haunts my dreams there was a crippled beggar who always sat under the picture gallery in trafalgar square his frail body propped on a padded crutch and his lean long fingers fluttering the keys of an old accordion joanna schopenhauer the mother of the philosopher published her account of london in and left her description of one remarkable beggar who was supposed to be the sister of mrs siddons the actress she had been brought low by misfortune and perhaps madness but was always greeted with a curious reverence on the streets of london where she preferred to live on the charity of strangers we often saw this curious apparition she always wore a black silk hat which left her face and features clearly visible a green woollen dress a large snowwhite apron and a kerchief also white she was supported by two crutches and never begged or asked for anything yet still those who passed her felt obliged even driven to give her something she was a native of the streets a tutelary presence to which offerings had to be made charles lamb wrote an essay in the s entitled a complaint of the decay of beggars in the metropolis which remarked upon one of those sporadic and inconclusive attempts by the civic authorities to clear the streets there have through the centuries been proclamations and policies but the beggars always return lamb in elegiac mood however anticipated their passing the mendicants of this great city were so many of her sights her lions i can no more spare them than i could the cries of london no corner of the street is complete without them they are as indispensable as the balladsinger and in their picturesque attire as ornamental as the signs of old london the beggar somehow embodies the city perhaps because he or she is an eternal type like the games and songs of children endlessly recurrent as lamb suggests the beggar is the only man in the universe who is not obliged to study appearances the ups and downs of the world concern him no longer beyond the fleeting appearances of the world he represents unchanging identity so beggars became the standing morals emblems mementoes dialmottos the spital sermons the books for children the salutary checks and pauses to the high and rushing tide of greasy citizenrylook upon that poor and broken bankrupt there the example of the bankrupt is apposite in a city devoted to the pursuit of money there is a dignity to be derived from complete impoverishment and in his rags the beggar was a standing reproach to those intent upon appearances by the midcentury when all forms of urban existence were under intense scrutiny the beggar became the object of research and record the growth of social control and system in midvictorian london for example covered the phenomenon of beggary a mendicity society was established in red lion square where all the beggars of the metropolis were classified and described charles dickens was in many respects a generous benefactor to the poor but he was never slow to report an apparently shamming beggar or beggingletter writer to the society charles babbage the inventor of the analytic engine and father of the computer as well as the author of tables of logarithms made a systematic study of london beggars he records that walking home from the hot rooms of an evening party he was often followed through a drizzling rain by a halfclad miserable female with an infant in her arms and sometimes accompanied by another just able to walk begging for a little charity he asked for details of their circumstances and discovered that they lied to him he was once introduced in a dense fog to a pale emaciated man who in the words of the owner of a common lodging house has tasted nothing during the last two days but water from the pump on the opposite side of the street babbage gave him some clothes and a little money and the young man said that he was about to accept a situation of steward in a small west indiaman but again he was lying he had been living riotously at some publichouse in another quarter and had been continually drunk so charles babbage brought him before the magistrates he was remanded for a week duly lectured and discharged what are we to make of these examples of london beggars they were the outcasts of the city first seen in drizzling rain or dense fog like exhalations of the lead and stone they lived upon the margins of existence and in all cases seemed doomed to an early death the stages of emaciation and drunkenness in the young man followed quickly upon one another they were persistent cheats and liars because they had no connection with the ordered and comfortable society which babbage represented their reality was so precarious that they had nothing left to lose they were living in a different state of human existence only london could harbour them one fear behind these attempts at survey and statistic was that which touched upon the most primitive impulse what if the beggars were multiplying out of control the crop one late nineteenthcentury writer put it has kept pace with the increase of the population that was the great fear the engendering of a species clinging so closely to london that it could not be distinguished or removed from it it was also feared that the changes in urban society would reproduce themselves in the nature of beggary itself so that as blanchard jerrold put it the cheat has developed the vagrant has become a systematic traveller the beggar has a hundred stories which the rascal of old could not employ there were disaster beggars for example which included shipwrecked mariners blown up miners burnt out tradesmen and lucifer droppers the unfortunate mariner is familiar to the london public in connection with rudely executed paintings representing either a ship wreck or more commonly the destruction of a boat by a whale in the north seas this painting they spread upon the pavement fixing it at the corners if the day be windy with stones there were generally two men in attendance and in most cases one of them had lost an arm or a leg curiously enough the nineteenthcentury handbooks on beggary are very much like their sixteenthcentury counterparts there is the same emphasis upon the dramatic ability of the beggar together with the repertoire of his or her favourite tricks and dodges it is almost as if a separate race had indeed perpetuated itself like any native population they had their particular beats or districts and were identified by such there were the pye street beggars and the st giles beggars while individuals did their own particular runs i always keep on this side of tottenham court road a blind beggar confided to an investigator in the s i never go over the road my dog knows that i am going down there thats cheniesstreet oh i know where i am next turning to the right is alfredstreet the next to the left is francisstreet and when i get to the end of that the dog will stop so london can be mapped out through routes of supplication the beggars also learned the temperament of their fellow dwellers in the city the rich and the middle class gave nothing at all on the assumption that all beggars were impostors this was of course the theme of official and quasiofficial reports which they willingly and gladly accepted in a city beginning to be ruled by system systematic prejudice also emerged if the power of reasoning were universally allotted to mankind wrote john binny the author of thieves and swindlers there would be a poor chance for the professional beggar the more affluent sort of tradesmen were also immune to appeal but beggars were successful amongst tradesmen of the middle class and among the poor working people their particular benefactors were the wives of working men which corresponds to the testimony of others that the london poor were charitable to the poor whose need was greater than their own it suggests also that contrary to public opinion not all beggars were impostors there were some who summoned up fellow feeling by the end of the nineteenth century the beggars complained that their lives and careers were being threatened by the twin forces of the new police and the mendicity society but there is no sure way of discovering whether their numbers were significantly diminished certainly contemporary statistics and descriptions would suggest that they were still swarming to employ a favourite term over the metropolis indeed it would be sensible to suggest that the larger the population the greater the number of beggars memoirs of the early twentieth century do not report bands or troupes of beggars but specific individuals who customarily made a pretence of selling matches or lozenges as a cover for begging they were required to own a hawkers licence which cost five shillings a year and then they selected their patch one on the corner of the west end lane and finchley road used to wind up a gramophone another used to wander along corbyn road with a single box of matches there was an organgrinder called shorty who used to work whitechapel and the commercial road there was mr matthewman who used to sit outside finchley road underground station with a pedlars pack and a tin mug these are all stray cases but they impart the flavour of london begging between the wars the author of londons underworld thomas holmes remarks it is all so pitiful it is too much for me for sometimes i feel that i am living with them tramping with them sleeping with them eating with them i become as one of them it is the sensation of vertigo of being drawn to the edge of the precipice in order to throw oneself down how easy it must be to become one of them and willingly to go under this is the other possibility which the city affords it offers freedom from ordinary cares and all the evidence suggests that many beggars actually enjoyed their liberty to wander and to watch the world the sellers of bootlaces and matches have gone and in their place in the twentyfirst century have come the homeless who sleep in doorways they carry their blankets with them as a token of their status some of them have all the characteristics of their predecessors they are slowwitted or drunken or in some other way disabled from leading an ordinary existence others are shrewd and quickwitted and not unwilling to practise the old arts of shamming but such cases perhaps form the minority others find that they are genuinely unable to cope with the demands of the city they fear the world too much or find it difficult to acquire friends and form relationships what will the world of london seem to them then it becomes a place which the dispossessed and homeless of all ages have experienced a maze of suspicion aggression and small insults the vagrants have always had to accommodate themselves to the hardness and incuriosity of londoners in his poem the approach to st pauls james thomson is jostled by anxious crowds whose heart and brain were so absorbed in dreams of mammongain that they could spare no time to look upon to look upon what those who had fallen along the way it happens only in so large a place as london samuel johnson suggests where people are not known this unseen world exists still in the early twentyfirst century although it has changed its outward form the closepacked tenements of stepney have gone but the highrise estates have taken their place the hereditary casuals have been replaced by those seeking benefit the shelters of london have become the homes of the dispossessed marked by what honor marshall describes in twilight london as mental disorder family disruption in particular the broken marriage chronic ill health recidivism prostitution alcoholism in wellclose square there was a mission designed to harbour the people nobody wants the rejected and the discarded who would otherwise simply fade into the streets they fade because nobody sees them there are certain busy places of london like the forecourt of charing cross station where lines of people queue for soup from a salvation army mobile canteen but for the crowds hurrying past them it is as if they were not there at all a beggar can lie immobile among happy crowds of people drinking outside a pub unacknowledged and unregarded in turn these dispossessed people gradually lose all contact with the external world and in london it is easier to go under than in any other part of the country a recent survey of a night shelter in central london reported in no way home by s randall revealed that four fifths of young people were from outside london and most were recent arrivals the city is as ever voracious a quarter had been in care half had already slept rough and nearly threequarters did not know where they were going next they were characteristically in ill health with inadequate clothing and no money this night shelter was at centrepoint beside the site of the old rookery of st giles where previous migrants to london had lived in rags chapter they outvoted me london drives some of its citizens mad a psychiatric survey in the s revealed that cases of depressive illness were three times higher in the east end than in the rest of the country schizophrenia was also a common condition as early as the fourteenth century the hospital of st mary of bethlem had begun to care for those sick in mind pore naked bedlam toms acold god almighty bless thy five witstoms acold their cries might also have been heard in st mary barking a hospital for priests and inhabitants of london both male and female who were inflicted with insanity yet it is through bethlem that london has always been associated with insanity thomas more asked if the city itself were not a great madhouse with all its afflicted and distracted so that bethlem became the epitome or little world of london in the records suggest that there were nine inmates supervised by a master a porter and his wife as well as a number of servants but the number of patients steadily increased in the chronicles of london dated there is a reference to a church of our lady that is named bedlam and in that place be found many men that be fallen out of their wit and full honestly they be kept in that place and some be restored unto their wit and health again and some be abiding therein forever for they be fallen so much out of themselves that is incurable to man some were allowed to leave the madmans pound as it was known in order to wander the streets as mendicants a tin badge on the left arm signified their status and they were variously known as gods minstrels or anticks there was dread and superstition as well as pity surrounding them in the streets of the city they might be regarded as tokens of the citys madness they were wandering spiritssometimes abject and sometimes prophetic sometimes melancholy and sometimes denunciatorycalling attention to the naked human condition in a city that prided itself upon its artifice and civilisation early sixteenthcentury maps show bedlame gate beside the highway of bishopsgate you opened this gate and walked into a courtyard with a number of small stone buildings here was a church and a garden there were thirtyone of the insane crowded into a space designed for twentyfour where the cryings screechings roarings brawlings shaking of chains swearings frettings chafings are so many so hideous so great that they are more able to drive a man that hath his wits rather out of them the usual treatment was the whip and the chain in an inventory are mentioned six chains with locks and keys belonging to them four pairs of iron manacles five other chains of iron and two pairs of stocks thomas more writes in that century of a man who had ben put uppe in bedelem and afterward by betyinge and correccyon gathered hys remembraunce to hym so it can be assumed that punishment or correction was considered efficacious you had to be brave to be mad by the early seventeenth century bedlam had become the only hospital used for the incarceration of lunaticks the preponderance of them were vagrants apprentices and servants with a sprinking of scholars and gentlemen of the fifteen vagrants eleven were women there were many wandering the streets of london who might be deemed mad and could be thrown into the compter for the night but they generally remained at liberty the large proportion of female vagrants among the inmates of bedlam approximately one in three also throws a suggestive light on the life of the london streets one inmate was lady eleanor davis who was confined in the winter of for proclaiming herself a prophet she was kept in the stewards house rather than in the ordinary ward but she later complained that bedlam itself was like hellsuch were the blasphemies and the noisome scenes it was the house of such restless cursing and she complained that the steward and his wife abused her when they were very farre gone in drincke so bedlam represented an intensification of the worst aspects of london life that is why in the early years of the seventeenth century it was put on stage in a number of dramas the madhouse became the scene of violence and intrigue where the inmates act such antic and such pretty lunacies that spite of sorrow they will make you smile these lines are from thomas dekkers play of the honest whore which was the first to include scenes within bedlam itself the fact that london contained the only madhouse in the country was in itself suggestive to dramatists in websters the duchess of malfi madness is associated with various urban professions such as that of a tailor crazed i the brain with the study of new fashions intimating once more that life in the city can render you insane it is the most important point of contact between london and lunacy there was another important association manifested in john fletchers the pilgrim of where the drama is concerned with the mental stability of the keepers rather than the patients if the custodians and gaolers are mad then so is the society that bestowed their status and responsibilities upon them the old madhouse was by the middle of the seventeenth century in such a squalid and ruinous condition that it had become a civic scandal so in it was decided that a great modern building situated in moorfields would take its place designed upon the model of the tuileries palace and decorated with gardens and columns it took three years to complete above its entry gate the sculptor cibber created two baldheaded and seminaked figures called raving madness and melancholy madness they became one of the great sights of london rivalling the fame of those earlier guardians of the city gog and magog from this time forward bethlem hospital acquired its true renown visitors foreign travellers and writers flocked to its apartments in order to see the mad confined within them it was of great importance to the city and to the civic authorities that lunacy should be seen to be managed and restrained it was part of the great movement of reason after the great fire and the plague when the city itself had become the scene of madness and unreason on an enormous scale daniel defoe had narrated the events of when so many citizens were raving and distracted and oftentime laying violent hands upon themselves throwing themselves out of their windows shooting themselves mothers murdering their own children in their lunacysome dying of mere grief as a passion and some of mere fright and surprise without any infection at all others frightened into despair and melancholy madness londoners had a propensity for mania perhaps that was the condition for their very existence in the city yet as if to point the moral that lunacy is undignified and absurd the inmates were on display like so many wild beasts in a zoo they were ravening creatures that had to be manacled or tied there were two galleries one above the other on each floor a corridor ran along a line of cells with an iron gate in the middle to divide the males from females outside it seemed to be a palace inside it closely resembled a prison the price of admission was a penny and it has been reported that the distempered fancies of the miserable patients most unaccountably provoked mirth and loud laughter in the unthinking auditors and the many hideous roarings and wild motions of others seemed equally entertaining to them nay so shamefully inhuman were some as to provoke the patients into rage to make them sport this familiar letter from samuel richardson provides a mideighteenth century picture of desolation which is fully documented by other sources one other commentator on witnessing these scenes remarked that the maddest people in this kingdom are not in but out of bedlam here was the most curious thing the building in moorfields provoked irrational behaviour in its visitors as well as in its inmates the whole scene of wild motions which can be deemed to be sexual and hideous roarings creating an unimaginable confusion of types and roles prostitutes used to linger in the galleries looking for custom on the principle that lustfulness might be excited by the antics of the mad it was suggested only half seriously that another asylum be built to house those who came to mock and make sport of the insane so it might seem that the contagion of madness spread from moorfields across the whole city thus in the literature of the period bedlam becomes a potent metaphor for all the evils of london in popes verses it casts its shadow over grub street where poverty and lack of accomplishment have driven many mad traherne wrote that the worlds one bedlam or a greater cave of madmen that do alwaies rave john locke compared temporary madness to being lost in the streets of a strange city a suggestive analogy which was taken up by many observers of london in smolletts humphry clinker for example matt bramble remarks of londoners that all is tumult and hurry one would imagine that they were impelled by some disorder of the brain that will not suffer them to be at rest how can i help supposing they are actually possessed by a spirit more absurd and pernicious than anything we meet within the precincts of bedlam so the building at moorfields rears over a city which is infected with the same disorder the citizens of london live in a state of unnatural energy and uproar they live in foul houses with no light or air they are driven by the whip of business and moneymaking they are surrounded by all the images of lust and violence they are living in bedlam by the end of the eighteenth century bethlem hospital had acquired its own patina of decay and desolation in a commission described it as dreary low and melancholy as if the material fabric had been infected by the melancholy madness of its inhabitants the neighbourhood was itself suffused with dreariness the hospital was surrounded by squalid houses as well as a number of shops dealing in old furniture so in it was agreed that the institution should move across the river to southwark the third bedlam in londons history rose within appropriate surroundings since southwark had always been the nursery of prisons and other institutions the new building was as grand as its predecessor with a portico decorated with ionic columns and surmounted by a great dome yet the conditions of the interior were as sparse as before as if once again the whole purpose of the building was a theatrical display designed to depict the triumph over lunacy in london the two sculpted giants of madness known popularly as the brainless brothers were kept in the vestibule methods of treatment remained severe and were largely dependent on mechanical restraint one patient lay in chains for fourteen years it was not until the midnineteenth century that a more enlightened policy was developed after two inquiries had been severely critical of the hospital regime a moral medical treatment was instituted with the patients being given jobs or occupations as well as medical therapy with drugs such as chloral and digitalis it was a world within a world its water came from an artesian well within the grounds so that the patients remained free of the cholera and dysentery which raged around them and there was a monthly ball where the patients danced with one another many observers commented on this moving and somewhat bizarre occasion yet still the persistent question about madness remained charles dickens walked past the hospital one night and was moved to reflect are not all of us outside of this hospital who dream more or less in the condition of those inside it every night of our lives the rate of insanity in london had tripled by the middle of the nineteenth century and other institutions for the mentally ill were established those of hanwell and colney hatch were perhaps the best known bethlem moved to the country near beckenham in but by that time the capital was well stocked with asylums these in turn have become known as mental health units or trusts where patients are service users in more recent years too the mentally ill have been released on medication into the community on the streets of london it is not uncommon to see passersby talking rapidly to themselves and sometimes gesticulating wildly on most main thoroughfares you will see a lone figure huddled in a posture of despair or staring vacantly occasionally a stranger will shout at or offer violence to others there was once a famous saying of london life go thy way let me go mine to which may be added i to rage and you to dine women and children an etching of a mudlark one of those small children who searched the banks of the thames for pieces of coal wood or metal which could be sold in the streets they comprised one of those small communities separate and apart which made up the sum of londons heterogeneous life chapter the feminine principle it is generally supposed that london is or was a male city phallic symbols of copper alloy have been found beneath leadenhall street and cheapside and phallic sculpture in coleman street the great phalluslike erection canary wharf tower now dominates all of london it is also a symbol of successful commercial speculation thus displaying the twin poles of londons identity the buildings close to that tower have wraparound sheaths of sandstone yet another example of the penis in stone london has always been the capital of masculine fashion its structures of power characteristically dominated by men rivers are normally feminine deities but londons river is known as old father thames yet there is a strange ambiguity in all this imagery the monument rises erect by london bridge and upon its base london is depicted as a weeping woman in its fall through fire it changes its gender in the early written records women acquire status and identity only through their commercial dealings the role of medieval london widows for example is indicative of a world in which trade matrimony and piety were thoroughly mingled on the death of her husband the widow was allowed a halfshare in his goods and unlike civic law in the rest of the country was permitted to occupy their joint house until the time of her own death she could become a freewoman of the city and was expected to continue her husbands old trade or business in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the known widows of artisans for example all continued with their husbands businesses the continuity of trade was important to the civic authorities but these arrangements also suggest the formidable position which women could assume in the city they could also join the guilds or fraternities and there is a record from the fraternity of the holy trinity in st stephens coleman street of a charity box to whiche box eche brother amp sister schal paie eche quarter a peny there were also rich widows who played a large part in city life but they were in the minority in another context there are references in fourteenthcentury records to the female practitioners of surgery certainly there were wise women who fulfilled a role as doctors within certain london parishes but we may also find women in the trades of haberdasher and jeweller spice merchant and confectioner for every twenty or thirty men paying tax however only one woman appears in the fourteenthcentury records the general images of order and subordination of decency and seemliness were of course applied to the women of the city for many centuries unwed women went bareheaded while married women wore hats or hoods wifebeating was acceptable while the ducking of scolding wives was on occasions deemed a fit punishment the ecclesiastical authorities often condemned women for wearing red antimony and other makeup upon their faces for curling their hair with tongs of iron and for wearing finery they had as it were taken on the unnatural colours of the city in contrast the presence of the great convents in london up to the time of the dissolution offered an image of women who had retired from the world theoretically at least they were part of the city of god rather than the city of men a general portrait of london women might therefore be constructed along familiar lines as the subordinate elements of a hierarchical and patriarchal society in a city of power and of business they retain a supportive invisible presence yet the women of london were also distinguished by other characteristics the daughters of wealthier households together with some of those from the merchant class were sent to elementary schools we may presume that a significant number of women could read and write or owned manuscripts and might deal with the males of the household on terms of practical if not theoretical equality a study of wills and testaments medieval london widows edited by cm barron and anne f sutton describes them as verbose bossy disorganised affectionate and anecdotal with a concern for distant relatives and distinct expressions of affection for household servants they also reveal networks of female friendships and loyalties which stretched across london most of the early descriptions of london women then suggest that they were very much part of the city one german traveller of the fifteenth century entered a london tavern and a woman presumably the landlady kissed him fully on the lips and murmured whatever you desire that we will gladly do this is not quite the docility and propriety expected of women of a patriarchal culture but it supports evidence from other sources of women who seem to be filled with all the energy and licentiousness of the city representations of women in drama from the scold to noahs wife display characteristics of aggression and violence as mentioned earlier in the chronicles of london for there is recorded the fate of a breton in london who murdered a widow an as he wente hys wey where as he hadd ido this cursed dede women of the same parissh come owte with stonys and canell dong and there made an ende of hym in the hyghe strete so that he wente no ferther notwithstondynge the constables and othere men allso the wiche hade hyum undir gouernans to condite hym forwarde ffor ther whas a gret manye of them and no mercy ne no pity this scene which was without algate and thus on the site of the present whitechapel high street is of some interest a large party of women aroused by the murder of one of their own overpower or intimidate a group of men surrounding the murderer then they stone him to death this is not a city of order and subordination but one in which some communal or egalitarian feminine spirit seems to be at work the women were also without mercy ne no pity which in turn suggests that they were in some sense brutalised or rendered callous by their existence in london in an early sixteenthcentury account it is revealed that the women have much more liberty than perhaps in any other place the same foreign observer reports that they also know well how to make use of it for they go dressed out in exceedingly fine clothes and give all attention to their ruffs and stuffs to such a degree indeed that as i am informed many a one does not hesitate to wear velvet in the streets which is common with them whilst at home perhaps they have not a piece of dry bread there was a sixteenthcentury proverb that england for which we may safely substitute london was hell for horses purgatory for servants but a paradise for women one of the central images of the age is that of dame alice more berating her husband thomas more for his stupidity in resisting the kings will her remarks to him were often sharp and occasionally sarcastic but he received them cheerfully enough perhaps only in london could that intense spirit of equality be sustained of course such treatment was the prerogative of rich or wellconnected families the notions of liberty on the streets meant different things so the same foreign observer suggested that many witches are found in london who frequently do much mischief by means of hail and tempest he seems here to be invoking an irrational fear of women a disturbance which the experience of the city itself appears to engender records of the seventeenth century suggest that the troubling spirit was not curbed one stranger to london wrote that he had sometimes met in the streets a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man crowned with very ample horns preceded by a drum and followed by a mob making a most grating noise with tongs gridirons frying pans and saucepans i asked what was the meaning of all this they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating for accusing her of making him a cuckold that example of violence can be followed by another when some of our party saw a wicked woman in a rage with an individual supposed to belong to the spanish embassy she urged the crowd to mob him setting the example by belabouring him herself with a cabbage stalk and again in another report the english seem to fear the company of women the women of london are the most dangerous women in the world this may or may not be accurate but for all the harshness there was also gaiety another traveller noted what is particularly curious is that the women as well as the men in fact more often than they will frequent the taverns or alehouses for enjoyment they count it a great honour to be taken there and given wine with sugar to drink and if one woman only is invited then she will bring three or four other women along and they gaily toast each other there were less happy circumstances for every engraving of a matron or merchants wife there are pictures of women who are almost literally slaves of the city it was the tradition that women sold perishable goods such as fruit and milk whereas men customarily sold durable or solid articles perhaps it was an obscured representation of the fact that in the city the women themselves were more perishable the streetsellers depicted by marcellus laroon in the s form a remarkable collection of urban types a seller of strawberries wearing a loose hood looks curiously pensive a crippled woman selling fish has an unutterably weary face although laroons editor and commentator sean shesgreen remarks that she is dressed in an eccentrically stylish way careful and even fastidious about her appearance it is a curiously london mixture of theatricality and pathos the seller of great eeles is lively and more alert with an expression so quizzical and yet so wary that she might be ready to see or hear anything as she made her way through the streets single women were certainly vulnerable to every kind of attention and even molestation the female seller of wax is a study in melancholy she wears an impassive almost stupid look and walks with a wooden gait her clothes are tattered and rundown patched in various places and eaten away at the sleeves here is a woman brutalised by the city into a state of indifference and neglect the seller of apples has a peculiar sneer upon her face as if demonstrating her contempt either for her customers or for her calling the merry milk maid is anything but merry the female mackerelseller an ancient creature with palsied face and puckered eye is a definite urban type the image of london marked upon her visage so too is the seller of cherries whose intelligent expression suggests that she manoeuvres successfully through the streets and markets of london another urban type endlessly displayed in chapbooks and upon the stage was the female innkeeper immortalised by mistress quickly but endlessly renewed ever since at every review in hyde park these trollops are certainly in a hackney will stop the coach to drink pint glasses with em at phillips yet wonder at the liberties some women take and tho they are ready to eat every fellow they see cant believe any of their sex virtuous but themselves this is entirely characteristic and in the writing of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there seems to be a consensus that the city tends to harden or sharpen female perceptions london wreaks transformationsthe angry become docile the querulous resignedbut in terms of women it was generally believed that there was a downward draught london was not a suitable place for women those who made a pact or compact with it were regarded as fallen the earliest actresses upon the stage for example were considered as brazen and tarred certainly this was true of eleanor gwynn whose pert vivacity to use macaulays phrase recommended her to charles ii she was a genuine london type frank unsentimental according to the dictionary of national biography her behaviour was considered unedifying while her remarks were often sharp and indecent i am the protestant whore she once declared and there is a famous scene of her cursing upon the stage at the spectacle of an almost empty house she was indiscreet and wild and her eyes when she laughed became almost invisible and she a seller of perishable goods like other women herself perished young mary frith otherwise known as moll cutpurse again became a figure symbolic of london itself she was born in the barbican in and quickly acquired a reputation for violent eccentricity her portrait became the frontispiece of middletons and dekkers the roaring girle a true story of city life and depicts her in male clothes complete with pipe and sword in fact she generally dressed as a man and was well known for her stentorian voice in the twentyfirst century this might be seen as a token of sexual identity in fact it was a token of urban identity her behaviour manifesting one of the most complicated but significant aspects of female life in the city by dressing in male clothes she understood where the power of london lay that is why she became more ostensibly masculine than any male yet there may be anxiety or misery involved in that pursuit mary frith declared that when viewing the manners and customs of the age i see myself so wholly distempered and so estranged from them as if i had been born and bred in the antipodes this strangely reflects the words of aphra behn who died in a garret in not far from where mary frith was born and who declared that all my life is nothing but extremes she is now considered to be a harbinger of feminist consciousness in literature having written novels plays pamphlets and poems on an heroic scale but as the dictionary of national biography suggests she attempted to write in a style that would be mistaken for that of a man hence she was accused of uncleanness coarseness and indecency but there was no alternative it was the style of the city they had to become unruly women in the phrase of the period in order that their identities or gifts might survive the fate of ruly women in london did not materially alter during the eighteenth century they were servants of the city in an almost literal sense since it has been estimated that approximately onequarter of all women in work were engaged in domestic service others were employed in clothing and in hawking in shopkeeping or in laundry work they were overworked and underpaid there was also a certain pattern to their urban exploitation as they grew older they descended still lower into poverty and distress the city hardened those whom it did not kill yet single women among them widows and deserted wives still flocked into the city as the only market for their unskilled labour it is no coincidence that this was also the period of londons great commercial unfolding as business and industry grew the male presence of the city was rendered more powerful so women were commercial objects wearing suchandsuch an amount of material at suchandsuch a price or they were rendered feminine and pretty the more straightforward and forlorn images of the late seventeenth century give way to idealised representations of the feminine by the middle of the succeeding century there was a vogue for advice books beginning in and reaching its peak in the s with titles such as an unfortunate mothers advice to her absent daughters and an enquiry into the duties of the female sex in which the virtues of humility and obedience are continually encouraged the purpose was to restrain or curb the natural power or instincts of women all the more overtly displayed in the city a distinction was often drawn between the city wife and the country wife for example the latter manifesting all the characteristics of docility and faithfulness which the former notably lacks during the eighteenth century the prejudice against actresses had faded they were no longer considered coarse or degraded but like kitty clive and mrs pritchard were allowed into the society of men such as horace walpole there were many eminent women throughout the centurylady mary wortley montagu theresa cornelys hannah more and mary wollstonecraft among thembut although the pieties of hannah more raised her above any disapprobation and indeed she exercised an influence not unlike that of an abbess in early medieval london the careers of other celebrated women were beset by scandal and obloquy walpole wrote of lady mary wortley montagu for example that she is laughed at by the whole town her dress her avarice and her impudence must amaze anyone she wears a foul mop that does not cover her greasy black locks that hang loose never combed or curled an old mazarine blue wrapper that gapes open and discovers a canvas petticoat her face swelled violently on one side and partly covered by white paint which for cheapness she had brought so coarse that you would not use it to wash a chimney mary wollstonecraft whose ingenious and suggestive a vindication of the rights of women was written in store street off the tottenham court road was disparaged as a blasphemer and a whore her demands for female equality were dismissed as the tirade of an amazon and her life was marked by isolation and unhappiness as william st clair has written in the godwins and the shelleys at the end of the entry in the antijacobin review for mary wollstonecraft the reader is crossreferred to prostitution but the single entry under that heading is see mary wollstonecraft it will perhaps come as little real surprise that the desire to control women occurred at times of panic and low financial confidence it ought also to be recalled that there was a sense of impending change and disturbance in the air and that the first intimations of revolution in france and america threatened the very existence of the state polity or old corruption mary wollstonecrafts a vindication of the rights of women was itself an aspect of that fervour which may explain why females were never more derided than in the latter decades of the eighteenth century it was another method of urban control the women of nineteenthcentury london were also marginalised and restricted they were given roles in other words to which they were forced to adapt the culture of the period is permeated by images of saint and sinner angel and whore pure and fallen but this is only one aspect of a fixed network of expression fictional representations for example often concentrate upon the innocent fragility of milkmaids or flowersellers treading the hard streets of the city yet the obsessive interest in innocence particularly in the middle decades of the nineteenth century was based upon the understanding that it would be destroyed when the narrator of dickenss master humphreys clock meets the prepubescent girl little nell wandering through the streets of london he is filled with anxieties of all possible harm that might happen to the child no londoner reading this in would have the least possible doubt that the most likely harm was that of being literally forced upon the streets the trade in child prostitution was thriving the city of that period had nurtured if not created that trade we might say that it prospered upon it so all the tears at the death of little nell and all the pity and sympathy at the spectacle of transient innocence were instigated by a context and by a city which the victorians themselves created they wept over young women who were being betrayed by the great metropolis so in this depiction of innocence there is also a kind of necessary cruelty or hardness innocence has to be destroyed if the city itself is to survive and prosper london was the arena for the battle of life or the struggle for life to use two characteristic victorian expressions and its women were not soldiers that is why the role generally imposed upon the middleclass and nonworking woman was that of the angel of the hearth a domestic deity whose role as wife and mother was preeminent and inevitable she tended her husband when he returned home from the battlefield and protected her children from the depredations of the city the london house became a zone of privacy and segregation in victorian homes the exterior world seems literally to be kept at bay by a whole artillery of protective forces it was screened by thick curtains and by lace inner curtains muffled by patterned wallpaper held off by settees and ottomans and whatnots mocked by wax fruit and wax candles the metaphorical and literal darkness of london banished by lamps and chandeliers this was the home of the feminine principle those who were not protected from the life of the nineteenthcentury city were obliged to work very hard in order to survive they became part of the sweating industries where sweating means long days and nights of sewing and stitching in overcrowded attics or small rooms many were confined within the drudgery of domestic service while other categories of employment were cooking and laundering some could not withstand the pressures upon them in the list of the inmates of bethlem hospital for the mad are listed thirtythree servants seven needlewomen four milliners and sixty wives widows and daughters of tradesmen there were other forms of escape the women of what the victorians called the lower classes were reported to drink to excess more than men they take to it largely to carry them through their work the women are worse than the men but their drinking is largely due to their slavery at the wash tub alcohol was the curse of working women precisely because they were consigned to a life of unremitting labour if the soakers smelled of gin or of beer it was also the smell of the city verlaine wrote of the behaviour of certain girls perhaps prostitutes that you cant imagine what charm there is in the little phrase old cunt addressed every evening to old gentlemen swearing and blasphemy were everywhere apparent but in a thoroughly pagan city what else was to be expected close observers of the streets such as charles dickens and arthur morrison also noticed the propensity of poor women for violent argument and assault the photographs of females in late nineteenthcentury london show them staring suspiciously at the camera one of the most familiar and suggestive of these images particularly at the turn of the century is that of the flowerseller instead of the painterly image of innocence and freshfaced exuberance no longer to be found on the streets the photographs show glum and elderly women each wearing a straw hat or a mans cap transfixed by a hatpin together with a shawl and an apron they congregated around the fountain of eros in piccadilly circus with their baskets of violets and carnations spread around them they were always known as flowergirls never women and in that linguistic transference there is contained a great deal of london lore one observer of the city regarded them as cockney vestal virgins although virgins they probably were not these female emblems of london as they soon became were grouped around the statue of desire yet they themselves were old and withered they sold flowers images of perishable beauty when they themselves had dropped into the sere leaf of age this contrast of youth and desire with age and poverty at the very heart of the city is a potent reminder of the wastefulness and weariness of urban life they continued at their post until the early s before disappearing in one of londons great silent transitions throughout the early decades of the twentieth century the prevailing image of women is still one of work and labour for every description of glamorous and affluent society women there are others of the hotel restaurant slavey of the shop assistant of the typing pool there is a sequence in a film entitled every day except christmas of a real character known as old alice the last of the women porters in covent garden market pushing a barrow of flowers the film was made in which suggests the longevity of certain trades some female occupations were quite new however and the period of both world wars fundamentally changed the nature of labour when the young men were despatched to the trenches and battlefields of the first world war women were for the first time accepted within previously male reserves they began to do war work in heavy industry particularly in munitions and in engineering the number of women employed at woolwich arsenal rose from to while the old workhouse at willesden was used as lodgings for the women working at factories in park royal there were female busand tubedrivers with a steady admission of women into clerical or commercial work although women were not continually employed in the heavier industries after the first world war their counterparts in office life remained this was complemented by another great transition by the end of the first world war the number of women in their once traditional occupations dressmaking and domestic service had dropped quickly and significantly instead women found work in banking and commerce local government and retailing shops and businesses public administration and the civil service one distinct type had been the factory girl whose token moment of emancipation arrived in the summer of when girls working in the bryant amp may match factory in bow walked out of their jobs in a demand for higher wages they were to a certain extent organised by the fabian militant annie besant and their success had significant consequences in that year also women were allowed to vote in local london elections and of course the movement of the suffragettes found its source and purpose in london for the first time in the citys history women were able to engage its egalitarian spirit in pursuit of their own interests in sylvia pankhurst founded the east london federation of the womens social and political union the wspu itself was established by her mother ten years earlier the federations birthplace was a bakers shop along the bow road not far from the bryant amp may factory sylvia wrote later that i regarded the rousing of the east end as of utmost importance the creation of a womans movement in that great abyss of poverty would be a call and a rallying cry to the rise of similar movements in all parts of the country so through the efforts of women london reacquired its destiny as the home of radical dissent it was a suitable response kindling a spirit in all those women who had been written off as soaks or worse the history of the suffragettes connected with sylvia pankhurst was associated very closely with that of the east end and became a genuine expression of the areas concerns meetings were held in poplar bromley and bow processions began or ended in victoria park the printer of suffragette literature was in premises along roman road while the womens hall opened on the old ford road the significance of the topography of the womens movement has never adequately been analysed but it has become clear that the eastern areas of london lent power and authority to it during the first world war a distress bureau was opened on the old ford road for women who with their husbands income gone had been threatened with eviction a cooperative factory organised by sylvia pankhurst was established in norman road with a day nursery within it a free clinic and nursery was opened on the corner of old ford road and st stephens road it had once been a public house known as the gunmakers arms but was renamed the mothers arms it was this double movement of caring feminism and the female adoption of male working roles which steadily advanced the moral and social position of women in the city there are still women wrestlers in shoreditch the inmates of holloway prison have been characteristically convicted of cruelty to children prostitution or drug trafficking there are still many poor women whom the city has beaten into submission from the latter half of the twentieth century there are records of hostels and refuges for sick women and battered women there is a truth about london here the pattern of relative misery remains recognisable and unaltered while surging above it are broad general movements of change so for example the latest statistics suggest that female labour in london has increased by over per cent in the ten years from while that of men has declined it is now estimated that per cent of the women in london are in paid employment so the city has become friendlier to women and they permeate all of its structures and institutions there are female taxidrivers and female executives just as the early twentyfirstcentury city is becoming lighter and more open so after two thousand years it is discovering its feminine principle chapter boys and girls come out to play the history of children in london affords much material for contemplation whether in their mortality in their savagery or in their instinct for game the great forces of the city are revealed the first evidences are brief and elusive fragments of small leather shoes and slippers as well as bronze toys and bone whistles the delight in game or play is profound and eternal the tombstones of children from the roman era still also survive one is inscribed to onesimus the helpful child and welldeserving son and another to good dexius son of diotimus the death of children is a constant thread in the history of london in more than one sense youth is a stuff which will not endure within the confines of the city deep beneath the level of poultry has been found the golden statuette of a baby and that small image represents all those ideas of holiness or sacredness which surround the child there are accounts of children as prophets and visionaries one young londoner was imbued to the glory of god with a knowledge which the master had not taught him we read of another who had the job along with two boys from the cathedral school of guarding the abbey at westminster there are accounts of children carrying baskets of sand and gravel to smithfield in the early twelfth century in order to help rahere in the building of st bartholomews great church there this connection of children with the protection and even erection of londons sacred sites is a highly significant one the city is acquiring the energy and innocence of its children in an activity not far removed from that of childsacrifice in the foundations of temples or of bridges certainly children were at the centre of civic and ecclesiastical ceremonies it has been noted that upon st nicholas st katherine st clement and holy innocents day children were wont to be arrayed in chimers rockets surplices to counterfeit bishops and priests and to be led with songs and dances from house to house blessing the people as late as the sixteenth century just before the reformation a boy habbited like a bishop in pontificabilis went abroad in most parts of london singing after the old fashion in the lord mayors show of the great procession was accompanied by naked boys and children were an integral feature of all the city and guild pageants that were carried along cornhill and cheapside we may also note here the curious and yet consistent pattern of superstition which surrounded children during the commonwealth the prophesies of children were listened to intently and astrologers employed children as scryers or visionaries when a spirit is raised one book of magic suggests none hath power to see it but children of eleven or twelve years of age or such as are true maids here the idea of innocence in a corrupt and corrupting city is powerfully effective the status of the child as a legal and commercial entity was also quickly established of william the conquerors charter to londoners in the second of the three precepts was i will that every child be heir after his fathers death thus confirming a tradition of primogeniture a complex system of wardship was also in place so that there was no possibility that the children of the deceased might be fraudulently deprived of their inheritance the commercial importance of the child in london is emphasised by the words of an ancient ballad in which a married couple send their boy away to fair london an apprentice for to find while the first extant record of a young london apprentice can be dated to another commercial activity undertaken by children was that of begging while children themselves were robbed kidnapped and murdered for profit one alice de salesbury was condemned to stand in the pillory because she had taken one margaret daughter of john oxwyke grocer and had carried her away and stripped her of her clothes that she might not be recognised by her family that she might go begging with the said alice and a gain might be made thereby this activity of childstealing continued upon the streets of london well into the nineteenth century when it was called a kinching lay the children of the affluent were a particular prey since they could be decoyed and their clothes and jewellery sold many of them were killed upon the spot to prevent their crying out or afterwards identifying their assailants london could be a perilous place for the young william fitzstephen preferred to emphasise the energy and vivacity of the youthful citizens how they delighted in cockfighting and in the wellknown game of football with an inflated pigs bladder used as a ball on the holy days of summer the children engaged in leapfrogging wrestling and slinging javelins beyond a mark in winter they indulged in snowballing and iceskating using the long shin bones of animals rather like the skateboards of the late twentieth century fitzstephen is at pains to emphasise the elements of competition and aggression in these games to complement his description of the valiant spirit which marked out london from other cities the lay sons of the citizens rush out of the gate in crowds and there they get up sham fights and exercise themselves in military combat young children were often given bows and arrows with which to practise their skills since one day they might be required to defend their city they were already londoners with a strong sense of civic identity and pride in similar fashion schoolboys were taught how to engage in dispute and rhetorical combat one with another while the boys of the different schools wrangle with each other in verse and contend about the principles of grammar or the rules of the perfect and future tenses in wellknown public areas such as the churchyard of st bartholomew the great in smithfield the children would mount upon makeshift stages and compete in rhetorical harangues or recitations here lies one of the origins of london drama but aptly in fitzstephens account the elements of combat and aggression are compounded with spectacle and theatricality in this respect the children of london are faithful images of the city itself one fourteenthcentury bishop reproved impudent youths who scribbled in the margins of books while robert braybroke in his letter of excommunication on november complained of boys good for nothing in their insolence and idleness instigated by evil minds and busying themselves rather in doing harm than good they throw and shoot stones arrows and different kinds of missiles at the rooks pigeons and other birds nesting in the walls and porches of the church also they play ball inside and outside the church and engage in other destructive games there breaking and greatly damaging the glass windows and the stone images of the church a bakers boy was carrying a basket of loaves up the strand he passed the bishop of salisburys palace and one of the bishops servants stole a loaf the boy raised a hue and cry and a crowd of children apprentices and other citizens engaged in what almost became a fullscale riot children were in other words part of the turbulent life of the turbulent city the administrative reports of the fourteenth century record a boy climbing up to a gutter to retrieve his lost ball of others playing on a heap of timber when one fell and broke his leg and of another a schoolboy returning over london bridge after dinner who must needs climb out and hang by his hands from a plank on the side of the bridge and fell in and was drowned they played hoodman blind now known as blind mans buff and cobnutte which is the present game of conkers there were rulebooks for schoolboys which by indirection preserve the essence of a london childhood in the medieval city with injunctions concerning no running jumping chattering or playing no carrying of sticks stones or bows no tricks upon passers by no laughing or giggling if anyone were to read or sing minus bene rather less than well in turn there survive doggerel poems by schoolboys about their masters i would my master were an hare for if he were dead i would not care in a city where everyone was competing for notice the children also clamoured but they also seemed drawn to the forbidden places of london as if in defiance against its threat it is the spirit of impudence or mockery which has always been noticeable among london children in the s and s they played a game called last across in which they would run across the road in imminent danger of being knocked down by cars it is a question of meeting and beating the city on its own terms when the young thomas more walked in the s from his house in milk street to st anthonys school in threadneedle street the city pressed upon him in ways which he never forgot he passed the standard in cheapside for example where public and bloody executions took place children were not spared the spectacle of violent death he passed churches painted images of the saints and the pissing conduit as well as the stalls of the fishmongers and butchers he would have seen the beggars some of his own age as well as the prostitutes and the thieves or loiterers set up in the stocks like an adult he went dressed in doublet and hose because children were not considered different from their elders but simply younger versions of the same thing at school he learned music and grammar as well as useful proverbial phrases o good turne asket another many handes maken lite werke the more haste the werse spede he was also educated in rhetoric and was one of those children who competitively exercised their talents in st bartholomews churchyard but the important point is simply that he was being trained for a career in the legal administration of london it was undoubtedly and principally a civic education he was taught to celebrate order and harmony and much of his public career was devoted to introducing that order and harmony within the streets which he had known since childhood yet those same streets hardened him as they hardened all their children his own writing is filled with their slang and demotic the hardness and theatricality of his own nature as well as his wit and aggression sprang from a characteristic london childhood london children therefore confronted harsh realities if they were poor they were put out to hard service working hours as long as their adult companions but if they were the offspring of affluent families they were enlisted within the households of richer or more eminent citizens the young thomas more for example entered the household of the archbishop of canterbury it was necessary to work or be punished the records of bridewell show that nearly half of its inmates were boys accused of nothing but vagrancy they were packte up and punnyshed alyke in brydewell with rogues beggers strompets and pylfering theves this harshness is reflected in the commentaries of two londoners the late fifteenthcentury william caxton and the early sixteenthcentury roger ascham caxton complained that i see that they that ben borne within the city of london encrease and prouffyte not lyke theys faders and olders while ascham maintained that innocence is gone bashfulnesse is banished moch presumption in yougthe these sentiments might be considered as the perpetual rage of age against youth in the context of the changing generations but it is interesting to note that they were made at a time when the city was expanding between and the population rose from to and it suffered from an excess of turbulence unrest and energy it seems likely that the children embodied that spirit in the most obvious and to the older citizens alarming way the image of the unruly young apprentice was a potent one within the city for example and as a result the civic authorities drew up tightly regulated and organised statutes of labour and discipline nothing could be allowed to disrupt commercial harmony the apprentice was bound and must obey since i have undertook to serve my maister truly for seven years my duty shall both answer that desire and my old maisters profite every way i prayse that city which made princes tradesmen by the latter comment the speaker meant that even those of noble birth could be enrolled as apprentices of a trade the commercial instinct was very strong apprentices were forbidden to muster in the streets drink in the taverns or wear striking apparel they were in addition allowed only closely cropped hair in a similar spirit it was still the custom for children to kneel before their father to acquire his blessing before proceeding with the days events they often dined at a separate smaller table and were served after the adults then they might be questioned about their activities or their learning at school or asked to recite a verse or a proverb recalcitrant children were often whipped with the juice of the birch which is excellent for such a cure if you apply it but twise or thrice the songs as well as the calls and cries of children are part of the general sound of the city home againe home againe market is done must rival for antiquity on christmas night i turn the spit or matthew mark luke and john bless the bed that i lie on in john aubrey wrote that little children have a custome when it rains to sing or charme away the raine thus they all join in a chorus and sing thus raine raine go away come againe a saterday there are a great many songs and rhymes set specifically in london this is perhaps not surprising since the city had the largest congregation of children in the nation and eventually in the world it has been stated by those authorities on childhood matters iona and peter opie that most of these rhymes can be dated after certainly they emanated from london printerpublishers of the period one of whom was jocularly known as bouncing b shoe lane but there are more significant urban features of these songs they emanate from the street cries and ballads of london their context is that of an oral culture some rhymes relate indirectly to wars or to political matters while others refer to urban events such as an ice fair upon the thames or the burning of a bridge of london town in february other songs came from the london theatres such as there was a jolly miller and when i was a little boy i washed my mammys dishes the house that jack built was originally the title of a london pantomime in fact there were so many pantomimes and harlequinadesold mother hubbard and her dog harlequin and little tom tucker and a host of othersthat it could be presumed that londoners themselves had become like little children the printers of shoe lane paternoster row and elsewhere issued a stream of storybooks and songbooks catching the young with their usual commercial spirit and again the presence of london filled their pages o was an oyster girl and we went about town from an eighteenthcentury spelling book is only the plainest of a number of verses or songs which celebrated london trades and tradespeople there are childrens songs on the milkmaids of islington and the sweeps of cheapside as well as the tailors the bakers and the candlestickmakers some of them begin as i was going oer london bridge as a great metaphor for the highway of life but of course the most ancient and familiar is the mysterious song london bridge is broken down broken down broken down london bridge is broken down my fair lady in its twelve verses it evokes a bridge that is continually being destroyed and rebuilt thus wood and clay will wash away bricks and mortar will not stay iron and steel will bend and bow silver and gold will be stolen away why should such strange sentiments issue from the mouths of london children unless it be a reference to the ancient belief that only the sacrifice of a child can placate the river and preserve the bridge unnaturally set across it the opies themselves suggest that the song is one of the few perhaps the only one in which there is justification for suggesting that it preserves the memory of a dark and terrible rite of past times they then describe the connection of childsacrifice with the building of bridges so the singing child is alluding to a dreadful destiny within the city and perhaps there is also an intimation that london itself can only be reared and protected by the sacrifice of children there is some element of this fatal relationship in that other great london song oranges and lemons where the invocation of old london churches reaches a climactic moment with the lines here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head again the origins of this verse are mysterious it has been suggested that they allude to the journey of a condemned man to the scaffold when the bells of london rang out to mark the stages of his progress or that in some way the song commemorates the bloody marital career of henry viii yet its power resides in its almost magical invocation of sacred places with their names ringing out like an incantation ring ye bells at whitechapple ring ye bells aldgate as well as those at st catherines at st clements at old bailey at fleetditch at stepney and at pauls a sacred as well as ferocious city is being invoked it could be suggested then that death was often in the minds of london children pray do tell me the time for i have let my watch run down why tis half an hour past hangingtime and time to hang again in one of those silent patterns of oral mnemonics hanging became kissing although of course the halter was known as the kiss or the cheat the point of rhymes and riddles was to train the perceptions of small children so that they might learn how to survive in a difficult environment that is why there is a tradition of sharpness and impertinence among young londoners when winston churchill met a boy outside downing street and asked him to stop whistling the child replied why should i you can shut your ears cant you aubrey and swift collected examples of wit and sallies from street children as have other compilers from dickens and mayhew to the opies the artful dodger is perhaps only a slightly dramatised version of any streetwise london child that imp of the perverse who seems somehow to have inherited all the levelling and egalitarian spirit of the city in his or her own small person there was a film made just after the second world war entitled hue and cry in which a boys quickwitted observations thwart a criminal gang he is asked so youre the boy who sees visions in the streets of london it is a question which might have been posed in the early medieval city in a climactic scene of the same film the criminals are pursued by a gang of children across the bombsites and ruined buildings of the blitz here again is an eternal image of urban childhood there are many pictures and descriptions of the london child against a background of flames of the child carried to safety during the incursions of boudicca or the depredations of the great fire yet somehow the image of children clambering over ruins is more poignant whether it be saxon children playing among the vestiges of roman london or twentiethcentury children leaping among the bombsites of the second world war it summons up associations of eternal renewal and invincible energy which are precisely the characteristics of london itself boys and girls come out to play the moon doth shine as bright as day leave your supper and leave your sleep and join your playfellows in the street this mysterious image of streets filled with play is amplified by zechariah viii and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the street thereof children can be found clustering in certain areas for play among them exmouth market the commercial road south and east of the elephant and castle along the goswell road and of course the scores of small parks and recreation grounds which echo across the capital certain areas seem to draw them towards games as if the presence of the children will soften them and render them inhabitable children for example always congregated east of aldgate pump in norman douglas published a scholarly volume entitled london street games perhaps in order to preserve the memory of a world which he sensed to be in some kind of transition but it is also a vivid memorial to the inventiveness and energy of london children and an implicit testimony to the streets which harboured and protected their play there were girls games such as mother im over the water or turning mothers wringer and skippingrope games such as nebuchadnezzer and over the moon their voices rose to the tapping of their feet upon the pavement charlie chaplin meek and mild stole a sixpence from a child when the child began to cry charlie chaplin said goodbye the texture of the city itself can create opportunities for play marbles were rolled in the gutters and the paving stones were marked with chalk for a hopping game children made use of walls against which fagcards were flicked in games such as nearest the wall takes or nearest the wall spins up it was remarked that these games make the boys uncommonly nimble with their hands and this must help them later on if they go in for certain trades like watchmaking then there were the touch games one entitled london the game of follow my leader was popular in the streets of london particularly in the suburbs it included crossing the road at precarious moments following the route of railway lines or knocking upon streetdoors and there was an evening game called nicho midnight or flash your light as one cockney boy put it you have to play in the dark because torches are no good in the daytime street games can be played in the darkness of london because sport is sweetest when there be no spectators that is why old tunnels disused railways lines dilapidated parks and small cemeteries have become the site of games it is as if the children are hiding themselves from london from that secluded vantage the boisterous may jeer or throw missiles at passing adults or shout insults such as ill punch your teeth in an instinctive savagery and aggression often seem to be at work in the city air some of the most poignant memorials of children date from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries carvings of charity children for example are still to be seen in holborn and westminster there were statuettes of schoolchildren by st mary rotherhithe where a free school for eight sons of poor seamen was established in two children of coade stone were placed outside st botolph bishopsgate with badges numbered and those belonging to st brides school were three feet six inches in height which is a token of the average size of the london child there are children in hatton garden and caxton street and vintners place some of them wear the costume dating back almost three hundred years with blue coat and yellow stockings apparently worn to ward off rats and are a perpetual reminder of an otherwise forgotten aspect of london childhood they can be associated with all the other stone or wooden representations of children within the city the fat boy in giltspur street the pannies boy in the bread market near st pauls the boys playing a game of marbles above a doorway on laurence pountney hill the child brandishing a telephone in temple place all are images of the child living within the city but now as it were taken out of time in that sense they embody the eternal nature of childhood itself yet the city of time could still degrade them a late sixteenthcentury writer noted that manye lytle prettie children boyes and gyrles doe wander up and downe in the stretes loyter in powles and lye under hedges and stalles in the nights in the spring of pepys records that in several places i asked women whether they would sell me their children that they denied me all but said they would give me one to keep for them if i would samuel curwen another seventeenthcentury diarist was walking down holborn when he noticed a crowd of people around a coach filled with children they were aged between six and seven young sinners who were accustomed to go about in the evenings stealing filching and purloining whatever they could lay their little dirty claws on and were going to be consigned into the hands of justice most of such children had been abandoned by their masters or by their parents to fall upon the mercy of the streets benjamin and grace collier as reported in the county records of the late seventeenth century privately made away with their goods and run away leaving their children destitute sara rainbow served in an alehouse in long alley little moorfields for nine years with very much hardship and of late a months causeless imprisonment in bridewell and other great cruelties which she could not endure in she ran away together with her two brothers one boy sold himself for five shillings to a clipper bound for barbados while the other was never seen again there are pictures of such children selling or begging or stealing upon the streets almost naked and in the last degree miserable eaten up with vermin and in such nasty rags that one could not distinguish by their clothes what sex they were of contemporary illustrations verify this unhappy condition one image of a street child shows him wearing the ragged clothing of an adult with a tattered greatcoat and pitifully torn breeches his hat and shoes are much too large and by his side he carries a tin bowl to be used both for drinking and for cooking he seems to be of no age and of every age the acquisition of castoff adult clothing serving to emphasise this ambiguous status these wandering children are as old and as young as the city itself the records of parish children in the eighteenth century are filled with images which provoke sorrowful contemplation foundling children were often named after the part of london where they were taken up the registers of covent garden parish are replete with names such as peter piazza mary piazza and paul piazza the phrase for those dropped or abandoned was children laid in the streets which itself is sufficiently evocative the parish officers were given ten pounds for each child brought into their care on which occasion there was a feast known as saddling the spit it was assumed that the childs life would not be long and therefore the money might be spent on jollification once more it is the pagan nature of these urban rituals which requires emphasis a general opinion prevailed that a parish childs life is worth no more than eight or nine months purchase and it seems likely that their deaths were hastened by unnatural means a parliamentary report of revealed that a great many poor infants and exposed bastard children are inhumanly suffered to die by the barbarity of nurses in one westminster parish only one child survived out of five hundred laid in the streets if they lived the poor children were lodged in the parish workhouses these were essentially primitive factories where from seven in the morning until six in the evening the little inmates were set to work spinning wool or flax and knitting stockings an hour a day was spent upon the rudiments of learning and another hour for dinner and play these workhouses were generally filthy and overcrowded places that in the parish of st leonards shoreditch for example was obliged to put thirty nine children into three beds it combined the aspects of both factory and prison thus confirming its identity as a peculiarly urban institution many of the children infected one another with disorders and contagious diseases and were then despatched to hospitals the quartet of london confinementworkhouse factory prison and hospitalis complete children were confined precisely because in their natural and liberated state they were considered to be wild they were still halfnaked or in tattered rags cursing and swearing at one another rolling in the dirt and kennels or pilfering on the wharfs and keys these were the ill natured cattal with which our prisons are daily filled and under the weight of which tyburn does so often groan very few social observers chose to discuss whether the conditions of london itself brutalised or dehumanised these small children the reality was too overwhelming and too palpable to elicit any cogent analysis beyond the imagery of bestiality and savagery once the vagrant children had been trained to labour in the parish workhouse for example they are as much distinguished from what they were before as is a tamed from a wild beast but that imagery can be applied elsewhere in the commercial jungle of london the master may be a tiger in cruelty he may beat abuse strip naked starve or do what he will to the poor innocent lad few people take much notice and the officers who put him out the least of anybody the reference here is to the parish child being sold off as an apprentice although that condition has been immortalised in oliver twist in the cruelties and hardships associated with this trade in children have a particular eighteenthcentury emphasis consider the plight of chimneysweeps apprentices known as climbing boys they were usually attached to their masters at the age of seven or eight although it was also common for drunken or impoverished parents to sell children as young as four years old for twenty or thirty shillings small size was important because the flues of london houses were characteristically narrow and twisted so that they became easily choked with soot or otherwise constricted the young climbing boy was prodded or pushed into these tiny spaces fearful or recalcitrant children were pricked with pins or scorched with fire to make them climb more readily some died of suffocation while many suffered a more lingering death from cancer of the scrotum known as sooty warts others grew deformed a social reformer described a typical climbing boy at the close of his short career he is now twelve years of age a cripple on crutches hardly three feet seven inches in stature his hair felt like a hogs bristle and his head like a warm cinder he repeats the lords prayer these children blackened by the soot and refuse of the city were rarely if ever washed they were coated in londons colours an express symbol of the most abject condition to which it could reduce its young a familiar sight they wandered about shouting out in their piping voices to sweep for the soot oh it was known as calling the streets in the harsh condition of london however they were rarely the objects of compassion instead they were condemned as thieves parttime beggars and the greatest nursery for tyburn of any trade in england yet in one of those astonishing displays of theatrical ritual of which the city was always capable once a year they were allowed to celebrate on the first of may they were painted white with meal and hairpowder and as lillywhites to use the contemporaneous expression they flocked through the streets where they called weep weep they also banged their brushes and climbing tools as they paraded through the city in this reversal we recognise both the hardness and gaiety of london they had very little to celebrate in their unhappy lives yet they were allowed to play and become children again for one day of the year but there are other connotations here which reach deep into the mystery of childhood in the city the climbing boys were characteristically dressed in foil gold leaf and ribbons just as were the children in the pageants of the medieval city in that sense they came to represent once more holiness and innocence in however vulgarised a fashion yet banging the instruments of their trade along the thoroughfare they also become lords of misrule for the day thus their wildness is being emphasised itself a threat to the city unless it were formalised and disciplined within ritual patterns all these elements convergeplayfulness innocence savageryto create the child in the city peter earle in a city full of people has noted that early eighteenthcentury london offered many enticements for young people in particular the city offered the lure of bad company gambling drink idleness petty theft and lewd women so london children were from the beginning at a disadvantage in the spiritshops lurked children who drink with so much enjoyment that they find it difficult to walk on going away in the engravings of hogarth too children are often characterised as malevolent or mischievous tokens of the city their faces are puckered up in misery or derision and they tend to mock or imitate the conduct and appearance of their elders in the fourth plate of a rakes progress a young boy can be seen sitting in the gutter he is smoking a small pipe and reading with attention a newspaper entitled the farthing post the sign of whites gambling house can be seen in the distance down st jamess street and in the foreground five other children are engaged with dice and cards one boy is a bootblack who has literally lost his shirt another is a seller of spirits while a third is a newspaper vendor known as a mercury of nineteenthcentury streetboys too it was noticed that gambling was a passion with them indulged in without let or hindrance in the early decades of the twentieth century also quite young children were still being arrested for streetgambling in games such as buttons so for at least two centuries london children have been associated with or identified by gambling and why should they not be gamblers faced with the general uncertainty of life in the city another boy away from the foreground in the hogarth engraving is stealing a handkerchief from the rake himself here in miniature is the image of the eighteenthcentury london child busily engaged in all the adult life and activity of the streets their features are also stamped with greed and acquisitiveness like tutelary spirits of place in the series of engravings morning noon evening and night children play a significant role some of them wear exactly the same clothes as their elders so that they have all the appearance of dwarflike or deformed citizens others are ragged street urchins fighting for food in the gutter or huddled together for warmth beneath wooden street stalls the ragged children of the streets have a vivid emblematic quality therefore but in the photographs of nineteenthcentury london they become more recognisable and more sorrowful these are no longer characters or caricatures but somehow familiar human faces soft or plaintive sorrowful or bewildered it has been suggested that the philanthropic instinct had changed by the end of the eighteenth century towards a more benign dispensation but the actual conditions of london had not altered the amount of crime starvation and nakedness or misery of every sort in the metropolis dickens told a journalist in the midnineteenth century surpasses all understanding it surpassed understanding because that starvation and misery affected the very youngest and most vulnerable in almost half the funerals in london were of children under the age of ten and it was a pretty conceit of early photographers to pose small children among the tombstones of the city graveyards it represents the brutality of victorian naïveté in another genre of photograph three little girls sit in the street their feet in the gutter and their bodies upon the flat stone pavement one girl looks round with surprise at the camera but the most striking impression is of their dark and faded clothes it is as if they were mimicking the dark and cracked stone all around them so that they might become almost invisible it is often forgotten how drab and dirty the victorian capital was the thoroughfares were always filled with litter and there was a general air of grime and grease as dickens wrote how many who amidst this compound of sickening smells these heaps of filth these tumbling houses with all their vile contents animate and inanimate slimily overflowing into the black road would believe that they breathe this air there is another photograph of seven little boys who have obviously been arranged in a tableau by the photographer but it is a tableau of want all of them are barefoot one child is wearing a battered hat but his trousers are in rags and falling off at the knee how they managed to live is something of a mystery still they look careworn but they are not starving there is a famous picture of a boy selling bryant amp may matches he holds up a box with an air of solemn defiance as if to saytake it or leave it i shall survive in the early part of the century prince herman pücklermuskau saw a child of eight driving his own vehicle in the middle of a whirlpool of carriages and commented that such a thing can only be seen in england where children are independent at eight and hanged at twelve there is indeed the famous description by a traveller in of a group of twelveyearolds sitting in the condemned cells in newgate all under the sentence of death smoking and playing very merrily together in there were inmates of london gaols who were under the age of seventeen some were barely nine or ten according to the chronicles of newgate children began to steal when they could scarcely crawl cases were known of infants of barely six charged in the courts with crimes children formed regular gangs each choosing one of their number as captains and dividing themselves into reliefs to work certain districts one by day and by night their favourite tricks were those of picking pockets or shoplifting smash and grab where a young thief would starr a window pane and robbing drunkards in this last occupation the girls attacked him and the boys stripped him of all he had the street children of the nineteenth century were known as little arabs a title that indicated in jingoistic terms their propensity for savagery it is perhaps appropriate to note in this context that the recalcitrant children of more affluent families were known as little radicals as if to identify the source of social unrest in the energy of the young three different books were published in the s and s each with the title the cry of the children confirming the prevalence of that anxious note it could be interpreted as a cry of battle as much as a cry of woe tolstoy visited london in and remarked that when i see these dirty tattered children with their bright eyes and angels faces i am filled with apprehension as if i were seeing drowning people how to save them which to save first that which is drowning is that which is most valuable the spiritual element in these children charles booth came across a group of cockney arabs small roughlooking childreni suggested they would be better at home and in bed at this time of night to which a girl of about eight and little at that replied in saucily precocious style speaking for herself and a companion garn were ahrt wiv ahr blokes thats my bloke yus says the other girl and thats mine at this there was a general shout of laughter and then came a plaintive plea give us a penny will you guvnor london children were a paying proposition no investment wrote the author of the children of the poor in gives a better return today on the capital put out than work among the children of the poor some young children became errand boys or the carriers of beer others donned a red uniform and were employed to clean up the horse manure in the busy streets they held horses for those who wished to make a purchase they carried trunks to and from the railway or parcels for omnibus passengers they stood at the doors of theatres and public places ready to call a cab especially when the night turned out wet and they helped porters whose duties had become too onerous or cabmen who were befuddled with drink it is possible to envisage a city of childrenthe number occupied in streetwork was estimated between ten and twenty thousandwatching for work and taking it up with eagerness and alacrity when it was offered they were the true progeny of london others became streetsellers and were recognisable figures with nicknames such as the cocksparrow or the early bird they were envied by unemployed little ones who look upon having the charge of a basket of fruit to be carried in any direction as a species of independence this is an interesting vision which these children possessed to have even the smallest means of earning a living allowed you to become master or mistress of the streets to wander as you will small boys and girls known as anybodys children were hired by costermongers or small tradesmen to sell stock upon commission each child would undertake to bring back an amount for the wares he or she had been given and could keep as bunse anything earned beyond that figure at first light the children would assemble in the various streetmarkets a boy would run up to the barrows of costermongers with the plea dyou want me jack or want a boy bill they waited all day to see if theyre wanted and if they were fortunate became the favourites of certain costermongers a boy was often employed at crying the goods which he and his master were pushing in a barrow this might appear to be a charming custom except that we find the natural tone completely annihilated at a very early age and a harsh hoarse guttural disagreeable mode of speaking acquired here the physical effects of living in the city are clearly delineated london wearied even the voices of the young and turned high notes into harsh ones another occupation for the children of london was to provide light entertainment for the citizens many small boys for example used to keep pace with the trams not merely by using their legs briskly but by throwing themselves every now and then on their hands and progressing a few steps so to speak with their feet in the air the favourite locale for this energetic activity was baker street where the children cartwheeled to attract attention and obtain the preference if a job were in prospect done too in hopes of a halfpenny being given the urchin for his agility this display in the streets is an aspect of theatrical london too but the spectacle had its consequences mayhew examined the hands of one urchin and noticed that the fleshy parts of the palm were as hard as solingleather as hard indeed as the soles of the childs feet for he was barefooted so the city hardened its street children in every sense the unhappy process is complemented by the description of their stolid and inexpressive countenances when the children worked on their own hook there were certain items which they could not sell no child could master the sale of patent medicines because they did not have the experience to gull the public nor were they skilful at selling last dying speeches more curious however is the evident fact that these street juveniles did not sell such childish items as marbles or spinning tops the reason here may be more profound who would wish to purchase items of childhood innocence and play from those who had always been denied such things street children had their penny gaffs commonly known as low theatres where amateur dramatic representations were performed for an audience which also came from the street they became a byword for filth and indecency there were other forms of drama for more affluent london children however principal among them the toy theatre it was sold with characters penny plain and two pence coloured which were cut out pasted on to cardboard glued to wires or sticks and then pushed upon a wooden or cardboard stage playacting was essentially a london pastime crucially combining the tradition of the caricature or satirical print to be seen in the windows of every printseller with that of the london drama or pantomime the earliest of these childhood spectacles was manufactured in and they soon became immensely popular when george cruikshank was dilatory in their publication the boys used to go into his shop and abuse him like anything for his frequent delays in publishing continuations of his plays the toy theatre was part of the history of london spectacle in other words emerging from the gothic and the phantasmagoric it imitated the humour and heterogeneity of the london stage also with burlesques and buffooneries the sorrows of werther became the sorrows of water or love liquor and lunacy it was a city of melodrama in many respects where the young loved to act and to recite one of the daily reading lessons at london schools was taken from the drama and there was a perfect itch for acting among the young boys and girls in vanity fair thackeray depicts two london boys as having a pronounced taste for painting theatrical characters another londoner writing of the early s stated that nearly every boy had a toy theatre there is a picture composed in of punch by night which depicts a group of tiny children looking up in wonder at a punch and judy booth illuminated by oillight some are barefoot and some in rags but as they stand on the rough stones their eager attentive faces are bathed in light yet it may be that the illumination is emerging from them on this dark london night a similar sense of the numinous emerges in descriptions of children at play in the streets of the city theodore fontane the german author wrote of spring in the rookeries of st giles when the children have taken their one pitiful toy a homemade shuttlecock into the street with them and while wherever we look everything is teeming with hundred of these pale children grown old before their time with their bright dark eyes their shuttlecocks fly up and down in the air gleaming like a swarm of pigeons on whose white wings the sunlight falls there is a sense of wonder and mystery vouchsafed in the wave of happiness and laughter emerging from the foul and squalid tenements of the poor it is not a question of innocence contrasted with experience because these children were not innocent but somehow a triumph of the human imagination over the city even in the midst of filth they have the need and the right to be joyful that sense that human aspiration is also present in the many descriptions of children dancing in the street in at camden pratts unknown london there is an account of holywell street in the late nineteenth century with the curious sight of the children in lines across the roadway at either end of the row dancing to the music of a barrel organ that never seems to go away it is noticeable that they all dance the same simple step but the grace of some of these unkempt girls is remarkable it is as if it were some ritual dance the dance of the city to a music that never seems to fade evelyn sharp in the london child records how sometimes they danced in unison sometimes as a kind of chorus to a little première danseuse in whirling pinafore and bare feet and always they betrayed their kinship with the motley crowd that dances in wild abandonment to the jingle of the street organ once more the street organ betrays its persistent presence as if it were the music of the stones but the simple ritualised step of the children has made way for wildness and abandonment they are giving themselves up to forgetfulness and oblivion because in the savage dance they can ignore the conditions of their ordinary existence implicitly they are defying the city if we can dance like this what harm can you do us a poem of depicts a city child halfgirl half elf babbling to herself while playing hopscotch on the steps of st pauls cathedral london roars in vain to catch her inattentive ear and she does not bestow one glance upon the great church rising above her here the dignity and selfsufficiency of the city child are being celebrated quite removed from all the demonstrations of power and business around her she would appear to have been created out of the very conditions of the streets and yet there is something within her which is able to ignore them it is a mystery vouchsafed to the late nineteenthcentury poet laurence binyon who depicts two children in an alley once more dancing to the sound of a barrel organface to face they gaze at each other their eyes shining grave with a perfect pleasure their mutual enjoyment and understanding rise above the sordid material world that surrounds them in george gissings novel thyrza gilbert grail turns into lambeth walk and as he did so a street organ began to play in front of a public house close by grail drew near there were children forming a dance and he stood to watch them do you know that music of obscure ways to which children dance a pathos of which you did not dream will touch you and therein the secret of hidden london will be revealed it is the great secret of those who once existed in the dark heart of the city it is defiance and forgetfulness compounded it is the london dance lambeth is now like much of london quieter than once it was there seem to be no children on the streets but a small green named pedlers park in salamanca street has been classified as a childrens play area where once all london was a play area now zones have been segregated for that purpose lambeth walk once the centre of old lambeth is now pedestrianised with threestorey council houses of dark brick along it it leads to a shopping mall albeit a dilapidated one down which staggers a drunken man cursing to himself shops are boarded up and some are derelict but above the mall itself have been painted murals of children one shows lambeth ragged school in newport street and is dated another is of children with their legs bare exuberantly dancing after a watering cart the image is taken from a photograph by william whiffin dated c which showed some small boys playing in the spray and then suddenly on july four young girls bring out a skipping rope and begin to play in the middle of lambeth walk continuities george scharf s drawing of the original oyster shop in tyler street the shop itself has gone but all the buildings on the same site have followed its contours chapter have you got the time the nature of time in london is mysterious it seems not to be running continuously in one direction but to fall backwards and to retire it does not so much resemble a stream or river as a lava flow from some unknown source of fire sometimes it moves steadily forward before springing or leaping out sometimes it slows down and on occasions it drifts and begins to stop altogether there are some places in london where you would be forgiven for thinking that time has come to an end in medieval documents ancient london customs were declared to be from time out of mind about which contrary human memory does not exist or an object might be classified as standing where it now stands for a longer time than any of the jurors can themselves recall these were ritualised or standardised phrases suggesting that the earliest measure of time was human memory itself in an anonymous medieval poem on the life of st erkenwald there are verses which concern the masons rebuilding st pauls cathedral in the fourteenth century they discover a great tomb within the ancient foundations of the church in which rests the unblemished corpse of a pagan judge who speaks thus how long i have lain here is from a time forgotten it is too much for any man to give it a length although even in that distant period london was the metropolis and the master town it evermore has been the corpse is baptised its soul saved and at the close all the bells of london rang loudly together beyond the time measured by human memory there exists therefore sacred time invoked by the sound of these bells the visions of our lady in the church of st bartholomew or the miracles surrounding the shrine of our lady of willesden suggest that london was also the harbour of eternity the bells provided that sonority where sacred and secular time met yet for many centuries a form of communal memory was also commonplacein the great hard frost in the late dreadful storme ever since the sicknesse yeare two or three dayes after the great high windwhen the events of london mark out an imprecise but useful chronology public gatherings also measured london time in sermon time or at exchange time when the merchants meet at the royal exchange there was a human scale also in the measurement of light and shadow in the city as an index of time about candlelighting in the evening or when it was duskish the spirit of the city lives too in the emblems which adorn it there were four wall dials in the inner temple one of which bore the inscription begone about your business which is a true london apothegm on the sundial in pump court are etched the words shadows we are and like shadows depart and in lincolns inn two emblems of sacred time were installed on the southern gable of the old buildings was the motto ex hoc momento pendet aeternitas or on this moment hangs eternity and beside it qua redit nescitis horam or we do not know the hour of his return these emblems are the written equivalent of the church bells resounding through the streets of the city in the middle temple another sundial reasserts the actual nature of london with complementary mottoes time and tide tarry for no man and vestigia nulla retrorsum or no moment is backward so even the sun and the light are mastered by the urgent rhythm of city activity in this context the dominance of clock time in the city can be understood wrens london churches have clocks designed within them no doubt the dials are a substitute for the bells which once rang out but there is also a suggestion that time itself has somehow become a deity to be venerated when in the early eighteenth century bennetts clock shop at cheapside set up images of gog and magog above its frontage the shops owner was expressing a general truth these tutelary deities of london were used to strike the hour confirming the identity of time and the city for a city based upon work and labour upon power and commerce time becomes an aspect of mercantilism that is why the city became famous for its clocks from that upon st pauls to that of big ben on st stephens tower at westminster and renowned for its clockmakers artificers such as charles gretton and joseph antram of fleet street john joseph merlin of hanover place and christopher pinchbeck of st johns lane were often visited by foreign travellers and were themselves notable london figures pinchbeck opened a clockmaking and clockwork gallery to display his skills while merlin had his own mechanical museum the measurement of time and the ingenuity of its artificial instruments fascinated londoners in a city always moving and always making the attention to the process of measuring was also an attention to its own energy and greatness that is why london also became the world centre of watchmaking by the end of the eighteenth century for example there were more than seven thousand workmen in clerkenwell assembling watches at a rate of a year per cent of which were exported it is almost as if london was manufacturing time itself and then distributing it to the rest of the world the nature of its manufacture with different artisans in different districts making one small part of the assembly means that clerkenwell itself could be seen as a clockwork mechanism with its face to the sky the position of greenwich upon the meridian is well known but on this famous site was also erected the time signal ball a wood or leather sphere five feet in diameter which was raised and dropped by a galvanic motor clock this device was considered to be the most wonderful clock in the world regulating the time of all the clocks and watches in london in particular a very small outlay will secure true greenwich time to every city establishment so time and trade ran together another great clock was established at the post office of st martins le grand in the s it was known as the chronopher and by means of a time current running along the electric telegraph it controlled the time of sixteen of the most important cities in the kingdom london set up and dominated the time of the entire country with the central position of greenwich it might even be said to have controlled the time of the world there was also the phenomenon of railway time so that the locomotives speeding out of london set the time for the provincial stations through which they passed in twentyfirstcentury london too time rushes forward and is everywhere apparent it hangs upon neon boards and is illuminated on the front of office buildings clocks are everywhere and most citizens have the image of time strapped to their wrists it might even be suggested that the general and characteristic obsession of london is with time itself that is why all of its commercial operations are designed to be conducted and monitored in the shortest possible time just as information is only important when it is of instantaneous access the faster an action or a dealing can be reported the more significance it acquires the affluent londoners of the fourteenth century who first displayed the counterpoise clock in their households were at the beginning of a process in which london would capture and market time the city oppresses its inhabitants and the evidence of that oppression can be found in the time it imposes there is a time for eating a time for working a time for travelling to work a time for sleeping it represents the great triumph of materialism and commerce within the city the consequences emerge in the activity and imagery of london over a long period one eighteenthcentury observer remarked that in london they talk little i suppose that they may not lose time similarly there is no bargaining and the custom of having fixed prices is not the product solely of competition and confidence but also of the necessity of saving time it has often been noted how quickly londoners walk if there is a cause for this anxious speed it may lie in the deeply inherited instinct that time is also money there is an old london inscription as every thread of gold is valuableso is every minute of time time must not be wasted chateaubriand noticed that londoners were impervious to art and general culture precisely because of this obsession they chase away the thought of raphael as liable to make them lose time and nothing more significantly he associates this with the need to work they are for ever on the brink of the abyss of starvation if for a moment they forget work time and work are indeed intimately mingled within the consciousness of london they cannot be separated not even for a moment and out of this conflation emerges frantic and continuous activity like automata the citizens become the components of the monstrous clock that is london then time indeed becomes a prison a riddle in a london chapbook asked the question what am i close in a cage a bird ill keep that sings both day and night when other birds are fast asleep its notes yield sweet delight and the answer i am a clock even the gallows was wreathed with the implication of time one victim of the rope declared in his last speech men women and children i come hither to hang like a pendulum to a watch for endeavouring to be rich too soon the clock of holy sepulchre newgate in turn regulated the times of hanging it is of course possible to control time ned ward noticed an assistant in an early seventeenthcentury musickshop beating time upon his counter while his customers danced to the sound of pipes and fiddles this is an ancient yet still familiar scene of course and suggests that the permanent refuge of londoners from the claims of clocktime may lie in song and dance that is one way at least to beat time and there are also places where time may cease to exist among the prison inmates of london for example day after day rolled on but their state was immutable every moment was a moment of anguish yet did they wish to prolong that moment fearful that the coming period would bring a severer fate during the second world war harold nicolson noted one lives in the present the past is too sad a recollection and the future too sad a despair i go up to london after dinner i walk back to the temple he is walking through a timeless city abandoned to darkness during the blackout and there are still areas of london where time seems to have come to an end or ceaselessly to repeat itself the phenomenon can be particularly noted in spitalfields where the passing generations have inhabited the same buildings and pursued the same activities of weaving and dyeing it may be noticed that by the market of spitalfields archaeologists have recovered successive levels of human activity dating back to the time of the roman occupation but time also moves slowly in shoreditch and limehouse these areas have acquired a finality in which nothing new seems able to prosper the time of cheapside and stoke newington is rapid and continuous whereas that of holborn and kensington is fitful jonathan raban in soft city has noted that time in earls court is quite different from time in islington by which he is suggesting that the rhythms imposed upon the inhabitants of these areas are particular and identifiable there are streets in which the presence of old time is familiar the area of clerkenwell and the passages off maiden lane are notable in that respect but there are other places such as tottenham court road and long acre which seem to exist in a continual state of novelty and unfamiliarity there are also forms of timelessness neither vagrants nor children are on the same journey as those whom they pass on the crowded thoroughfares chapter the tree on the corner consider the plane tree at the corner of wood street and cheapside no one knows how long it has existed on that spotonce the old churchyard of st peters which was destroyed during the great fire of but in extant documents it is termed ancient and for centuries it has been a familiar presence in for example the sight of this tree in the centre of london inspired wordsworth to compose a poem in which the natural world breaks through cheapside in visionary splendour at the corner of wood street when daylight appears hangs a thrush that sings loud it has sung for three years poor susan has passd by the spot and has heard in the silence of morning the song of the bird then enchantment holds her and she witnesses a mountain ascending a vision of trees bright volumes of vapour through lothbury glide and a river flows on through the vale of cheapside this might be construed as an example of wordsworths disenchantment with the city and his wish to obliterate it in the interests of nature but it might also represent his vision of a primeval past the tree conjures up images of its distant predecessors everything about this corner of wood street suggests continuity even its name is connected with the tree wood was indeed once sold here but the tree itself is protected and can never be cut down in the spring of rooks came to rest in its branches reestablishing the ancient association between london and those dark birds the london plane flourishes in the smoke and dust of london and the tree at the corner of wood street has become an emblem of the city itself it has now reached a height of approximately seventy feet and is still thriving beneath it nestle the small shops which have been an aspect of this corner for almost six hundred years in a shop known as the long shop was first built here against the churchyard wall and others followed after the fire they were rebuilt in the site is only a few feet in depth and each small shop still consists of a single storey above and a boxfront below the trades which have passed through them were varioussilversellers wigmakers law stationers pickleand saucesellers fruiterersall of them reflecting the commercial life of the capital appearances may change but form remains constant in more recent years there was a shirtmaker and a music warehouse a sweetshop and a gownmaker a florist carrie miller who was born in st pancras and had never left london was interviewed here in the years immediately following the second world war i was fortunate enough to find this little shop under the famous tree in wood street before i came it was a toy shop the city is in my blood now i would not be anywhere else in the whole world so this tiny spot this corner provides evidence of continuity on every level human social natural communal there exists on the site today a shirtmakers l and r woodersen which advertises itself as under the tree a newsagents with the shop sign time out londons living guide and a sandwich bar called fresh options such lines of continuity are to be found everywhere within london some of great antiquity the fact that heathrow airport is built upon the site of an iron age camp is suggestive with the evidence of a neolithic track or cursus extending two miles on the western side of the runways of the present airport the original roman street pattern of london has survived unchanged in certain parts of the city cheapside eastcheap and cripplegate still follow the ancient lines in milk street and ironmonger lane seven successive waves of building have employed exactly the same sites despite the fact that during this period the streetlevel itself rose some three feet three inches there is a spiritual as well as a physical continuity one historian of the parish of st andrew holborn cm barron has noticed that along the roman road leading westwards from newgate there was a kind of funerary ribbon development which in turn coincides with the fatal route taken by the condemned from newgate to tyburn the line of death seems to have been prepared in advance in a similar spirit we may note that at the same church of st andrew there is evidence of pagan cremation burials roman sepulchral building and remnants of early christian worship the layers of sacred activity radiate from one to another within what is undoubtedly an holy area an archaeological investigation of the graveyard of st katherine cree between leadenhall street and mitre street offers interesting evidence of continuous occupation here were a series of patchy roman surfaces according to the london archaeologist into which were cut burials in stone and mortar cists probably a continuation of the late saxon graveyard excavated to the east the area continued to be used as a graveyard to the present day with burials being made in wooden and lead coffins and the ground level rising steadily londoners seem instinctively aware that certain areas have retained characteristics or powers continuity itself may represent the greatest power of all the coinage of early tribes in the area of london particularly that of the iceni carried the image of a griffin the present city of london uses the same miserly and rapacious birds as its emblem more than two thousand years after their appearance the griffins still guard the boundaries of the city within that city the administrative network of the wards is of ancient date these units of local government can be traced back to the early ninth century and their exact alignments are still employed at the beginning of the twentyfirst century this is perhaps so familiar a concept that its striking singularity is often missed there is no other city on earth which manifests such political and administrative continuity its uniqueness is one of the tangible and physical factors that render london a place of echoes and shadows the texture of the city is also remarkably consistent peters hill and upper thames street were laid out in the twelfth century other streetsurfaces and frontages have a similar history with property divisions remaining intact for many hundreds of years even the devastation of the great fire could not erase the ancient lanes and boundaries in a similar pattern of continuity those streets which were newly laid out after the fire also showed tenacity of purpose ironmonger lane for example has had the same width for almost years that width was and is fourteen feet originally sufficient to allow two carts to pass each other without hindrance or blockage it is another aspect of this continuous london history that its structure can accommodate itself to quite different modes of transport when george scharf drew an early nineteenthcentury oystershop on the corner of tyler street and king street just east of regent street its shallowness was explained by scharfs latest editor peter jacksonall the houses on the north side of tyler street followed a medieval building line which ran at an angle making them progressively shallower the streets have been renamed as fouberts place and kingly street but even now the building on this spot still has the same proportions an even more remarkable physical token of the past lies a little further west in park lane the lower end of that street from woods mews down to stanhope gate is marked by irregularity the streets are set back a few feet from each other so that the front is never in a straight line this is not an accidental or architectural arrangement however since the map or plott of the lordship of eburie reveals that those streets were in fact laid down upon the pattern of the old acre strips of the farmland which once covered the site these acre strips belonged to the village community system of the saxon period and the irregularity of park lane is a token of their continuing presence and influence just as the saxon wards maintain their energy and power within the city so the saxon farming system has helped to create the structure and topography of the modern city in similar fashion the curve of west street where the ivy restaurant is now situated exactly imitates the curve of the country lane which once existed there a sixteenthcentury surveyor named tiswell drew up a map of the land which is now occupied by the west end at that time it consisted of farmland with lanes winding between the villages of st giles and charing yet a modern map superimposed upon the elizabethan plan coincides with its principal thoroughfares and most notable topographical features it may be a cause of surprise but it should be one of wonder once the city is seen in this light then it begins to reveal its mysteries the persistent echoic effect can be recognised everywhere thus one of the great twentiethcentury writers upon london steen eiler rasmussen has noted of standard london dwellings in london the unique city that the little house of which there have been thousands and thousands is only sixteen feet broad it has probably been the ordinary size of a site since the middle ages he adds that the uniformity of the houses is a matter of course and has not been forced upon them these houses emerge as a matter of instinct therefore deriving from some ancient imperative it is as if they were similar to the cells that cluster in a human body when in elizabeth i declared by edict that one house should belong to one family she was giving expression to another great truth about london life and as rasmussen suggests her proclamation or programme has been repeated over and over again through the centuries the names of the streets in which many of these houses are to be found also prove to be of ancient provenance in similar fashion the squares of london can be associated with the courtyards of the medieval city the socalled ribbon development along the western avenue in the s obeys the same process of growth as the ribbon development along whitechapel high street in the s the passage of four hundred years means very little in the workings of londons inexorable laws a recent study of london demography london a new metropolitan geography by k hoggart and dr green concluded that several of londons population characteristics have been present for five hundred years or more among them the creation of suburbs the overrepresentation of adolescents and young adults as well as the presence of a marginalised and destitute underclass and the exceptional representation of overseas migrants and religious cultural and ethnic minorities any slice or slide of london life in other words would broadly mirror that of previous and succeeding centuries there has been no fundamental change the work of london is also consistent the preponderance of finishing trades and what have become known as the service industries affords one example while another continuity is to be found in the reliance upon small workshop rather than factory production in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries aldermen complained about lack of public money the complaint has been repeated in almost every decade of every century stephen inwood in a history of london has remarked that for a city that is the home of national government london has often been a surprisingly poorly governed place perhaps it is not a surprise after all it may be part of its nature and organic being these are all large concerns with which to demonstrate the essential continuities of the citys life but they can also be glimpsed in local and specific ways where a stray object or perception can suddenly manifest the deep history of london being it was in the early fifteenth century that richard whittington built near the mouth of the walbrook in the vintry the huge public privy that was known as whittingtons longhouse john schofield in the building of london has noted that centuries later the offices of the public cleansing department now cover the site in endell street there was once found an ancient bath of unknown date fed by a fine spring of clear water which was said to have medicinal qualities in the nineteenth century the lower parts of the bathhouse were filled with lumber and rubbish so that the spring no longer flows but it did not disappear it simply emerged in different form there is a sauna in endell street and on the corner a public swimming bath known as the oasis the site of the curative wells in barnet where people gathered for healing in the seventeenth century is now occupied by a hospital at the foot of highgate hill where it inclines gently into holloway a great lazarhouse or leper hospital was established in the s it had fallen into decay by the middle of the seventeenth century but the spirit of the place was not diminished in the small pox and vaccination hospital was erected there the site is now the whittington hospital almshouses for the frail or feeble were erected in liquorpond field the royal free hospital now covers the area there was an old poorhouse on chislehurst common erected in it is now the site of st michaels orphanage once a famous maypole was set up at the crossing of leadenhall street and gracechurch street it towered above the city and in the fifteenth century the church of st andrew cornhill was rededicated as st andrew undershaft because it was physically under the shaft the great maypole itself was stored along the side of shaft alley this might seem an exercise in medieval nostalgia were it not for the fact that on this very same spot now rises the tall and glittering lloyds building the history of a structure on the corner of fournier street and brick lane is also curiously suggestive it was built in as a church for the huguenot weavers of the period but was used as a synagogue for the jewish population of spitalfields between and now it is a mosque the london jamme masjid for the muslim bengalis who succeeded the jews succeeding waves of immigrants have chosen to maintain this place as a sacred spot it is possible too that an unpleasant or unhappy atmosphere may persist like some noisome scent in the air it has been noted of certain streets such as chick lane field lane or black boy alley all in the vicinity of the present farringdon road that a curious fact about these places is that their bad character began so early and persisted so long of coventry street off piccadilly it was stated in that there is a considerable number of gaming houses in the neighbourhood at the present time so that the bad character of the place is at least two centuries old or ever since it was built upon the act of building may itself determine the character of an area for ever in other words it is as if the stones themselves carried the burden of their own destiny so we may see the passage of time through stone but that vision of unbroken continuity is essential to the vision of london itself this is not the eternity vouchsafed to the mystic who ascends from the body to glimpse the soul of things but one immured in sand and stone so that the actual texture or process of life is afforded a kind of grace the continuity of london is the continuity of life itself east and south an etching of billingsgate by james mcneill whistler executed in it shows something of the animation of the docksides with many boats engaged in trade upon the ever commercial thames chapter the stinking pile it has often been suggested that the east end is a creation of the nineteenth century certainly the phrase itself was not invented until the s but in fact the east has always existed as a separate and distinct entity the area of tower hamlets limehouse and bow rests upon a separate strip of gravel one of the flood plain gravels which were created at the time of the last glacial eruption some years ago whether this longevity has played any part in creating the unique atmosphere of the east end is open to question perhaps but the symbolic importance of east versus west must not be ignored in any analysis of what became known in the late nineteenth century as the abyss the roman burials of londinium some of them within the very area now known as the east end were so conducted that the heads of those interred were inclined towards the west the same practice can be found in early christian burial rituals again in the territory of london which suggests some profound affinity it seems also to have been an instinctive one part of a territorial spirit that emerges in the earliest recorded periods of londons history archaeological evidence suggests for example that the invading saxons of the fifth and sixth centuries settled to the west of the river walbrook while the defeated and demoralised romanobritish natives dwelled upon the east bank this pattern of habitation has been consistent and profound there is one interesting and significant feature of the eastern area which suggests a living tradition stretching back beyond the time of the romans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries there was found evidence of a great wall running along the eastern portion of the thames down the river bank and along the essex shores to protect the land from the depredations of the tidal river it was constituted of timber banks and earthworks at the end of the wall in essex close to the area now known as bradwell watersidewhich may plausibly be translated even after two thousand years of transition as broad wallwere discovered the earthworks of a roman fortress as well as the ruins of a later chapel st peteronthewall which had become a barn other local antiquarians have also found small churches or chapels placed beside what might be called this great eastern wall it is quite forgotten save by a few local historians but by keeping at bay the water and by helping to drain the marshland of the eastern areas it created the east end or londons dark side every city must have one and where does the east begin according to certain urban authorities the point of transition was marked by the aldgate pump a stone fountain constructed beside the well at the confluence of fenchurch street and leadenhall street the existing pump lies a few yards to the west of the original other antiquaries have argued that the real east end begins at the point where whitechapel road and commercial road meet the taint of poverty already apparent in the late medieval period was in any case gradually extended stow observed that between and there was a continual street or filthy strait passage with alleys of small tenements or cottages built almost to ratcliffe the road from the pump of aldgate to the church at whitechapel was by this date also lined with shops and tenements while the adjoining field to the north was pestered with cottages and alleys in similar manner there was a continuous building of small and base tenements for the most part lately erected from bishopsgate to shoreditch and even beyond that there were mean buildings a good flight shot as far out as kingsland and tottenham by the end of the sixteenth century the eastern portions of the city were being defined as base and filthy their squalor and stench emerging despite proclamations and parliamentary acts the area of spitalfields laid out along more regular lines between and also soon acquired a reputation for poverty and overcrowding the houses were small and narrow while the streets themselves were often only fifteen feet wide that sense of diminution or of constriction exists still as the houses so their inhabitants a report of described the overcrowding created by poor indigent and idle and loose persons so the filthy cottages of stows report were being filled with filthy persons it is the story of london the industries of the eastern neighbourhood gradually became filthy too much of its trade and commerce came from the river but in the course of the seventeenth century the region became steadily industrialised in the vicinity of the lea mills malodorous manufactories were introduced in a local court records that the jury present lancelot gamblyn lately of stratford langthorne starchmaker because by unlawful making of starch such a stink and ill favour continue and daily arise less than fifty years later sir william petty was lamenting the fumes steams and stinks of the whole easterly pyle and indeed for hundreds of years after that the easterly pyle became the home of what were known as the stink industries all forms of corruption and noisomeness were fashioned there it represented the focus for londons fear of corruption and disease nor were these fears entirely illfounded either demographic surveys revealed a remarkably high incidence of consumption and fever in the eastern reaches of london so the flight westward continued from the seventeenth century onward the laying out of streets and squares moved inexorably in that direction the wealthy and the wellborn and the fashionable insisted upon dwelling in what nash called the respectable streets at the west end of the town the topographical divide or rather the obsession with the west over the east could be seen in minute particulars when jermyn street was completed in the s the london encyclopaedia observes that the west end of the street was more fashionable than the east another line of demarcation ran through soho square where every minute longitude east is equal to as many degrees of gentility minus as an american visitor put it or towards west plus of the newly fashioned regent street it was noted that there are many squares on the eastern side of this thoroughfare and some good streets but rank and fashion appear to avoid them it has been observed that the west end has the money and the east end has the dirt there is leisure to the west and labour to the east yet in the early decades of the nineteenth century it was not singled out as being the most desperate source of poverty and violence it was known principally as the centre of shipping and of industry and thus the home of the working poor in fact the industry and the poverty steadily intensified dye works and chemical works manure factories and lampblack factories manufacturers of glue and of paraffin producers of paint and bonemeal all clustered in bow and old ford and stratford the river lea for centuries had been the site of industry and of transport but throughout the nineteenth century it was further exploited and degraded a match factory on its banks lent the water a urinous taste and appearance while the smell of the whole area became offensive in all this of course we see the condition of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries being expanded and intensified it is as if the process continued with a momentum of its own the industrial districts of canning town silvertown and beckton were created between the lea and barking creek beckton becoming particularly well known for its sewage dispersal system all the filth of london crept eastwards but then at some point in the s it reached what might be called critical mass it imploded the east end became the abyss or the nether world of strange secrets and desires it was the area of london into which more poor people were crammed than any other and out of that congregation of poverty sprang reports of evil and immorality of savagery and unnamed vice in his essay on murder considered as one of the fine arts thomas de quincey apostrophised the area of the ratcliffe highway murders of as one of the most chaotic and a most dangerous quarter a perilous region replete with manifold ruffianism it is perhaps important that a writer should inscribe the east end in this manner since its subsequent and lurid reputation was to a large extent established upon the work of journalists and novelists who felt almost obliged to conjure up visions of darkness and horror as a way of describing the shadow which london itself cast and of course the defining sensation which for ever marked the east end and created its public identity was the series of murders ascribed to jack the ripper between the late summer and early autumn of the scale of the sudden and brutal killings effectively marked out the area as one of incomparable violence and depravity but it was equally significant that the crimes should have been committed in the darkness of malodorous alleys the fact that the killer was never captured seemed only to confirm the impression that the bloodshed was created by the foul streets themselves that the east end was the true ripper all the anxieties about the city in general then became attached to the east end in particular as if in some peculiar sense it had become a microcosm of londons own dark life there were books written the titles of which represented their themesthe bitter cry of outcast london the people of the abyss ragged london in darkest london the nether world in that last novel george gissing provides a description of the peststricken regions of east london sweltering in sunshine which served only to reveal the intimacies of abomination across miles of a city of the damned such as thought never conceived before this age of ours above streets swarming with a nameless populace cruelly exposed by the unwonted light of heaven this is a vision of the east end as the inferno the city as hell and it is not one confined to the novelist the autobiographical narrative of john martin school master and poet was partly set in the purlieus of nineteenthcentury limehouse a mind is neededblack misanthropic in its view of things used to fearful visions of the night to look with comprehensive and unflinching eye upon these scenes of sickly horror and despair when jack london first wished to visit the east end in he had been told by the manager of thomas cooks cheapside branch that we are not accustomed to taking travellers to the east end we receive no call to take them there and we know nothing whatsoever about the place at all they knew nothing about it perhaps and yet everyone knew of it in tales of mean streets arthur morrison declared that there is no need to say in the east end of what the east end is a vast city as famous in its way as any the hand of man has made but who knows the east end the presence of jewish immigrants in whitechapel and in spitalfields only served to emphasise the apparently alien quality of the neighbourhood they served also to reinforce that other territorial myth which clung to the east end because it did indeed lie towards the east it became associated with that larger east which lay beyond christendom and which threatened the borders of europe the name given to the dispossessed children of the streets streetarabs offers some confirmation of this diagnosis the east end was in that sense the ultimate threat and the ultimate mystery it represented the heart of darkness yet there were some who came as missionaries into that darkness as early as the s men and women impelled by religious or philanthropic motives set up halls and chapels in the east end the vicar of st judes in whitechapel samuel barnett was instrumental in what was called settlement work where generally idealistic young men and women tried materially to assist the straitened or precarious lives of the east enders arnold toynbee declared in one of his lectures to the inhabitants of bethnal green you have to forgive us for we have wronged you we have sinned against you grievously we will serve you we will devote our lives to your service and we cannot do more partly as a result of his example and his eloquence various missions were established among them oxford house in bethnal green and st mildreds house upon the isle of dogs the tone of supplication in toynbees remarks might also be construed as one of anxiety that those who had been so grievously treated might react against the sinners who betrayed them there was indeed much radical activity in the east end with the members of the london corresponding society in the s and the chartists in the s meeting in the mug houses and public houses of whitechapel and elsewhere in order to promote their revolutionary causes a radically egalitarian and antiauthoritarian spirit has always been rising from the area in terms of religious as well as political dissent if in fact the two can be distinguished in the eighteenth century the ancient deists of hoxton espoused millennarian and generally levelling principles and there is evidence of ranters and muggletonians quakers and fifth monarchy men contributing to the general atmosphere of dissent in the early decades of the twentieth century the political ethic of the east end was dominated by municipal socialism george lansbury in particular became associated with the movement known as poplarism a variant of populism whereby in the local labour party in control of the borough set unemployment relief at a level higher than the central government permitted there was a confrontation and the councillors of poplar were briefly imprisoned but the central demands of lansbury were eventually met it was a characteristic episode in the sense that the east end never rose up as the civic authorities feared it was always considered a potent ground for insurrection as oswald mosley and his followers demonstrated in the s but like the rest of london it was too large and too dispersed to create any kind of galvanic shock a more important revolutionary influence came in fact from the immigrant population the communist and anarchist movements among the german and russian populations have borne significant witness to the effect of the east end upon human consciousness there was the celebrated anarchists club in jubilee street among whose members were kropotkin and malatesta opposite the london hospital along whitechapel high street a hall accommodated the fifth congress of the russian social democratic labour party which ensured the preeminence of the bolshevik party in a hostel in fieldgate street joseph stalin was a welcome guest lenin visited whitechapel on numerous occasions and attended the anarchists club while trotsky and litvinov were also frequent visitors to the area the east end can in that sense be considered one of the primary sites of world communism no doubt the presence of political exiles from europe is largely responsible for that eminence but the prevailing atmosphere of the place may also have been suggestive blanchard jerrold in the s had remarked upon the fact that the quaint dirty povertyladen stalllined streets are here and there relieved by marts and warehouses and emporiums in which rich men who employ the poorest labour are found already the startling contrast between the rich and the poorest standing upon the same ground is being revealed the east end was also the image of the whole world with the german the jew the frenchman the lascar the swarthy native of spitalfields the leering thinhanded thief with endless swarms of ragged children international communism sprang from an international context but other visitors saw other realities the czechoslovakian playwright karel capek observing the east end at first hand in the early twentieth century suggested that in this overwhelming quantity it no longer looks like an excess of human beings but like a geological formation it was piled up from soot and dust it is an impersonal force of dullness the total aggregate of labour and suffering among the soot of ships and factories it is a geological formation perhaps to the extent that the area itself seems to emanate waves of frustration and enervation at the turn of the nineteenth century mrs humphry ward noticed the monotony of the east end in terms of long lines of low housestwo storeys always or two storeys and a basementof the same yellowish brick all begrimed by the same smoke every doorknocker of the same pattern every windowblind hung in the same way and the same corner public on either side flaming in the hazy distance george orwell noticed it too in when he complained that the territory between whitechapel and wapping was quieter and drearier than the equivalent poor areas of paris this is a familiar refrain but it tends to come from those upon the outside the autobiographical reminiscences of east enders themselves do not dwell upon monotony or hardship but upon the sports and clubs and markets the local shops and local characters which comprised each neighbourhood as one old resident of poplar put it in a recent history of the area the east end then and now edited by wg ramsey it never occurred to me that my brothers and sisters and i were underprivileged for what you never have you never miss this is the experience of the east end and of all other impoverished parts of london for those who live in them the apparent deprivation and monotony are never realised because they do not touch the inner experience of those who are meant to be affected by them any emphasis upon the uniformity or tedium of the east end has in any case to be seriously modified by the constantly remarked merriment or cheerfulness of its inhabitants there was a valiant cheeriness full of strength blanchard jerrold remarked after reciting a litany of sorrowful mysteries to be found upon the eastern streets everywhere a readiness to laugh he also observed that the man who has a ready wit will employ his basket while the dull vendor remains with his arms crossed thus emerged the figure of the cockney once the native of all london but in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries identified more and more closely with the east end this was the character heard by vs pritchett with whining vowels and ruined consonants and the hardchinned look of indomitable character the creation of that chirpy and resourceful stereotype can in some measure be ascribed to another contrast with east end monotony the music hall the conditions of life in whitechapel bethnal green and elsewhere may have predisposed their inhabitants to violent delights the penny gaffs and the brightly illuminated public houses are testimony to that as well as the roughness and coarseness which were intimately associated with them but it is also significant that the east end harboured more music halls than any other part of londongilberts in whitechapel the eastern and the apollo in bethnal green the cambridge in shoreditch wiltons in wellclose square the queens in poplar the eagle in the mile end road and of course the empire in hackney are just the most prominent among a large number which became as characteristic of the east end as the sweatshops or the church missions by the midnineteenth century the area roughly inclusive of the present borough of tower hamlets harboured some music halls it is perhaps appropriate that charles morton universally if inaccurately known as father of the halls because of his establishment of the canterbury in was born in bethnal green in one sense the eastern region of the city was simply reaffirming its ancient identity it has been mentioned before that two of the earliest london theatres the theatre and the curtain had been erected in the sixteenth century upon the open ground of shoreditch the whole region outside the walls became a haven for popular entertainment of every kind from teagardens to wrestling matches and bearbaiting so the music halls of the east end represent another continuity within the area equivalent to its poor housing and to its stink industries yet in another sense the halls represented the extension and intensification of east end life in the nineteenth century many emerged and prospered in the sthe eagle tea gardens the effingham and wiltons are of that periodby including burletta performances as well as variety acts and orchestral music among those who played here were the lions comiques alfred vance and george leybourne who sang such cockney songs as slap bang here we are again and champagne charlie vance in particular was known for his coster songs written in a flash or cockney dialect among them costermonger joe and the chickaleary cove where humour and bravado are easily mingled such songs as these became the folk songs of the east end animated by all the pathos and diversity of each neighbourhood charged with the circumstances and realities of the entire area they remain powerful because they are filled with a real sense of place as tangible as artillery lane or rotherhithe tunnel when charles coborn sang two lovely black eyes at the paragon in mile end he recalled parties of girls and lads of the coster fraternity all of a row arm in arm shouting out my chorus at the top of their voices the identification of performer and audience was paramount so that when lively lily burnand sang about the housekeeping of the poor at the queens in poplar she was touching upon a familiar subject dont forget the hapenny on the jam jar the landlords comin in the mornin an hes so particular in this instance it was the importance of earning the halfpenny on the return of the jam jar to the shop the common elements of privation and poverty were lifted into another sphere where they became touched by universal comedy and pity thus for a moment at least was misery transcended it would not be too much to claim in fact that the halls provided a boisterous and necessary secular form of the mass in which the audience were themselves identified and uplifted as members of a general community in early twentiethcentury memoirs of the east end that life is recorded with what in retrospect looks like the precision of all lost things along poplar high street there were horace thorogood wrote in east of aldgate once little shops of various shapes and heights and sizes interspersed with small houses with polished brass numbers on the doors here might be found a parrotcage shop a musical instrument shop and characteristically rows of little onestoreyed houses standing a few feet back from the pavement behind iron railings in shadwell the children went barefoot and wore rags but that was just irish slovenliness they never wanted for food in the east end in the first decades of the twentieth century the public houses were open from early morning till halfpast midnight with gin at fourpence halfpenny a quartern and beer a penny for a halfpint women would come in at seven in the morning and stay till three in the afternoon the east end was also famous for its marketsrosemary lane spitalfields chrisp street watney streetwhen the thoroughfares swarmed with people and at night flared with naphtha light you could have walked on the peoples heads all the way from commercial road to cable street a fierce and protective sense of identity marked out the east end in these decades the inhabitants of limehouse called the people to the west those above the bridges and there was a great deal of inbreeding which sprang from territorial loyalties one isolated corner of poplar beside the leamouth road in the s had a population numbering about men women and children according to the east end then and now who were members of no more than six families among whom the lammings the scanlans and the jeffries were the most numerous these families tended to marry within their own circle the community had its own school two pubs and a small general store it was noticed too that the chinese residents of pennyfields married girls from hoxton rather than those from poplar poplarites were against mixed marriages according to one observer in the s it might be surmised that since hoxton is closer to the city and to the rest of london it has avoided that peculiar sense of territoriality or insularity when east enders became more affluent they moved out the clerks of the nineteenth century for example took advantage of the burgeoning transport system to migrate into the more salubrious areas of chingford or forest gate the population of middlesex grew per cent in ten years wembley grew by per cent and harrow by per cent only the poor remained in the old centres of the east end their numbers increasing as their fate grew more desperate this in turn established precisely the sense of separation and grievance which has not yet been dissipated the cost of labour in human terms was very high the east end tended to wake up earlier than the rest of the city and at dawn the area became a great plain of smoking chimneys the factories kept on coming in search of cheap labour and by it contained almost per cent of the citys working population in the early years of the twentieth century horace thorogood came upon one east end cottage under a railway where he found a family of six living in one upper room the window of which had to be kept closed otherwise sparks from the trains flew in and set light to the bedclothes the effect of the second world war surpassed those few disagreeable sparks and great swathes of the east end were destroyed approximately per cent of the built areas of stepney poplar and bethnal green were razed once more the east end was adversely affected by its industrial history the german bombers sought out the ports and the factory areas close to the lea valley as well as using the inhabitants of the east end as an example it suggests the importance of the east in the whole process of the war that the king and queen visited poplar and stepney immediately after the celebrations of ve day in may it was perhaps one method of controlling or ascertaining the mood of a populace which since the nineteenth century had been considered mysterious even as late as whole areas were still characterised only as bombsites where strange weeds grew and where children played a temporary housing programme authorised the construction of nissen huts and prefabricated singlestorey dwellings but many of these prefabs were still in use more than twenty years later there were other schemes to house the residents of the east end not least the greater london plan of professor abercrombie who wished to relocate many city dwellers in satellite towns beyond the newly established green belt the proposal was to disperse a large number of residents from hackney and stepney and bethnal green yet the whole history of london suggests that such exercises in civic engineering are only partially successful an equivalent emphasis was placed on the rebuilding and replanning of the devastated east as if its character might be thoroughly changed but it is impossible to destroy three hundred years of human settlement for all the redevelopments of the east end in the s and s you had only to turn a corner to encounter a row of terraced housing erected in the s or the s there were still georgian houses as well as laidout estates from the s and the s the postwar east end was a palimpsest of its past for those who cared to look for such things there were the dark canals and the gasworks old pathways and rusting bridges all with the exhalation of forgetfulness and decay there were patches of waste ground covered with weeds and litter as well as deserted factories and steps seeming to lead nowhere the old streets of tiny yellowbrick houses were still to be found with their characteristic pattern of a small front parlour and a passage leading past it from the street door straight into the kitchen which looked out upon a small yard two small bedrooms above and a cellar beneath along the barking road were scores of sidestreetsladysmith avenue kimberley avenue mafeking avenue macaulay road thackeray road and dickens road form one sequencein which row upon row of suburban villas albeit one grade higher than the terraces of bethnal green or whitechapel effortlessly retained into the s the atmosphere of the late nineteenth century the borough of hackney epitomises sprawl and heterogeneity one account evocatively titled a journey through ruins the last days of london published in took dalston lane as its centre of enquiry here the author patrick wright discovered a street corner of forgotten municipal services as a token of civic neglect yet its old energies remain and dalston lane is a jumble of residential commercial and industrial activities with factories clothiers shops and small businesses one of the most surprising aspects of the contemporary east end is the extent to which it has maintained its economic life in the equivalent of the nineteenthcentury small workshop a number of the main thoroughfares from the hackney road to the roman road and hoxton street are populated by storefront businesses ranging from television repairers to newsagents upholsterers to fruiterers cabinetmakers to moneyexchangers in the east where historically land and property have been less valuable than in the west the relics of lost decades linger and are commonly allowed to decay there are curious regions of the east end where other continuities may be glimpsed in walthamstow just beyond the high street to the east some spectral image or atmosphere of the countryside suddenly pervades church hill this is indeed a peculiar sensation since all the streets close to it including the high street markhouse road and coppermill road embody the characteristic patterns of the east end suburbs nevertheless the old presence of a once rural neighbourhood seems to issue from the territory itself many areas in that sense preserve their identity there is a harshness about barking for example which makes it dissimilar from walthamstow here a native population seems to have maintained its presence with a kind of bleakness or hardness of attitude the survival of part of the ancient abbey in no way diminishes that atmosphere which is powerfully sustained by the presence of the old creek from which the majority of the population once earned their living it remains a strangely isolated or selfcommuning neighbourhood where the london accent seems peculiarly thick in pennyfields where the malays and chinese dwelled more than a century before there is now a large population of vietnamese secondhand pornography is sold in sclater street shoreditch in what has always been a redlight district the market of green street in east ham recalls the energy and spirit of medieval london itself in fact the ancient mercantile life of the city has been reawakened if indeed it ever really slept in areas as diverse as west ham and stoke newington spitalfields and leytonstone a typical journey around an east end neighbourhood will disclose one or two georgian houses with perhaps some large midvictorian establishments now turned into council offices or social security centres there will be remnants of late nineteenthcentury housing together with council housing of the s and s pubs and betting offices together with the ubiquitous small general store and newsagent minicab offices as well as shops specialising in longdistance telephone calls to africa or india a variety of council blocks the oldest estates alongside lowrise estates of the s and the nineteenstorey tower blocks of the same period there will be an open space or a park in some parts of the east the arches beneath the innumerable railway bridges will be used for carmaintenance or for storage yet there have of course been changes poplar high street was a crowded thoroughfare with a plethora of shops and stalls and grimy buildings on either side now it is an open street bordered by fivestorey councilhouse estates pubs and shops of yellow brick the sound of people thronging buying and selling has now been replaced by the intermittent noise of traffic much of the east end has followed that example where there was once a collection of shops and houses in a variety of styles there will now be a block of uniform texture and dimensions as a substitute for rows upon rows of terraced houses there are major roads the altered neighbourhoods seem somehow lighter perhaps because they have lost touch with their history at the extreme western end of poplar high street just beyond pennyfields joseph nightingales coffee rooms with signs for steak and kidney or liver and bacon used to adjoin the horseflesh shop of james mcewen which in turn was next to george ablard the hairdresser the buildings had different frontages and were of varying height in recent years that corner has been taken up by threestorey redbrick council dwellings and a small thoroughfare saltwell street runs by it the opium quarter of limehouse is now represented by a chinese takeaway here was once a street known as bickmore street and an extant photograph taken in shows crowds of children posed outside a number of bowwindowed shopfronts in its place today stands part of a recreation ground it might be concluded that the clutter and clatter of life have gone from these areas even if they exist elsewhere in the east end it could also be suggested that the rebuilt or renovated neighbourhoods resemble those within other areas of london the council estates of poplar for example are not so very different from those of southall or greenford so the aspiration towards civic contentment has led to a diminution of local identity the greatest contrast of all evinced in photographs taken from to lies in the diminution of people in the streets the life of the east end has gone within whether the telephone or television has effected this change is not the question the salient fact remains that the human life of the streets has greatly diminished in exuberance and in intensity yet it is important not to sentimentalise this transition if the east seems a more denuded place it is also a less impoverished one if it is more remote or less human it is also healthier no one would willingly exchange a council flat for a tenement slum even if the slums were filled with a communal spirit you cannot go back chapter the south work that was how southwark received its name from the south work of a river wall to match its northern counterpart its origins however remain mysterious along the old kent road at the junction with bowles road were discovered the remnants of an ancient settlement which manufactured flint tools within the weathered sands reported one investigator in the london archaeologist were many finds associated with the activities of prehistoric people no doubt it would be fanciful to connect this long history of human settlement with the air of exhaustion of spent life which seems to pervade the vicinity there is after all another explanation the roads of the south were decorated with funereal monuments and the memory of these important emblems may in part account for the sense of transience associated with the neighbourhood three inhumation burial sites have been found close to each other the first along the present borough high street their significance lies in their rarity the only other burial of an equivalent date being close to the tower of london but also in the fact that two roman burials of a similar nature were found a few yards to the southeast the whole area of southwark is in fact rich in roman burial sites with a cluster of inhumations in the area where stane street and watling street once diverged from what is now borough high street the lines of the streets still exist under the names of newington causeway and the old kent road another cluster of burial sites can be found to the northwest beside another great roman road leading from the bridge across the river that is why travellers met in southwark in order to continue their journeys southward and of course it represents the starting point of the canterbury pilgrimage narrated by chaucer there have always been taverns and inns here for the welfare of those passing through hospitals congregated here also perhaps in some atavistic homage to transitoriness the roman settlement left another legacy a gladiators trident was discovered in southwark prompting speculation that an arena may have been constructed in the vicinity where in the late sixteenth century the swan and the globe theatres flourished the south bank has always been associated with entertainment and pleasure therefore and its most recent incarnations encompass the newly thriving globe theatre as well as the whole area dominated by the royal festival hall the national theatre and the tate modern st mary overie later st saviour later southwark cathedral became a favoured place of sanctuary for those fleeing from the citys justice so southwark acquired an illfavoured reputation there were seven prisons in the area by the seventeenth century its most famous the clink gave its name literally to other such institutions and yet there was continual riot and disorder the neighbourhood was owned by various religious authorities among them the archbishop of canterbury and the cluniac order which inhabited the priory at bermondsey and yet it was known for its licentiousness the prostitutes of the bankside practising their trade within the liberty of the bishop of winchester were known as winchester geese so there existed a strange oscillation between freedom and restraint which is perhaps not so strange after all in the general pattern of contraries which covers the whole of london in wyngaerdes map of the area south of the thames is intimately connected with that of the north by various lines of harmony rather like the contemporary map of the underground flowing towards and over the bridge a continuous row of houses stretches for almost a mile along the southern bank of the thames from paris garden stairs to the great beere howse just east of tooley street beside pickle herring stairs it is perhaps worth noting that over a century before shakespeares falstaff appeared at the globe a short distance away his namesake sir john falstolfe owned four messuages called beer houses here in similar fashion harry or herry bailey of the tabard inn was a real and familiar southwark figure before he entered chaucers canterbury tales perhaps there is something in the air of southwark which encourages the transaction between reality and imagination on the agas map of the s are shown ponds water mills smoky industries bear pits pleasure gardens and stewhouses like the celebrated castle upon the hope inn which still survives as the anchor the city in a sense feared the contagion of these pleasurable haunts a civic edict of the sixteenth century ordered the wherrymen who were customarily employed to row citizens across the river to the brothels to moor their boats at night by the northern stairs in order to ensure that thieves and other misdoers shall not be carried to the southern bank another form of civic displeasure is exemplified in the fact that although bridge without had become the twentysixth ward of the city its inhabitants were not allowed to elect their own aldermen who were in effect imposed upon them southwark had become a kind of satrapy thus ensuring that almost to the end of the twentieth century it remained a relatively undeveloped and illregarded place yet it was not necessarily poorly administered the rich or middling class as always superintended the poor and ensured that travelling paupers were discouraged the parish vestry collected the rates and distributed poor relief while the local court supervised all aspects of trade these suggestions of a relatively selfsufficient community have been amplified in a recent historical survey which concludes that the population of this particular suburb and by extension of others like it was relatively stable the inhabitants of southwark maintained residence in the same houses and intermarried in the same neighbourhood as was characteristic of the city in general these conclusions tend to support the notion that throughout the whole of london and its outlying districts there was a vital and recognisable communal spirit this spirit has survived over so many centuries that the present neighbourhood of rotherhithe for example is still distinct from those of deptford and bermondsey there is an indigenous or native spirit which animates a particular area in contemporary south london there are a number of different areas among them lambeth and brixton camberwell and peckham which have developed beside one another and by some form of symbiosis make up a recognisable atmosphere yet the south remained relatively unknown to other londoners except as a source of disquiet the southern bank fulfilled some of the functions of the eastern pyle as a boundary zone to which london could consign its dirt and its rubbish hence in the early eighteenth century it became the repository for some of the stink industries which had been banished from the city proper the tanneries were consigned to bermondsey for example while lambeth became the site for noisy timber yards vinegarmakers dye manufactories and the makers of soap and tallow it was reported in the local press that a society of persons did exist at lambeth who made a trade of digging up the bodies of the dead they made candles of the fat extracted volatile alkali from the bones and sold the flesh for dogs meat this sounds sufficiently alarmist to be apocryphal but there is no doubt that south london already had a difficult reputation one market gardener of the area decided in to set up his business elsewhere because the smoke constantly enveloped my plants the obscurity of the situation the badness of the roads leading to it with the effluvia of surrounding ditches being at times highly offensive south london or at least those parts of it which were in immediate relation to the rest of the city and could be seen from it was considered as a poor and disreputable appendage there was always a form of urban discrimination that is why there were so many prisons in the vicinity as well as institutions for female orphans and asylums for the poor bethlem too was erected in lambeth london was consigning all its difficult or problematic citizens to the south the area also acquired a reputation for dubious taverns and doubtful pleasure gardens establishments such as the apollo gardens were under civic scrutiny and were on occasions closed down by the authorities for disorderliness the whole of lambeth became known as a louche and even disreputable quarter the temple of flora and the dog and duck tavern situated where the path across st georges fields met the lambeth road was certainly the most dreadful place in or about the metropolis the resorts of women not only of the lower species of prostitution but even of the middle classes south london had once more manifested its ancient status as a haven of sexual freedom the philanthropist francis place recalled highwaymen of the s claiming their horses in these southern fields where flashy women come out to take leave of the thieves at dusk and wish them success it is known that radical insurrectionaries were hunted down in the area since they were believed to plot and plan in various decaying public houses just as the musichall stars of the midnineteenth century moved south to brixton so those of dubious public reputation like the transvestite chevalier deon had moved to lambeth a century before it was in every sense a dumping ground but the prospect of dirt or dilapidation did not materially affect the growth of london in that direction like the beetle which lives upon dung the offensive smells and sounds might even arouse its powers into further expenditures of energy the erection of westminster bridge in and the completion of blackfriars bridge nineteen years later marked the real development of south london highways led from the newly established bridges and moved towards kennington and the elephant and castle in addition roads were laid across open fields to join these major thoroughfares the new roads led to fresh industrial development so that the vinegarand dyeworks were complemented by potteries lime kilns and blacking factories by lambeth had assumed all the characteristics of a slum yet the area still grew it expanded and developed acquiring its shape along with the other ribbon developments which snaked southwards the process acquired resistless momentum in the first decade of the nineteenth century when three toll bridges were completed southwark bridge waterloo bridge and vauxhall bridge opened the way for the extensive building programmes which created south london in its present form the increase in londons population and the exertion of the new industrial forces drew the city over the thames at an ever increasing rate the streets around st georges circus were soon thickly inhabited with houses covering all the adjacent fields but soon the shops and houses and businesses began to travel down the roads which radiated from that neighbourhood newington kennington and walworth were directly affected and by the s the whole area of the present south was being covered in roads and houses the suburban development soon expanded to include peckham and camberwell brixton and clapham even so far as dulwich and herne hill it was not long before sydenham and norwood forest hill and honor oak became part of the same urban diaspora those who have recorded their impressions of coming into london by the railway from the south have remarked upon the apparently endless vista of red and brown roofs dead walls and little streets which flashed by the prospect has been compared to that of a sea or a desert both images invoking the power of some remorseless force which cannot be withstood a character in hg wellss tono bungay travelling in the early s on the southeastern railway marked beyond chislehurst the growing multitude of villas and so came stage by stage through multiplying houses the congestion of houses intensified and piled up presently into tenements i marvelled more and more at this boundless world of dingy people one of the principal sensations was also that of fear it was the instinctive fear of uniformity as well as fear of the approaching capital which had engendered it as the railway carriage travelled closer to its destination at cannon street whiffs of industrial smell of leather of brewing circulated like the odours of sulphur from some unseen inferno since the colonisation of the southern bank was entirely driven by the need for industrial expansion and exploitation it is appropriate that the smell of industry itself should permeate the territory there were glue factories and wool warehouses while charles knights encyclopaedia of london notes that chimneys shot up at intervals of a few yards towering above a very maze of red roofs and furnishing their contribution to the smoky atmosphere of the neighbourhood the district once characterised by its priory was now celebrated for its protean quality it may be regarded as a region of manufacturers a region of marketgardeners a region of wholesale dealers and a maritime region according to the quarter where we take our stand just as there were various trades in bermondsey so there were heterogeneous odours in one street strawberry jam is borne in upon you in whiffs hot and strong in another raw hides and tanning in another glue while in some streets the nose encounters an unhappy combination of all three between and the london novelist and essayist vs pritchett worked for a leather manufacturer he also recalled the odours of bermondsey there was a daylight gloom in this district of london one breathed the heavy drugging beer smell of hops and there was another smell of boots and dog dung the stinging smell of vinegar from a pickle factory and smoke blew down from an emery mill from the occasional little slum houses the sharp stink of poverty that last is of course the most penetrating and significant odour of them all compounding the noisome reputation of south london in general the similarities between the east and the south are apparent but there were also significant disparities the east end offered a more intense kind of community than the south it possessed more open markets for example and more music halls in the south also there was less contact with the rest of london by sheer proximity the east end could share some of the energy and animation of the old city it had after all existed against its walls for many centuries but the great swathe of the river had always isolated the south lending it a somewhat desolate quality it is reflected in those comments about south london which render it a distinct and alien place george gissing for example depicted southwark in terms of its unpleasant odours an evil smell hung about the butchers and the fish shops a publichouse poisoned a whole street with alcoholic fumes from sewergrates rose a miasma that caught the breath a london reporter writing in remarked that to pass over london bridge was to cross that natural dividing line of peoples it is an interesting remark suggesting an almost atavistic reverence for the natural boundary of the river which changes the essence of the territory on either bank he then asked whether having crossed that significant line the very streets changed in some subtle and unconscious manner to a more sordid character the shops to a more blatant kindeven the people to a different and lower type if london contains the world then there is a world of meaning here the distinction between the northern and southern races is of ancient date the north being considered more ascetic and more robust than the effete and sensual south it was a distinction emphasised by darwin who in the context of that theory of natural selection which he developed in london declared that the northern forms were enabled to beat the less powerful southern forms the southern forms may be weaker because they come from too attenuated an origin perhaps stretching back to the great tracts of mesolithic and neolithic time those noisome smells may in part include the odour of ancient history and what of their pleasures according to the london reporter of even the dramatic tastes of the people over the water are now supposed to be primitive and transpontine is the adjective applied to melodrama that is too crude for the superior taste of northern london yet the sensational and spectacular aspects of the theatre of the south may be a refraction of those sixteenthcentury tastes which the south bank once satisfied if you stand on bankside today you will see in alignment the power station of sir giles gilbert scott transformed into the new tate modern opened in beside the seventeenthcentury house on cardinals wharf reputed to have been the lodging of christopher wren in the s while he superintended the construction of st pauls cathedral across the river beside that in turn is the globe recreated in its sixteenthcentury form a short distance away in borough high street the remnants of the george inn evoke the atmosphere of southwark during those centuries when it was a staging post and haven for travellers on their journeys towards or away from the great city close by in st thomass street an old operating theatre has been discovered in the attic of the eighteenthcentury parish church an account of this strange relic dating from notes that many of the surgical instruments were still very similar to those used in roman times trepanning a procedure in use three thousand years ago was still one of the most common operations on this site so when the patients were brought in blindfolded and strapped to the small wooden table and when the doctor raised his knife perhaps they were participating in rites which had taken place on the same ground since the time of the neolithic and roman settlements these tokens or emblems of the past have retained their power as a consequence of the relative isolation or insularity of south london even in the s according to aa jacksons semidetached london it was rare for a londoner to cross the river because it remained foreign territory with a quite unfamiliar distinctively different transport system of course much has been demolisheda row of elizabethan houses in stoney street southwark was torn down in order to make way for the bridge into cannon street railway stationbut much survives in a different aspect where once in the seventeenth century thomas dekker observed so many taverns that the high street became a continued ale house with not a shop to be seen the public houses still cluster together on the way leading to london bridge even in the early nineteenth century the talbot inn once called the tabard could still be inspected by the curious antiquarian as well as the nightly visitor above its gateway was the inscription this is the inn where geoffrey chaucer knight and nine and twenty pilgrims lodged in their journey to canterbury in neither fashion nor pressing commercial need affected the fabric of south london this accounts for its charm and its desolation yet the revival of the south bank in particular with a new footbridge erected in in order to span the river from st peters hill to bankside will lead to a great change south london has been underdeveloped in past centuries but this neglect has allowed it effortlessly to reinvent itself the point can be made by looking at the stretch of the thames where much redevelopment is taking place on the northern bank the streets and lanes are filled to bursting with business premises so that no further alteration in its commercial aspect or direction is possible without more destruction the relatively undeveloped tracts south of the thames are in contrast available for a spirited and imaginative transformation to walk along the north bank of the river between queenhithe and dark house walk is an experience in isolation there is no sense of any connection with people or with the city along the thameside walk which winds between the old quays and jetties these wharves exist as little more than the disconnected riverside terraces of various company headquarters including one bank and a depot of the corporation of london the northern bank of the thames to use a contemporary expression has been privatised to the south however there is interchange and animation from the new tate modern to the globe and then to the anchor public house the broad walkway is commonly filled with people the ancient hospitality and freedom of the south are emerging once more in the twentyfirst century it will become one of the most vigorous and varied not to say popular centres of london life so the south bank has been able triumphantly to reassert its past the restored bankside power station with its upper storey resembling a box filled with light is aligned with cardinals wharf and the newly constructed globe in a triune invocation of territorial spirit this is surely a cause for wonder when five centuries are embraced in a single and simple act of recognition it is part of londons power where the past exists the future may flourish the centre of empire a detail from hogarths a harlots progress showing a small black servant black slaves were often employed in the more affluent london households of the eighteenth century chapter maybe its because im a londoner london has always been a city of immigrants it was once known as the city of nations and in the mideighteenth century addison remarked that when i consider this great city in its several quarters or divisions i look upon it as an aggregate of various nations distinguished from each other by their respective customs manners and interests the same observation could have been applied in any period over the last years it is remarked of eighteenthcentury london in peter linebaughs the london hanged that here was a centre of worldwide experiences with outcasts refugees travellers and merchants finding a place of refuge of news and an arena for the struggle of life and death it was the city itself which seemed to summon them as if only in the experience of the city could their lives have meaning its population has been likened to the eighteenthcentury drink all nations made up of the remains at the bottoms of various bottles of spirit but this is to do less than justice to the energy and enterprise of the various immigrant populations who arrived in the city they were not dregs or leftovers in fact the animation and enterprise of london often seemed to invade them and with one or two exceptions these various groups rose and prospered it is the continuing and neverending story it has often been remarked that in other cities many years must pass before a foreigner is accepted in london it takes as many months it is true too that you can only be happy in london if you begin to consider yourself as a londoner it is the secret of successful assimilation fresh generations with their songs and customs arrived at least as early as the time of the roman settlement when london was opened up as a european marketplace the working inhabitants of the city might have come from gaul from greece from germany from italy from north africa a polyglot community all speaking a variety of rough or demotic latin by the seventh century when london rose again as an important port and market the native and immigrant populations were thoroughly intermingled there was also a more general change it was no longer possible to distinguish britons from saxons and after the northern invasions of the ninth century the danes entered the citys racial mixture by the tenth century the city was populated by cymric brythons and belgae by the remnants of the gaulish legions by east saxons and mercians by danes norwegians and swedes by franks and jutes and angles all mingled and mingling together to form a distinct tribe of londoners a text known as iv aethelred mentions that those who passed through london in the period before the norman settlement were men from flanders pontheiu normandy and the ile de france as well as men of the emperor germans in fact london has always been a hungry city for many centuries it needed a permanent influx of foreign settlers in order to compensate for its high deathrate they were also good for business since immigration has characteristically been associated with the imperatives of london trade foreign merchants mingled here and intermarried because it was one of the principal markets of the world on another level immigrants came here to pursue their trades when denied commercial freedom in their native regions and again other immigrants arrived in the city ready and able to take on any kind of employment and to perform those tasks which native londoners given the relative nature of that phrase were unwilling to perform in all instances immigration corresponded to employment and profit that is why it would be sentimental and sanctimonious to describe london as an open city in some idealistic sense it has acquiesced in waves of immigration because essentially they helped it to prosper there were however occasions of criticism i do not at all like that city richard of devizes complained in all sorts of men crowd there from every country under the heavens each brings its own vices and its own customs to the city in the monkish chronicler matthew paris was bemoaning the fact that london was overflowing with poitevins provençals italians and spaniards it is an anticipation of late twentiethcentury complaints that london was being swamped by people from africa the caribbean or asia in the case of the thirteenthcentury chronicler there is an atavistic and incorrect notion of some original native race which is being displaced by others yet other forces are at work in his attack upon the foreigners he was not wholly sympathetic to the commercial instincts of the capital and felt himself alienated or removed from its heterogeneous life thus to single out foreign merchants was a way of neutralising or challenging the citys commercial nature those who attacked immigrants were in effect attacking the business ethic which required the constant influx of new trade and new labour the attack did not succeed it never has succeeded the immigrant rolls of provide an absorbing study in ethnicity and cultural contrast an essay by sylvia l thrupp in studies in london history aliens in and around london in the fifteenth century offers interesting parallels with other periods some per cent were classified as doche this was a generic term including flemish dane and german but more than half in fact came from holland the evidence of their wills suggests that their common characteristics were a striving towards piety and economic advancement through honest work and mutual help within the group an observation which could equally be applied to more recent immigrants from for example south asia these fifteenthcentury immigrants tended to settle into defined trades such as goldsmithery tailory haberdashery clockmaking and brewing they were also celebrated as printers others mingled within the broader urban community as beersellers basketmakers joiners caterers and servants within london households or at london inns evidence from the guilds and from extant wills also indicates that english became the means of communication within this group again a characteristic and often instinctive response of any immigrant community in the city wards the italians comprised a commercial and financial aristocracy although there were differences within the group there were frenchmen and a number of jews and greek italian and spanish physicians but the underclass of that period seems to have been icelanders who were commonly employed as servants there was a period of sustained suspicion in the s when italian merchants and bankers were condemned for usury but the imbroglio passed leaving only its rumours as confirmation of the fact that londoners were particularly sensitive to commercial doubledealing the evil may day riots of when the shops and houses of foreigners were attacked by a mob of apprentices were dispelled with equal speed and without any permanent effect upon the alien population this has been the custom of the city over many centuries despite violent acts inspired by demagoguery and financial panic the immigrant communities of the city have generally been permitted to settle down engage with their neighbours in trade and parish work adopt english as their native language intermarry and bring up their children as londoners a wave of immigration in the mids however when the huguenots sought refuge from catholic persecution provoked a general alarm on february there was a great watch in the city of london for fear of an insurrection against the strangers which were in great number in and about the city the huguenots were accused of trading secretly among themselves and of engaging in illicit commercial practices such as hoarding they take up the fairest houses in the city divide and fit them for their several uses and take into them several lodgers and dwellers thus they were held directly responsible for londons overcrowding even if the children of these immigrants born within this realm are by law accounted english they remained foreigners by inclination and kind affection once more it is a familiar language adopted by those who were uneasy at the presence of aliens in their midst there were also charges that they pushed up the prices of london properties it was perhaps inevitable that at times of financial recession or depression the onus fell upon the supposedly unfair or restrictive commercial practices of the aliens in similar manner at times of growth and expansion the presence of the same traders was greeted as an indication of the citys munificence and varied wealth addison on viewing the polyglot assembly at the royal exchange remarked that it gratifies my vanity as i am an englishman to see so much an assembly of countrymen and foreigners consulting together upon the private business of mankind and making this metropolis a kind of emporium for the whole earth there is no jewbaiting or francophobia in this account in william wordsworth writing of his earlier residence in london reflected upon the fact that within the city crowd he had found every character of form and face the swede the russian from the genial south the frenchman and the spaniard from remote america the hunterindian moors malays lascars the tartar and chinese and negro ladies in white muslin gowns he also mentions the italian the turk the jew and can thus be said to provide a comprehensive survey of the immigrant population it provides a now familiar insight into the character of a city which contains many nations within itself but in the nineteenth century there came a fresh movement of political as opposed to religious refugees carlyle noticed their presence in london when he observed that one might mark the years and epochs by the successive kinds of exiles that walk london streets and in grim silent manner demand pity from us and reflections from us the russian revolutionary kropotkin celebrated london as the haven for political refugees from all over the world and indeed it has been claimed that by the close of the nineteenth century the city had become the most significant arena for the dissemination of political ideas for the creation of political ideologies and for the promulgation of political causes so there were spanish refugees in somers townyou could see a group of fifty or a hundred stately tragic figures in proud threadbare coats perambulating mostly with closed lips the broad pavements of euston square and the regions about st pancras new church they became conspicuous in and then like many other such groups vanished almost as suddenly as they had first arrived in the spring of according to a diarist of the period there was an abrupt increase in the numbers of french in london as political agitation and civic uprisings fluctuated in intensity so did the numbers of the french london became the political barometer for the whole of europe garibaldi and mazzini came as did marx and engels in herzen and kossuth arrived the one a russian the other a hungarian so did political refugees from poland and germany england and in particular london was the place most welcoming to exiles the history of any one group is filled with profound interest there were jews africans and representatives of most of the european races at the time of the roman settlement it is not too much to claim that their lives have haunted london ever since the mystery of difference and of oppression has been played out over the centuries touching upon the need to define oneself or ones race and implicated in the pride or susceptibility of a native population this narrative has been largely conceived in terms of acceptance and assimilation but no known human history is without its victims the jews suffered early from prejudice and brutality refugees from the rouen pogrom arrived in the city in but the first documentary evidence for a jewish quarter emerges in they were not permitted to engage in ordinary commerce but were allowed to lend money the usury from which christian merchants were barred then of course they were blamed or hated for the very trade imposed upon them by the civic authorities there was a murderous assault upon their quarters in when the houses were besieged by the roaring people because the madmen had not tools fire was thrown on the roof and a terrible fire quickly broke out many families were burned alive while others fleeing into the narrow thoroughfares of old jewry and gresham street were clubbed or beaten to death there was another pogrom in and on certain occasions the jews took refuge in the tower in order to escape the depredations of the mob they suffered from the noble families who were indebted to them also and in strange anticipation of a later destiny they were obliged to wear a sign upon their clothes in recognition of their race it was not the star of david but a tabula or depiction of the stone tablets upon which the ten commandments were supposed to have been miraculously inscribed in hundreds of jews were hanged on suspicion of adulterating the coinage and then eighteen years latertheir usefulness at an end after the arrival of italian and french financiersall were expelled beaten spat upon or killed in a mass exodus from the city it would have seemed that the wandering race could find no permanent haven even in the cosmopolitan and commercial city of london london instead had become the very pattern of urban exploitation and aggression but some returned quietly and almost invisibly over the next two or three centuries under the guise of christians in the seventeenth century charles i made use of their financial skills and resources but it was cromwell who with a more profound biblical knowledge allowed the right of settlement after a humble petition of the hebrews at present residing in this city of london they requested that wee may therewith meete at our said private devotions in our particular houses without feere of molestation either to our persons famillys or estates these were sephardic jews who like isak lopes chillon one of the signatories to the petition came out of spain and portugal but in the latter part of the seventeenth century from central and eastern europe arrived the ashkenazi jews who were less affluent less well educated and variously depicted as downtrodden and povertystricken charles booth has described how the old settlers held aloof from the newcomers and regarded them as a lower caste fit only to receive alms and here emerges the other face of the immigrant population the newcomers were not necessarily the accepted and acceptable not merchants and doctors but the wandering alien the lowly refugee the poor unskilled migrant fit only for the sale of old clothes or in peddling goods such as fruit jewellry and knives the ashkenazim were representative of an entire impoverished and wandering population alternately exploited and abused by the native residents more ashkenazi jews arrived at various notable occasions in the eighteenth century there were persecutions and partitions and sieges which sent them flocking to their coreligionists already in london where the first ashkenazi synagogue had been established in aldgate in but they were not welcomed principally because they were poor it was suggested that they would deluge the kingdom with brokers usurers and beggars once more emerges the irrational but instinctive fear of being swamped they were also accused of taking jobs from native londoners although since they could not be apprenticed to christian masters the fear of their usurping available employment was a false one but in london such fears have always been widely advertised and believed in a society where financial want and insecurity were endemic among the working population any suggestion of unfair labouring practices could arouse great discontent thus in the s and s jewbaiting became a sport like cockthrowing or bullbaiting or pelting some poor wretch in the pillory there is another problem evinced as early as the seventeenth century whereby immigrants are lent distinct and opprobrious identities as the frenchmen love to be bold flemings to be drunken thomas dekker wrote in so irish love to be costermongers or street pedlars it is a question in the modern term of stereotyping which afflicts all migrant populations the irony of course is that certain groups seem unable to escape this matrix of false expectations and misperceptions the london irish for example had always been typecast as the poorest of the poor by parish records note the presence of a poor irishman a poore distressed man from ireland a shroude for an irishman that dyed a poore gentleman vndone by the burning of a cittie in ireland his goods cast away comeing from ireland four poore women and sixe children that came oute of ireland poor plundered irish all these instances and more come from the registers of st gilesinthefields and evoke the first steps in a sad history of migration yet it was not quite the beginning eleven years before an edict had declared that this realm hath of late been pestered with a great number of irish beggars who live here idly and dangerously and are of illexample to the natives this has always been one of the cries against the immigrants of london that they are lazy living off handouts like beggars and thus demoralising the resident population the assumption here must be that immigrants are a threat because they undermine the will to work and provide examples of successful idleness they are also receiving help or charity which paradoxically the native population claims by right to itself the same complaints have been levelled in recent years against the bangladeshi population of whitechapel and of tower hamlets in general there were riots against the irish too once more on the prevailing assumption that they were allowing themselves to be used as cheap employmentletting themselves out to all sorts of ordinary labour robert walpole wrote considerably cheaper than the english labourers have there were masters who took them in for above onethird less per day few observers stopped to consider the measure of poverty and desperation which would encourage them to accept almost starvation wages instead there was open hostility and violence directed against them committed by mobs which arose in southwark lambeth and tyburn road there were assaults upon the irish in tower hamlets clare market and covent garden during the gordon riots in under the lambent cry of no popery irish dwellings and public houses were indiscriminately attacked and pulled down another familiar component of these actions against the immigrants was the prevailing belief that many of them were criminals come to prey upon unsuspecting londoners one city magistrate in argued that most of the robberies and the murders consequent upon them have been committed by these outcasts from ireland just as the jews were receivers so the irish were thieves london was the refuge where dangerous or depraved immigrants seek shelter and concealment the meaning of refuge then can subtly change from haven to lair among these riots and alarms there was another group of immigrants who if they stirred little outrage excited even less sympathy they were the indians the forgotten ancestors of the twentiethcentury arrivals who came to london as servants or slaves some remained in employment while others were summarily dismissed or ran away to a vagrant life there were hue and cry advertisements in the public printsa guinea for the recapture of a black boy an indian about thirteen years old run away the th ins from putney with a collar about his neck with this inscription the lady bromfields black in lincolns inn fields other advertisements were placed to discover an east india tawney black or a runaway bengal boy other asian servants were discharged or dumped having attended their employers on their passage from india so that they were reduced to a life upon the streets one indian visitor wrote to the times in order to complain about the presence of indian beggars who were a great annoyance to the public but more so to the indian gentlemen who visit england the public advertiser in observed that those poor wretches who are daily begging for a passage back proves that the generality of those who bring them over leave them to shift for themselves the moment they have no further occasion for their services these were the unwilling immigrants although the general number of european immigrants increased throughout the nineteenth century the jews and the irish remained the targets of public opprobrium they were the object of derision and disgust because they lived in selfcontained communities popularly regarded as squalid it was generally assumed too that they had somehow imported their disorderly and insanitary conditions with them philanthropic visitors to the irish rookeries discovered such scenes of filth and wretchedness as cannot be conceived somehow these conditions were considered to be the fault of the immigrants themselves who were accustomed to no better in their native lands the actual and squalid nature of london itself and the social exclusion imposed upon the irish or the jews were not matters for debate the questionwhere else are they to gowas not put similarly the fact that immigrants were willing to accept the harshest and most menial forms of employment was also used as another opportunity for clandestine attack with the implied suggestion that they were good for nothing else yet the jews became part of the sweated system in order to make enough money to move out of the unhappy situation in which they were placed they no more appreciated the noisome conditions of whitechapel than did philanthropic visitors their poverty became the object of pity and disgust while their attempts to transcend it were met with hostility or ridicule the popular prejudice against another asian group is representative by the late nineteenth century the chinese of limehouse and its environs were considered to be a particular threat to the native population in the newspapers they were portrayed as both mysterious and menacing while at a later date the dangerous fumes of opium rose in the pages of sax rohmer conan doyle and oscar wilde a cluster of associations was then reinforced these particular immigrants were believed to contaminate the surrounding urban population as if the presence of aliens might be considered a token of disease throughout the history of london there has run an anxious fear of contagion in the conditions of an overpopulated city and that fear simply changed its form the fear of pollution had become moral and social rather than physical or medical in fact the chinese were a small and generally lawabiding community certainly no more lawless than the residents by whom they were surrounded they were also disparaged because of their passivity the spectre of the eastern habit of opiumsmoking was resurrected but in fact the jews had also been characterised as the passive recipients of scorn and insult it was as if the native london tendency towards violence were somehow provoked or inflamed by those who eschewed violence in their daily intercourse the enclosed nature of the chinese community in turn provoked a sense of mystery and suspicions of evil there was particular concern about the possibility of sexual licence in their dens of iniquity once more these are characteristic of more general fears about immigration and resident aliens they emanate in hostile attacks upon russian jews at the start of the twentieth century against germans during the world wars against coloureds in these anxieties were directed against commonwealth immigrants in the s and s and were in turn followed by hostility against asian and african migrants in the s and s the pattern changes its direction but it does not change its form yet with fear on certain occasions comes respect this is nowhere more evident than in the sometimes grudging attention paid to the fact that a variety of immigrants retained their fidelity to a particular religion or orthodoxy their imported faith was in such contrast to the generally disaffiliated or frankly pagan inclinations of londons native population that it was often a matter of remark the faith of the jews for example was regarded as providing a strong moral presence and continuity in the east end ironically it was seen as one method with which they withstood assault and opprobrium from other londoners the protestant faith of the huguenots the catholic faith of the irish and of the italians in clerkenwell the lutheran faith of the germans such religious practices were also considered a redeeming feature then he would catch sight of one of the old jewish black garbed men venerable and beardedso runs one narrative of the east end the crossing point by g charlesnow so few in the quarter but occasionally to be seen and his heart would lift with a kind of passionate nostalgia as if through such men he could still touch the certainty the vitality the rough innocent ambitious swarming life of those early immigrants with so much before them of promise this passage evokes those other aspects of immigrant life which in the context of great and overwhelming london are often disregarded there is nostalgia for the certainties of an old faith but also a fascinated attention to that vitality and ambition which have helped to create the contemporary multiracial city the notting hill carnival of trinidadian origin takes place in mid to late august exactly as the old bartholomew fair at smithfield did it is an odd coincidence which emphasises the equally curious continuities of london life but it throws into relief one of the strangest stories of urban immigration when black and white confronted the mystery of each others identity within the context of the city in sixteenthcentury drama the moor the black tends to be lascivious prone to irrational feeling and dangerous his appearance upon the stage is of course a consequence of his entry into london where colour became the most visible and most significant token of difference there were africans during the long existence of roman london and no doubt their successors by intermarriage continued to live in the city during its saxon and danish occupations but sixteenthcentury trade with africa and the arrival of the first black slaves in london in mark their irruption into the citys consciousness if they were heathen did they possess souls or were they somehow less than human their skin the mark of a profound abyss which set them apart that is why they became the object of fear and curiosity although relatively few in number most of them watched and controlled as domestic slaves or indentured servants they were already a source of anxiety in elizabeth i despatched a letter to the civic authorities complaining that there are of late diverse blackamoores brought into these realms of which kinde there are already here too manie and a few months later the queen reiterated her sentiment that these kinde of people may be well spared in this realme being so populous five years later a royal proclamation was announced in which the great number of begars and blackamoores which are crept into this realm were ordered to leave yet like all such proclamations touching upon london and londons population it had little effect the imperatives of trade particularly with the islands of the caribbean were more powerful africans arrived as the slaves of plantation owners or as sailors free and unfree or as presents for affluent londoners in addition the increase of traffic with africa itself afforded open access to the ports of london where many black crews found temporary homes in the eastern suburbs black servants also became popular and fashionable in the households of the nobility so the population grew and by the midseventeenth century blacks had become unremarkable if still unfamiliar members of the urban community most of them were still indentured or enslaved and according to james walvins the black presence consigned to the status of subhuman property the evidence of their existence in london is thereby confined to decaying headstones crude statistics in crumbling parish registers cryptic advertisements this of course is also the destiny of most londoners and it might be said that these black immigrantsseen as it were by a reverse imagerepresent in emblematic form the inflictions of london itself on august an advertisement in mercurius politicus concerned a negro boy about nine years of age in a gray searge suit his hair cut close to his head was lost on tuesday last august at night in st nicholas lane london those who were lost or ran away found themselves upon the mercy of the streets one german observer noted in that there are in fact such a quantity of moors of both sexes that i have never seen so many before males and females frequently go out begging the most significant abuses occurred however among those who were in more orthodox employment until a famous trial in the somerset case established that the english courts would not recognise slave status they were still slaves labouring for their masters the london sessions reported a case in of a black immigrant john caesar who with his wife had worked as a slave without wages for fourteen years for a company of printers in whitechapel as late as an advertisement appeared concerning a black servant man about twentyfour years of age named william of a brown or tawney complexion wearing a parsons great coat blue breeches white bath flannel waistcoat yellow gilt shoe buckles and a beaver hat with a white lining he had run away and although his appearance seemed fashionable and exemplary the advertisement noted that he is also the property of his master and has a burnt mark le on one of his shoulders this was the brand not of infamy but of inhumanity it was a way in which the blacks could be marked out as something less than human in a commercial city they became part of its movable property thus in the eighteenth century there were a large number of notices advertising their saleto be sold a negro boy aged eleven years enquire at the virginia coffee house in threadneedle street his price is and would not be sold but the person he belongs to is leaving off business and yet the condition of london bears another witness to their fate these commercial transactions were undertaken by the wealthy or the well connected there can be little doubt that the gentlemen who purchased and sold their little slaves would have been quite happy to see the lower orders of london generally consigned to such servitude in that sense the fate of the black slave was representative of civic and administrative oppression on a larger scale that is why the london crowd treated the black population with a certain amount of sympathy and fellowfeeling it is a manifest expression of that native egalitarianism which has already been defined as one of the moving spirits of london life that egalitarianism to be seen at its most profound among the poor and wretched is evinced in the life of a black onelegged violinist named billy walters who was nicknamed the king of the beggars it was said that every child in london knew him it has often been observed how the prophets of racial conflict in london have been proved false the voices crying doom in the late s and early s have since fallen quiet we may find the causes of that relative harmony and tolerance between black and white in the general urban sympathy for the mistreated black immigrants of the eighteenth century yet as their presence grew even very slightly so did the anxieties about the blackness in the midst of london john fielding a london magistrate in the mideighteenth century suggested that they became a subversive element almost as soon as they arrived in the city particularly when they realised that white servants performed the same functions as themselves to be black in other words was not a unique or an inalienable mark of servitude so they put themselves on a footing with other servants became intoxicated with their liberty grew refractory so as to get themselves discharged and when they were discharged into london what then they corrupt and dissatisfy the mind of every black servant that comes to england others made their way to the retired streets and alleys where a black community had established itself so for the civic authorities the black presence as it has been called posed a double threat those in habitual servitude were being aroused to anger or complaint while small clusters of immigrants were to be found in the low districts of wapping st giles and elsewhere the number of destitute negroes had also increased by the end of the eighteenth century in particular black recruits who had fought for the english during the american war of independence fell into dereliction on their arrival this was another aspect of immigration where the influx was the direct result of the actions of the host country in that sense these black exsoldiers created a recognisable line of descent to those twentiethcentury migrants who left the ruins of empire a pamphlet issued in stated that thousands of blacks traversed the town naked pennyless and almost starving as a result they were believed to threaten social order the african afroamerican or west indianas long as his or her skin was of the appropriate huewas always and instinctively considered a threat with that fear came also the prospect of miscegenation since mixed marriages were not unusual in the poorer areas of london here the sixteenthcentury connection of the moor with lasciviousness was once more revived as if a black skin were a token of black desires lying just beneath the surface of the human order the lower classes of women in england are remarkably fond of the blacks it was reported for reasons too brutal to mention a committee for relieving the black poor was set up with the sole purpose of assisting in expatriation it was not a success less than five hundred out of a population estimated between and embarked upon the emigrant shipsan indication perhaps of the fact that london remained their chosen city however dolorous or impoverished their lives the majority of black immigrants wished to remain in a place which in its daily commerce remained one of opportunity and diversion that population became acclimatised and although still subject to racial taunts a familiar presence in the streets of nineteenthcentury london they had become part of the underclass and were scarcely to be differentiated from it as crossingsweepers as vagrants or as beggars they had become almost invisible in the vast city they did not exist in numbers large enough to command public attention or concern they were not competing for employment and so did not threaten anyones livelihood they rarely appear in novels or narratives except as occasional grotesques and their general fate seems to have been one of settlement among the urban poor yet the beginning of immigration from the caribbean islands in the late s set off a litany of familiar fears among them the prospect of white unemployment of intermarriage and of general overpopulation in the summer of the ss empire windrush brought young migrants from jamaica it marked the beginning of a process which would alter the demography of london and affect all aspects of communal life the west indians were in turn followed by immigrants from india pakistan and east africa so that at the beginning of the twentyfirst century it is estimated that london harbours almost two million nonwhite ethnic minorities despite occasional racially motivated attacks and despite the anxiety felt by certain minorities at the behaviour of the police there is striking evidence that the egalitarian and democratic instincts of london have already marginalised fear and prejudice immigration is so much part of london that even its latest and most controversial manifestations eventually become a settled part of its existence this became clear even in the aftermath of the notting hill riots of and in particular after the murder of a young antiguan carpenter named kelso cockrane an essential element of london life returned normally in the early days you know one young west indian informed the authors of windrush a study of twentiethcentury immigrants from the caribbean whenever something appeared in the papers you could always test the temperature by going on the bus people would be very hostile and in this instance after that funeral there was a turning point you could sense a change people were more friendly people began to react and respond in a different way there have been riots and murders in the course of the last twenty years but no one can doubt that the central and essential movement within london has been one of absorption and assimilation it is an intrinsic aspect of its history the city itself in the process has also changed the authors of windrush michael and trevor phillips provide an interesting context for this alteration they suggest that workers from jamaica barbados and elsewhere were not simply migrating to britain they were in effect migrating to london because it was the life of the city which called to them and which they had begun to crave in the twentieth century the city had effectively created the conditions of modern industrial and economic life thus for the new settlers the journey to london was the only way to engage with the broad currents of modernity it is a significant observation in itself and one that throws a suggestive light upon all immigrant transactions over the last thousand years they were drawn to the city itself london called them to settle there was in some oblique and intuitive way to be part of the present moment moving into futurity the importance of time within the city has already been outlined but for the first generations of the immigrant population the city represented the movement of time itself yet their vitality and optimism in turn brought energy back into the city throughout the s for example it is claimed that the immigrants themselves assisted the process of remodelling and modernising the streets and houses in which they lived areas like brixton and notting hill had been declining and rundown since the nineteenth century but the new arrivals revalued huge swathes of the inner city the use of the word revalued suggests the economic effectiveness of the settlers but the transition from black immigrant to black londoner also called upon different resources caribbeans had to go through a fundamental series of changes in order to live and flourish in the city like the jews or the irish before them they had to acquire an urban identity which maintained their inheritance while at the same time allowing its smooth passage into the huge complex but generally welcoming organism of london that urban environment might have seemed anonymous or hostile or frightening but in fact it was the appropriate arena for the caribbeans and other immigrants to forge a new identity so it is that the authors of windrush suggest that the instinct of the city was to equalise choices and to level out differences between consumers and producers this is the new egalitarianism which in turn equalises the differences between the various races which comprise it since the essential job of the city was to put people together yet in turn the character of the city came to define the identity of the nation and the existence of a various and heterogeneous london has helped to redefine the notion or nature of englishness itself now there are montserratians in hackney and anguillians in slough dominicans in paddington and grenadians in hammersmith where once there were swiss in soho and cypriots in holborn there are now barbadians in notting hill and jamaicans in stockwell there are punjabis in southall and bangladeshis in tower hamlets turks in stoke newington and pakistanis in leyton each community has replicated its independence within the larger context of london so that once more the city takes on the aspects of a world in itself the city that globe of many nations acts as a paradigm and forerunner in the great race of life chapter empire day by the last decades of the nineteenth century london had become the city of empire the public spaces the railway termini the hotels the great docks the new thoroughfares the rebuilt markets all were the visible expression of a city of unrivalled strength and immensity it had become the centre of international finance and the engine of imperial power it teemed with life and expectancy some of its gracefulness and variety had now gone its georgian compactness and familiarity had also disappeared replaced by the larger scale of neoclassical or neogothic architecture which somehow matched the aspirations of this larger and more anonymous city nelsons column in trafalgar square erected in was conceived upon the model of a column in the temple of mars the avenger in imperial rome while a revised classicism was employed for the new buildings along whitehall the architecture of london according to jonathan schneer in london celebrated british heroism on the battlefield british sovereignty over foreign lands british wealth and power in short british imperialism if it was a more public and more powerful city it had also become a less human one tower bridge which took some thirteen years to build and was eventually completed in was a representative emblem it was an extraordinary feat of engineering but it seems deliberately to have been built upon an impersonal and somewhat forbidding scale in its immensity and complexity it reflected the workings of the city itself late nineteenthcentury london was established upon money the city had acquired the historic destiny that it had been pursuing for almost two thousand years it had become the progenitor of commerce and the vehicle of credit throughout the world the city maintained england just as the riches of the empire rejuvenated the city the sea trade of the earliest settlers had over the centuries borne unexpected fruit since by the turn of the century almost one half of the worlds merchant shipping was controlled directly or indirectly by the institutions of the city in the early decades of the twentieth century new office blocks became a familiar presence new banks company headquarters insurance offices were built upon a massive scale with intense and dramatic architectural effects the latest edition of pevsners buildings of england for the city of london notes for example how the bank of england acted as a field of force for other commercial enterprises around it are clustered the headquarters and major branches of the main clearing banks many of which had grown enormously by merger and acquisition at the end of the s they were built to impress inside and out here the element of londons essential theatricality once more emerges but strangely mingled with the principles of profit and of power the tendency towards merger and acquisition among banking institutions was reflected in a general movement towards the creation of greater and greater organisations the newspaper industries the enormous growth of the post office the vast expansion of insurance companies all contributed to the sense of a city growing quickly and almost unnaturally it was unnatural in other respects the advent of electric light in the sits first interior use occurred in in the premises of lloyds bank along lombard streetinevitably meant that natural light was no longer necessary to work indoors so arrived those great waves of city workers who indeed might have been dwelling beneath the sea they came to work in the darkness of a winter morning and departed in the evening without once seeing the sun so london helped to instigate one of the great disasters for the human spirit in addition the use of new building technologies particularly those of reinforced concrete and steel and the introduction of passenger lifts led inexorably to the erection of ever higher buildings by that strange symbiotic process which has always marked the development of london the expansion of the available space was matched only by the increase of the number of people ready to inhabit it it has been estimated that the working population of the city numbered in but in charles pooter of the laurels brickfield terrace holloway is a fictional variant of one of the thousands of clerks who comprised what one guidebook terms a very city of clerks my boy as a result of twentyone years industry and strict attention to the interests of my superiors in office i have been rewarded with promotion and a rise in salary of the fact that the grossmiths comic creation has endured in public affection for more than a hundred years is testimony perhaps to the instinctive accuracy of their account the ordinariness of pooters life was seen as emblematic of the new type of urban or suburban man in his loyalty and in his naïveté he was the kind of citizen whom london needed in order to sustain itself but it was not only a city of clerks london had become the workplace of the new professions as engineers and accountants and architects and lawyers moved ineluctably towards the city of empire in turn these affluent consumers created a market for new department stores and new restaurants there arose a revived and more salubrious west end of theatres under such actormanagers as irving and beerbohm tree there were also more refined delights the parks the museums and the galleries of midvictorian london were discovered by a new and more mobile population of relatively affluent citizens there were better libraries and a plethora of distinguished or specialised exhibitions to satisfy a new urban taste for instruction compounded by enjoyment it was also the city of fabians and of the new woman it was the home of the findesiècle most readily associated in the public mind with the spectacular london career of oscar wilde but the old city never went away in the s approximately four hundred people of both sexes used to sleep in trafalgar square among the fountains and the pigeons as hp clunn noted in the face of london only about onethird of these people had any regular calling or occupation and the rest simply lived from day to day as best they could from childhood and could hardly explain how they had managed to exist for so long in any one year of that decade approximately twentyfive thousand people were charged with being drunk and disorderly in the streets in part because the public houses were allowed to remain open all night perhaps the strain of being the richest and most powerful city in the world had some effect upon the citizens themselves it was a city of contrast until the late s leicester square was littered with tin pots kettles old clothes castoff shoes dead cats and dogs the streets were filled with the ceaseless and incessant stream of horsedrawn motordriven and steampropelled traffic the average speed of the hansoms and the growlers and the vans and the bumpers or buses remained approximately twelve miles per hour old women squatted in the streets selling herbs apples matches and sandwiches there was a floating population of ragged barefoot children who slept in alleys or beneath bridges there were costermongers with their carts selling anything from coals to flowers fish to muffins tea to crockery there were also epidemics of surprising speed and savagery which passed through the floating urban population but somehow perhaps only with the benefit of hindsight the lives and roles of the poor seem diminished within the immensity and complexity of late nineteenthcentury london their voices are heard less easily amid the incessant traffic and their struggles are lost among the army of clerks and professions and the whole multiplying population of the city this immensity and complexity the emanations of so much wealth and power created problems for the authorities themselves how could the metropolitan board of works together with all the vestries and parishes supervise or control the largest and most important city in the world as a result in the london county council lcc was established to administer an area of approximately square miles it covered the whole of london inner and outer from hackney in the north to norwood in the south there had always been unstated fears concerning an overmighty and overweening city so the lcc was granted no powers over the police or the public utilities yet even at the time its inauguration was considered an event of great significance in the development of london sidney webb described it as a movement towards a selfgoverning community which indirectly aroused memories of the medieval commune with its wall and its army the great constitutional historian of london laurence gomme became clerk of the lcc which for him represented the reincarnation of the democratic spirit of the medieval charters and traditions of citizenship as ancient as the saxon and roman origins of the city in in a further act of reorganisation twentyeight metropolitan boroughs were created out of the vestries and district boards of the preceding century although these were designed to impede any centralising impulses of the lcc they too had a somewhat atavistic air at a royal review in the summer of each borough mustered a battalion to march before king george v it may have been a harbinger of the great war but the troops from fulham and wandsworth stepney and camberwell poplar and battersea were a reminder of old territorial loyalties issuing from the earliest days of the burg and the soke the lcc embarked upon its municipal duties with enthusiasm and animation the earliest priority was that of slum clearance and the development of public housing what might seem in retrospect at least a symbolic gesture claimed the area of the jago in bethnal green the squalid alleys and tenements immortalised by arthur morrison were swept away in the late nineteenth century and in their place was erected the boundary green estate other areas of inner london were cleared but in deference to the prevailing taste for expansion as a physical and mental imperative cottage estates were erected in places like east acton and hayes in the county council assumed control of elementary education in london and funded a system of scholarships whereby clever children might move on from board schools to grammar schools such innovations directly affected the lives of londoners a city government impinged upon the citizens for the first time in living memory the administration of london was no longer some distant and almost unrecognisable presence characterised by what matthew arnold described in another context as a melancholy long withdrawing roar it had become a force for change and improvement london once more embodied a young and energetic spirit with a curious acquisitive atmosphere which floods the pages of urban chroniclers such as hg wells the laborious and intricate city of the findesiècle seems to have vanished together with that heavy and lassitudinous atmosphere so peculiar to the memoirs of the period it is as if the city had come alive with the new century it was the first age of the mass cinema too with the advent of the moving picture theatre and the kinema the underground lines had abandoned their steam trains and the whole network was electrified by motor buses tramcars lorries and tricycles added to the general momentum london was in a phrase of the period going ahead where in the late nineteenth century wrote the author of the streets of london it had been rich and fruity it was becoming slick and snappy one of the permanent and most striking characteristics of london lies in its capacity to rejuvenate itself it might be compared to some organism which sloughs off its old skin or texture in order to live again it is a city which has the ability to dance upon its own ashes so in the memoirs of edwardian london there are accounts of thés dansants tangos and waltzes and blue hungarian bands there were twelve music halls and twentythree theatres in the central area with another fortyseven just outside the shops and restaurants grew in size while the tea shops became corner houses and maisons there were picture domes and prizefights and soda fountains and cafés and revues all compounding the atmosphere of a fast city the great war of cannot be said to have impeded the citys growth or its essential vitality london has always been energetic and powerful enough to buttress itself against distress and disaster herbert asquith heard a distant roaring on the final day of peace at the beginning of august he wrote that war or anything that seems likely to lead to war is always popular with the london mob you remember sir r walpoles remark now they are ringing their bells in a few weeks theyll be wringing their hands london was accustomed to violence and to latent savagery not least in the manifestations of the mob and for many the vision of chaos and destruction acted as a restorative the inhabitants of a large city are always the most sanguineous it is true also that london expanded during the years of war just as in earlier centuries it had killed more than it cared for so in the present conflict it seemed to thrive upon slaughter the citys economy was fuelled by full employment with so many of its young males detained elsewhere and as a result the standard of living improved of course there were local hazards and difficulties building work was suspended and at night the city was only partly illuminated by lamps which had been painted dark blue as a precaution against the raids of zeppelin warships parks and squares were used as kitchengardens while hotels became government offices or hostels but there were more foreign restaurants and pâtisseries than ever as a result of the presence of émigrés while the dance halls and music halls were full there was a loss of life in the capitalit is still not unusual to find plaques upon the walls of longsince renovated buildings commemorating a zeppelin raid upon the sitewith approximately seven hundred killed in the four years of war in contrast it has been estimated that almost londoners died in battle yet london is prodigal of life the close of the war in november was greeted with scenes of revelry and enthusiasm which have always punctuated the citys history stanley weintraub has depicted the occasion in a stillness heard around the world the end of the great war the street was now a seething mass of humanity flags appeared as if by magic streams of men and women flowed from the embankment almost before the last stroke of the clock had died away the strict warstraitened regulated streets of london had become a triumphant pandemonium this is a description of the city stirring into life again with the streams of its citizens like the blood once more racing through its arteries pedestrians were dancing on the sidewalks and vast crowds gathered in all the public places in order to experience that inchoate sense of collective feeling which is one aspect of urban identity on these occasions the citizens do indeed become one body and one voice george v drove through waves of cheering crowds with the image of the sea once more invoking the strange impersonality and inexorability within this expression of mass emotion osbert sitwell recollected that the last time he had seen such a crowd was when it was cheering for its own death outside buckingham palace on the evening of august most of the men who composed it were now dead here the exultation comes very close to savagery and a kind of barbaric triumph is let loose upon the streets of london the god of herds had taken over as the people sometimes joining up sometimes linking hands dashed like the waves of the sea against the sides of trafalgar square the celebrations there would continue for three days without ceasing paradoxically there was a certain amount of violence and riot to celebrate this peace while one observer described it as a sort of wild orgy of pleasure an almost brutal enjoyment it was frightening one felt that if there had been any germans around the women would have advanced upon them and torn them to pieces the same cruelty had of course been visible in the crowds delight at the beginning of the war in one novel relating these events james hiltons random harvest the scenes represent a common earth toucha warm bawdy link with the mobs of the past the frenzy spread in unexpected directions there is the story of the famous parrot in the cheshire cheese public house who with his beak drew a hundred corks without stopping amid the din of armistice night and then fell down in a faint it may seem perverse to pay more attention to the celebrations of a few days in winter than to the whole course of a war but in that shorter period the city became more intensely itself out of that conflict too emerged dynamic movement and a fresh sense of purpose by the population of greater london had risen to it was the largest level it had ever attained and is perhaps ever likely to attain one in five of the british population had become a londoner the city had expanded in every sense with new dual carriageway roads and radial highway schemes which reached out to cheshunt and hatfield chertsey and staines just as it grew outwards so its interior fabric was renewed new banks and office blocks arose in the city while the bank of england itself was rebuilt a new lambeth bridge was being constructed with new initiatives in education and welfare as well as schemes for the redevelopment of housing and of parks the london county council sustained the momentum of the citys development hp clunn writing the face of london in suggested that the new london is rising with irresistible energy on timehonoured sites it was not the first nor the last period of restoration london is perpetually old but always new it was an appropriate sign of renovation however that in the autumn of the most significant public and commercial buildings of the capital were for the first time illuminated by floodlighting its novel brightness attracted powerful forces the process of what has often been called metropolitan centralisation attracted politicians trade unionists and broadcasters thus the bbc ensconced in the heart of london also became the voice of the nation the film and newspaper industries together with the myriad advertising companies migrated to the metropolis in the process helping to spread images and visions of the capital throughout the entire country industry too was part of this mass migration the authors of the county of london plan noted that many commercial leaders were attracted by the sight of numerous flourishing factories and the general air of prosperity associated with greater london once more london had reverted to type and become cockaigne or the city of gold the s have in particular been anatomised as the age of anxiety when economic depression unemployment and the prospect of another world war materially affected the general disposition of the city yet the historians and reporters bring their own preoccupations to the subject london is large enough and heterogeneous enough to reflect any mood or topic it can hold or encompass anything in that sense it must remain fundamentally unknowable jb priestley for example saw evidence of a giant transition he described a new urban culture growing up all around him as one of arterial and bypass roads of filling stations and factories that look like exhibition buildings of giant cinemas and dance halls and cafes bungalows with tiny garages cocktail bars woolworths motor coaches wireless the familiar london sensation of everything growing too large once more emerged it was reported in that dagenham for example had within ten years increased its population by per cent in it had been a small village complete with cottages and fields of corn within a decade houses had been erected to sustain a workingclass population george orwell had mentioned dagenham in his account of a new city where the citizens inhabit vast new wildernesses of glass and brick where the same kind of life is being lived at different levels in laboursaving flats or council houses along the concrete roads he was describing the same reality as priestley with miles of semidetached bungalows all with their little garages their wireless sets they were both reacting to the single most important change in london life within the last years they were talking about the suburbs after the great war one of many posters from the london undergroundthis one dates from extolling the virtues of suburbia or metroland the retreat into suburbia in fact marked the greatest change in londons topography since the estates of the eighteenth century chapter suburban dreams the suburbs are as old as the city itself they were once the spillings and scourings of the city unhappy and insalubrious the subarbes contained precisely that which had been banished from the town the stink industries brothels leper hospitals theatresso that the area beyond the walls was in some way deemed threatening or lawless it was neither city nor country it represented londons abandoned trail across the earth nevertheless by the sixteenth century such diverse extramural areas as wapping and holborn mile end and bermondsey began to manifest all the signs of burgeoning population trade and housing the author of londinopolis wrote in that tis true that the suburbs of london are much broader than the body of the city which make some compare her to a jesuits hat whose brims are far larger than the block in the same period the spanish ambassador remarked i believe there will be no city left shortly for it will all have run out of the gates to the suburbs yet the process was as inevitable as it was inexorable london could no more cease growing than a lava flow can stop its irruption but the process was complex and unpredictable london did not extend itself ever outwards in all directions like some blockedin mass perpetually extending its perimeter it spiralled out in various directions making use of existing roads or trade routes and testing the capacity of various villages or parishes to sustain its weight the south of stepney for example seemed like a city by the river one of the earliest industrial suburbs but to its north still this parish has the face of the country london moved organically in other words always finding the right ecology in which it might exist and flourish spitalfields expanded fivefold in less than sixty years and the derivation of these fields of spittle might have been taken from the fluffy white excreta of the spider continually expanding its web yet of course this natural glut of buildings and of people provoked sensations of disgust or dismay it seemed to threaten the identity of the city itself on a technical level the authorities could no longer supervise trade or working practices or prices in a less palpable sense the guardians of law and of authority were gradually losing control that loss of power induced anxiety so for example charles i blamed mob riots in whitehall upon the meane and unrulie people of the suburbs and the suburbs themselves have been described in stephen inwoods a history of london as a nether world of dung heaps stinking trades bloodsports gallows low taverns prostitutes foreigners thieves the poor and the mob yet for a while it still seemed possible to escape from the blight of the city by the end of the eighteenth century there were in peckham many handsome houses most of which are the country seats of wealthy citizens of london in kentish town the air being exceedingly wholesome many of the citizens have built houses and such whose circumstances will not admit of that expense take ready furnished lodgings for the summer in fulham also were many good buildings belonging to the gentry and citizens of london the process here was not one of confused inchoate growth but one of deliberate colonisation of the surrounding countryside villages such as clapton and hampstead and dulwich became in the nomenclature of a later period suburban villages as early as beside newington green terraced houses appeared on the model of london terraces thirty years later kensington square was similarly laid out while according to chris miele in suburban london making no apparent concession to the rural character of the place by some strange alchemy the city had reassembled itself in a distant spot as a silent token of that which was to come by a similar process suburban estates emerged in previously rural areas closely modelled upon the estates which had already been constructed in the western quarters of london kensington new town hans town and camden town were cities in miniature laid down at convenient and profitable sites beside the main roads the suburbs like the rest of london were established upon the principles of commercial gain just as areas such as hammersmith and camberwell could no longer be described as either town or country but were now something partaking of both so their inhabitants were mixed and ambivalent defoe had already noticed the emergence of the middle sort of mankind grown wealthy by trade and who still taste of london some live both in the city and the country at the same time hybrid forms of architecture too began to emerge in these mingled landscapes in the s and s for example villas emerged as standard suburban dwellings they were soon visible in islington and muswell hill ealing and clapham walthamstow and south kensington it has been said that their example directly affected the appearance of a later and more extensive suburbia with what john summerson described as the flood of victorian housebuilding that torrent of villadom this description may itself be said to partake of the somewhat dismissive attitude still adopted towards the suburbs of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries yet the villas of the mideighteenth century anticipated the atmosphere and texture of later suburban life in more than an architectural sense they embodied for example that privacy which was instinctive to the london character but which the city could no longer provide one of the motives behind the movement towards the suburbs both in its early and late forms was to escape the sheer proximity of other people and other voices the quietness of a modern suburban street may not equal the silence of villa grounds in roehampton or richmond but the principle of exclusion remains the same the villas were originally designed as dwellings for one family of course surrounded and protected from the depredations of the city the notion of one unit as one family is indeed central to the later development of suburban life where the yearning for safety and the relative anonymity of isolation have been equally powerful the villas were detached cheaper versions for the more populous areas were in turn established upon semidetachment there are social and aesthetic consequences attendant upon what some might see as retreat or regression the original villas were a highly visible token of respectabilityof cheerfulness elegance and refinement to quote a brochure of the periodand this vision of respectability sustained the suburbs for the next two centuries the phrase keeping up appearances might have been coined for suburban living but the original villas themselves introduced a form of artifice they were not villas in any classical sense certainly nothing like the roman variant which would once have been seen all over southern england and the illusion of country living was sustained only with a great amount of determination and ingenuity the nineteenthand twentiethcentury suburbs were also involved in an elaborate game of makebelieve with the implicit assumption that they were not part of the city at all in reality they were as much an aspect of london as newgate or the tottenham court road but their principal attraction was still based on the assumption that they were free of the citys noxious and contaminating influences this happy fiction could not be sustained for long however with the emergence of mass transport expediting the greatest exodus in londons history soon the pattern became clear with the more prosperous citizens moving further out to more extensive grounds and eminences even as they were being displaced by new arrivals the phenomenon is as old and as new as the city itself charles manby smith in the little world of london observed the progress over the s to s of one fictional street which he named strawberry street in suburban islington it was two or three years in building with a double row of twostoried dwellings and at first clung with considerable tenacity to rural associations and characteristics in order to avoid being swallowed up in babylons bosom it was genteel the abode of professional gentlemen and their families clerks managers and responsible persons employed in the city but then it began to change the professional ladies and gentlemen moved by degrees further north and their places were supplied by a new classby tradesmens clerks by foremen and overseers of workshops who worked all hours and who let lodgings to help pay the rent soon enough long ranks of cottages not twenty feet apart sprang up like mushrooms in the waste ground on the eastern side they were inhabited as soon as built a sawmill was erected in the vicinity and in the street itself there appeared a variety of shops a carpenter a joiner a greengrocer joined the older residents so that in a couple of years the whole street on both sides of the way with the exception of a very few houses was transformed into a thirdrate business street the sawmill itself prospered and gathered round it a host of industrial processors beershops and public houses and coffee shops emerged alongside workshops and workyards so within thirty years the street had been transformed from the abode of quiet and easeloving competence to that of the toiling and struggling mass there was another characteristic urban process too with development along the lines of the main roads followed by a consolidation of the areas between the thoroughfares so that as the builder of put it the growth of the solid nucleus with but few interstices left open has been nothing less than prodigious by the s the city began to lose its population to areas such as canonbury to the north and walworth to the south the advent of cheap workmens fares meant that areas close to a railway station could be quickly inhabited thus there emerged workingclass suburbs such as tottenham and east ham the drift was gathering pace and by the s the clerk and the shopkeeper desired nothing but a little villa out of town an observer perched on top of primrose hill in noted that the metropolis has thrown out its arms and embraced us not yet with a stifling clutch but with ominous closeness the metaphors here suggest some alien threat or invasion and of course they represent a familiar if unimaginative attitude towards london the citys expansion over the countryside was noisy noxious and destructive yet it could equally be argued that the city brought energy and activity to those areas which it covered and that in the creation of suburbia it fashioned a new kind of life it brought prosperity and for those who settled on the new estates a kind of contentment in the middle decades of the nineteenth century therefore there was endless building activity in all the environs of london let as fast as built was one slogan yet it would be a mistake to characterise all suburbs as examples of shoddy architecture or improvised planning the informal st johns wood estate and those of wimbledon common or hampstead garden suburb for example were quite distinct from the workingclass terraces of walthamstow or barking the rows of small houses that comprised agar town differed from the more genteel avenues of brixton the eton college estate covering the district known as chalk farm was very different from the seven sisters estate dreary islington was not the same as leafy crouch end hg wells reacted with dismay to the suburbia of bromley where he had grown up and denounced its jerry built unalterable houses as well as the planlessness of which all of us who had to live in london were the victims yet only a decade after the young wells was unhappily ensconced in bromley the young wb yeats was enjoying the relatively sylvan delights of bedford park both were london suburbs the broadest view however might identify three separate types of suburb there were those still on the very outer limits of the city areas like surbiton sidcup and chislehurst were characterised by the grander villas with large gardens built on high ground there was a sprinkling of cottages and shops by the nearest railway station but the rural illusion could still be maintained in the second degree of suburbs in areas such as palmers green and crouch end dwelled the middle managers supervisors and better paid clerks who benefited from the low fares of the surface railways to find a safe and relatively quiet retreat from the roar of babylon the third level catered for the working class and in estates like leyton and east ham undistinguished and indistinguishable terraces of lowcost housing covered every available open space these latter were generally located in the east of the city the ancient territorial imperatives were after all also a determining factor in the character and quality of the suburbs those to the east and northeast being obviously inferior to those of the west the suburbs to the south were more expansive and more sedate than those to the north by the s it was agreed that london was as to its greater part a new city it had become in the words of building news in a huge overgrown metropolis largely comprised of a tide of small houses this was the paradoxthat a vast capital could be constructed out of small individual units it was almost as if london had by some strange act of intuition taken on the visible shape of burgeoning social democracy new forms of mass transportation such as the deeplevel underground system had helped to create a new city in turn that city was now creating the context for evolutionary social change where will london end asked the builder in to which the only reply was goodness knows the question might have been asked at any time over the last six centuries and received a similar answer in cfg masterman also described the growth of the suburbsas a london topic it was on everyones mindas miles and miles of little red houses in little silent streets in numbers defying the imagination for him it represented a life of security a life of sedentary occupation a life of respectability at a later date in homage to catalonia george orwell in similar vein remarked upon the huge peaceful wilderness of outer london sleeping the deep deep sleep of england yet the denigration and the tone of limited contempt implicit in these descriptions were not shared by those who lived in the suburbs sleep and respectability may have been precisely the conditions required by succeeding generations of new londoners the population of the city had for many centuries been characterised by its violence and impetuosity its drunkenness and ill health the suburbs represented a new urban civilisation which would flourish without any of the familiar urban attributes when ilford was developed in the s as a middlerange suburb for clerks and skilled workers the speculators refused to permit the construction of any pubs in the vicinity their concern was to render the new suburb as little like london as possible in the same period the london county council shifted its emphasis from the refurbishment or redevelopment of innercity areas to the erection of cottage estates on the fringes of london the idea of the cottage was itself much abused in the process but the introduction of twostorey terraced houses with small rear gardens changed the reputation of council housing and in fact changed the image of the londoner the cockney need not necessarily be a product of the slums in the mids it was estimated that each day two and a half million people were on the move in london that is why there was a large increase in private as well as public suburbia it was the age of metroland which began life with the cedars estate in rickmansworth and spread outwards to include wembley park and ruislip edgware and finchley epsom and purley the importance of transport in effecting this mass dispersal is emphasised by the fact that the very notion of metroland was created by the metropolitan railway company and heavily endorsed by the london underground their booklets and advertisements emphasised the resolutely nonurban aspects of what were effectively great housing estates metroland beckoned us out to lanes in beechy bucks according to john betjeman who had a tenacious if ambiguous affection for the suburban terrainfor gabled gothic and newplanted pine for the pear and apple in croydon gardens and the light suburban evening where a vast and welcoming security is so much to be hoped for in a poem entitled middlesex betjeman invoked another form of permanencekeep alive our lost elysiumrural middlesex againand the advertisers of the metropolitan railway and the underground exploited this ache or longing for continuity and predictability according to the brochuresdisplaying once more according to betjeman sepia views of leafy lanes in pinnerthe new inhabitant of the suburbs will dwell beside brambly wildernesses where nightingales sing one advertisement prepared by the london underground showed three rows of grey and mournful terraces with the words leave this and move to edgware a sylvan scene presents itself accompanied by a quotation from the seventeenthcentury poet abraham cowley who himself retired to chertsey after the restoration in in a single sentence he expresses the wish that i might be master of a small house and a large garden with moderate conveniences joined to them once more the new suburban vision in accordance with the implicit antiquarianism of london itself took refuge in an appeal to an illdefined and illexplained past the same form of cultural nostalgia was evident in the architectural style of the new suburbs the dominant model being mock tudor or what became known as stockbroker tudor or tudorbethan the desire was to combine the sense of continuity with the satisfaction of traditional workmanship and design it was a way of conveying substantiality and a measure of dignity to these new londoners who had exiled themselves from the central core of the city the city can transform and regenerate itself in unanticipated ways thus the suburban gardens drives parks ways and rises are now as much a part of london as the old rents and lanes and alleys london had created and harboured a new kind of life once more it happened unpredictably with no concerted or centralised planning and was directed by shortterm commercial demands so the suburbs became the home of shopping parades and imposing cinemas of aesthetically pleasing underground stations and ornate railway stations it was the age of the morris and the ford the factories which lined the new dual carriageways were now manufacturing the domestic items of this new civilisationthe washing machines and the refrigerators the electric cookers and the wirelesses the processed food and the vacuum cleaners the electric fires and the leatherette furniture the reproduction tables and the bathroom fittings in a novel entitled invisible cities the italian writer italo calvino reflects upon the nature of the suburbs under the assumed names of the cities of trude and penthesilea we may substitute acton and wembley park the narrator is told that he may travel wherever he chooses but you will arrive at another trude absolutely the same detail by detail the world is covered by a sole trude which does not begin and does not end but this was always the definition of london that it had no beginning and no ending in that sense its suburbs simply partake of its endless nature the gin palaces of the old city gave way to the glittering cinemas of the s the hostelries were replaced by roadside inns or mocktudor pubs located on significant crossroads and the streetmarkets by shopping parades and department stores the suburbs of the interwar years significantly extended the life and reach of london but essentially they elaborated upon it in calvinos novel the narrator asks for the location of penthesilea and the inhabitants make a broad gesture which may mean here or else farther on or all around you or even in the opposite direction so for calvino the visitor begins to ask whether penthesilea is only the outskirts of itself the question that now begins to gnaw at your mind is more anguished outside penthesilea does an outside exist or no matter how far you go from the city will you only pass from one limbo to another never managing to leave it london is so ubiquitous that it can be located nowhere in particular the extraordinary growth of its suburbs emphasised the fact that since it has no defined or definite centre its circumference is everywhere blitz a famous photograph of st pauls cathedral miraculously the church survived the depredations of the bombs of the second world war but it rose over a blasted and wasted city chapter war news it began with attacks upon outer london croydon and wimbledon were hit and at the end of august there was a stray raid upon the cripplegate area then at five pm on september the german air force came in to attack london six hundred bombers marshalled in great waves dropped their explosive and high incendiary devices over east london beckton west ham woolwich millwall limehouse and rotherhithe went up in flames gas stations and power stations were hit yet the docks were the principal target telegraph poles began to smoke then ignite from base to crown although the nearest fire was many yards away then the wooden block road surface ignited in the searing heat the firemen had to race through fire and perpetual explosion to reach conflagrations which were almost out of hand the fire was so huge that we could do little more than make a feeble attempt to put it out the whole of the warehouse was a raging inferno against which there were silhouetted groups of pigmy firemen directing their futile jets on walls of flame these reports come from courage high a history of london firefighting by sally holloway one volunteer was on the river itself where half a mile of the surrey shore was ablaze burning barges were drifting everywhere inside the scene was like a lake in hell in the crypt of a church in bow people were kneeling and crying and praying it was a most terrible night the german bombers came back the next night and then the next the strand was bombed st thomass hospital was hit together with st pauls cathedral the west end buckingham palace lambeth palace piccadilly the house of commons truly to londoners it seemed to be a war on london between september and november almost bombs were dropped upon the capital in the first thirty days of the onslaught almost six thousand people were killed and twice as many badly injured on the night of the full moon october it seemed as if the end of the world had come some compared london to a prehistoric animal wounded and burned which would disregard its assailants and keep moving massively onward this was based on the intuition of london as representing some relentless and ancient force which could withstand any shock or injury yet other metaphors were in useamong them those of jerusalem babylon and pompeiiwhich lent a sense of precariousness and eventual doom to the citys plight when in the first days of the blitz londoners saw the ranks of german bombers advancing without being hindered by antiaircraft fire there was an instinctive fear that they were witnessing the imminent destruction of their city the earliest reactions were according to the reports of mass observation and other interested parties mixed and incongruous some citizens were hysterical filled with overwhelming anxiety and there were several cases of suicide others were angry and stubbornly determined to continue their ordinary lives even in the face of extraordinary dangers some tried to be jovial while others became keenly interested spectators of the destruction all around them but for many the mood was one of spirited defiance as one anthologist of london history an wilson has put it the records of the time reveal the perkiness the jokes the songs even in the immediate and garish presence of violent death it is difficult fully to define that particular spirit but it is of the utmost interest in attempting to describe the nature of london itself in his definitive study london at war philip ziegler has suggested that londoners made a deliberate effort to seem nonchalant and unafraid but this selfcontrol may have been a necessary and instinctive unwillingness to spread the contagion of panic what if this city of eight million people were to regress into hysteria it was precisely that fate which bertrand russell had predicted in a pamphlet which way to peace in which he anticipated that london would become one vast bedlam the hospitals will be stormed traffic will cease the homeless will shriek for peace the city will be a pandemonium it is possible that ordinary citizens with instincts finer than those of their erstwhile betters knew that this could not be allowed to happen so the calmness the resigned resolution of the londoner was the quality which impressed those coming from outside in all of its periodic crises and riots and fires london has remained surprisingly stable it has tipped and tilted before righting itself this may in part be explained by the deep and heavy presence of trade and commerce within its fabric the pursuit of which rides over any obstacle or calamity one of winston churchills wartime phrases was business as usual and no slogan could be better adapted to the condition of london yet there was another aspect of the calmness and determination of londoners in the autumn and winter of springing from some deep sense that the city had suffered before and had somehow survived of course nothing could equal the fury and destruction of the blitz but the sheer persistence and continuity of london through time lent an intimate yet perhaps at the time unidentifiable reassurance there was always the intimation of eventual renewal and reconstruction the poet stephen spender in north london in the aftermath of one raid related i had the comforting sense of the sure dark immensity of london here is another source of consolation the city was too large too complex too momentous to be destroyed then he recognised that the grittiness stench and obscurity of kilburn suddenly seemed a spiritual forcethe immense force of poverty which had produced the narrow yet intense visions of cockneys living in other times this has the spiritual force of revelation since spender seems to have concluded that poverty and suffering had somehow produced a kind of invulnerability to even the worst onslaughts which the world can unleash we can take it was one of the often recorded comments by those who had been bombed out of their homes with the unspoken addition that we have taken everything else the attitude of selfsufficiency was often accompanied by an element of pride every one absolutely determined one observer humphrey jennings wrote secretly delighted with the privilege of holding up hitler there was according to ziegler a strange lightness of heart londoners felt themselves an elite they were proud of their own sufferings in the same way that earlier generations of londoners claimed an almost proprietorial interest in their noxious fogs in the violence of their streets in the sheer anonymity and magnitude of their city in a sense londoners believed themselves to be especially chosen for calamity this may in turn help to explain the evident fact that macabre exaggeration became a hallmark of many londoners conversation particularly on the numbers of the dead and the wounded the innate theatricality of london life affords one explanation it has been said that there was never any conflict in the citys history to match the drama of the second world war london firemen claimed that half their time was spent in dispersing crowds of interested spectators rather than fighting the conflagrations if it were not for the sheer blank monotony of tiredness and suffering suffused with the horror of the bombs one might almost sense a gaiety or delight in destruction itself there are other images of these early months one was of the blackout which plunged one of the most brilliantly illuminated cities of the world into all but total darkness it became once more the city of dreadful night and aroused in some inhabitants sensations of almost primitive fear as once familiar thoroughfares became lost in blackness one of evelyn waughs characters notes that time might have gone back two thousand years to the time when london was a stockaded cluster of huts urban civilisation had been established upon light for so long that in its absence all customary certainties fell away of course there were some who took advantage of the darkness for their own purposes but for many others the predominant sensation was one of alarm and insufficiency the lure of shelter under the ground has already been discussed together with the fear of administrators that london would breed a race of troglodytes who would never wish to come to the surface the reality however was both more stark and more prosaic only per cent of the citys population ever used the london underground for night shelter largely on account of the overcrowded and often insanitary conditions which they would have found there in implicit compliance to the tradition of london as a city of separate family dwellings most citizens elected to stay in their own houses and what might they have seen when they emerged at daybreak the house about yards from ours struck at one this morning by a bomb completely ruined another bomb in the square still unexploded the house was still smouldering there is a great pile of bricks scraps of cloth hanging to the bare walls at the side still standing a looking glass i think swinging like a tooth knocked outa clean cut virginia woolfs description registers the sensation of almost physical shock as if the city were indeed a living being which could suffer hurt a vast gap at the top of chancery lane smoking still some great shop entirely destroyed the hotel opposite like a shell and then miles amp miles of orderly ordinary streets streets empty faces set amp eyes bleared it might seem that nothing could obliterate these miles amp miles of streets that london could as it were soak up any punishment yet its citizens were not so sturdy fatigue and weariness and anxiety passed over them in waves in the following month october woolf visited tavistock and mecklenburg squares where she had lived she passed a long line of people with bags and blankets queuing at eleven thirty that morning for a nights shelter in warren street underground station in tavistock square she found the remnants of her old housebasement all rubble only relics an old basket chair otherwise bricks amp wood splinters i cd just see a piece of my studio wall standing otherwise rubble where i wrote so many books and then there was the dust like the soft residue of obliterated experience all again litter glass black soft dust plaster powder it was remarked at the time that upon everything lay a fine coat of grey ash and cinders prompting further comparison between london and pompeii the loss of personal history was another aspect of the city bombings the wallpaper and mirrors and carpets were sometimes stripped bare and left hanging in the air of a ruin as if the private lives of londoners had suddenly become public property this encouraged a communal feeling and became one of the principal sources of the evident bravado and determination the second world war also created a climate of care it became a question of saving the children for example by a process of mass evacuation from the city to the country in the months preceding the outbreak of hostilities on september a policy of voluntary evacuation was drawn up to deal with the movement of approximately four million women and children yet the curious magnetism of london then began to exert itself less than half the families wished or decided to leave those children about to be sent to reception areas in the country departed reluctantly the children of dagenham were despatched on boats and john oleary author of danger over dagenham has recorded awful silence the children did not sing one of a childhood contingent from stepney the writer bernard kops recalled that this was the place where we were born where we grew up where we played and sang laughed and cried and now all the grey faces as we passed were weeping it was strangely quiet when they arrived in the country they seemed and were quite out of place a minority were unwashed liceridden and disruptive here the old image of the savage rises forcefully others would not eat wholesome food but clamoured for fish and chips sweets and biscuits and would not go to bed at reasonable hours they were the unnatural progeny of an unnatural city and there were children who refused new clothes and who fought and clung desperately to old and dirty things the image of the london child as somehow dirty and woeful is here reinforced then within a few weeks they began to return home by the winter of approximately mothers and children had come back by the early months of the following year half of the evacuees had made their way back to the city london was for me like a return from exile one is reported as saying in zieglers history my pet cat met me at the gate the neighbours welcomed me and the sun shone here is a palpable sense of belonging of being part of the city which is the strongest sentiment among londoners in the summer of when the german forces began to conquer europe another attempt was made to remove the children those of the east end in particular one hundred thousand children were evacuated but two months later children were coming back each week it represents the strangest and perhaps most melancholy instinctthe need to get back to the city even if it becomes a city of fire and death the curious fact even during the airraids themselves was that the children proved more resilient than the adults like their predecessors over many eras like the children depicted by hogarth in the eighteenth century they seemed to revel among all the suffering and privation and in part reclaimed that state of semisavagery which had been the mark of the streetarabs of the previous century one visitor to stepney after a raid noted that the children were wildlooking and grimy outwardly but full of vitality and enthusiasm one child said mister let me take you to see the last bomb round the corner in watsons wharf off wapping a gang of children congregated under the name of the dead end kids their story is told in east end then and now edited by wg ramsey they were the unofficial firefighters of the east end some of these children were very poor and dressed in cheap clothes they were split into sections of four each section was responsible for a district on wapping island they had iron bars and a handtruck as well as sand buckets and spades to assist them in their work they roped in time bombs and tossed them into the thames they carried the wounded away from incendiary scenes one intense night of bombing in wapping brought them out and in the words of one witness in a moment ten boys rushed up the stairs ready as it seemed to eat fires they entered a burning building in order to lead out some horses trapped within and emerged with the clothes of some of those boys smouldering some of them were killed in the fires and explosions but when casualties depleted their ranks others willingly filled their places it is a most extraordinary story which emphasises in vivid and poignant detail the hardiness and selfreliance bred within london children a little girl from the elephant and castle when asked if she wished to return to the country said no fear no fearthat is the key to their selfcontainment or recklessness there was also a different kind of community elizabeth bowen in her novel of wartime london the heat of the day suggested that those who had died in the fire and destruction were not forgotten these unknown dead reproached those left living not by their own death which might only be shared but by their unknownness which could not be mended now the war had revealed the essence of the citys conditions of solitude and anonymity who had the right to mourn them not having cared that they had lived as a result there was an attempt by the citizens to break down indifference and in some sense to ignore or mitigate the usual restrictions of life in london the wall between the living and the living became less solid as the wall between the living and the dead thinned so strangers would say good night good luck as they passed each other in the evening there was also a marked and pervasive sense of unreality as if the familiar outlines of the city had suddenly changed their aspect and become unknown or intangible everybody and all familiar things and jobs seemed so unreal one recalled we even spoke differently to each other as if we should soon be parted this sense of fragility or transitoriness helped to form the atmosphere in what was called a besieged city and one londoner who made a brief visit to the countryside professed himself surprised at buildings unthreatened at mountains that could not be overthrown as a result of his experience all permanence was astonishing so unnatural had his own life been that nature seemed not to belong to him nor he to nature the city had always been deemed unnatural by atavistic moralists but now that sense was shared by its citizens it was unnatural to be congregated in a place where bombs would fall it was unnatural to be part of so vast and manifest a target yet this was the condition of their lives perhaps it was the condition of being human the bombings of culminated in the most celebrated and notorious of all raids that of sunday december the warning was sounded a little after six in the evening and then the incendiaries came down like heavy rain the attack was concentrated upon the city of london the great fire had come again the area from aldersgate to cannon street all of cheapside and moorgate was in flames one observer on the roof of the bank of england recalled that the whole of london seemed alight we were hemmed in by a wall of flame in every direction nineteen churches sixteen of them built by christopher wren after the first great fire were destroyed of the thirtyfour guild halls only three escaped the whole of paternoster row went up in flames destroying some five million books the guildhall was badly damaged st pauls was ringed with fire but escaped no one who saw will ever forget william kent wrote in the lost treasures of london their emotions on the night when london was burning and the dome seemed to ride the sea of fire almost a third of the city was reduced to ash and rubble by curious coincidence however the destruction was largely visited upon the historical and religious aspects of the old city the thoroughfares of business such as cornhill and lombard street remained relatively unscathed while none of the great financial centres was touched the deities of the city protected the bank of england and the stock market like the city griffins which jealously guard its treasure one who walked through the ruins the day after the raid recalled that the air felt singed i was breathing ashes the air itself as we walked smelt of burning there are many accounts of the craters the cellars opened to the outer air the shattered walls the fallen masonry the gasmains on fire the pavements covered with dust and broken glass the odd stumps of brick the broken and suspended stairs for some days the church walls steamed and smoked according to james popehennessy in an account entitled history under fire yet the workers the temporary inhabitants of the city came back after the raids the whole city seemed to be on the tramp as the clerks and secretaries and office boys all took circuitous ways through the ruins to their destinations many had arrived to find their places of employment gutted or absolutely destroyed and then returned on the following morning simply because they had nothing better to do the power of the city then became manifest in their behaviour they resembled the prisoners of newgate who after it had been fired by the gordon rioters returned to wander among the ruins of their cells the city had become unfamiliar territory the area between st mary le bow in cheapside and st pauls cathedral reverted to wasteland where the long grass was crossed by beaten paths bearing the names of old change friday street bread street and watling street signs were nailed up with the names of these streets and others to prevent people from losing their way even the colours of the city had changed concrete and granite had been scorched umber while church ruins were chrome yellow there are some remarkable photographs taken by cecil beaton in the aftermath of the december raid paternoster row is a mound of broken rubble with odd pieces of ironwork sticking out among the brick and stone the premises of thirty publishers were destroyed in the last great fire the row was similarly struck and according to pepys all the great booksellers almost undone outside the church of st giles cripplegate the statue of milton had been blown off its plinth by the blast of a bomb but the tower and walls of the church survived as they had done almost four hundred years before it was recorded on september that sant gylles was burned alle hole save the walles stepall and alle and how it came god knoweth now almost by a miracle they were saved again there are photographs of many ruined church interiors with monuments tumbled down screens fallen into fragments and cherubs heads scattered across the floor there are photographs of the ruined guildhall of the bombed middle temple of craters and falling roofs it seemed to many that the tangible and textural history of london was without meaning if its glory could disappear in a night it was too fragile and frail to be relied upon it was the invisible and intangible spirit or presence of london that survived and somehow flourished in the period of devastation there were however unexpected discoveries a section of the roman wall hidden for many hundreds of years was uncovered by the bombing of cripplegate an underground chamber paved with tiles emerged below the altar of st mary le bow and a gothic blockedup doorway was recovered in st vedasts foster lane after its bombardment roman relics were found by austin friars one of them a tile with the pawmarks of a dog in pursuit of a cat behind the organ of all hallows church hitherto concealed by panelling which the bombs destroyed was found a seventhcentury arch formed out of roman tiles the parish priest described how out of the wall adjacent to the arch great fragments fell which had for at least eight hundred years been embedded as the capstones in the strong norman pillars of that date some of these stones were most remarkable they represent a school of craftsmanship whereof we have no other evidence they form a portion of a noble cross which once upreared its head on tower hill before the norman william conquered london the emblematic significance of the discovery was not in doubt the german bombs had fortuitously uncovered a saxon cross representing defiance before an invader so those who believed that the citys history could be easily destroyed were mistaken it emerged at a deeper level with the implicit assurance that like the ancient cross london itself would rise again there was even a natural analogy air damage to the herbarium in the natural history museum meant that certain seeds became damp including mimosa brought from china in after their trance of years they began to grow again yet there was also a curious interval when the natural world was reaffirmed in another sense one contemporary has described how many acres of the most famous city in the world have changed from the feverish hum and activity of man into a desolate area grown over with brightly coloured flowers and mysterious with wild life the transformation was deeply affecting in bread street and milk street bloomed ragwort lilies of the valley white and mauve lilac quiet lanes lead to patches of wild flowers and undergrowth not seen in these parts since the days of henry viii the connection here with the sixteenth century is an appropriate one when this part of london was laid out with gardens and pathways but the bombed city travelled further back to the time when it was prehistoric marshland the author of londons natural history rs fitter suggested after the war that the profusion of wild flowers birds and insects to be seen on the bombed sites of the city is now one of the sights of london he mentioned wild flowers grasses and ferns mammals birds insects and kinds of other invertebrates which had appeared since pigs were kept and vegetables cultivated in wasteland beside the bombed cripplegate church this earth had been covered with buildings for more than seven centuries and yet its natural fertility was revived it is indirect testimony perhaps to the force and power of london which kept this fertility at bay the power of the city and the power of nature had fought an unequal battle until the city was injured then the plants and the birds returned after the great fireraid at the end of december the attacks were more sporadic but no less deadly there were raids in january with a brief cessation in february but they began again in earnest in march on april the city was visited by what the germans described as the greatest airraid of all time the bombers returned again three nights later more than a thousand people were killed on each night of the bombardment which hit areas as diverse as holborn and chelsea london became confused and misshapen while anxiety and loss of sleep marked the faces of londoners it was the crushing sense of unreality and meaninglessness which now weighed heaviest the weariness combined with the destruction to create a lightheadedness among the population so low did the divebombers come one witness recalled that for the first time i mistook bombers for taxicabs the heaviest and most prolonged raid of all occurred on saturday may when bombs fell in kingsway smithfield westminster and all over the city almost were killed the law courts and the tower of london were attacked the house of commons reduced to a shell the church of st clement danes was destroyed so devastated that its rector died from the shock and grief in the following month his wife died four months later this perhaps represents a small amount of suffering compared to the totality of misery endured during these years but it marks one pertinent aspect of londons destruction certain individuals can become so attached to or associated with certain buildings that their destruction provokes death itself the city and its inhabitants are intertwined for better or for worse on the following day the smell of burning was never so pronounced as on that sunday morning it seemed then that the city could not withstand the onslaught for much longer an american journalist larry rue noticed that male workers in the city were travelling to their offices unshaven i began to realise he wrote to what deep depths of their being the may raid had shocked and shaken the people of london it was just one raid too much yet it was to be the last significant attack upon london for three years the german invasion of russia had indirectly saved the city from more destruction and there succeeded a relative peace then life went on the city seemed to resume its normal course with its postmen and busdrivers and milkmen and errand boys but there was the strangest feeling of ennui or despondency after the spectacular damage of the blitz philip ziegler in london at war has described it as an enervating lull with the conflict taking place in other cities and over other skies londoners felt that they had been left on the sidelines they were bored and dejected those who still used the underground shelters had established a network of friendship and camaraderie but this subterranean spirit was an odd token of londons general condition in what elizabeth bowen called the lightless middle of the tunnel enduring the discomforts and disadvantages of a war over which it had no control the citizens were frustrated at and bored by the privations of life and this in turn affected the very atmosphere and character of london itself the people were shabbily dressed and in instinctive and intimate sympathy their houses became shabby the windows were cracked the plaster was flaking away the wallpaper manifested signs of damp the public buildings of the city were also showing signs of fatigue and depression as their façades became more grimy and decayed the atmosphere was woebegone with a strange symbiosis between the city and its inhabitants which suggestsas defoe had discovered during the great plaguethe presence of a living suffering organism then at the beginning of the bombs returned but the little blitz as it was called was the unhappy end of unfinished business there were fourteen raids in all the heaviest in february and march directed against a city which had been wearied and to a certain extent demoralised by the prolonged and uncertain conflict london seems disturbed by the raids and less ebullient than in jock colville noted then something else happened in june of that year pilotless jet planes carrying a bomb known as the v alias doodlebug alias flying bomb alias buzz bomb alias robot bomb began to appear in the skies above london they were recognised by the sharp buzzing of the engine followed by sudden silence as the engine cut out and the bomb fell to earth they came in daylight with infrequent intervals between them and were perhaps the hardest to bear one listens fascinated to the doodle bugs passing over one contemporary wrote holding ones breath praying that they will travel on the atmosphere in london has changed back into the big blitz apprehension is in the air buses half empty in the evening marked absence of people on the streets thousands have left and many go early to the shelters the novelist anthony powell was on fire duty and watched the vs travelling through the air to their unknown targets with a curious shuddering jerky movement a shower of sparks emitted from the tail he saw them as dragons and in imagination one smelt brimstone so that the city under threat becomes once more a place of fantasy and myth almost two and a half thousand flying bombs fell upon the capital within ten monthsdroning things mercilessly making for you thick and fast day and night it was the impersonality of the weapons often compared with giant flying insects which compounded the fear the intended victims themselves became depersonalised of course so that the condition of living in the city was the condition of being less than human londoners according to cyril connolly grow more and more hunted and disagreeable like toads each sweating and palpitating under his particular stone the general mood was one of strain weariness fear and despondency let me get out of this was the unspoken wish visible upon every tired and anxious face while at the same time the inhabitants of london carried on with their customary work and duties the mechanism continued to operate but now in a much more impersonal manner the whole world had turned into a machine either of destruction or of weary survival just as the frequency of the flying bombs began to diminish in the early autumn of vengeance twothe vwas targeted upon the capital for the first time in the history of warfare a city came under attack from longdistance rockets which travelled at approximately three thousand miles per hour no warning could be sounded no counterattack launched the first one hit chiswick and the explosion could be heard at westminster about seven miles away their power was so great that whole streets were flattened as they landed one resident of islington recorded i thought the end of the world had come that phrase has been repeated before in the history of london at moments of crisis or terrible conflagration almost a thousand rockets were aimed at the capital with a half reaching their targets there were open spaces where streets had been one rocket hit smithfield market and another a department store in new cross the royal hospital in chelsea was struck are we never to be free of damage or death one londoner complained surely five years is long enough for any town to have to suffer it was the coldest winter for many years and the bombs continued to fall illness was in the air as it has been throughout londons troubled history along with rumours of epidemics and mounting deaths yet there was also a certain insouciance abroad the vs were so unpredictable and random that they revived the gambling spirit of londoners who now retired to bed without knowing if they were necessarily going to rise on the following morning and then suddenly it was all over at the end of march a rocket fell upon stepney and another on whitefields tabernacle on the tottenham court road but then the raids ceased the rocketlaunching sites had been captured the skies had cleared the battle of london was finally won almost londoners had been killed and more than houses utterly destroyed a third of the city of london had been razed on may there were the usual celebrations for victory in europe ve day although by no means as garish or as hysterical as those of the participants were more weary after five years of intermittent bombing and death than their predecessors on the same streets twentyseven years before and the war against japan was continuing vj day was august yet something had happened to london too in the phrase of the period the stuffing had been knocked out of it the metaphor suggesting a thinner and more depleted reality certainly it had lost much of its energy and bravura it had become as shabby as its inhabitants and like them it would take time to recover refashioning the city a poster extolling the virtues of the lansbury council estates in poplar built upon the ruins of the old east end some of the energy and the animation of the original tenements had gone but the east end was a safer and healthier place chapter fortune not design how shall we rebuild london this was the title of a book by cb purdom which described the postwar city dulled by such extensive drabness monotony ignorance and wretchedness that one is overcome by distress that drabness or greyness so characteristic in recollections of london in the s was a matter of privation in the years immediately after the second world war most commodities were rationed but in another sense it was the greyness of twilight if one natural reaction after the war lay in the desire to create a new world as the urban planners wished then another was to reconstruct the old world as if nothing particular had happened so when roy porter in london a social history invokes the s in terms of a kneesup at the pub and contented commuters he is remarking upon the atavistic tendency of london to go on doing all the things which it had been doing before the unhappy interruption of hostilities yet it could not and did not succeed the desire to impose a set of familiar conditions in changed circumstances led only to a vague atmosphere of oppression or constriction the two great setpieces of london theatre were the festival of britain in and the coronation of elizabeth ii in this sense of london as a successful and enthusiastic community miraculously reassembled after the war was subtly reinforced by the resurgence of orthodox values and conventional activities youth organisations like the scouts and the cubs flourished it was a great period for boys clubs in east and south london attendance at football matches rose once again to prewar levels the cinemas were also crowded perhaps because as one londoner of the period recalled there was practically nothing else to do this air of mild oppression like a hangover after the excitement of war was intensified by a concerted if unspoken desire to redefine sexual and social mores which had been considerably relaxed during the conflict the relative sexual freedom of women and the chummy egalitarianism of enforced contact between the classes were phenomena strictly of the past and that in turn led to further if illdefined unease especially among the younger population the standards of the s were being reintroduced within a quite different society the imposition of two years of compulsory military service known as national service only served to emphasise the atmosphere of general constriction it was a less advantageous aspect of the newly formed welfare state so london then was drab compared with other great cities such as rome and paris and new york it was ugly and forlorn for the first time in its history it had become something of an embarrassment and yet there were already stirrings of change arriving from unexpected quarters the teddy boys of elephant and castle and other parts of south london were joined by the bright young things of the chelsea set and the beatniks of soho as objects of moral outrage it is perhaps significant that these various groups were closely associated with certain areas of the city as if local historical forces were also at work they were all intent upon breaking free from what they considered to be the dreary uniformity of urban life still modelled on outdated systems of class and belief the dead areas of walworth or of acton of islington or of stoke newington were a standing reproof their territorial spirit too was manifest in what they wore the clothes of the teddy boy as well as his successor the mod were the single and often only mark of identity the teddy boys had in fact borrowed their look from the more respectable tailors of savile row and jermyn street who were trying to promote the images of edwardian refinement among their male customers edward became teddy and a new hybrid was created instead of those images of workingclass youth in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries shabbily dressed and with the uniform cloth cap perched upon their heads there emerged a picture of boys in velvet jackets and drainpipe trousers the recklessness and freedom already evinced by the children of the blitz were still apparent in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries clothes were handed down from class to class in the spiral of trade but on this occasion the disadvantaged actively promoted the transaction it was another feature of native london egalitarianism accompanied by a selfpossession and aggression which have been evident in london since the days of the medieval apprentices in fact many teddy boys were themselves apprentices but these attitudes were reinforced by the fact that london was becoming once more a young city the rising birth rate and accelerating prosperity of london in the s helped to create a younger society which wished to divest itself of the limitations and restrictions of the postwar capital there was no sudden transition in other words to the swinging sixties there were cafés and coffee bars and jazzclubs in soho there were clothesshops and small bistros in chelsea some years before the efflorescence of boutiques and discothèques london was slowly being rejuvenated and by the mids it was suggested that per cent of the general population were under twentyfive this is approximately the condition of roman london when only per cent of the population survived after fortyfive and we may infer a similar sexual energy it also corresponds to the ratio of the citys population in the sixteenth century where all the evidence suggests an earlier resurgence of the london appetite for fashion if the conditions are approximately the same then urban attitudes will be repeated before the blitzrasmussen has written in london the unique city londoners took their dingy streets as a matter of fact an unavoidable act of fate but when whole terraces could be levelled with one bomb they came to believe that even london was susceptible to destruction and could be changed it was dirty and seedy it was part of the civilisation which had created two world wars a london newspaper the evening standard asked for more dynamite even before the war was over a regional planner patrick abercrombie had prepared two proposals the county of london plan and the greater london plan which would lend london order and efficiency and beauty and spaciousness with an end to violent competitive passion it is the eternal aspiration or delusion that somehow the city can be forced to change its nature by getting rid of all the elements by which it had previously thrived yet in topographical terms the abercrombie plans were immensely influential they required a significant shift of population within the city itself in order to create balanced communities each comprising several neighbourhood units the reconstruction of bombed london would proceed on the basis of density zones which would disperse hitherto overcrowded neighbourhoods there would be a balance of housing industrial development and open space with key highways connecting variously integrated communities three examples may represent many much of the population of bethnal green was rehoused in lcc lowdensity estates such as woodford in essex the bombed areas of poplar were rebuilt as the great lansbury estate with a mixed style of block and single dwellings within inner london the loughborough estate rose in brixton its main edifices eleven storeys high the elements of london were being redistributed to create more light and air the old streets which were variously considered obsolete or outworn narrow or confined were erased in order to make room for modern larger and neater estates the advent of municipal control over large swathes of the city was not however without disadvantages it altered the reality of london damping down its natural laws of growth and change small businesses the life and blood of the city could no longer thrive the inner london councils were attempting to ignore or reverse the natural tendencies of the city which had been in operation for almost a thousand years it was inevitable that the old city of london would promote other ideas and in its own plan the planners suggested the conservation wherever possible of features which are of traditional and archaeological significance as well as maintaining the romance and history which the very street names breathe but their proposals for careful redevelopment were not in accordance with the modern spirit of innovation and largescale urban planning they were rejected by the national administration and the lcc was invited to redevelop areas around st pauls the tower and the present barbican other elements of abercrombies plans were also implemented most notably in the town and country act of he proposed that london become a circular inland city composed of four ringsthe inner urban ring the suburban ring the green belt ring and the outer country ring it was a way of containing the inner city as if it were some dangerous or threatening organism which could not be permitted to grow on most maps it is painted black it was also important to remove industry and people from this inner darkness as if the act of so doing would render it less dangerous in order to expedite the migration of a million people another part of abercrombies report suggested the development of new satellite towns in the outer country ring eight of these were built and prospered but the effects upon london itself were not exactly as had been anticipated and planned as any historian of london might have told the various urban boards neither schemes nor regulations would be able to inhibit the city it had been proposed to check its industrial and commercial growth by siting new industries in the satellite towns but londons commercial prosperity revived after war the manufacture of cars buses trucks and aeroplanes rose to unprecedented levels the port of london handled record numbers of goods and employed men the office economy had restored the city of london so that it experienced a property boom the population of the capital had dipped slightly after the dispersal of many of its inhabitants to the suburbs and to the new towns but the effect was mitigated by sudden and unexpectedly high fertility nothing could withstand the ability of the city to rejuvenate itself and continue its growth the new satellite towns such as stevenage and harlow and basildon became part of an historical process which was also too powerfultoo instinctiveto be reversed london has always grown by taking over adjacent towns or villages and cradling them in its embrace it has been a feature of its development since the eleventh century and so it overtook the newly created towns so powerful is the historical imperative that patrick abercrombie and his colleagues were instinctively creating just the same patterns of habitation as the seventeenthcentury builders of bloomsbury and covent garden the new towns ineluctably became as much part of london as their predecessors instead of restricting the size of the city the postwar planners immeasurably expanded it until the whole southeastern area became london the outer metropolitan area represented the latest manifestation of urban life characterised by endless movement but that was always the condition of london whenever the opportunity and location are offered it replicates its identity it is a blind force in that sense not susceptible to the blandishments of planners or politiciansexcept as we have seen when they offer further prospects of growth the green belt did not then act as a barrier or inhibitor of urban life in certain respects it simply became a large open space fortuitously situated within the outer metropolitan region but it did have one effect in checking the physical development of the inner city and its immediate suburbs which had to leap over the greenness in order to continue their ineluctable life yet as part of this phenomenon there was also a curious sense in which the city recoiled upon itself it fed back into itself deprived of any room for immediate local extension it began to reexplore its own patterns and possibilities the construction of the great inner london estates the resurgence of interest in restoring old dwellings the process of gentrification the growth of loft living the whole emphasis upon renewal are the direct consequences of the green belt which forced london and londoners to look inwards rather than outwards the imperatives of londons history had one further consequence the postwar planners had also envisaged a great network of orbital and ring roads with much the same intent and significance as the wide avenues proposed for london by wren and evelyn after the great fire but like the earlier designs they came to nothing they were defeated by political pressure economic constraints and vehement local opposition london almost alone of english cities has withstood the edicts of rational planners and highway management it was part of its ability successfully to frustrate any general or grandiose plan general structural change did not and could not occur the city has preserved its character ever since the first tudor proclamations concerning town planning were ignored yet this was not generally understood at the time and in london the s were particularly charged with forgetfulness the american weekly time proclaimed on its front cover londonthe swinging city its affluence was visible enough real earnings had risen by approximately per cent in the twenty years since the war and the high birth rate in the first years of peace certainly gave the impression of a city dominated by youth the fact that national service had been abolished in itself represented a literal and emblematic lifting of restrictions upon young males in particular so music and fashion returned on an unprecedented scale one designer mary quant has suggested that she wished to create clothes that were much more for lifemuch more for real people much more for being young and alive in so there was an efflorescence of boutiques in welldefined areas of london carnaby street became the centre for young men who wore mod fashions with the familiar london emphasis upon what was new or in the news while the kings road in chelsea became the destination for young women who wished to be trendy music too emanated from london with groups such as the who the kinks the small faces and the rolling stones many of their members having come from london art schools and colleges those groups from outside the city like the beatles necessarily migrated to it designers had also caught the prevailing mood terence conran recollected that id always believed that welldesigned things should be available to the whole population that it shouldnt be an elitist thing and i think this coincided with a lot of people whod had further education coming through who were discontented with the way things were so broader access to higher education played its part in what conran called the atmosphere of discontentment it was discontent primarily with the postwar world of hierarchy and repression but also with the perceived shabbiness and dreariness of london it was a way of lightening the surroundings the actual nature and identity of the city were no longer of any consequence for a few years instead it became the style capital where music and fashion attracted the ancillary industries of magazine publishing photography advertising modelling broadcasting and filmmaking to create a bright new city but of course swinging london was not new at all the citys familiar instincts had never ceased their operation the commercial imperative of the citys life for example had identified a market among the newly resurgent youth which could be in turn exploited by intelligent entrepreneurs the commercial infrastructure of the music business for example was already in place in all areas of this teenage revolt in fact the youths themselves were exploited by a vast commercial project it was a thoroughly london undertaking the phenomenon of the s was essentially theatrical and artificial in nature too like so many london displays it glided over the fundamental underlying life in the capital to see the decade clearly it is important to see it steadily and as a whole encompassing all of its realities it is significant for example that the age of the boutique and the discothèque was also the age of the tower block of public vandalism and of increased crime they are not unconnected of the tower blocks of the s much has been written they had become the resort of planners and architects motivated by aesthetic as well as social reasons they seemed to offer the vision of a new kind of city many georgian and victorian terraces were razed by the civic authorities to make way for an experiment in urban living in which a new kind of vertical community might be forged the popularity of the tower blockssome four hundred were erected in london during the late swas also animated by economic principles they were standardised and therefore could be quickly and cheaply assembled there were so many people on housing lists or living in parts of the inner city which were deemed unfit for human habitation that the highrise estates seemed at the time to be the only efficient and affordable means of translating citizens from relative squalor into relative comfort it was the age of the property developer when great fortunes could be made trading off development land to the lcc for permission to build on sensitive sites their names were legioncentrepoint london wall euston centre elephant and castle all of london seemed to have been changed out of scale and out of recognition it was a form of vandalism in which the government and civic authorities were happy to acquiesce vast swathes of london disappeared in the processprinting house square caledonian market st lukes hospital parts of piccadilly stretches of the city were all demolished in order to make way for what became known as comprehensive redevelopment what it represented was a deliberate act of erasure an act of forgetting not so dissimilar in spirit to the mood and ambience of the swinging sixties elsewhere in london it was as if time and londons history had for all practical purposes ceased to exist in pursuit of profit and instant gratification the past had become a foreign country three examples from the s may suffice londonderry house in park lane was dismantled in to make way for the london hilton the georgian streets of the packington estate in islington were demolished in to make room for a council estate in the great euston arch the portico of euston station was pulled down as part of a scheme of modernisation just as the excitement of the trendy had animated the worlds of music and fashion so the same denial or rejection of the past determined architectural and civic planning swinging london was all of a piece and much of the swinging was done by the implements of the demolition teams london has always been an ugly city it is part of its identity it has always been rebuilt and demolished and vandalised that too is part of its history the ancient creedcursed be he that removeth old landmarkshas never been observed in the city in fact one of the characteristics of london planners and builders over the centuries has been the recklessness with which they have destroyed the citys past there were even songs on the subject from previous centuries o london wont be london long for twill all be pulled down and i shall sing a funeral song it might have been sung by victoria station or knightsbridge or st giles circus in the s the haunts we revelled in today we lose tomorrow morning as one by one are swept away in turn without a warning in the s all the old ruinated work of past ages was swept away in the entire redevelopment of bridge ward in the s the medieval gates of the city walls were demolished on the grounds that they obstructed the free current of air in the same decade of improvement houses were demolished to make way for new streets in no fewer than eleven wards it was the greatest single change in london since the great fire a hundred years before then in the union of benefices act expedited the destruction of fourteen city churches some of them erected by wren after that fire the s were in fact the great period of destruction when in the words of gavin stamp in the changing metropolis half of london was being rebuilt the city must have been a nightmare of dust mud scaffolding and confusion queen victoria street and the holborn viaduct were being constructed causing massive destruction to the oldest parts of london while the various railway networks were defacing the cityscape with tracks and stations the london chatham amp dover railway passed across ludgate hill for example and obscured the view of st pauls cathedral this disfigurement of the cathedral was once more the charge levelled against property developers of the s so it would seem that there is no pause in the destruction of london it can be no more than coincidence that these great waves of vandalism occurred in the s of each century unless you were to believe that some theory of cyclical recurrence can be applied to the citys development in that case we might expect the s to mark the destruction of much twentiethcentury building other aspects of the s seem in retrospect aligned to each other there was an extraordinary and indeed unprecedented rise in crime which tripled in the twelve years after and showed no signs of diminution in the late s the culture of instant gratification and of youthful power must have played a large part in inciting less affluent youths to theft and housebreaking but the tower blocks and the property speculators and the garish fashions all contributed to a mood of implicit or explicit aggression controls had been removed from officebuilding and from planning applications but controls had also been removed from all aspects of londons existence the later waves of youthful protest from the hippies and flower children of the late s to the punks of the s manifested only confusion and anxiety in a highly unsettled urban society the civic existence of london like some behemoth below the water continued ineluctably to expand in the greater london council comprising thirtytwo boroughs and some square miles of territory was established as has always been the case with londons government it represented a political compromise and a division of powers between different levels of urban government the confusion can be exemplified perhaps in the decision that the glc should be responsible for metropolitan roads the ministry of transport for trunk roads and the boroughs for local roads yet confusion is perhaps the wrong word for the fundamental condition of londons administration the competing road authorities were remarkably similar to the competing vestries and parishes and metropolitan authorities which in the early decades of the nineteenth century were responsible for lighting and sanitation london has always been a muddle that is perhaps why it has survived the glc however was given responsibility for a new development plan for london including the distribution of population employment transport and redevelopment in the continuing delusion that the city could somehow be made to serve the will of civil servants politicians and planners even at the time of its inception however the greater london council was not great enough to control or supervise the expansion of a city which in terms of planning for population and employment now took in the entire southeast of england its administrative area was already anachronistic and its planning purposeless it could not have been otherwise but something else was happening over which no one had any control trade was being lost manufacturing industries moved out or closed down unemployment rose very quickly the most important transition occurred upon the river where in quick succession londons docks were deemed redundant and irrelevant they were no longer large enough to handle the new container ships and in any case trade with the commonwealth was rapidly decreasing the east india dock ceased activity in followed by st katherines dock and london dock two years later the surrey commercial docks were closed in and there were further closures until the banks of the thames were bare and empty with echoing warehouses and waste ground the only visible remnant of what had once been one of the citys glories the queenhithe dock which had a continuous history since the time of saxon london was destroyed in the spring of to make way for a luxury hotel in a sense it epitomises the movement of london where one trade must give way to another but the wasteland of the dockside area once the centre and principle of the citys commerce was in a larger sense an emblem of london in the s the s have been described by some commentators as a time of innocence although their levels of crime and vandalism may serve to alter that impression but whatever innocence still existed fell away in the succeeding decade when all the old problems of london reasserted themselves an economic boom in the late s was followed by a bust in the mids london lost its vivacity and much of its energy the sudden decay of trade and commerce in a city devoted to them provoked considerable dismay and anxiety for a while it seemed that its life was being stopped this in turn led to concern among those who administered the city london was sick and needed a fresh access of life and trade the long experiment with highrise tower blocks on borough housing estates came to an end it had been effectively destroyed by a structural accident at ronan point in in which several people were killed but the spirit of the timeand indeed the spirit of londonturned against it the emphasis would now rest upon highdensity and lowrise estates which would in a sense attempt to reproduce the atmosphere of the old terraced streets at the same time measures were introduced to revive the central areas of london with schemes designed to protect the environment and expedite public transport in particular the policy of demolishing victorian or georgian housing was reversed and grants were instead made available for improvements in older and more dilapidated dwellings the city once more was being comforted and consolidated rather than destroyed there ensued a process of what became known as gentrification when generally middleclass and professional couples moved into rundown houses or areas in order to refurbish and renew them islington and spitalfields were two previously deprived areas which benefited from this change of ownership and direction the green belt turned the city in upon itself the edges of greater london were now so distant that londoners began to reclaim those parts of the city closer to home the city was solidifying perhaps it was about to realise its potential at a time of recession and falling expectations there were also fears that it might become the terrain of social conflict it became the task of administration therefore to preserve and heal the fragile city thus in the late s the greater london council funded new community projects with the emphasis resting upon the vulnerable or the marginal ethnic and sexual minorities in particular were afforded assistance here was an affirmation of londons democratic and egalitarian instincts but it was also a necessary remedy for difficult times the real needs of the city having been ignored or exploited for some years were being met it is significant too that in the period of improvement grants and gentrification the conservation of london became a matter of great and growing public concern a scheme for the motorway box around london was dropped proposals to refit covent garden in accordance with principles of traffic flow and pedestrian decks were abandoned after strenuous local opposition by the mids there were some conservation areas located in all parts of the city testifying to a new awareness of londons textural fabric and social history hostilities against the city had finally come to an end the abolition of the greater london council in left it without a unified authority but it did not seem to notice in effect london resumed its ancient life with the separate boroughs affirming distinct and different identities the city in the process acquired its old momentum the election of a mayor and assembly for london will not materially affect its nature or direction it does not respond to policy committees or to centralised planning it would be easier to control the elements themselves this was nowhere more evident than in the conception and creation of docklands the docklands development corporation was established in to restore or renew the wasteland left by the closure of the london docks wapping rotherhithe the isle of dogs silvertown north woolwich and beckton were within its boundaries and a number of enterprise zonesratefree and taxfree catchment areaswere marked out for especial attention the london city airport the docklands light railway and an extended jubilee line were the designated means of transport but as in most london developments the results were largely unplanned and unpredictable the fate of canary wharf was in that sense emblematic its central feature was an foot tower surmounted by a pyramid which might provoke thoughts of imperial destiny with approximately ten million square feet of office space the original developers withdrew from the scheme and their replacement the firm of olympia amp york was reduced to bankruptcy even as the tower was nearing completion a third consortium took over the project even though a surplus of office space in the rest of the capital mitigated against early success and yet somehow it worked tenants were found and the whole of canary wharf flourished docklands itself experienced a similar fate wild fluctuations in the urban economy left it balancing between triumph and disaster on a number of occasions its apartment blocks were fashionable one year and unfashionable the next there were complaints about rudimentary transport facilities as well as the absence of shops but nevertheless there was continual development michael hebbert in london has remarked that there were few preconceptions as to what should occur and that this handsoff approach produced a curiously piecemeal environment yet in that respect it followed the pattern of most london growth which is no doubt the reason for its success docklands had no overall philosophy for the massing and scale of buildings or for the layout of public spaces but that is why it has become a natural and recognisable extension of london the entire area was accused of aesthetic incoherence and a marketdriven disregard of social policy but these are precisely the conditions and circumstances in which the city has expanded and flourished it understands no other principles of life that is the context in which the great tower of canary wharf which dominates the london skyline has won in hebberts words immediate acceptance and affection this great shaft so in tune with the alignment of the city now rivals the monument and big ben as the symbol of london it represents too the single most important shift in urban topography for many centuries the commercial and social pressures had always edged westwards but the development of docklands has opened up what has been called londons eastward corridor which in historical and structural terms offers passage and access to europe at a time when londons economy is becoming more closely associated with the continent there is a suspicion that the city of londonas well as the banks and brokers newly moved to docklands will come to dominate the financial markets of the european community here in this steady progress eastwards we may be able to sense londons instinctive and almost primordial reaching towards money and trade it is appropriate to mention here the big bang which transformed the city in the autumn of that explosion turned the stock exchange into the international stock exchange enabled the merger of banking and brokerage houses finished the system of fixed commissions and introduced electronic dealing it was not the beginning of the citys triumphalism the phenomenon of young urban professionals named yuppies had been first noticed in a group who in the phrases of the period wished to get rich quick before burnout but the events of heralded a seachange in the position of the city of london its foreign exchange market is now the most advanced and elaborate in the world handling approximately onethird of the worlds dealings with employed in banking and allied services it has become the largest exchange in the world once more london was fulfilling its historical destiny and recovering the preeminence which it had achieved in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it is an historical achievement in more than one sense since as hebbert has explained the compactness of a year old urban core is fortuitously well suited to the operation of a globalised financial service centre whether it is entirely fortuitous is another matter however since the actual nature of that square mile seems uniquely possessed by the spirit of commerce there have been booms and busts but it has maintained its ascendancy a new type of commercial activity however demanded new forms of building that is how the city changes while keeping its identity intact the demand was for large open spaces which could accommodate the miles of cables attached to electronic activity and which could harbour thousands of employees working under consistent pressure there was after all a human cost to this fresh access of trade in the late s some four million square metres of office space were added to the stock of the city not least with the development of the broadgate complex lightsensitive blinds and prismatic bluegreen glass shielded the devotees of finance as they continued night and day with their dealings and transactions all the gods and griffins of the city protected them what gods were these who can say in faith in the city a report sponsored by the archbishop of canterbury noted that it was the poor who have borne the brunt of the recession both the unemployed and the working poor yet it is the poor who are seen by some as social security scroungers or a burden on the country preventing economic recovery this is a cruel example of blaming the victim it is one of the great and continuing paradoxes of london life that the rich global city contains also the worst examples of poverty and deprivation but perhaps that comprises the meaning of london perhaps its destiny is to represent the contradictions of the human condition both as an example and as a warning the report also described those council estates which have a quite different social and economic system operating almost entirely at subsistence level dependent entirely on the public sector the degeneration of many such areas has now gone so far that they are in effect separate territories outside the mainstream of our social and economic life these sentiments will be familiar to those who have studied the social topography of london over the centuries charles booths poverty map of might provoke a similar analysis for example with the proviso that there was then no public sector to support the indigent and the unfortunate once more it is the condition of london itself which is being described if the city had a voice it might be saying there will always be those who fail or who are unfortunate just as there will always be those who cannot cope with the world as presently constituted but i can encompass them all the decade which saw the emergence of the yuppies for example also witnessed the revival of streetbeggars and vagrants sleeping rough upon the streets or within doorways lincolns inn fields was occupied once more by the homeless after an interval of years while areas like waterloo bridge and the embankment became the setting for what were known as cardboard cities the strand in particular became a great thoroughfare of the dispossessed despite civic and government initiatives they are still there they are now part of the recognisable population they are londoners joining the endless parade or perhaps by sitting upon the sidelines they remind everyone else that it is a parade and yet what is it now to be a londoner the map of the city has been redrawn to include outer metropolitan areas as well as greater and inner london the entire southeast of england haswillingly or unwillinglybecome its zone of influence is london then just a state of mind the more nebulous its boundaries and the more protean its identity has it now become an attitude or set of predilections on more than one occasion in its history it has been described as containing a world or worlds within itself now it has been classified as a global city and in hebberts words as a universe with its own rules which has genuinely burst out of national boundaries so it does truly contain a universe like some dense and darkly revolving cloud at its centre but this is why so many millions of people describe themselves as londoners even if they are many miles from the inner city they call themselves londoners because they are pervaded by a sense of belonging london has been continuously inhabited for over two thousand years that is its strength and its attraction it affords the sensation of permanence of solid ground that is why the vagrant and the dispossessed lie in its streets that is why the inhabitants of harrow or croydon call themselves londoners its history calls them even if they do not know it they are entering a visionary city cockney visionaries a fantastical tribute to christopher wren outlining the spires and vistas of the great and powerful city which he helped to create much of his work has gone but the power and energy remain chapter unreal city it has always been a city of vision and prophecy it is supposed to have been founded after a prophetic dream vouchsafed to brutus and the vision of a great city in a strange yet greener country haunts the imaginations of the classical poets as ovid wrote in his metamorphoses even as i speak i see our destiny the city of our sons and sons of sons greater than any city we have known or has been known or shall be known to men its visionary or mythic status has rendered it provisional and impalpable it has become an unreal city in the phrase of ts eliot which throughout its history has been populated by the creatures of mythology nymphs have been seen along the banks of its rivers and minotaurs within its labyrinths of brick it has been aligned with nineveh and tyre sodom and babylon and at times of fire and plague the outlines of those cities have risen among its streets and buildings the citys topography is a palimpsest within which all the most magnificent or monstrous cities of the world can be discerned it has been the home of both angels and devils striving for mastery it has been the seat of miracles and the harbour of savage paganism who can fathom the depths of london chaucers prophetic dream in the house of famei dreamt i was within a temple made of glass with many a pillar of metalhas been applied to many of londons edifices but the most formidable prophecies are of revelation and apocalypse on the north side of aldersgate were inscribed the words then shall enter into the gates of the city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of david and the city shall remain forever even to its inhabitants it was a biblical city its history beyond the memory of man verified its sacredness yet its inhabitants have also been touched by other forms of vision of chaucers pilgrims on their way to canterbury along borough high street william blake said that they compose all ages and nations every race or tribe or nation every faith or form of speech have been comprehended within the city the whole universe may be found within a grain of londons life the gate of heaven in st bartholomew the great was located beside the shambles of smithfield but if it is a sacred city it is one which includes misery and suffering the bowels of god have opened and rained down shit upon london the most abject poverty or dereliction can appear beside glowing wealth and prosperity yet the city needs its poor what if the poor must die or be deprived in order that the city might live that would be the strangest contrast of all life and death meet and part misfortune and good fortune shake hands suffering and happiness inhabit the same house without contraries blake once wrote is no progression he reached this truth by steady observation of the city it is always ancient and forever new that disparity or disjunction itself creating a kind of ferment of novelty and inventiveness it may be that the new protects the old or the old guards the new yet in the very fact of their oneness lies the secret of londons identity shining through time yet wherever you go in the city you are continually being assaulted by difference and it could be surmised that the city is simply made up of contrasts it is the sum of its differences it is in fact the very universality of london that establishes these contrasts and separations it contains every aspect of human life within itself and is thus perpetually renewed yet do the rich and the poor inhabit the same city it may be that each citizen has created a london in his or her own head so that at the same moment there may exist seven million different cities it has sometimes been observed that even native londoners experience a kind of fear or alarm if they find themselves in a strange part of the city it is partly the fear of becoming lost but it is also the fear of difference and yet is a city so filled with difference also therefore filled with fear this vision of totality of fullness of life may be cast in an optimistic sense boswell suggested that the intellectual man is struck with london as comprehending the whole of human life in all its variety the contemplation of which is inexhaustible it is the vision which was imparted to him as he was driven along the haymarket in the early days of i was full of rich imagination of london such as i could not explain to most people but which i strongly feel and am ravished with my blood glows and my mind is agitated with felicity it is the fullness of london which prompts his happiness the congregation of people of all races of all talents of all fortunes releases a massive air of expectancy and exhilaration london manifests all the possibilities of humankind and thus becomes a vision of the world itself steele was a great lover of mankind and by cornhill at the sight of a prosperous and happy multitude i cannot forbear expressing my joy with tears that have stoln down my cheeks a century later charles lamb wrote that i often shed tears in the motley strand for fulness of joy at such a multitude of life the multitudes induce wonder they are not an incoherent mass or a heap of irreconcilable elements but a flowing and varied multitude english drama and the english novel spring out of the very conditions of london in jonson and smollett and fielding the poetry of the streets finds its fulfilment theirs is a visionary imagination as rich as that of chaucer or of blake but it is a peculiarly london vision filled with images of the theatre and the prisonhouse of commerce and of crowds of fullness and rapacity and forgetfulness from a london vision springs a distinctive sensibility all of these writersand many more are numbered with themwere preoccupied with light and darkness in a city that is built in the shadows of money and power all of them were entranced by the scenic and spectacular in a city that is continually filled with the energetic display of people and institutions they understood the energy of london they understood its variety and they also understood its darkness so they tended to favour spectacle and melodrama as city artists they are more concerned with the external life with the movement of crowds with the great general drama of the human spirit they have a sense of energy and splendour of ritual and display which may have very little to do with ethical judgement or the exercise of moral consciousness in part they share the sublime indifference of london where the multitudes come and go however hard and theatrical it may seem it is a true vision of the world in the famous phrase london made me but then it cannot be altogether hard it reduced steele and lamb to tears it is appropriate then that there should also have been visions of disaster of london in ruins or choked to death upon its own smoke and dirt the french writer mirbeau invoked a city of the nightmare of dream of mystery of the conflagration of the furnace of chaos of floating gardens of the invisible the unreal this special nature of the prodigious city an image of the furnace often emerges in london visions in blakes jerusalem primrose hill is the mouth of the furnace amp of the iron door and in arthur machens when i was young in london there was a moment when looking back one could see all the fires of london reflected dimly in the sky as if far away awful furnace doors were opened it has been known as the oven as if that sense of unnatural heat provokes strange images of its inhabitants being cooked and eaten yet it has also been called a temple of fireworshippers so perhaps the citizens venerate the agents of their destruction a nineteenthcentury observer of the fog noticed the sun as a mysterious and distant gleam which seemed to be trying to penetrate to this immobile world this is another true vision of the city when all its noise and bustle have disappeared when it lies silent and peaceful all of its energy momentarily suspended it seems like some natural force that will outlast all the activity of humankind it is gigantic monstrous and by the very fact of its enormity somehow primeval the poet tom moore had a refrain go where we may rest where we will eternal london haunts us still eternity may have many aspects one is that of eternal recurrence so that the people of the city will say the same things or use the same gestures upon the same streets since no one may watch a corner or a stretch of thoroughfare over hundreds of years the truth of this will never be discovered yet perhaps it has become clear that certain activities seem to belong to certain areas or neighbourhoods as if time itself were moved or swayed by some unknown source of power yet if this seems too fanciful there may be another aspect of eternal london it is permanent it is unceasing of its essence it is unchanged it is a condition of the universe as the author of london nights has put it london is every city that ever was and ever will be thus wordsworth saw by ludgate hill a visionary scenea length of street laid open in its morning quietness deep hollow unobstructed vacant smooth the silence is the silence of permanence when all the passing generations have sung their songs and departed the city continues its quiet life to see london without its inhabitants is indeed a visionary scene because another presence then reveals itself that is why there have been so many visions of london in ruins in drawings and in engravingseven in images of filmit resembles some lost continent or a city lately risen from the sea these are not the ruins of babylon or rome but of atlantis or some other mythological landscape they are emblems of some undying need or aspiration it is possible however to see among them the passing generations london is eternal because it contains them all when addison visited the tombs of westminster abbey he was moved to reflect that when i read the several dates of the tombs of some that died yesterday and some six hundred years ago i consider that great day when we shall all of us be contemporaries and make our appearance together it may be that london uniquely among cities prompts such considerations since the dead seem to be pursuing at the heels of the living for some this is a hopeful vision it suggests reconciliation where all the manifest differences of the city riches and poverty health and sickness will find their quietus one cannot be separated from the other so turner saw the most angelic beings in the whole compass of the london world in the squalor and filth of the london docks there are those who have been possessed by a different vision according to geoffrey grigson london stood for doing at least it stood for beginning branwell brontë in the parsonage at haworth collected all the maps of london he could find depicting its alleys and back slums and short cuts according to juliet barker in the brontës he studied them so closely that he knew them all by heart so that he appeared to be an old londoner who knew more about the ins and outs of the mighty babylon than many a man who had passed his life within its walls this intense reading of london was for him a form of liberation the maps represented all the hopes for and aspirations towards a new life it was as if he were studying his own destiny but for others the dream may become feverish when the whole weight of london presses down at the end of bleak house that threnody among the labyrinths of london richard carstone towards the close of his wretched life asks it was all a troubled dream for many that is also a true vision of the city the elements of innovation and of change are subtly mingled together with the sheer exhilaration of being one among a numerous company one could become anybody some of the great stories of london concern those who have taken on new identities and new personalities to begin again to renew oneself is one of the great advantages of the city it is part of its endlessly dramatic life it is possible after all to enter if only for a moment the lives and emotions of those who pass by this collective experience can in turn be a source of exhilaration it was what francis thompson perceived in his vision of the traffic of jacobs ladder pitched between heaven and charing cross it is the enchantment of a million golden souls moving back and forth between heaven and the city all singular and all blessed it is the same vision vouchsafed to those who have heard the music of london a pattern of notes rising and falling in some great melody to which all the streets and avenues move in unison the city then forms a geography passing beyond the natural to become metaphysical only describable in terms of music or abstract physics thus writes michael moorcock in mother london some inhabitants hear the musicthese are the dreamers and the antiquariansbut others perceive it only fitfully and momentarily it may be in a sudden gesture in a sentence overheard in an instant of memory london is filled with such broken images laughter which has been heard before a tearful face which has been seen before a street which is unknown and yet familiar chapter resurgam if you were to walk across the isle of dogs where the canary wharf tower itself is to be found past the enamel panels and the jet mist granite past the silver cladding and the curved glass walls you might come across other realities here and there still stand late victorian pubs marking the corners of otherwise shattered roads there are council blocks from the s and councilhouse estates from the s occasionally a row of nineteenthcentury terraced houses will emerge like an apparition the isle of dogs represents in other words the pattern of london certain of the new developments are themselves decked out as if they were victorian warehouses or georgian terraces or twentiethcentury suburban dwellings thus intensifying the sense of heterogeneity and contrast this too is part of london this is why it has been said that there are in reality hundreds of londons all mingled there are different worlds and times within the city whitehall and west ham white city and streatham haringey and islington are all separate and unique yet in the last years of the twentieth century they participated in the general brightness of london if light travels in waves then it may be described as a rippling effect as the renovation or rejuvenation of the inner core has spread outwards london has opened up there seems to be more space and more air it has grown in lightness in the city towers are clad in silverblue reflective glass so that the difference between the sky and the building is effaced in clapton and shepherds bush houses are being repaired and repainted if london were a living thing we would say that all of its optimism and confidence have returned it has again become the capital of all capitals in every cultural and social sense the world flocks to it and once more it has become a youthful city that is its destiny resurgam i will arise it was the word found upon a piece of stray and broken stone just when wren began his work upon st pauls cathedral he placed it at the centre of his design in exchange square of the broadgate development in the last autumn of the twentieth century a calypso band was playing in an open space designed for performance some city workers before their journey homewards were drinking in a public house close by a man and woman were dancing to the rhythm of the music in the shadow of the great arch of exchange house in an area below them a shallow cascade of water ran continually while to one side reclined a statue entitled the broadgate venus below the square i could see the platforms of liverpool street station with the trains moving inwards and outwards while on the horizon behind exchange house the spire of st leonard shoreditch could plainly be discerned it was a matter of conjecture how many different times inhabited this small area there was a nineteenthcentury railway time but also the time of the music there was the endless movement of water but also the rhythm of the dancing the great statue of the reclining nude seemed almost preternaturally still amid all this activity enjoining a quietness not unlike that of st leonard in the distance and then there were the officeworkers with glasses in their hands who were at that moment like their ancestors wandering out of time so broadgate in the early evening contained many times like currents of air invisibly mingling on that same evening i walked perhaps two hundred yards to the east and i came across another london site just beyond the old market of spitalfields archaeologists have discovered an area where the medieval hospital of st mary spital once stood on this small spot were found the stone sarcophagus of a fourthcentury roman female a fourteenthcentury charnel house and graveyard a fifteenthcentury gallery from which civic dignitaries listened to the spital sermon evidence of a sixteenthcentury artillery ground london fortifications of the seventeenth century eighteenthcentury dwellings and part of a nineteenthcentury street more will emerge in time although time itself has a thicker and more clouded atmosphere in such a place the levels of the centuries are all compact revealing the historical density of london yet the ancient city and the modern city literally lie beside each other one cannot be imagined without the other that is one of the secrets of the citys power these relics of the past now exist as part of the present it is in the nature of the city to encompass everything so when it is asked how london can be a triumphant city when it has so many poor and so many homeless it can only be suggested that they too have always been a part of its history perhaps they are a part of its triumph if this is a hard saying then it is only as hard as london itself london goes beyond any boundary or convention it contains every wish or word ever spoken every action or gesture ever made every harsh or noble statement ever expressed it is illimitable it is infinite london an essay on sources if london is endless and illimitable so are the books and essays devoted to it the bibliography of printed works on london history edited by heather creaton london lists separate publications from london history periodicals to service war memorials no scholar of the city however eager or ambitious can hope to assimilate all this material my own thread through the labyrinth has been twined out of enthusiasm and curiosity coarse enough in the circumstances but serviceable of the general studies i can recommend the future of londons past by m biddle and d hudson london the stones of london by jv elsden and ja howe london the soul of london by fm ford london street names of the city of london by e ekwall oxford the lost language of london by h bayley london london in song by w whitten london london echoing and the london perambulator both by james bone london and historians of london by s rubinstein london memoirs of extraordinary popular delusions by c mackay london the synfulle citie by ej burford london london mystery and mythology by w kent london note that these books are in no particular order chronological or thematic and in that sense they act as an image of the city itself where stray impressions leave their mark in turn we have the streets of london through the centuries by t burke london they saw it happen edited in four volumes by wo hassall crn routh t charlesedwards b richardson and a briggs oxford the ghosts of london by ja brooks norwich characters of bygone london by w stewart london the quack doctors of old london by cj thompson london london as it might have been by f barker and r hyde london queer things about london by c harper london the geology of london and southeast england by gm davies london is matched by london illustrated geological walks by e robinson edinburgh the curiosities of london by j timbs london can similarly be placed beside literary and historical memorials of london by jh jesse london london rediscoveries by wg bell london and old customs and ceremonies of london by m brentnall london the londoners almanac by r ash london contains peculiar and sometimes interesting facts such as twenty slang words used by london taxidrivers w kents london in the news through three centuries london contains astonishing stories of hauntings bodysnatchings and deaths by lightning the aquarian guide to legendary london edited by jm matthews and c potter wellingborough is indispensable reading for those who are interested in the occluded aspects of the citys history while london bodies by a werner london is a fascinating exercise in comparative physiology the building of london by j schofield london offers many valuable perceptions into the fabric and texture of the developing city while the city of london by ch holden and wg holford london is concerned with the task of reconstruction after the second world war lost london by h hobhouse london is necessary if poignant reading on all that has been destroyed or vandalised by generations of londons builders and it is complemented by g stamps the changing metropolis london which contains many fascinating photographs of the vanished or forgotten city studies in london history edited by aej hollaender and w kellaway london is a collection of essays which has the virtue of appealing to every literate londoner with articles ranging from the real richard whittington to the prenorman london bridge invaluable too is london in paint edited by m gallinou and j hayes london which moves from the earliest oil painting of london to the latest emanation of what might loosely be termed the school of london in a similar spirit the image of london views by travellers and emigrés edited by m warner london collects the compositions of among others whistler monet and canaletto to provide a pictorial synopsis of the city london on film by c sorensen london performs a similar feat with the cinema curious london by r cross london is filled with well curiosities and with a sigh we may finish this intricate selection with where london sleeps by wg bell london it would be out of place here to list the literature of london simply because to a large extent it also represents the literature of england few novelists poets or dramatists have not been touched or moved by london i might also name chaucer shakespeare pope dryden johnson and the myriad other writers who comprise a distinct and distinctive london world that is the matter for another book all i can do here is list specific debts and allegiances especially to those writers and books which emerge in the course of my narrative i feel of course an obligation to ts eliot thomas more william blake and charles dickens who have helped to fashion my vision of london to thomas de quincey charles lamb george gissing arthur machen and the other urban pilgrims i owe an especial debt i have alluded in this biography particularly to virginia woolf henry james aldous huxley joseph conrad george orwell hg wells and gk chesterton from other centuries the urban works of tobias smollett daniel defoe ben jonson and henry fielding have been a perpetual comfort and reward specific references are made to samuel selvons the lonely londoners london michael moorcocks mother london london iain sinclairs downriver london arthur morrisons a child of the jago london and elizabeth bowens the heat of the day london certain literary studies have also been immensely helpful there are many general works such as w kents london for the literary pilgrim london andrew daviess literary london london wb thresshings the london muse georgia and the book lovers london by a st john adcock london of more specific import are henry james and london by j kimmey new york and virginia woolfs london by d brewster london london transformed by m byrd deals primarily with the literary territory of the eighteenth century i owe an especial debt to j wolfreyss writing london london particularly for his perceptive remarks on carlyle and engels the early history of london is marked by speculation and controversy much of it is veiled in myth or legend and the enchantment can be glimpsed in legendary london early london in tradition and history by l spence london and prehistoric london its mounds and circles by eo gordon london the holy groves of britain by fj stuckey london is also of absorbing interest a more sober account is provided by n merriman in prehistoric london london which is complemented by fg parsonss the earlier inhabitants of london london the great antiquarian and scholar laurence gomme a true successor of john stow has written the governance of london london and the making of london london as well as the topography of london london for the deeper background i recommend celtic britain by c thomas london and the druids by s piggott london for the city of later date london city of the romans by r merrifield london is essential reading together with a shorter study by r merrifield and j hally entitled roman london london a more speculative account can be found in the london that was rome by m harrison london then later still the anglosaxons edited by j campbell london is the best general account the essays and articles in the journal of the london society are of great importance in the study of early london but the major source of archaeological information remains the london archaeologist the articles and site reports in that periodical are invaluable the medieval city has been the object of much study and all general histories of england survey its conditions contemporary documents sometimes provide haunting detail and they can be found in the chronicles of london edited by cl kingsford oxford the chronicles of richard of devizes edited by jt appleby london fifty early english wills edited by fj furnivall london the london eyre of edited by hm chew and m weinbaum london calendar of pleas and memoranda rolls of the city of london edited by ah thomas and pe jones london and liber albus of edited by ht riley london later historical studies

london london the shaping of a city by cnl brooke london london life in the fourteenth century by c pendrill london and g homes medieval london london especial mention must be made of l wrights sources of london english medieval thames vocabulary oxford which brings the reader right down to the reeking waterside accounts of sixteenthcentury london are of course dominated by stows a survey of london the edition by cl kingsford london is still the most authoritative more recent studies include elizabethan london by m holmes london worlds within worlds structures of life in sixteenthcentury london by s rappaport cambridge trade government and economy in preindustrial england edited by dc coleman and ah john london london and the reformation by s brigden oxford and the pursuit of stability social relations in elizabethan london by iw archer cambridge the diaries of john evelyn and of samuel pepys are of course essential for any understanding of seventeenthcentury london and macaulays history of england from the accession of james ii is still immensely readable but there are specific volumes of great interest among them london and the civil war edited by s porter london and the rebuilding of london after the great fire by tf reddaway london p earles a city full of people men and women of london london is a fascinating quarry l picards restoration london london provides a detailed synopsis of daily living it is complemented by the images within the cries and hawkers of london the engravings of marcellus laroon edited by s shesgreen aldershot which provide direct access to the streets and people of the late seventeenth century i have also made use of wenceslaus hollar by r godfrey new haven which provides different but no less interesting images e wards the london spy london comes at the end of the century but not at the end of a rich tradition of london low life sketches eighteenthcentury london is replete with source material from the poems and plays of john gay to the engravings of william hogarth any biography of samuel johnson or william blake will provide a vision of the city in its general and particular circumstances specific mention however might be made of j boswells london journal edited by fa pottle london the world of addison and steele can be discovered within the pages of selections from the tatler and the spectator edited by a ross london the best general survey of the period is md georges london life in the eighteenth century london while j summersons georgian london london will clarify the readers mind on architectural matters george rudés hanoverian london london remains a very important study of more specific interest is london in the age of industrialisation by ld schwarz cambridge while m wallers scenes from london life london provides an intimate picture of ordinary life crime death and punishment seem to emerge as objects of attention in eighteenthcentury london among the books devoted to them are p linebaughs the london hanged crime and civil society in eighteenthcentury london london and death and the metropolis by j landers cambridge of related interest is i mccalmans radical underworld cambridge john gays london by wh irving cambridge is precise and informative as is j uglows hogarth a life and a world london the latter biography can be read alongside the edition of hogarths graphic works edited with a commentary by r paulson london the godwins and the shelleys by w st clair london provides more interesting source material on radical london and s gardners the tyger the lamb and the terrible desart london provides an approximation of the blakean vision the nineteenthcentury city has been the object of fascinated enquiry ever since the nineteenth century itself major texts are of course those of henry mayhew and charles booth mayhews london labour and the london poor taken from articles in the morning chronicle and published in four volumes between and mingles anecdote with statistic in a characteristically midnineteenth century style yet it remains the single most important source for the manner and speech of the nineteenthcentury poor enlivened by mayhews eye for detail which can truly be described as dickensian the seventeen volumes of booths life and labour of the people of london are perhaps less colourful but no less sympathetic this was also the century for the great compilations of londons history by enthusiasts and antiquarians principal among them are the six volumes of old and new london edited by w thornbury and e walford london which moves from area to area like some great eagleeyed observer and c knights london in six volumes london which provides a series of long essays ranging in subject from prisons to beermaking to advertisements london a pilgrimage by blanchard jerrold and gustave doré london contains haunting images of the savagery and industry of imperial london an edition of george scharfs london with a text by p jackson london offers images of early nineteenthcentury london in a different tone and mode from those of doré there are many books upon the victorian poor but those i have found most useful include the rookeries of london by t beames london people of the rookery by dm green london and j hollingsheads ragged london in london f sheppards london the infernal wen london is also highly instructive in this context for a more romantic picture of the city it is worth looking at grandfathers london by oj morris london while dickenss london an imaginative vision london contains many rare and distinctive photographs of the period more can be discovered in old london by g bush london part of the archive photograph series there are also general histories the victorian city edited by hj dyos and m wolff london is invaluable together with dj olsens the growth of victorian london london the latter is particularly interesting for its account of the building work of the period culminating in the partial destruction of georgian london and the growth of the great new estates talliss london street views london helps to complete the picture london world city edited by celina fox london contains a valuable series of essays from science to architecture the making of modern london by g weightman and s humphries london should also be studied there are also many nineteenthand early twentiethcentury memoirs now practically forgotten but still an impressive and comprehensive account of the city known and unknown there are anecdotes and walks and rambles with titles like hv mortons the spell of london london cw heckthornes london memories and london souvenirs london and bygone london life by el apperson london and london revisited by ev lucas london the two volumes of a hares walks in london london are charming as well as erudite while wg bells unknown london london is a repository of secret urban knowledge from an earlier date come cm smiths the little world of london london and alephs london scenes and london people london et cooks highways and byways in london london affords similar nostalgic pleasures at camdenpratts unknown london london covers among other subjects newgate and the wool exchange while the west end of yesterday and today by eb chancellor london speaks for itself r nevills night life in london and paris london is in a similar category av comptonricketts the london life of yesterday london covers many centuries with a very light touch but particular mention should be made of another great london historian walter besant who published a number of volumes on the life and history of the city his south london london east london london london london medieval london london and london north of the thames london provide a diorama of urban history his bust is to be found beside the thames opposite northumberland avenue it is perhaps appropriate that at the beginning of the twentieth century there should also be a concentration of books on the occluded or darker aspects of the city london in shadow by b kennedy london is complemented by londons underworld by t holmes london one of the many studies devoted to the vagrant and the dispossessed at the turn of the century the atmosphere is deepened by s grahams london nights london a highly evocative study and rendered poignant by p normans london vanished and vanishing london ch rolphs london particulars london provides a detailed and not at all nostalgic memoir of the early decades while j schneers london new haven offers an overview of social and cultural developments at that time of transition a more optimistic version of urban commentary emerged in the face of london by hp clunn london the wonderful story of london edited by h wheeler london and a bushs portrait of london london one of the greatest of twentiethcentury accounts however remains london the unique city by se rasmussen london which seems to prove the familiar adage that foreign observers view london matters with a clear eye a guide to the structure of london by m ash bath is good on the intricacies of postwar planning docklands in the making by a cox london is a lively introduction to the phenomenon of the resurgent banks of the thames and takes its rightful place as part of the great survey of london which has been compiled over a period of one hundred years in a similar spirit focus on london london published by the office of national statistics is a source of reliable information the making of modern london by s humphries and j taylor london is required reading and is particularly good on the growth of the suburbs london by s harding london can be recommended together with london a new metropolitan geography edited by k hoggart and dr green london h

twentiethcentury studies of london among the best of which are s inwoods a history of london london a truly comprehensive and scholarly account of the city from its earliest times and r porters london a social history london which is more polemical in intent but no less readable landlords to london the story of a capital and its growth and the selling of mary davies by s jenkins london and are invaluable f sheppards london a social history oxford is concise and serious while m hebberts london chichester is colourful and idiosyncratic the most important guide to city architecture remains the pevsner series london the city of london edited by simon bradley and nikolaus pevsner london has brought it up to date and then of course there is the london encyclopaedia edited by b weinreb and c hibbert london which is a prodigy of research and reference there are also urban anthologies among them the oxford book of london edited by p bailey oxford and the faber book of london edited by an wilson london in which appear passages of prose and verse which might otherwise have languished in obscure and forgotten places the pride of london edited by w and s scott london is also useful an especial mention must be made of the three volumes london literary sources and documents edited by x baron london here are lamb and de quincey engels and dostoyevsky dekker and gay together with a hundred other observers and chroniclers of the city these volumes are an important and indeed indispensable guide to london through the centuries i have devoted some space in this biography to the
