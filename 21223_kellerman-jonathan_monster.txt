jonathan kellerman monster book in the alex delaware series to the memory of kenneth millar chapter the giant knew richard nixon towering yellowhaired grizzled a listing mountain in khaki twill he limped closer and milo tightened up i looked to frank dollard for a cue dollard appeared untroubled meaty arms at his sides mouth serene under the tobaccoed gray mustache his eyes were slits but theyd been that way at the main gate the giant belched out a bass laugh and brushed greasy hair away from his eyes his beard was a corncolored ruin i could smell him now vinegarish hormonally charged he had to be sixeight three hundred the shadow he threw on the dirt was ashcolored amoebic broad enough to shade us he took another lurching step and this time frank dollards right arm shot out the huge man didnt seem to notice just stood there with dollards limb flung across his waist maybe a dozen other men in khaki were out on the yard most of them standing still a few others pacing rocking faces pressed against the chain link no groups that i could see everyone to himself above them the sky was an untrammeled blue clouds broiled away by a vengeful sun i was cooking in my suit the giants face was dry he sighed dropped his shoulders and dollard lowered his arm the giant made a finger gun pointed it at us and laughed his eyes were dark brown pinched at the corners the whites too sallow for health secret service he thumped his chest victorias secret service in the closet underwear undercover always lookin out for the guy good old nixon rmn rimmin always rimmin wanting to be rimmed he liked to talk the walk cuttin outta the white house night house doing the party thing all hours with kurt vonnegut jd salinger the glass family anyone who didnt mind the politics heat of the kitchen i wrote cats cradle sold it to vonnegut for ten bucks billy bathgate typed the manuscript one time he walked out the front door got all the way to las vegas big hassle with the hells angels over some dollar slots vonnegut wanting to change the national debt rimmin agreed the angels got pissed we had to pull him out of it me and kurt vonnegut salinger wasnt there doctorow was sewing the cats cradle they were bad cats woulda assassinated him any day of the week leeway the oswald harvey he bent and lifted his left trouser leg below the knee was bone sheathed with glossy white scar tissue most of the calf meat ripped away an organic peg leg got shot protecting old rimmin he said letting go of the fabric he died anyway poor richard no almanac know what happened rimmed too hard i couldnt stop it chet said dollard stretching to pat the giants shoulder the giant shuddered little cherries of muscle rolled along miles jawline his hand was where his gun would have been if he hadnt checked it at the gate dollard said gonna make it to the tv room today chet the giant swayed a bit ahh i think you should make it to the tv room chet theres gonna be a movie on democracy were gonna sing the starspangled banner could use someone with a good voice yeah pavarotti said the giant suddenly cheerful he and domingo were at caesars palace they didnt like the way it worked out rimmin not doing his voice exercises lee lee lee lo lo lo no egg yolk to smooth the trachea it pissed pavarotti off he didnt want to run for public office yeah sure said dollard he winked at milo and me the giant had turned his back on all three of us and was staring down on the bare tan table of the yard a short thick darkhaired man had pulled down his pants and was urinating in the dirt setting off a tiny dust storm none of the other men in khaki seemed to notice the giants face had gone stony wet he said dont worry about it chet dollard said softly you know sharbno and his bladder the giant didnt answer but dollard must have transmitted a message because two other psych techs came jogging over from a far corner one black one white just as muscular as dollard but a lot younger wearing the same uniform of shortsleeved sport shirt jeans and sneakers photo badges clipped to the collar the heat and the run had turned the techs faces wet miles sport coat had soaked through at the armpits but the giant hadnt let loose a drop of sweat his face tightened some more as he watched the urinating man shake himself off then duckwalk across the yard pants still puddled around his ankles wet well handle it chet soothed dollard the black tech said ill go get those trousers up he sauntered toward sharbno the white tech stayed with chet dollard gave chet another pat and we moved on ten yards later i looked back both techs were flanking chet the giants posture had changedshoulders higher head craning as he continued to stare at the space vacated by sharbno milo said guy that size how can you control him we dont control him said dollard clozapine does last month his dosage got upped after he beat the crap out of another patient broke about a dozen bones maybe he needs even more said milo why he doesnt exactly sound coherent dollard chuckled coherent he glanced at me know what his daily dosage is doctor fourteen hundred milligrams even with his body weight thats pretty thorough wouldnt you say maximums usually around nine hundred i told milo lots of people do well on a third of that dollard said he was on eleven migs when he broke the other inmates face dollards chest puffed a bit we exceed maximum recommendations all the time the psychiatrists tell us its no problem he shrugged maybe chetll get even more if he does something else bad we covered more ground passing more inmates untrimmed hair slack mouths empty eyes stained uniforms none of the ironpumper bulk you see in prisons these torsos were soft warped deflated i felt eyes on the back of my head glanced to the side and saw a man with hauntedprophet eyes and a chestful of black beard staring at me above the facial pelt his cheeks were sunken and sooty our eyes engaged he came toward me arms rigid neck bobbing he opened his mouth no teeth he didnt know me but his eyes were rich with hatred my hands fisted i walked faster dollard noticed and cocked his head the bearded man stopped abruptly stood there hi the full sun planted like a shrub the red exit sign on the far gate was five hundred feet away dollards key ring jangled no other techs in sight we kept walking beautiful sky but no birds a machine began grinding something i said chefs ramblings there seems to be some intelligence there what cause he talks about books said dollard i think before he went nuts he was in college somewhere i think his family was educated what got him in here said milo glancing back same as all of them dollard scratched his mustache and kept his pace steady the yard was vast we were halfway across now passing more dead eyes frozen faces wild looks that set up the small hairs on the back of my neck dont wear khaki or brown milo had said the inmates wear that we dont want you stuck in therethough that would be interesting wouldnt it shrink trying to convince them hes not crazy same as all of them i said incompetent to stand trial said dollard your basic how many do you have here said milo twelve hundred or so old chets case is kinda sad he was living on top of a mountain down near the mexican bordersome kind of hermit deal sleeping in caves eating weeds all that good stuff couple of hikers just happened to be unlucky enough to find the wrong cave wrong time woke him up he tore em upreally went at em with his bare hands he actually managed to rip both the girls arms off and was working on one of her legs when they found him some park ranger or sheriff shotgunned chets leg charging in thats why it looks like that he wasnt resisting arrest just sitting there next to the body pieces looking scared someone was gonna hit him no big challenge getting a on something like that hes been here three years first six months he did nothing but stay curled up crying sucking his thumb we hadtoivfeedhim now he beats people up said milo progress dollard flexed his fingers he was in his late fifties husky and sunburnt no visible body fat the lips beneath the mustache were thin parched amused what do you want we should do haul him out and shoot him milo grunted dollard said yeah i know what youre thinking good riddance to bad rubbish youd be happy to be on the firing squad he chuckled cop thinking i worked patrol in hemet for ten years woulda said the exact same thing before i came here couple of years on the wards and now i know reality some of them really are sick he touched his mustache old chets no ted bundy he couldnt help himself any more than a baby crapping its diaper same with old sharbno back there pissing in the dirt he tapped his temple the wirings screwy some people just turn to garbage and this place is the dumpster exactly why were here said milo dollard raised an eyebrow that i dont know about our garbage doesnt get taken out i cant see how were gonna be able to help you on dr argent he flexed his fingers again his nails were yellow horn i liked dr argent real nice lady but she met her end out there he pointed randomly out in the civilized world did you work with her not steadily we talked about cases from time to time shed tell me if a patient needed something but you can tell about people nice lady a little naive but she was new naive in what way she started this group skills for daily living weekly discussions supposedly helping some guys cope with the world as if any of em are ever getting out she ran it by herself her and a tech whos the tech girl named heidi ott two women handling a group of killers dollard smiled the state says its safe you think different im not paid to think we neared the chainlink wall milo said any idea why someone in the civilized world would kill dr argent speaking as an excop dollard said from what you told methe way you found her in that car trunk all cleaned upid say some sociopath right someone who knew damn well what he was doing and enjoyed it more of a than a your basic lowlife criminal trying to fake being crazy cause theyre under the mistaken impression itll be easier here than in jail weve got two three hundred of those on the fifth floor maybe a few more cause of three strikes they come here ranting and drooling smearing shit on the walls learn quickly they cant bs the docs here less than one percent succeed the official eval periods ninety days but plenty of them ask to leave sooner did dr argent work on the fifth floor nope hers were all s besides total crazies and ninetyday losers who else do you have here said milo weve got a few mentally disordered sex offenders left said dollard pedophiles that kind of trash maybe thirty of em we used to have more but they keep changing the law stick em here nope the prison system oops back here unhuh prison dr argent didnt hang with them either least that i noticed so the way you see it what happened to her couldnt relate to her work here you got it even if one of her guys got outand they didntnone of them couldve killed her and stashed her in the trunk none of them could plan that well we were at the gate tan men standing still like oversized chess pieces the faraway machine continued to grind dollard flicked a hand back at the yard im not saying these guys are harmless even with all the dope we pump into them get these poor bastards delusional enough they could do anything but they dont kill for funfrom what ive seen they dont take much pleasure from life period if you can even call what theyre doing living he cleared his throat swallowed the phlegm makes you wonder why god would take the trouble to create such a mess chapter two corpses in car trunks claire argent was the second the first found eight months earlier was a twentyfiveyearold wouldbe actor named richard dada left in the front storage compartment of his own vw bug in the industrial zone north of centinela and picoa warren of toolanddie shops auto detailers spareparts dealers it took three days for dadas car to be noticed a maintenance worker picked up the smell the crime scene was walking distance from the west la substation but milo drove over to the scene in life dada had been tall dark and handsome the killer stripped off his clothes bisected him cleanly at the waist with a toothedged weapon dropped each segment in a heavyduty black plastic lawn bag fastened the sacks stashed them in the volkswagen drove to the dump spot most probably late at night and escaped without notice cause of death was loss of blood from a deep wide throat slash lack of gore in the bags and in the car said the butchery had been accomplished somewhere else the coroner was fairly certain dada was already dead when cut in half long legs milo said the first time he talked to me about the case so maybe cutting him solved a storage problem or it was part of the thrill or both i said he frowned dadas eyes were taken out too but no other mutilation any ideas the killer drove dadas car to the dump spot i said so he couldve left on foot and lives close by or he took the bus and you could interview drivers see if any unusual passengers got on that night ive already talked to the bus drivers no memory of any conspicuously weird passengers same for taxi drivers no latenight pickups in the neighborhood period by unusual i didnt mean weird i said the killer probably isnt bizarrelooking id guess just the opposite composed a good planner middleclass even so having just dumped the vw he mightve been a little worked up who rides the bus at that hour mostly nightshift busboys and office cleaners a few derelicts someone middleclass might be conspicuous makes sense he said but there was no one who stuck in any of the drivers memories okay then the third possibility there was another car ready to take the killer away extremely careful planning or an accomplice milo rubbed his face like washing without water we were at his desk in the robberyhomicide room at the west la station facing the bright orange lockers drinking coffee a few other detectives were typing and snacking i had a childcustody court appearance downtown in two hours had stopped by for lunch but milo had wanted to talk about dada rather than eat the accomplice bit is interesting he said so is the local angleokay time to do some footwork see if some joker who learned freelance meatcutting at san quentin is out on parole get to know more about the poor kid toosee if he got himself in trouble three months later milos footwork had unearthed the minutiae of richard dadas life but had gotten him no closer to solving the case at the halfyear mark the file got pushed to the back of the drawer i knew milos nerves were rubbed raw by that his specialty was clearing cold cases not creating them he had the highest solve rate of any homicide d in west la maybe the entire department for this year that didnt make him any more popular as the only openly gay detective on the force hed never be invited to bluebuddy barbecues but it did provide insurance and i knew he regarded failure as professionally threatening as a personal sin too one of the last things hed said before filing the murder book was this one deserves more some felonious cretin getting bashed with a pool cue is one thing but this the way the kid was slicedthe spine was sheared straight through alex coroner says probably a band saw someone cut him neat and clean the way they section meat any other forensic evidence i said nope no foreign hairs no fluid exchange as far as ive been able to tell dada wasnt in any kind of trouble no drug connections bad friends criminal history just one of those stupid kids who wanted to be rich and famous days and weekends he worked at a kiddie gym nights he did guess what waited tables his index finger scored imaginary chalk marks bar and grill in toluca lake closest he got to delivering lines was probably what kind of dressing would you like with that we were in a bar ourselves a nice one at the rear of the luxe hotel on the west end of beverly hills no pool cues and any felons were wearing italian suits chandeliers dimmed to orange flicker spongy carpets club chairs warm as wombs on our marbletopped drink stand were two leaden tumblers of chivas gold and a crystal pitcher of iced spring water milos cheap panatela asserted itself rudely with the cohibas and churchills being sucked in corner booths a few months later the city said no smoking in bars but back then nicotine fog was an evening ritual all the trim notwithstanding the reason for being there was to ingest alcohol and milo was doing a good job of that i nursed my first scotch as he finished his third and chased it with a glassful of water i got the case because the lieutenant assumed dada was gay the mutilation when homosexuals freak they go all the way blah blah blah but dada had absolutely no links to the gay community and his folks say he had three girlfriends back home any girlfriends out here none that ive found he lived alone in a little studio place near la brea and sunset tiny but he kept it neat that can be a dicey neighborhood i said yeah but the building had a keycard parking lot and a security entrance the landlady lives on the premises and tries to keep a good clientele she said dada was a quiet kid she never saw him entertain visitors and no signs of a breakin or any burglary we havent recovered his wallet but no charges have been run up on the one credit card he owned a discover with a four hundred dollar limit the apartment was clean of dope if dada did use he or someone cleaned up every speck the killer i said that fits with the clean cut and the planning possibly but like i said dada lived neat his rent was seven hundred he took home twice that a month from both jobs sent most of his money back home to a savings account his big shoulders dropped maybe he just ran into the wrong psychopath the fbi says eye mutilation implies more than a casual relationship sent the fbi the crimescene data questionnaire got back doubletalk and a recommendation to look for known associates problem is i cant locate any friends dada had hed only been out in california for nine months maybe working two jobs prevented a social life or he had a life he hid what he was gay i think i wouldve unearthed that alex not necessarily gay i said any kind of secret life what makes you say that model tenants just dont walk out on the street and get sawed in half he growled we drank the waitresses were all gorgeous blondes wearing white peasant blouses and long skirts ours had an accent czechoslovakia shed told milo when he asked then shed offered to clip his cigar but hed already bitten off the tip it was the middle of the summer but a gas fire was raging under a limestone mantel airconditioning kept the room icy a couple of other beauties at the bar had to be hookers the men with them looked edgy toluca lake is a drive from hollywood i said its also near the burbank studios so maybe dada was trying to make acting connections thats what i figured but if he got a job it wasnt at a studio i found a want ad from the weekly in the pocket of one of his jackets tiny print thing open casting call for some flick called blood walk the date was one month before he was killed i tried to trace the company that placed the ad the number was disconnected but it had belonged at that time to some outfit called thin line productions that traced to a listing with an answering service which no longer serviced thin line the address they had was a fob in venice long gone no forwarding no one in hollywoods heard of thin line the scripts never been registered with any of the guilds no evidence a movie ever got made i talked to petra connor over in hollywood she says par for the course the industrys full of flybynights most casting calls go nowhere blood walk i said yeah i know but it was a full month before and i cant take it any further what about richards other job wheres the kiddie gym pico and doheny whatd he do there played games with toddlers irregular work mostly birthday parties the gym owner said he was greatpatient cleancut polite he shot back whiskey goddamn boy scout and he gets bisected there has to be more some homicidal toddler who resented waiting in line for the moon bounce he laughed studied the bottom of his glass you said he sent money home i said wheres that denver dads a carpenter mom teaches school they came out for a few days after he was killed salt of the earth hurting bad but no help richard played sports got bs and cs acted in all the school plays did two years in junior college hated it went to work for his father so hes got carpentry skillsmaybe he met the killer at some woodworking class he never went to classes of any type that i can find a carpenters kid and he gets bandsawed i said he put down his glass careful to do it silently his eyes fixed on me normally startling green they were graybrown in the tobacco light his heavy face was so pale it looked talced white as his sideburns the acne pits that scored his cheeks and chin and brow seemed deeper crueler he pushed black hair off his forehead okay he said very softly besides exquisite irony what does it mean i dont know i said it just seems too cute he frowned rolled his forearm along the edge of the table as if rubbing an itch raised his glass for a refill thanked the waitress when he got it sipped his way through half the whiskey and licked his lips why are we even talking about it im not gonna close this one soon if ever i can just feel it i didnt bother arguing his hunches are usually sound two months later he caught the claire argent homicide and called me right away sounding furious but sparked by enthusiasm got a new one some interesting similarities to dada but different too female vie thirtynineyearold psychologist named claire argentknow her by any chance no home address in the hollywood hills just off woodrow wilson drive but she was found in west la territory stripped naked and stashed in the trunk of her buick regal back of the loading dock behind the stereos galore in that big shopping center on la cienega near sawyer that side of la cienega was west las eastern border barely in your territory yeah santa loves me heres what i know so far the shopping center closes at eleven but theres no fence at the dock anyone can pull in there real easy access because an alley runs right behind west of the alley is a supplementary indoor lot multiple levels but its closed off at night after that its all residential private homes and apartments no one heard or saw a thing shipping clerk found the car at six am called for a tow and when the driver winched it up he heard something rolling around inside and had the smarts to worry about it was she cut in half i said no left in one piece but wrapped in two garbage bags just like dada her throat was slashed too and her eyes were mangled mangled how chopped into hamburger but not removed no he said irritably if my storage theory about richard is correct it would explain why she wasnt cut in half dr argent was fivefive folded easily into the buick and guess where she worked alex starkweather hospital really i said ghoul central ever been there no i said no reason none of my patients ever killed anyone chapter in the spring of emil rudolph starkweather died in his bed in azusa at the age of seventysix unmarried leaving no heirs having dedicated fifty years to public service ten as a water and power engineer forty as a state senator tightfisted in every other regard starkweather campaigned relentlessly for mentalhealth funding and pushed through construction of scores of community treatment centers throughout the state some said living with and caring for a psychotic sister had made him a oneissue humanist the sister died five months before starkweathers massive nocturnal coronary soon after her burial starkweathers health seemed to rot away not long after his funeral state auditors discovered that the veteran senator had systematically embezzled four decades of campaign funds for personal use some of the money had been spent on the sisters twentyfourhour nursing care and medical bills but most went into real estate starkweather had amassed an empire of over eleven thousand california acres primarily vacant lots in rundown neighborhoods that he never developed no racehorses no swiss accounts no secret mistresses no apparent profit motive of any kind people started questioning emil starkweathers mental health the rumors intensified when the will was made public starkweather had bequeathed everything to the state of california with one proviso at least one hundred acres of his land was to be used for construction of a major mental hygiene facility that takes into account the latest research and progress in psychiatry and allied disciplines legal experts opined that the document was probably worthless but the knots starkweather had tied might take years to unravel in court yet in one sense the timing was perfect for the newly elected governor no admirer of starkweatherwhom hed long considered an annoying eccentric old farthed campaigned as a crimecrusher condemning revolvingdoor justice that spat dangerous maniacs back onto the street frenzied consultations with legislative bosses produced a plan that cut through the morass and aides were dispatched from sacramento to search for worthless publicly owned real estate the perfect solution emerged quickly a longunused parcel of county land well east of the la city line once a gas company fuel station then a garbage dump now a toxic swamp poisoned soil pollutants seeping past bedrock only eightynine acres but who was counting through a combination of executive order and rammedthrough legislation starkweathers purloined plots reverted to the state and construction of a major mental hygiene facility for criminals judged incompetent to stand trial was authorized secure housing for spree murderers blood drinkers cannibals sodomizers childrapers chanting zombies anyone too crazy and too dangerous for san quentin or folsom or pelican bay it was an odd time to build a new hospital state asylums for the retarded and the harmlessly psychotic were being closed down in rapid succession courtesy of an odd coldhearted alliance between rightwing misers who didnt want to spend the money and leftwing ignoramuses who believed psychotics were political prisoners and deserved to be liberated a few years later a homeless problem would appear shocking the deacons of thrift and the social engineers but at the time dismantling an entire inpatient system seemed a clever thing to do still the governors storage bin for maniacs went up in two years he stuck the old farts name on it starkweather state hospital for the criminally insane was one main buildinga fivestory cementblock and gray stucco tower hemmed by twentyfoothigh electrified barbedwire chain link streaked with mineral deposits and etched by pollutive grime punitively ugly wed gotten off the freeway sped past boyle heights and several miles of industrial park traversed a series of dormant oil wells frozen like giant mantis specimens greasygray slaughterhouses and packing plants abandoned freight yards several more empty miles that stank of stillborn enterprise here we go said milo pointing to a narrow tongue of asphalt labeled starkweather drive another sign said state facility ahead the road drew the unmarked into a graygreen fringe of eucalyptus maybe seventy trees deep that blessed us with mentholated shade before we reemerged into the august sun and a white glare so piercing it rendered my sunglasses useless up ahead was the high fencing electric cables thick and black as water snakes a collection of english and spanish warning signs in approved state colors presaged a glassedin booth and a steel gate arm the guard was a chunky young man of indeterminate mood who slid open a window listened to milos explanation took his time coming out he examined our id with what seemed like pain took all the papers back to his glass closet returned asked how many firearms or knives we were carrying and confiscated milos service revolver and my swiss army knife several minutes later the gate opened very slowly and milo drove through hed been unusually quiet during the trip now he looked uneasy dont worry i said youre not wearing khaki theyll let you out if you dont say too much he snorted what he was wearing was an old maroon hopsack blazer gray widewale cords gray shirt wrinkled black poly tie scuffed beige desert boots with soles the color of pencil erasers he needed a haircut black cowlicks danced atop his big head the contrast with the nowwhite sideburns was too strong yesterday hed made some comment about being mr skunk the road tilted upward before flattening we came to an outdoor parking lot nearly full then more chain link broad stretches of earth yellowtinged and sulfurous behind the fence stood a solidlooking man in a plaid sport shirt and jeans the sound of the unmarked made him turn and study us milo said our welcoming party and began searching for a spot why the hell would anyone want to work here are you asking in general or about dr argent both but yeah her what would make her choose this it was the day after hed called me and i hadnt yet seen the argent file theres something for everyone i said also managed cares tightened things up could be she had no choice she had plenty of choice she quit a research position at county general neurosomething maybe she was doing research here too maybe he said but her job title was psychologist ii pure civil service and the directorsome guy named swig didnt mention research why would she quit county for this youre sure she wasnt fired her exboss at county told me she quit dr theobold myron theobold him you know met him a few times at faculty meetings what else did he say not much like he didnt know her well or maybe he was holding back maybe you should talk to him sure he spotted an opening swung in sharply hit the brakes hard yanking off his seat belt he looked through the windshield the man in the plaid shirt had unlocked the second fence and come closer he waved milo returned the gesture fifties gray hair and mustache milo pulled his jacket from the backseat and pocketed his keys gazed beyond the man in the plaid shirt at the chainlink desert she spent eight hours a day here with deranged murderous assholes and now shes deadwouldnt you call this place a detectives happy hunting ground chapter dollard unlocked the rear gate and took us out of the yard and across a short cement path the gray building appeared like a storm cloudimmense flatroofed slabfaced no steps no ramp just brown metal doors set into the block at ground level small sharpedged letters said starkweather main bldg rows of tiny windows checked the cement no bars across the panes the glass looked unusually dull filmed over not glass plastic thick shatterproof windwhipped nearly opaque perhaps clouded minds gained nothing from a clear view the doors were unlocked dollard shoved the right one open the reception area was cool small ripe with a broiledmeat smell pinkbeige walls and black linoleum blanched under bluewhite fluorescence overhead airconditioning ducts emitted a sound that could have been whispering a heavyset bespectacled woman in her thirties sat behind two old wooden desks arranged in an l talking on the phone she wore a sleeveless yellow knit top and a picture badge like dollards two desk plaques rule one im always right rule two refer to rule one and l schmitz between them was a stack of brochures her phone had a dozen lines four lights blinked on the wall behind the desk hung a color photo of emil starkweather flashing a campaign smile full of bridgework above that a banner solicited employee contributions for toys for tots and the united way to the left a small sagging shelf of athletic trophies and group photos trumpeted the triumphs of the hurlers starkweather hosp staff bowling team first prize for seven years out often off to the right stretched a long bright hallway punctuated by bulletin boards and more brown doors dollard stepped up to the desk l schmitz talked a bit more finally got off morning frank morning lindeen these gentlemen are mr swigs ten oclock hes still on a call should be right with you coffee no thanks said dollard checking his watch should be soon frank milo picked up two brochures and gave one to me lindeen watched him then got back on the phone and did a lot of uhhuhing the next time she put down the receiver she said youre the police about dr argent right yes maam said milo hovering by the desk did you know her just hello and goodbye terrible thing she returned to the phone milo stuck around for a few more minutes lindeen looked up once to smile at him but didnt interrupt her conversation he gave me a pamphlet we both read brief history of starkweather state hospital then a boldtype statement of purpose lots of photos more shots of emil the embezzler the governor breaking ground with a goldtipped shovel flanked by nameless dignitaries construction chronology from excavation to completion cranes earth movers hardhatted worker ants finally a long view of the building set against a gorgeous sky that looked as false as starkweathers chompers the block walls were already stained the hospital had looked weary on its birthdate the mission statement was written by william t swig mph director and it stressed humane treatment of inmates while safeguarding the public lots of talk about goals directives objectives interfaces who taught bureaucrats how to write i folded the brochure and slipped it in my pocket just as lindeen said okeydoke hes free we followed dollard down the hall a few of the brown doors bore name signs in slideout slots most were blank the bulletin boards were layered with state paper notices legislation regulation no other people walked the corridor i realized the place was silent except for the sibilance from the ducts above us swigs door was no different from the rest his sign no more permanent dollard knocked once and opened without waiting for a reply outer office another receptionist older and heavier than lindeengo right in frank three vases of huge yellow roses obviously homegrown sat on her desk her pc monitor featured a mona lisa screen saver smiling frowning smiling frowning dollard pushed through to the inner sanctum swig was on his feet with his hand out as we entered he was younger than id expected maybe thirtyfive sparely built with a soft round baby face under a bald dome and several ominous moles on his cheeks and chin what little hair he did have was blond and cottony he wore a shortsleeved blue shirt plaid tie navy slacks moccasin loafers bill swig introductions all around swigs hand was cool and smallboned his desk was a bit larger than his secretarys but not by much no joke plaques here just a penandpencil set books and folders several standing picture frames their felt backs to us a photo on the righthand wall showed swig in a dark suit with a curlyhaired pointychinned woman and two pretty girls around four and six both asian a few books and lots of rubberbanded paper in a single case swigs plastic window offered an oily view of the yard dollard said anything else swig said no thanks frank and dollard hurried out please sit sorry to keep you waiting tragedy dr argent im still shocked i guess youd be a hard one to shock sir said milo swig looked confused working here said milo the things you see oh no not really detective sturgis this is generally a peaceful place probably safer than the streets of la especially since the airconditionings fixed no im as shockable as anyone the airconditioning we had a problem said swig the condensers went out a few years ago before i arrived he raised his hands palms up my predecessor couldnt get them fixed as you might imagine the comfort of our patients isnt a high priority in sacramento staff attritions what finally did it people started quitting i filed a report we finally got a new system todays a perfect examplecan you imagine it without ac how did the inmates handle it swig sat back it was a bit of a challenge so how can i help you any ideas about dr argents murder swig shook his head i can understand your thinking it might be workrelated but i term that impossible because of one simple fact dr argents patients are here and she was murdered out there he pointed at the window add to that the fact that her tenure was totally troublefree and theres nothing to work with is there model employee i was very impressed with her calm level thoughtful everyone liked her including the patients that makes the patients sound rational said milo pardon the patients liked her so they wouldnt hurt her i thought the men here didnt operate out of any logical motive pattern so whats to say one of them didnt hear a voice telling him to cut dr argents throat no mention of the eyes he was keeping that confidential swig tightened his lips yes well they are psychotic but most of them are very well maintained but whats the difference the main point is they dont leave here milo took out his pad and scrawled for a while that almost always gets a reaction swig raised his eyebrows they were pale blond nearly invisible and the movement created two crescentshaped wrinkles above his clear blue eyes milos pen stopped moving he said no one ever gets out swig shifted in his chair i wont tell you never but very very rarely how rare only two percent even attempt to obtain release and most of those never make it past our review committee of those who are reviewed perhaps five percent succeed in obtaining conditional release that means placement in wellsupervised board and care regular outpatient treatment and random urinalysis to monitor medication compliance additionally they must continue to show absolutely no symptoms of dangerous decompensation any minor infraction lands them back here of those who do leave the revocation rate is still eighty percent since ive been here never has a released patient committed a violent felony so for all practical purposes its a nonissue how long have you been here five years before that before that there were a few problems so said milo scanning his notes with so few men released it should be easy enough to track those whove gotten out swig clapped his hands together very softly yes but that would require a court order even our men have rightsfor example we cant monitor their mail without clear evidence of infraction you can dose them but no snooping the difference is that dosing them is for their own good swig wheeled his chair forward look im not trying to make your job difficult detective but i really dont get this line of questioning i can understand your initial assumption dr argent worked with dangerous individuals and now shes been murdered on the face of it thats logical but as i said its probably safer at starkweather than on your beat so youre telling me i need to file papers to find out whos been released im afraid so believe me if there was some obvious risk dont you think id let you know if only for our sake we cant afford errors okay said milo with an ease that made me glance at him lets move on what can you tell me about dr argents personality i didnt know her well said swig but she was competent quiet businesslike no conflicts with staff or patients he picked up a folder and scanned the contents heres something i can give you her personnel file thank you sir milo took it and handed it to me and resumed jotting notes inside were claire argents job application an abbreviated resume and a headshot photo the resume was five pages thick several published studies neuropsychology reaction time in alcoholics solid journals a clinical appointment as a lecturer why had she quit to come here the picture revealed a pretty slightly broad face brightened by a shy halfsmile thick dark hair shoulderlength flipped at the edges feathery bangs white hairband baby blue crewneck top clear skin very little makeup big dark eyes the first adjective that came to my mind was wholesome maybe a little too ingenue for someone her age though she looked closer to thirty than the thirtynine established by her birthdate no date on the photo so maybe it had been snapped years earlier shed gotten her phd ten years ago graduation shot i continued to study her face the eyes were lustrous warmher best feature now mangled someones trophy im afraid i cant tell you much said swig weve got a staff of over a hundred including more than twenty psychologists and psychiatrists the others are psych techs like mr dollard techs nonpsychiatric physicians nurses pharmacists secretaries cooks plumbers electricians custodians and you dont know if any of them had some kind of relationship with dr argent away from work im afraid not did she work with any staff members consistently id have to check on that please do certainly it will take a few days milo took the file from me opened it flipped pages i appreciate your letting us have this mr swig when i saw her she looked quite different as if warding off the comment swig turned to me youre a psychologist dr delaware forensic clinical i do occasional consulting have you worked much with dangerous psychotics i rotated through atascadero as an intern but thats about it atascadero must have been pretty tough back then tough enough i said yes he said before us they were the toughest place now theyre handling mostly mdsos sex offenders his tone was dismissive you have some of them too right said milo a few said swig incorrigibles who happened to come up for sentencing when the lawoftheweek said hospitalization nowadays they go to jail we havent accepted any in years that made the hospital sound like a college i said are the sex offenders housed with the regular population or up on the top floor with the s swig touched one of his moles regular population the s are a completely different situation theyre boarders not residents the court orders us to screen them we keep them totally isolated on the fifth floor bad influences on the s said milo swig laughed i dont think the s can be influenced too easily no its all the traffic and the escape risk they come in and out on sheriffs buseswhat they really want isnt treatment its out he sat back touched some of the moles on his face fingering them carefully like a blind man reading braille were talking about malingering criminals who think they can drool and avoid san quentin we evaluate them ship them back his voice had climbed and his skin had pinkened sounds like a hassle i said its a distraction from our main goal milo said managing the s treating insane murderers and keeping them invisible from the public every one of our men has committed the proverbial senseless crime on the outside you hear nonsense like anyone who kills has to be crazy doctor you of course know thats garbage most murderers are perfectly sane our men are the exception they terrify the publicthe apparent randomness of their crimes they have motives but not the kind the public can relate to im sure you understand dr delaware voices in the head i said exactly its like sausage making the less the public knows about what we do the better off we and the public are thats why i hope claires murder doesnt put us in the spotlight no reason for that said milo the sooner i clear the case the faster im out of your life swig nodded and worried another mole is there anything else what specifically did dr argent do here what any psychologist would do behavior modification plans for individual patients some counseling some group worktruthfully i dont know the details i heard she ran a group called skills for daily living yes said swig she asked permission to start that a few months ago why if the men dont get out starkweathers also an environment it needs to be dealt with how many men were in the group i have no idea the clinical decisions were hers id like to meet with them why in case they know something they dont said swig how could theyno im afraid i cant let you do that too disruptive im not sure any of them even realize what happened to her are you going to tell them that would be a clinical decision made by who the clinician in chargeprobably one of our senior psychiatrists now if thats all one more thing said milo dr argent had a good position at county hospital any idea why she switched jobs swig allowed himself a small smile what youre really asking is why would she leave the glorious world of academic medicine for our little snakepit during her job interview she told me she wanted a change of pace i didnt discuss it further i was happy to have someone with her qualifications come aboard did she say anything else during the interview that would help me swigs mouth puckered tight he picked up a pencil and tapped the desktop she was very quietnot shy more like selfpossessed but pleasantvery pleasant its a terrible thing that happened to her he stood we did too milo thanked him i wish i could do more detective actually said milo we wouldnt mind taking a look aroundjust to get a feel for the place i promise not to disrupt anyone clinically but maybe i could chat with some of the staff dr argent worked with the white eyebrows climbed again sure why not swig opened the door to the front room his secretary was arranging roses letty he said please call phil hatterson down detective sturgis and dr delaware are going to get a little tour chapter phil hatterson was short pearshaped middleaged with silly putty features and thinning brown hair his mousecolored mustache was feathery and offered no shelter to plump dark lips pleased to meet you he said offering the firm pumping handshake of a club chairman his eyes were hazel alert and inquisitive but softlike those of a tame deer his shirt and pants were khaki we followed him at a distance first floors all offices he said cheerfully his walk was oddsmall neat dancelike steps that forced us to slow down not docs offices just administration the docs circulate through offices on the wards his smile begged for approval i managed an upturned lip milo wasnt having any part of it toward the end of the hall at the right were two doublewidth elevators one keyoperated that said staff only the other with a call button which hatterson pushed milo watched hatterson intently i knew exactly what he was thinking the inmates run the asylum the elevator didnt respond but hatterson was unbothered bouncing on his feet like a kid waiting for dessert no floornumber guide above the doors no grinding gears then a voice came out of the wallout of a small square of steel mesh surrounding the button yes male voice electronically detached hatterson phillip duane id five two one six eight you just let me down to see administrator swig administrator swig just called to authorize me back up hold on three beats where you heading just up to two ive got two gentlemen taking a toura police officer and a doctor hold on the voice repeated seconds later the elevator doors slid open hatterson said after you sirs wondering whom i was turning my back on i complied the lift was walled with thick foam interior key lock sicklysweet disinfectant permeated the foam the doors closed as we rose hatterson said up up and away he was standing in the middle of the car id pressed myself into a corner and so had milo the elevator let us out into another pinkbeige hallway brown double doors with plastic windows key locks wall speaker similar to that near the elevator a sign above the door said a ward hatterson pushed a button talked to someone and the doors clicked open at first glance the second floor resembled any hospital ward except for a nursing station completely encased by plastic a sign said med line form here no pushing three whiteuniformed women sat inside talking nearby a gurney was pushed to the wall brown stains on white cotton sheeting the same black linoleum and brown doors as the first floor very low ceilingsno higher than seven feet khakid figures roamed the halls many of the taller inmates stooped so did some short men a few inmates sat on white plastic benches bolted to the floor others rocked in place several just stood there the arms of the chairs were drilled through with oneinchdiameter holes handcuff slots i tried to look around without being conspicuous black men white men brown men yellow men young men with surferblond hair and testosterone posture callow enough for acne but ancient around the eyes old men with toothless cavedin faces and hyperactive tongues gapejawed catatonics ragged muttering apparitions not much different from any westside panhandler some of the men like hatterson looked relatively normal every one of them had destroyed human life we passed them enduring a psychotic gauntlet receiving a full course of stares hatterson paid no notice as he dancestepped us through one of the young ones smirked and took a step forward patchy hair and chin beard swastika tattoo on his forearm white welted scars on both wrists he swayed and smiled sang something tuneless and moved on a hispanic man with a braid dangling below his belt drank from a paper cup and coughed as we neared splashing pink liquid someone passed wind someone laughed hatterson sped up a bit so many brown doors marked only by numbers most bore small latched rectangles peephole covers halfway down the hall two black men with matted hair careless dreadlocksfaced each other from opposite sides from a distance their stance mimicked a conversation but as we got closer i saw that their faces werent moving and their eyes were distant and dead the man on the right had his hand in his fly and i could see rapid movement beneath the khaki hatterson noticed it too and gave a prissy look a few feet away an avuncular type seventyish whitehaired as emil starkweather wearing rimless eyeglasses and a white cardigan sweater over his beige shirtleaned against the wall reading the christian science monitor someone cried out someone laughed the air was frigid a good deal colder than down in swigs office we passed an obese grayhaired man sitting on a bench soft arms as thick as my thighs face flushed and misshapen like an overripe melon he sprang up and suddenly his face was in mine blowing hot sour breath if youre lost thats the way out he pointed to one of the brown doors before i could respond a young woman appeared and took him by the elbow he said if youre lost the woman said its okay ralph no ones lost if youre lost thats enough ralph sharp voice now ralph hung his head the woman wore a greenstriped badge that said h ott pti claires grouptherapy tech she wore a longsleeved chambray shirt rolled to the elbows and tucked into snug jeans that showed off a tight shape not a large womanfivesix and smallboned she looked maybe twentyfive too young to wield authority her dishwater hair was gathered in a tight knot exposing a long face slightly heavy in the jaw with strong symmetrical features she had wideset blue eyes the clear rosy complexion of a farm girl ralph had six inches and at least a hundred and fifty pounds on her he remained in her grasp looking remorseful okay now she told him why dont you go rest she rotated him her body moved smoothly taut curves small bust long smooth neck i could see her playing volleyball on the beach what did the men in khaki see ralph tried again if youre lost thats the way his voice caught on the last word heidi ott said no ones lost louder firmer a tear fell from ralphs eye heidi ott gave him a gentle push and he shuffled off a few of the other men had watched but most seemed oblivious sorry she said to us he thinks hes a tour guide the blue eyes settled on hatterson keeping busy phil hatterson drew himself up im giving them a tour miss ott this is detective sturgis from the lapd and this is a doctorsorry i forgot your name sir delaware heidi ott said pleased to meet you hatterson said the thing about ralph is he used to cruise the freeways pick up people having car trouble hed offer to help them and then hed phil said heidi ott you know we respect each others privacy hatterson let out a small tight bark pursed his lips annoyed not regretful sorry heidi ott turned to milo youre here about dr argent her lips pushed together and paled young skin but tension caused it to pucker yes maam said milo you worked with her didnt you i worked with a group she ran we had contact about several other patients the blue eyes blinked twice less force in her voice now she seemed her age milo said when you have a chance id like to screams and thumps came from behind us my head whipped around the two dreadlocked men were on the floor a double dervish rolling punching clawing biting moving slowly deliberately silently like pit bulls other men started to cheer the old man with the christian science monitor slapped his knee and laughed only phil hatterson seemed frightened hed gone white and seemed to be searching for a place to hide heidi ott snapped a whistle out of her pocket blew hard and marched toward the fighters suddenly two male techs were at her side the three of them broke up the fight within seconds the dreadlocked men were hauled to their feet one was bleeding from his left cheek the other bore a scratch on his forearm neither breathed hard both looked calm almost serene the old man with the newspaper said by golly fuck heidi took the bleeder by the arm and led him to the nurses station buttonpush click and she received something from a slot in the front window swabs and antibiotic cream as she ministered to the bleeder some of the men in khaki began to come alive shifting position flexing arms looking in all directions the hallway smelled of aggression phil hatterson sidled closer to milo milo stared him still his hands were fisted one of the male techs a short husky filipino said okay everyone just settle down now the hallway went quiet hatterson gave out a long loud exhalation i hate when stupid stuff happens whats the point heidi hustled the bleeder around the nursing station and out of sight hatterson said gentlemen and we resumed our tour most of his color had returned i wouldnt have picked him for any pathology worse than oily obsequiousness eddie haskell misplaced among the lunatics annoying but coherent i knew many psychotics were helped mightily by drugs could this be chemistry at its best he said heres my favorite place the tv room the ward had ended and we were facing the open doorway of a large bright space filled with plastic chairs a bigscreen tv stood at the front like an altar hatterson said the way we choose what to watch is with democracyeveryone who wants to vote votes the majority rules its pretty peacefulpicking shows i mean i like news but i dont get to watch it too often but i also like sports and almost everyone votes for sports so its okay theres our mailbox he pointed to a hard plastic box fastened to the wall rounded edges chainlocked our mails private unless theres a mitigating circumstance such as i said the question frightened him someone acts out does that happen often no no his eyelids fluttered the docs do a great job dr argent too said milo sure of course so you knew her hattersons hands made tiny circular motions he licked his lips and turned them the color of raw liver we didnt do any counseling together but i knew who she was very nice lady another liplick i mean she seemed very smartshe was nice do you know what happened to her hatterson stared at the floor sure does everyone i cant speak for anyone sir it was in the paper they let you read the paper said milo sure we can read anything i like time magazine you get all the news in a neat little package anyway thats it for a ward b and c are mostly the same theres a few women on c they dont cause any problems are they kept to themselves i said no they get to mingle theres just not too many of them we dont have problems with them what about the fifth floor said milo oh said hatterson the s naw we never see them except to look out the window when a sheriffs bus brings them in they wear jail blues go straight up their own elevator theyre he shrugged theyre what i said fakers got no stake here anyway weve got some pretty nice rooms let me show em to youheres an open one we can take a look at the space was generous totally bare clean as a marine barracks four beds one for each corner mattresses set into white moldedplastic frames attached to the floor next to each one a nightstand of the same material a single clouded window offered a few square inches of cottony light three of the beds were made up neatly top sheets tucked tight one was jumbled no closets a doorless entry led to a tiny white lav lidless white toilet white sink no medicine cabinet no toiletries no toothbrushes anything was a potential weapon they give us disposables said hatterson as if following my thoughts aftershave brushes shaving cream safety razors under supervision guys who want to shave use electrics that are sterilized and reused he looked disapprovingly at the unmade bed someone must be having a bad day we cant hang anything on the wall because it could be set on fire so theres no family pictures or anything like that but its not bad right milo grunted hatterson flinched but persisted we get our three squares the foods pretty tasty chapter president of the starkweather chamber of commerce i could see why swig had picked him he led us out of the room and thats about all she wrote folks are all the rooms multiple occupancy i said wondering how roommates were chosen except for the s rssuppression and restraint those come one to a customer you can tell which ones they are because they have an s after the number he pointed theyre basically the same except smaller cause its only one patient does suppression and restraint mean straitjackets said milo padded walls like the elevator hattersons mustache vibrated no padding but sure if someone needs a straitjacket weve got em but hopefully if you behave yourself after you earn an s r you earn out of there in a jif i couldnt say from direct experience but thats what i imagine pride of ownership he gave denial new meaning i saw the revulsion in milos eyes we stood in the empty room as hatterson prattled on about the food fridays were still fish even though the pope said meat was okay vitamin pills too the patients were well taken care of an operator theres one in every setting a gossip too eager to tell us about ralphs criminal history was he swigs stoolie risky business on a ward full of murderers might as well take advantage i said what wards did dr argent work on hatterson stopped i guess she worked all over the place the docs all dothey move around most of them dont even have permanent offices they just share desks for charting where are the charts kept in the nursing station what exactly did dr argent do here i said i guess counseling what do you know about her groupskills for daily living just that she started it a few months ago picked some weird guys for it weird in what way messedup guys said hatterson he tapped his temple you know lowfunctioning guys milo said what was the point no one gets out of here right hatterson whitened his head began to droop and remained low as if straining under impossible weight the plump lips rotated right he said its not right no no yes it is did joining dr argents group help someone earn release said milo not that i heard sir did any of the group members get out hatterson shook his head no it was just aboutlearning to do things for yourself i guess dr argent wanted to help them feel better about themselves improve their selfesteem said milo hatterson brightened you got it you cant love others less you love yourself she knew what she was doing the docs here are smart okay ill call and get us up to b the two upper wards were laid out identically to a on c the hallway teemed but no female inmates were in sight we walked through quickly no fights nothing untoward the same mix of degraded muscles stupor and selfabsorption occasional dark stares rife with paranoia a few serpentine tongueflicks and jumpy muscles that said phenothiazine drug side effects hatterson moved us through quickly no more happy chatter he seemed defeated almost peevish with his chatter gone the corridors were stripped of conversation no discourse among the inmates here every man was an island i supposed swig was right his charges would be easier to control than simple criminals because once the violent impulses were held in check psychosis was a custodians friend neurochemically suppressing and restraining as the disease blunted initiative squelched the spark of freshness and novelty medication helped too to handle violent psychotics the trick was to find a drug that soothed the occasional fried synapse squelched rage hushed the little voices that commanded mayhem but take away the violence and you didnt have serenity what remained were what psychiatrists labeled the negative symptoms of psychosis apathy flat mood deadened voice blunted movement impoverished thinking language stripped of nuance and humor an existence devoid of surprise and joy that explained the ambient silence the lack of noise wasnt peaceful the ward felt like a crypt a psych tech came by wheeling a food cart i found myself welcoming the jangle hatterson took us to the c ward elevator milo said lets go up to five sorry said hatterson im not authorized no one is not even the docs unless they get an order to evaluate a you know a lot about this place i said hatterson shrugged as we waited for the lift to arrive i peered through the plastic panels on the door and watched the traffic on the ward techs moving around confidently unarmed a black nurse emerging from the station with a clipboard and making her way down the corridor with a highhipped trot inmates not doing much of anything i thought of how heidi ott had handled ralph and the fighters in a jail a skirmish like that could have led to fullscale rioting so starkweather was indeed a tight ship full of oneway passengers meaning the chance that claire argents work had anything to do with her murder was remote but had the system broken down somehow a released man acting out in the worst way maybe heidi could tell us she d worked with claire argent on the living skills group lowfunctioning men according to hatterson what had claire had in mind when setting up the sessions why had she come here hatterson said heres some docs three men came through the door shirts and ties no white coats badges with yellow bars no outward sign that a colleague had been slashed to death and stuffed in a car trunk milo said excuse me showed his badge explained his purpose the man in the middle was tall sandyhaired weatheredlooking in his sixties green plaid shirt yellow knit tie he said terrible thing i wish you luck v n aldrich md psychiatrist hi milo said if theres anything anyone can tell me that might help no responses then a bald darkbearded man said claire seemed very nice but i cant say i knew her c steenburg phd the third man was short and ruddy d swenson md he shook his head she was comparatively new wasnt she vern aldrich said just a few months i was her nominal supervisor on a few cases her work was fine nominal i said im the senior psychiatrist on day shift so officially she reported to me but she didnt need much supervision very bright im terribly sorry about what happened we all are nods all around what kind of work did she do here i said mostly behavior modificationsetting up contingency schedulesrewards for good behavior withdrawal of privileges for infractions that kind of thing aldrich smiled i wont claim to be an expert on her work product were pretty autonomous around here claire was very well trained used to work at county general any idea why she transferred i said she said she needed a change i got a sense she didnt want to talk about it my feeling is that shed simply had enough of what she was doing i used to be in private practice retired got bored with golf came here did you get the sense that she needed more human contact than neuropsych provided i asked it was a psychologists question not a cops and aldrich studied me i suppose he said in any event i dont imagine any of this has much to do with what happened to her whys that said milo she got killed out there aldrich pointed to a wall the wonderful democratic normal world he looked over at hatterson as if first noticing the little man laced his hands behind his back scanned hatterson from toetip to head circulating phil mr swig asked me to show them around dr aldrich i see well do that then aldrich faced milo i wish we could help you detective but were all stymied so youve discussed what happened the three of them exchanged looks yes of course said aldrich we were all upset what we found out is that none of us knew dr argent it spurred us to be more social with each other good luck getting to the bottom of it one more thing said milo the group dr argent ran skills for daily living would it be possible to meet with the patients youd have to check with administration on that said aldrich would you see a problem with it medically speaking aldrich tugged at his tie let me look into that i want to make sure we dont upset anything appreciate it doctor milo gave him and the others business cards the elevator arrived aldrich said you three ride down first well catch it next time as we descended hatterson said dr aldrich is very very smart milo said how long have you been here phil hattersons head drew back like that of a turtle poked with a stick his reply was inaudible whats that phil hatterson began smoothing his mustache chomped his lower lip with his upper teeth a long time he stayed in the car and waved us out goddamn weenie said milo as we walked back toward the reception area didnt get a chance to speak with the ott girlbetter get her home number and follow up everyone here spouts the same line this place is as safe as milkyou buy it they broke up that fight pretty fast yeah okay lets assume theyve got the lunatics well controlled you see anything that would lure claire away from county maybe all the structure i said no more applying for grants or having to play the academic game aldrich said she talked about needing a change structured or not the place creeps me out we didnt even scratch the surface did we maybe theres nothing below the surface he didnt answer we passed swigs office the door was closed okay ill get ms otts number then we fly out of here if youve got time i can show you argents house out in the evil messy normal world the longer i stay here the more i crave the insanity out there lindeen schmitz was back on the phone and she barely looked up milo stationed himself in front of her desk and leaned forward imposing on her space where does a frustrated sixthree pound cop stand anywhere he wants she tried to uhhuh her way through a conversation that was clearly personal finally said gotta go and hung up yes sir milo grinned down at her i need to do some followup with one of your staffers heidi ott may i have her home number please um im not sure i can do that without authorization and mr swigs gone oh what the hey youre the police you can always get it anyway in one of those backwards directories right batting her lashes she left her desk sashayed up the hall to the closest brown door came back with a message blank and gave it to milo neatly printed name and number area code milo gave a small bow thank you maam no problem sir more eyelash aerobics i hope you find whoever did it milo thanked her again and we headed for the main doors lindeen said why do you want to speak to heidi she worked with dr argent lindeen picked up a pencil and tapped the edge of her desk i dont think they were friends or anything dr argent didnt have any friends that i saw real quiet when a bunch of us went for margaritas or something we asked her along but she always said no so we stopped asking i figured she was shy but still its so horrible what happened to her when i heard i just couldnt believe it someone you see every day and then theyre just she snapped a finger she used to walk right past me every morning at eight pronto say good morning walk on like she had a big plan for the day its so horrible yes it is said milo so she didnt have any pals at all not that i saw she always seemed like work work work nice but work work work hope you solve it she reached for the phone milo said pardon me maam just one more thing im curious about her hand rested on the receiver whats that the guy who took us aroundhatterson whats he in for oh him she said why was there some kind of problem no does he cause problems she snorted not hardly the reason im asking is he didnt seem very crazy im just wondering what kind of guy gets to be a tour guide phil she said pronouncing the name with distaste phil raped a child so bad she needed reconstructive surgery chapter frank dollard was waiting for us outside he walked us across the yard without comment giant chet stood in a corner staring at chain link sharbno the urinator was gone a few men palsied a few men sat in the dirt the sun was even hotter dollard waited as we retrieved milos gun and my knife the outer gate swung open milo said let me ask you a question frank a guy like hattersonin prison hed be lunch meat dollard smiled so whats his status here low same as everyone for all i know the other guys dont even know what he did they dont care much about each otherthats the point theyre not connected driving through the eucalyptus grove milo began to laugh what i said hows this for a story line we catch the bad guy hes some joker they let out by mistake he pleads insanity ends up right back here sell it to hollywoodno not stupid enough we left the grove passed into white light then again you tell me our boy probably doesnt act or look crazy so maybe i should forget about this place my guess is our boy is probably more like a fifthfloor resident so do i bother looking for a recently released starkweather alum and whats with that group claire ran why do lowfunctioning guys need daily living skills unless she had a notion some of them would end up on the outside maybe it was altruism i said misguided or otherwise heidi ott might be able to shed some light on it shed also be able to tell you if any of claires patients have been released recently yeah shes definitely high on my list tough kid the way she handled that ralph guy can you imagine a female coming in here day in and day out he drove off starkweather drive and back onto the connecting road the bare gray acreage appeared then the first of the packing plants gigantic and sootstained behind the shadowy columns the blue sky seemed like an insult milo said im neglecting basic detective dogma lay your foundation get to know the vie trouble is im getting the same feeling about claire that i did about dada grabbing air she lived alone no obvious kinks so far no pals i can locate no local family you heard the way everyone at starkweather described her nice did her job stayed to herself offended no one richards spiritual sister so what do we have here a psychopath who goes after inoffensive people assuming the cases are related maybe someone who goes after lonely people then half of las at risk where is claires family pittsburgh just her parentsshe was an only child he chewed his cheek i did the notification call you know the drill i ruin their lives they cry i listen theyre coming out this week maybe ill get more than i did over the phone which was claire had no enemies terrific daughter wonderful girl theyre always wonderful girls we cut through industrial wasteland mounds of rotting machinery slag heaps muddy trenches planes of greasy dirt under a gray sky it could have passed for hell today it just looked like something you kept from the voting public milo wasnt noticing the scenery both his hands were back on the wheel tightknuckled white lonely people he said let me show you her house he drove much too fast all the way to the freeway as we swooped up the onramp he said i was up there for a good part of yesterday checking out the street talking to neighbors homes the big killing spot for females so i told the crimescene guys to take their time unfortunately it looks like time ill spent got some prelims this morning no blood or semen no evidence of breakin or disruption lots of prints all over the place which youd expect in anyones house but so far the only matches are to claires final autopsys scheduled for tomorrow if were lucky and no drivebys stuff up the pipeline what did the neighbors have to say take a guess she kept to herself never caused problems im hanging with the answer man he pressed down on the accelerator no one spoke two words to her no one even knew her name what about visitors none that anyone saw he said just like richard she did have an exhusband though guy named joseph stargill lawyer lives down in san diego now i put a call in to him howd you find him came across some divorce papers she kept in her home office i called dr theobold this morning hell be happy to engage in shrink talk with you he had some vague recollection of claire getting divorced only reason he found out is each year staff members update their resumes in the past claire had put married in the maritalstatus blank this year she whited it out and typed divorced so it was recent i said theobold didnt ask her about it he said she just wasnt the type you got personal with maybe thats why she took the job at starkweather what do you mean great escape show up on time dont make waves no one bugs you like dr aldrich said the staff gets leeway maybe she wanted to do clinical work but was afraid of having to relate to patients surrounding herself with psychotics took the pressure off and as long as none of her patients got violent she could do what she wanted with them the perfect escape escape from what academia and emotional entanglement her divorce was recent just because she didnt talk about it doesnt mean she wasnt still hurting people going through life changes sometimes try to simplify you see starkweather as simple in a sense it is he didnt answer put on even more speed a few miles later i said on the other hand she got entangled with someone the person who cut her throat the house was like so many others singlestory white stucco aged to a spoiledmilk gray roofed with black composite shingle attached single garage double parking space instead of a front yard one of those unadorned latefifties hillside knockups posing as intentionally contemporary but really the product of a tight construction budget the street was called cape horn drivea short straight afterthought of a slit into the north side of woodrow wilson deadending at a huge tipu tree matching trees tilted over the pavement the sidewalk was bleached and dry where the branches didnt hover second lot in third from the end eight neighboring residences in all most like claire argents with minor variation very few cars at the curb but closed garage doors made it hard to assess what that meant no major intersections or nearby commercial district youd have to intend to come up here this high the air was moving in the summer light the tipu trees were filmy their fernshaped leaves swishing in the breeze contrary creatures they lost their leaves in the spring when everything else bloomed when other branches began to shed the tipus were a riot of yellow blossoms not yet the only sparks of color shot from flower boxes and potted plants other houses not claires we made our way up to the front door nice views all around the freeway was miles away but i could hear it nowadays you always seem to hear it lapd seal on the door milo had a key and let us in i followed him into a tight bare space too small to be called an entry hall two white walls rightangled us into the living room not a livedin room unmarked walls empty hardwood floors not a single piece of furniture milo took three echoing steps and stood in the center over his head was a light fixture cheap frosted dome it looked original chenille drapes browned the windows the walls looked clean but were turning the same graywhite as the exterior the floors caught my attentionlacquered shiny free of scuff marks dents drag furrows as if the inhabitants had floated rather than walked i felt short of breath the house had no odorneither the stench of death nor the aromas of tenancy no food sweat perfume cut flowers air freshener not even the must of disuse a vacant place it seemed airless incapable of sustaining life i made myself take a deep breath milo was still in the center of the room fingers drumming his thighs cozy i said understanding why hed wanted me to see it he turned very slowly taking in the open area to the left that led to a small kitchen a single oak stool at an eatin counter white formica laced with a gold threadlike design also bare except for black fingerprintpowder smudges same for the other counters and the cabinets on the far wall hung an empty wooden spice rack fourburner white stove at least twenty years old refrigerator of matching color and vintage no other appliances he opened the fridge said yogurt grapes two apples baking soda baking soda for freshness she liked things neat just like richard simplifying he began opening and closing cabinets white ironstone dishes noritake service for four ditto stainlesssteel utensils everything full of fingerprint powder one skillet one saucepan containers of salt pepper no other spices bland life on to the stove burners lifting the grill he said clean either she never cooked or she was really compulsive or somebody else was i stared back at the empty front room did crime scene take furniture back to the lab no just her clothing this is the way we found it my first thought was someone cleaned the place out or shed just moved in or was in the process of moving out but i cant find evidence of her leaving and her deed says shes been here over two years i pointed to the virgin floor either she was planning to redecorate or never bothered to furnish like i said grabbing air cmon lets take a look at the rest of the place a hall to the left led to one bath and two small bedrooms the first set up as an office no carpeting the same pristine hardwood harsh echoes milo kneeled in the hallway ran his finger along the smooth clean oak maybe she took off her shoes like in a japanese house we started with the bedroom box spring and mattress on the floor no headboard fourdrawer pecanveneer dresser matching nightstand on the stand were a tissue box and a ceramic lamp the base white ovular shaped like a giant cocoon swirls of white fingerprint powder the telltale concentrics of latent prints her linens are at the lab said milo along with her clothes he moved the mattress around slid his hand under the box spring opened the closet empty same for the dresser i watched them pack her undies he said no hidden stash of naughty things just your basic white cotton small wardrobe dresses sweaters skirts tasteful stuff macys some budgetchain stuff nothing expensive he righted the mattress looked up at the ceiling then back at the empty closet she wasnt moving out alex this is where she lived if you can call it that in the office he put his hands together prayerfully and said give me something to work with lord thought you already went through it not thoroughly couldnt with the criminalists buzzing around just that box he pointed to a cardboard file on the floor thats where i found the divorce papers near the top he approached the desk and studied the books in the cheap plywood cases that covered two walls shelves stuffed and sagging volumes on psychology psychiatry neurology biology sociology bound stacks of journals arranged by date white powder and prints everywhere milo had emptied the top drawer of staples and paper clips bits of paper and lint was into the second drawer rummaging okay here we go he waved a red leatherette savings account passbook century bank sunset and cahuenga well well welllooks like she was doing okay i went over and looked at the page he held out balance of and some cents he flipped to the front of the booklet the initial transaction had taken place three years ago rolled over from a previous passbook when the balance had been ninetyeight thousand less accrual of nearly a hundred thousand in three years the deposit pattern was repetitive no withdrawals deposits of three thousand at the end of each month probably a portion of her salary i said theobold said her takehome was around four so she probably banked three took out a grand for expenses looks like it didnt change during the time she worked at starkweather which makes sense her civil service job classification puts her at a comparable salary frugal i said howd she pay her bills and her tax is there a checking account he found it seconds later in the same drawer mont deposits of five hundred last friday of the monthsa day she deposited into the savings account the woman w clock looks like she wrote mostly small check probably household stuff maybe she had a credit c paid the rest of her bills in cash so she kept five hundrei so around the house or in her purse to some junkie i could be a sizable score and the purse hasnt been found but this doesnt feel like robbery does it i said no still people have been killed for a lot less without her purse howd you identify her car registration gave us her name we ran her pri matched them to her psychologists license a sti junkie robbery wouldnt that be something shes out si ping gets mugged for her cash but what junkie muj would bother stashing her in trash bags driving her to a s public spot and leaving her car behind when he could thrown her somewhere dark gotten himself some wheel the night then again most criminals take stupid pills okay lets see what else she left behind he got to work on the rest of the desk the money sho up in a plain white envelope pushed to the back of the hand bottom drawer nine fiftydollar bills under a b leatherette appointment book issued as a gift by a drug c pany threeyearold calendar blank pages in the book so maybe she had fifty or so with her he said spender this does not feel like robbery i asked him for the bankbook examined every page what he said so mechanical exact same pattern week in week no sizable withdrawals also means no vacations or predictable splurges and no deposits other than her si implies she got no alimony either unless she put it ir other account also she maintained her individual ace throughout her marriage what about her tax return die file jointly he crossed the room to the cardboard file box inside were two years of state and federal tax returns neatly ordered no outside income other than salary no dependents other than herself nope individual return somethings off its like she was denying being married or she had doubts from the beginning he came up with a stack of stapled paper started flipping utility bills ah heres the credit card visa she charged food clothing gasoline for the buick and books not very oftenmost months therere only three four charges she paid on time too no interest at the bottom of the stack were auto insurance receipts low premium for no smoking and good driving record no financing on the buick meant she probably owned the car no way for her to know it would end up being a coffin on wheels milo scribbled notes and placed the paper back in the carton i thought of what we hadnt found mementos photographs correspondence greeting cards anything personal no property tax receipts or deductions for property tax if she rented why no record of rent checks i raised the question milo said so maybe the ex paid the mortgage and taxes maybe that was his alimony and now that shes gone hes off the hook and if hes maintained some ownership of the house theres a bit of incentive for you any idea who gets the two hundred forty any will show up not yet so you like the husband im just thinking about what you always tell me follow the money he grunted i returned to the bookcase pulled a few books out foxed pages neatly printed notes in margins next to five years worth of brain was a collection of journal reprints articles claire argent had authored a dozen studies all related to the neuropsychology of alcoholism funded by the national institutes of health the writing was clear the subject matter repetitive lots of technical terms but i got the gist during graduate school and the five years following shed filled her hours measuring human motor and visual skills under various levels of intoxication easy access to subjects county hospital was the treatment center of last resort for physically wasted alcoholic paupers who used the emergency room as their private clinic er docs called them gomersget out of my emergency room her results had been consistent booze slowed you down statistically significant but hardly profound lots of academics drudged through undistinguished careers with that kind of stuff maybe she had tired of the grant game one interesting fact shed always published solounusual for academic medicine where chairmen commonly stuck their names on everything underlings produced maybe myron theobold had integrity letting claire do her own thing claire going it alone from the very beginning a rattling sound made me turn milo had been handling the objects on the desktop and a pen had dropped he retrieved it and placed it next to a small calendar in a green plastic frame another drug company giveaway empty memo pad no appointments no indentations on the pad such a spare life several books trumpeting the virtues of serene simplicity had recently gone bestseller i wondered if the newly rich authors practiced what they preached this house didnt seem serene just blank hollow null we left the office and moved to the bathroom shampoo soap toothpaste multiple vitamins sanitary napkins advil no birth control pills no diaphragm the travertine deck around the tub was clear of niceties no bath beads or bubble bath or loofah spongenone of the solitary pleasures women sometimes crave the porcelain was streaked with amber milo said luminol no blood in the tub or the drain no semen on the towels or sheets just some sweat that matches claires blood type wondering if anyone but claire had ever set foot in this house i thought of the work pattern shed chosen for herself five years with drunks six months with dangerous psychotics perhaps after days immersed in delusion and warp shed craved silence her own brand of zen but that didnt explain the lack of letters from home not even a snapshot of parents nieces nephews some kind of contact the ultimate zen triumph was the ability to lose identity to thrive on nothingness but this place didnt bespeak any sort of victory such a sad little box or was i missing something projecting my own need for attachment i thought of what claire had hoarded her books and her articles maybe work had been everything and she had been content yet shed abandoned her first job impulsively relinquishing grant money trading dry but durable science for the chance to school psychotic murderers in the art of daily living to what end i kept searching for reasons shed traded county for starkweather but the shift continued to bother me even with comparable salaries a civil service position was a comedown from the whitecoat work shed been doing at county and if shed craved contact with schizophrenics county had plenty of those dangerous patients the jail ward was right there if she was tired of the publishorperish grind then why not do some private practice neuropsych skills were highly prized and welltrained neuropsychologists could do forensic work consult to lawyers on injury cases bypass the hmos and earn five ten times what starkweather paid even if money hadnt been important to her what about job satisfaction why had she subjected herself to shift after shift in the ugly gray building and the drive to starkweather day after day past the slag there had to be some other reason for what i couldnt stop thinking of as a selfdemotion it was almost as if shed punished herself for what or had she been fleeing something had it caught up with her chapter it was just after two pm when we left the house outside the air felt alive milo connected to laurel canyon headed south to sunset drove west on the strip an accident near holloway and the usual jam of misery ghouls slowed us and it was nearly three by the time we crossed through beverly hills and over to beverly glen neither milo nor i was saying much talked out he zoomed up the bridle path to my house robins truck was in the carport thanks for your time where are you headed hall of records look for real estate paper see what else comes up on mr stargill then a call to heidi ott he looked tired and his tone said optimism was a felony i said good luck and watched him speed away i walked up to my new house three years and i still thought of it as a bit of an interloper the old house the one id bought with my first real earnings had been an amalgam of redwood and idiosyncrasy a psychopath out to kill me torched it to cinders robin had supervised the construction of something white airy a good deal more spacious and practical undeniably charming i told her i loved it for the most part i did one day id stop being secretly stodgy i expected to find her out back hi her studio but she was in the kitchen reading the morning paper spike was curled up at her feet blackbrindle potroast body heaving with each snoring breath jowls flowing onto the floor hes a french bulldog a miniature version of the english breed with upright bat ears and enough vanity for an entire opera troupe he lifted one eyelid as i enteredoh you againand let it drop a subsequent sigh was laden with ennui robin stood spread her arms and squeezed me around the waist her head pressed against my chest she smelled of hardwood and perfume and her curls tickled my chin i lifted a handful of auburn coils and kissed the back of her neck shes a charitable five three but has the long swanlike neck of a fashion model her skin was hot slightly moist howd it go she said putting her hand in my hair uneventful no problem from the inmates huh nothing i held her closer rubbing the taut musculature of her shoulders moved down to delicate vertebrae magical curves then back up to the clean line of her jaw and the silk of her eyelids she stepped away took my chin in one hand that place made you romantic being out of there makes me romantic well im glad youre back in one piece it wasnt dangerous i said not even close five thousand murderers and no danger twelve hundred but whos counting twelve hundred she said how silly of me to worry at the last word her voice rose a notch sorry i said but really it was fine people go to work there every day and nothing happens everyone seems to think its safer on the wards than out on the streets sounds like rationalization to me meanwhile that psychologist gets stuffed in a car trunk theres no indication so far that her work had anything to do with it good the main thing is youre back have you eaten yet no you just juice in the morning busy day pretty busy trying to finish that mandolin she stretched to her full height she had on a red tshirt and denim overalls size six skechers small gold hoops glinted from her ears she took them off when she worked not planning to return to the studio im hungry now she said hint hint lets go out i said a mind reader just call me the answer man we gave spike a chewbone and drove to an indian buffet in santa monica that was open all afternoon rice and lentils kulcha bread stuffed with onions curried spinach with soft cheese spicy eggplant hot milky tea some sort of chant played in the backgrounda single male voice keening maybe praying the two ectomorphs in the next booth got up and left and we were the only patrons the waiter left us alone halfway through the pile on her plate robin said i know im harping but next time you go somewhere like that please call the minute you get out you were really that worried ax murderers and vampires lord knows what else i covered her hand with mine rob the men i saw today were submissive except for the bearded fellow on the yard whod come toward me the fight in the hall plastic windows s r rooms what makes them submit medication and a structured environment she didnt seem comforted so you learned nothing there not so far later we went to claire argents house i described the place what do you think about what the way she lived she drank tea put the cup aside thought awhile would i want to live like that not forever but maybe for a short stretch take a nice vacation from all the complications complications i said she smiled not you honey just circumstances obligations deadlineslife piling up like when i was handling all the construction or now when the orders stack up and everyone wants results yesterday sometimes life can start to feel like too much homework and a little simplicity doesnt sound bad at all this was more than simplicity robin this was bleak sad youre saying she was depressed i dont know enough to diagnose her i said but the feeling i got from the place wasinorganic blank did you see any evidence she was neglecting herself she said no and everyone describes her as pleasant dependable distant but no obvious pathology so maybe inwardly she was fine too maybe i said the only things she did amass were books maybe intellectual stimulation was what turned her on there you go she trimmed things down to concentrate on what mattered to her i didnt answer you dont think so she said pretty severe trim i said there was nothing personal in the entire house not a single family photo perhaps she wasnt close to her family or she had problems with them but even so how different does that make her from millions of other people alex she sounds to me more like someone cerebral living in her head enjoying her privacy even if she did have social problems what does any of that have to do with her murder maybe nothing i spooned more rice onto my plate played with grains of basmati took a bite of bread if she wanted intellectual stimulation why switch from a research job to starkweather what kind of research was she doing alcoholism and how it affects reaction time anything earthshattering not to me i summarized the studies actually it was pretty mundane could be she came to a realization shed been a good little girl doing what was expected of her since grad school she got tired of hacking it out wanted to actually help someone she didnt pick a very easy group to help so it was the challenge that motivated her that and tackling something new the men at starkweather dont get cured then i dont know all out of guesses im not trying to be contentious i said she just really puzzles me and i think theres a good deal of truth in what youre saying she got divorced within the last year or so maybe she was trying to cut free on several levels maybe for someone whod been grinding out studies year after year starkweather seemed novel she smiled and stroked my face if knitted brows are any kind of measure milos getting his moneys worth out of you the other thing i wonder about is the first caserichard dada the wouldbe actor on the surface he and claire have little in common but what they do seem to share is negative spacean absence of friends enemies quirks both of them were very neat no entanglements maybe were talking about loneliness and an attempt to fill the void some sort of lonelyhearts hookup with the wrong person a man and a woman she said a bisexual killer that would make dada gay and milo never found any indication of that or maybe it had nothing to do with sexjust companionship some kind of commoninterest club on the other hand the cases could be unrelated i raised her hand to my lips kissed the fingertips one by one mr romantic id better switch gears before i drive you into isolation she grinned waved languidly kissed air put on her bette davis voice pass me the spinach dahling then you can pay the check and sweep me off my feet to the nearest baskin robbins for some jamoca almond fudge after that hiho all the way home where you ah cawjully invited to add some entanglement to my life chapter at eight pm milo called am i interrupting anything hed missed interrupting by an hour robin was reading in bed and id taken spike for a short walk up the canyon when the phone rang i was sitting out on the terrace trying to rid my mind of question marks struggling to concentrate on the sound of the waterfall that fed the fishpond grateful because i couldnt hear the freeway not at all whats up got the info on claire and stargill married two years divorced nearly two no kids i reached stargill he says the split was amicable hes a partner in a tenlawyer firm remarried three months ago he just learned about claire san diego papers didnt carry it but one of his partners was up here read about it what was his demeanor he sounded pretty upset over the phone but what the hell does that mean said he doubted there was anything he could add but hed talk to me i set up an appointment for tomorrow morning at ten san diego no hes driving up very cooperative fellow he has business here anyway some commercial property closingshes a real estate lawyer so he comes up to la regularly yeah i made note of that lets see what hes like facetoface were meeting at claires house which she owns it was his bachelor place but after the divorce he signed it over to her and agreed to pay the mortgage and taxes in lieu of alimony and her dipping into his stocks and bonds who inherits the property now good question stargill wasnt aware of any will and he claims neither of them took out insurance on the other i never came across any policies claire was thirtynine probably wasnt figuring on dying i suppose a lawyer would know how to play the probate processhe might make a case for mortgage payment constituting partial ownership but my guess her parents would come first what do you think a place like that is worth three hundred or so how much is equity well find that out tomorrow if mr cooperative stays cooperative maybe he got tired of paying her bills huh it could chafe especially now that hes remarried especially if hes got money problems be good to know what his finances are like if you want to meet him be there at ten i left a message with heidi otts machine no callback yet and the lab sent another report on the prints definitely only claires looks like she really did go it alone the next morning i called dr myron theobold at county hospital left a voicemail message and drove to cape horn drive arriving at milos unmarked was already there parked at the curb a deepgray latemodel bmw sedan sat in front of the garage ski clamps on the roof the houses front door was unlocked and i entered milo had reassumed his position at the center of the empty living room near the kitchen counter stood a man in his forties wearing a blue suit white shirt yellow pindot tie he was just shy of six feet trim with short curly red hair and a matching beard streaked with gray skinny gold watch on his left wrist wedding band studded with small diamonds shiny oxblood wingtips milo said this is dr delaware our psychological consultant doctor mr stargill joe stargill a hand extended dry palms but unsteady hazel eyes his voice was slightly hoarse he looked past me into the empty room and shook his head mr stargill was just saying the house looks pretty different stargill said this wasnt the way we lived we had walltowall carpeting furniture over there was a big leather sofa that wall held a chrome cabinetan etagere i think it was called claire taught me that id bought a few things when i was single but claire filled it in pottery figurines macrame all that good stuff he shook his head again she must have gone through some major changes whens the last time you spoke to her sir said milo when i uhauled my things away maybe a halfyear before the final decree so you were separated before the divorce stargill nodded touched the tip of his beard milo said so your last contact would be around two and a half years ago thats right you never talked about the divorce well sure a phone call here and there to wrap up details i thought you meant a real conversation ah said milo and after the divorce you never came back to visit no reason to said stargill claire and i were over wed been over long before we made it official never really started actually the marriage went bad quickly stargill sighed and buttoned his jacket his hands were broad ruddy coated with beercolored hair it wasnt a matter of going bad the whole thing was essentially a mistake here i brought this found it this morning he fished out a crocodile wallet and removed a small photo which milo examined then handed to me color snapshot of claire and stargill arm in arm just married banner in the background he wore a tan suit and brown turtleneck shirt no beard eyeglasses his nude face was bony his smile tentative claire had on a long pale blue sleeveless dress printed with lavender pansies and she carried a bouquet of white roses her hair was long straight parted in the middle her face leaner than in the headshot id seen the cheekbones more pronounced full smile dont really know why i brought it said stargill didnt know i even had it whered you find it said milo in my office i went in early this morning before driving up here started going through all the paperwork claire and i had in common divorce documents transfer of ownership for the house its all out in the cartake whatever you want the picture popped out from between some pages stargill turned to me guess a psychologist could interpret thatstill having it maybe it does mean something on a subconscious level but i sure dont remember holding on to it intentionally seeing it again was bizarre we look pretty happy dont we i studied the photo some more a flimsylooking altar flecked with glitter was visible between the newlyweds glittering red hearts on the walls a pink cupid figurine with dizzy gillespie cheeks vegas i said reno said stargill tackiest wedding chapel you ever saw the guy who officiated was an old geezer half blind probably drunk we got into town well after midnight the geezer was closing up and i slipped him a twenty to do a quickie ceremony his wife had already gone home so some janitoranother old guyserved as witness afterward claire and i joked that they were both senileit probably wasnt legal he placed his hands on the counter stared blankly into the kitchen when i lived here we had appliances all over the placejuicer blender coffee maker you name it claire wanted every gizmo invented wonder what she did with the stufflooks like she was stripping everything away any idea why shed do that i said no he said like i said we werent in touch truth is even when we were together i couldnt have told you what made her tick all she ever really liked was going to the moviesshe could see a flick a night sometimes it didnt seem to matter what was on the screen she just liked being in the theater beyond that i never knew her at all whered the two of you meet another major romantic story hotel cocktail lounge marriott at the airport to be specific i was there to meet a client from the far east who never showed up and claire was attending a psychology convention im sitting at the bar irritated because this guy does this to me all the time and now ive wasted half a day claire glides in looking great sits a few stools down he pointed at the picture as you can see she was an eyeful back then different from my usual type but maybe thats what did it different how i said id been dating legal secretaries paralegals a few models wannabe actresseswere talking girls who were into fashion makeup the whole bodybeautiful thing claire looked like exactly what she was a scholar great structure but she didnt mess with herself that afternoon she was wearing granny glasses and one of those long print dresses her whole wardrobe was those dresses and some jeans and tshirts no makeup no high heelsopen sandals i remember looking down at her feet she had really pretty feet adorable white toes she saw me staring and laughedthis low chuckle that struck me as being really sexy and then i started to look past the glasses and i realized she was greatlooking she ordered a ginger ale i was well into the bloody marys i made some crack about her being a wild party girl she laughed again and i moved closer and the rest is history we got married two months later at the beginning i thought id died and gone to heaven he had a redheads typical milky complexion and now it pinkened thats the whole sordid story he said i dont know why i came here but if theres nothing else died and gone to heaven said milo pink turned to rose physically said stargill i dont want to be vulgar but maybe this will help you in some way what drew claire and me together was one thing sex we ended up getting a room at the marriott and stayed there till midnight she was lets just say id never met anyone like her the chemistry was incredible after her those other girls seemed like mannequins i dont want to be disrespectful lets leave it at that i said but the chemistry didnt last he unbuttoned his jacket put a hand in his pocket maybe it was too much too quickly maybe every flame burns out i dont know im sure some of the blame was mine maybe most she wasnt my first wife id gotten hitched in college that one lasted less than a year obviously i wasnt good at the matrimony thing after we started living together it was like something sputtered no fights just no fire both of us were really into our work we didnt spend much time together the beard hair under his lip vibrated a bit we never fought she just seemed to lose interest i think she lost interest first but after a while it stopped bothering me i felt i was living with a stranger maybe i had been all along the other hand went in a pocket now he was slouching so here i am fortyone working on my third happy honeymoon so far but who knows i noticed that he tended to shift the focus to himself selfcentered or an intentional distraction i said so claire was really into her work did that ever change not that i saw but i wouldnt have known we never talked about work we never talked about anything it was weirdone moment were getting hitched having hurricane sex then were each going about our business i tried i invited her to the office a couple of times but she was always too busy she never invited me to her lab one time i dropped in on her anyway what a zoo all those drunks lurching around she didnt seem happy to see melike i was intruding eventually we were avoiding each other completely easy to do when youre both working seventy hours a week id get home when she was already asleep shed wake up early be over at the hospital by the time i was in the shower only reason we stayed married for two years is each of us was too busyor too lazyto file the papers who ended up filing i said claire did i remember the day she announced it to me i came home late but this time she was up in bed doing a crossword puzzle she pulls out a stack of papers says i thought it was about time joe how do you feel about it i remember feeling relieved but also hurt because she didnt even want to try to work it out also for me it was the second time and i was wondering if id ever pull off the whole relationship thing i moved out but she didnt actually file for six months any idea why said milo she said she hadnt gotten around to it what was the financial agreement said milo polite said stargill no hassles we worked the whole thing out with one phone call i give claire big points for fairness because she refused to hire a lawyer let me know she had no intention of cleaning me out and i was the vulnerable one i had the assetsinvestments pension plan i had some real estate things cooking she couldve made my life miserable but all she asked was for me to deed her the house finish paying it off and handle the property taxes everything else was mine i left her the furniture walked away with my clothes and my law books and my stereo he rubbed an eye turned away tried to speak cleared his throat the paperwork was easywe never filed a joint tax return she never changed her name i thought it was a feminist thing but now i wonder if she ever intended to stay with me did that bother you said milo why should it the whole marriage didnt feel like a marriage more like a onenight stand that stretched out im not saying i didnt respect claire as a person she was a terrific woman considerate kind that was the only downer i liked heras a person and i know she liked me my first wife was twenty when she left me wed been together eleven months and she tried to enslave me for the rest of my life claire was so damn decent i wouldnt have minded remaining her friend but it just didnt go down that way i cant understand why anyone would want to hurt her he rubbed his eyes when did you move to san diego said milo right after the divorce a job opportunity came up and id had it with la couldnt wait to get out fed up with the smog said milo the smog the congestion the crime i wanted to live near the beach found myself a little rental near del mar the first year claire and i exchanged christmas cards then that stopped did claire have any enemies you were aware of said milo no way i never saw her offend anyonemaybe some nutcase at county got an idea in his head stalked her or something i still remember those drunks leering smelling of barf leaking all over the place when they walked i couldnt see how claire could work with them but she was real business like about it giving them these tests doing research nothing grossed her out im no expert but id concentrate on county he folded his handkerchief and milo and i used the split second to exchange glances stargill didnt know about the job switch to starkweather or wanted us to think he didnt milo shook his head dont bring it up now he said how much is owed on the house mr stargill quick change of context it throws people off balance stargill actually stepped backward around fifty thousand by now the payments are mostly principal i was thinking of paying it off whys that not much of a tax deduction anymore who gets the property in the event of dr argents death stargill studied him buttoned his coat i wouldnt know so you and she didnt have any agreementin the event of her demise it reverts to you absolutely not and so far no wills turned updo you have a will sir i do why is that relevant detective sturgis just being thorough stargills nostrils expanded im the ex so im a suspect oh come on he laughed whats the motive laughing again he stuffed his hands in his pockets and rocked on his heelsa courtroom gesture even if i did get the house three hundred thousand equity tops one of the things i did when i moved to sd was invest in seaside property ive got a net worth of six seven million so murdering claire for another three before taxes would be ludicrous he walked to the bare kitchen counter and rubbed the formica claire and i were never enemies i couldnt have asked for a better exwife so why the hell would i hurt her sir said milo i have to ask these questions sure fine ask hearing about claire made me sick to my stomach i felt this stupid urge to do somethingto be useful thats why i drove up brought you all the documents i shouldve figured youd see me as a suspect but still its shrugging he turned his back on us all i can say is glad its your job and not mine anything else you want to quiz me on i said what can you tell us about claires family background her social life nothing nothing about her family never met her family all i know is she was born in pittsburgh did undergrad at the university of pittsburgh went to case western for her phd only reason i know that is i saw her diplomas in her office she refused to talk about her past refused or avoided i said both and she never talked at all about her family stargill pivoted and stared at me thats right she was a closed book claimed she had no brothers and sisters her parents ran some kind of store other than that i dont know a thing he shook his head i talked plenty about my family and she listened or pretended to but she never met my side either my choice whys that i said because i dont like my family my mother was okaya quiet drunkbut by the time i met claire she was dead my father was a violent drunken sonofabitch i wouldnt have tossed a stick at let alone introduced to my bride same for my brother he gave a sick smile get it im one of those adult children of alcoholics et cetera et cetera never developed a drinking problem myself but i watch myself went through the whole therapy thing after my mother killed herself when i saw claire with that ginger ale i wondered if maybe she had some history with alcohol maybe we had something in common i ended up telling her about my colorful background the smile acquired teeth turned out she just liked ginger ale not a mention of her family in two years of marriage i said amazing like i said it wasnt your typical marriage every time i tried to get personal she changed the subject he rubbed his scalp and the corners of his mouth curled upoutward trappings of another smile but his mood was hard to read and she had an interesting way of changing the subject whats that i said she took me to bed chapter stargill was eager to leave but milo convinced him to tour the rest of the house the bathroom provoked no comment in the office he said now this looks exactly the same this was claires place she spent all her time here where was your office said milo i didnt like bringing work home used a small desk in the bedroom that room widened his eyes no memories left here we had a kingsize bed brass headboard down comforter antique nightstands claire must have realty wanted a change his expression said he still took that personally he looked into the empty closet where are all her clothes at the crime lab said milo oh man ive got to get out of here grabbing his beard for support he left the room outside he got the carton of documents from his bmw handed them over revved noisily and barreled down the hill whats your take on the guy said milo hes got his share of problems but no bells are ringing and unless claire wasnt as financially benevolent as he made outor hes not as richwhere is the motive three hundred even after taxes is still serious bread and guys with big net worth can still get into trouble im going to take a crash course on his finances what do you mean problems bleeding in publictelling us his life history maybe thats what attracted claire to him someone so selfabsorbed he wouldnt try to get into her head their marriage sounds like a passionwithastranger fantasy gone stale that shows an impulsive side to claire sexually and otherwise stargill says they avoided each other for most of the marriage meaning both of them couldve had multiple affairs maybe claires been dating strangers for years and finally met the wrong one the neighbors never saw anyone neighbors dont notice everything pick someone up in a bar bring them back in your car late at night whos to know or she had liaisons away from home that would fit with no prints except hers in the house stargill described her the same way everyone else has nice but detached i went on but theres one thing he did add a touch of dominance she moves into his house takes over the office he gets a desk in the bedroom he shares his past but she refuses to reciprocate when she tires of him she decides theyre going to divorce and what the settlement is going to be the fact that stargill didnt press her on anything tells us something about him a submissive lawyer thats a novel concept some people keep work and play separate think of the specifics of the settlement claire ends up with the house gets him to carry the mortgage and the taxes and he feels grateful because she didnt take more even their first meeting has that same lopsided feel shes sober he isnt shes in control he isnt he spills his guts about his drunken father and brother alcoholic tendencies of his own that he keeps in check the guys her polar opposite turns every conversation into therapy some women might be put off claire goes upstairs with him and gives him the time of his life later on whenever she wants to shut him up she uses sex she was clearly drawn to people with serious problems maybe she left county because she needed a bigger dose of pathology so he said maybe she found a nutcase whod gotten out of the hospital tried to dominate him pushed the wrong button ive got to see if anyone was released from starkweather during the last six months but if nothing turns up then what he looked worn out i said you ask me to theorize i theorize it could still turn out to be a carjacking gone really bad we walked to the seville something else he said the big taboo she had on talking about her family to me that says rotten background only unlike stargill she kept the bandage on when are her parents coming out couple of days why dont you meet them with me sure i got in the car he said she starts out as your basic nice lady and now were thinking of her as some kind of dominatrix so all i have to do is find some highly disturbed joker with sadistic tendencies who held on to her credit card speaking of which better call visa he looked back at the house maybe she did have visitors no one saw or just one sicko loverboy her living room woulda been a great playpen wouldnt it plenty of space to roll around inthose floors are baby smooth no body fluid traces on the wood but who knows whats easier to clean than lacquered hardwood i said true he said carpet would have yielded something stargill said she took the carpeting out he rubbed his face expatient or excon some bad boy she thinks she can control both would fit with the fact that she was found in her own car someone without his own wheels putting her in the drivers seat again faint smile a latenight pickupwe know from stargill that she wasnt opposed to being picked up they go somewhere things go bad no semen in her so it never got to hankypanky bad boy cuts her puts her in the trash bag stashes her in the trunk and drives her over to west la doesnt steal the car because thats a sure way to get busted smart meticulous not a starkweather fellow he grimaced meaning im wasting my time over there back to square one his cell phone chirped snapping it off his belt he said sturgis oh hi yes thank you oh how so why dont you just tell okay sure that would be fine give me directions cradling the phone under his chin he produced his pad wrote something down clicked off that he said was young miss ott she does the night shift today at starkweather wants to talk before work talk about what she wouldnt say but i know scared when i hear it shed asked to meet at plummer park in west hollywood i followed milo connecting to laurel turning east on melrose on the way i passed a billboard advertising a kickboxing gym terrificlooking woman in a sports bra drawing back a glove for a roundhouse the ad line was you can rest when youre dead theology everywhere the park was scrubby crowded more russian spoken than english most of the inhabitants were old people on benches heavily garbed despite the heat a sprinkle of kids on bicycles circled a dry oval of grass in the center sleepylooking dog walkers were led by the leash a few scruffy types in designer tshirts and cheap shoes hung out near the pay phones trying to radiate moscow mafia heidi ott stood by herself under a sadlooking carrotwood tree arms crossing her chest checking out the terrain in all directions when she spotted us she gave a small wave and headed for the only vacant bench in sight a pile of fresh dog turd nearby explained the vacancy wrinkling her nose she moved on and we followed her to a shady spot near the swing set under an old chinese elm the surrounding grass was bruised and matted a lone young woman pushed her toddler in a gently repeating arc both she and the child seemed hypnotized by the motion heidi leaned against the elm and watched them if i hadnt been looking for the fear i might not have noticed it she wore it lightly a glaze of anxiety hands knotting then releasing eyes fixing too intently on the swinging child thanks for meeting with us maam said milo sure she said my roommates sleeping or i wouldve had you come to my place she moistened her lips with her tongue she wore lowslung jeans a ribbed white tshirt with a scalloped neck and highcut sleeves blunttoed brown boots her hair was drawn back just as it had been at starkweather but in a ponytail not a tight bun dangling earrings of silver filigree some eye shadow a smear of lip gloss freckles on her cheeks that i hadnt noticed on the ward her nails were clipped short very clean the tshirt was formfitting not much meat on her but her arms were sinewy she cleared her throat seemed to be working up the courage to speak just as a tall thin man with long hair came loping by with a panting mutt the dog had some rottweiler in it the man wore all black and his coarse hair was a dull ebony he stared at the ground the dogs nose was down each step seemed to strain the animal heidi waited until they passed then smiled nervously im probably wasting your time if theres anything you can tell me about dr argent youre not squint lines formed around her eyes but when she turned to us they disappeared can i ask you one thing first sure claire dr argent was anything done to her eyes milo didnt answer immediately and she pressed herself against the tree trunk there was oh my god what about her eyes concerns you ms ott she shook her head one hand reached back and tugged her ponytail the man with the dog was leaving the park her eyes followed him for a second before returning to the swinging child the boy squalled as the young woman pulled him off struggled to stuff him into a stroller finally wheeled away just the three of us now as if a stage had been cleared i heard birds sing distant foreign chatter some traffic from fuller avenue milo was looking at heidi i saw his jaw loosen deliberately and he bent one leg trying to appear casual she said okay this is going to sound weird but three days ago one of the patientsa patient dr argent woed withsaid something to me the day before dr argent was killed it was at night i was doubleshifting doing bed check and all of a sudden he started talking to me which by itself was unusual hes barely verbal didnt talk at all until dr argent and i began she stopped pulled the ponytail forward so that it rested on her shoulder played with the ends squeezed them youre going to think im flaky not at all said milo youre doing exactly the right thing okay this is the situation im just about to leave his room and this guy starts mumbling like hes praying or chanting i pay attention because he hardly ever talksnever really talks at all but then he stops and i turn to leave again then all of a sudden he says her namedr a i say excuse me and he repeats it a little louder dr a i say what about dr a and he gives this strange smiletill now he never smiled eitherand says dr a bad eyes in a box i say what now hes back to looking down at his knees the way he always does and hes not saying anything and i cant get him to repeat it so i leave again and when i reach the door he makes this sound ive heard him make a few times before like a barknth nth ruh i never knew what it meant but now i get the feeling its his way of laughinghes laughing at me then he stops hes back in space and im out of there milo said dr a bad eyes in a box have you told anyone about this no just you i planned to talk to claire about it but i never got to see her because the next day she bit her lip the reason i didnt mention it to anyone at the hospital was because i figured it was just crazy talk if we paid attention every time someone talked crazy wed never get any work done but the next day when claire didnt come to work and later in the afternoon i heard the news it freaked me out i still didnt say anything because i didnt know where to go with itand what connection could there be then when i read the paper and it said shed been found in her car trunk im like boxed up could be a car trunk right this is freaky but the paper didnt mention anything about her eyes so i thought maybe by bad eyes he meant her wearing glasses it probably was just crazy talk although why would he say something about it all of a sudden when usually he doesnt speak at all so i kept thinking about it didnt know what to do but when i saw you yesterday i figured i should call and now youre telling me something was done to her eyes she exhaled licked her lips milo said i didnt exactly say that maam i asked why dr argents eyes concerned you oh she slumped okay so im making a big deal sorry for wasting your time she started to walk away milo placed a big hand on her wrist no apologies necessary ms ott you did the right thing out came his pad whats this patients name youre going to pursue it listen i dont want to make waves at this point said milo i cant afford to eliminate anything oh she picked some bark from the tree trunk and examined a fingernail the administration doesnt like publicity this is not going to earn me gold stars whats the problem with publicity mr swig believes in nonewsisgoodnews we depend on politicians for funding and our patients arent exactly looked upon kindly so the lower the profile the fewer the budget cuts she flicked bits of bark from under her nail slender fingers twirled the ponytail again shrug i opened the can what did i expect no big deal ive been thinking about leaving anyway starkweathers not what i expected in what way too repetitious basically i babysit grown men i was looking for something a little more clinical i want to go back to school to become a psychologist thought this would be a good learning experience dr delawares a psychologist i figured that she said smiling at me when hatterson said he was a doctor you wouldnt exactly be taking a surgeon around on the ward would you this patient i said is there any particular reason hed pay attention to dr argent not really except she worked with him i was helping her we were trying to raise his verbal output getting him to interact more with his surroundings behavior modification i said that was the ultimate goalsome kind of reward system but it didnt get that far basically she just talked to him trying to build up rapport she had me spending time with him too to bring him out of his isolation no one else bothered with him whys that probably no one wanted to hes got difficult personal habits he makes noises in his sleep doesnt like to bathe he eats bugs when he finds them garbage off the floor worse stuff he doesnt have roommates because of that even at starkweather hes an outcast but claire saw something workable in him i said i guess she said she told me he was a challenge and actually he did respond a bitthe last few weeks i got him to pay attention sometimes nod when i asked yesorno questions but no real sentences nothing like what he said that day dr a bad eyes in a box she nodded but how could he know i mean it doesnt make sense this is nothing right probably i said did this man associate with anyone who couldve planned to hurt claire maybe someone whos been discharged no way he didnt associate with anyone period and no ones been discharged since ive worked there no one gets out of starkweather how long have you worked there five months i came on right after claire did no i wouldnt be looking for any friends of this guy like i said no one hangs out with him on top of his mental problems hes physically impaired tardive dyskinesia milo said whats that side effects from the antipsychotic drugs his are pretty bad his walk is unsteady he sticks his tongue out constantly rolls his head sometimes he gets active and marches in place or his neck goes to one side like this she demonstrated straightened kept her back to the tree trunk thats all i know id like to go now if thats okay milo said his name maam another tug on the ponytail were not supposed to give out names even our patients have confidentiality but i guess all that changes when her arms went loose and her hands joined just below her pubis fingers tangling remaining in place as if protecting her core okay she said his names ardis peake maybe youve heard of him claire said he was notorious the papers gave him a nickname monster chapter milos jaw was too smooth forced relaxation ive heard of peake so had i a long time ago id been in grad schoolat least fifteen years before heidi otts calm was real shed been a gradeschool kid her parents would have shielded her from the details i remembered the facts the papers had printed a farm town named treadway an hour north of la walnuts and peaches strawberries and bell peppers a pretty place where people still left their doors unlocked the papers had made a big deal out of that ardis peakes mother had worked as a maid and cook for one of the towns prominent ranch families a young couple inherited wealth good looks a big old frame house a twostory housewhat was their name peakes name was immediately familiar what did that say i recalled snippets of biography peake born up north in oregon a logging camp father unknown his mother had cooked for the tree men as far as anyone could tell she and the boy had drifted up and down the coast for most of ardiss childhood no school registrations were ever found and when peake and his mother greyhounded into treadway he was nineteen and illiterate preternaturally shy obviously different noreen peake scrubbed tavern floors until landing the job at the ranch she lived in the main house in a maids room off the kitchen but ardis was put in a oneroom shack behind a peach orchard he was gawky mentally dull so quiet many townspeople thought him mute unemployed with too much time on his hands he was ripe for mischief but his sole offenses were some paintsniffing incidents out behind the sinclair store broaddaylight acts so reckless they confirmed his reputation as retarded the ranch owners finally gave him a job of sorts rat catcher gopher killer snake butcher the farms human terrier his territory was the five acres immediately surrounding the house his task could never be completed but he took to it eagerly often working late into the night with pointed stick and poison sometimes crawling in the dirtkeeping his nose to the ground literally a dogs job assigned to a man but by all accounts peake had found his niche it all ended on a cool sweet sunday morning two hours before dawn his mother was found first a heavy wide woman sitting in a faded housedress at the kitchen table a big plate of granny smith apples in front of her some of them cored and peeled a sugar bowl white flour and a stick of butter on a nearby counter said it would have been a piebaking day a pot roast was in the oven and two heads of cabbage had been chopped for coleslaw noreen peake was an insomniac and allnight cooking sprees werent uncommon this one ended prematurely shed been decapitated not a neat incision the head lay on the floor several feet from her chair nearby was a butcher knife still flecked with cabbage another knife from the same cutlery setheavier larger had been removed from the rack bloody sneaker prints led to a service staircase on the third floor of the house the young rancher and his wife lay in bed covers tossed aside embracing their heads had been left on though severed jugulars and tracheas said it wasnt for lack of effort the big knife had seared through flesh but failed at bone facial crush wounds compounded the horror a goreencrusted baseball bat lay on the floor in front of the footboard the husbands bat hed been a high school slugger a champ the papers made a big deal about how goodlooking the couple had been in lifewhat was their name ardullo mr and mrs ardullo golden couple everything to live for their faces had been obliterated down the hall the childrens bedrooms the older one a fiveyearold girl was found in her closet the coroner guessed shed heard something and hid the big knife badly bent but intact had been used on her the papers spared its readers further details a playroom separated her room from the babys toys were strewn everywhere the baby was an eightmonthold boy his crib was empty fading sneaker prints led back down to the laundry room and out a rear door where the trail lightened to specks along a winding stone path and disappeared in the dirt bordering the kitchen garden ardis peake was found in his shacka woodslat and tarpaper thing rancid with the stink of a thousand dogs but no animals lived there just peake naked unconscious on a cot surrounded by empty paint cans and glue tubes flasks bearing the label of a cheap mexican vodka an empty filled with urine a plastic packet frosted with white crystal residue was found under the cot methamphetamine blood smeared the rat catchers mouth his arms were reddrenched to the elbows his hair and bedding burgundy graywhite specks in his hair were found to be human cerebral tissue at first he was thought to be another victim but he stirred when prodded later everything washed off fast asleep a scorching smell compounded the reek no stove in the shack just a hot plate powered by an old car battery a tin wastebasket serving as a saucepan had been left on the heat the metal was too thin the bottom was starting to burn through and the stench of charring tin lent a bitter overlay to the reek of offal putrid food unwashed clothes something else heady a stew the babys pajamas on the floor covered by flies ardis peake had never been one for cooking his mother had always taken care of that this morning hed tried heidi ott said i never heard of him till i came to starkweather way before my time so you know what he did said milo killed a family its in his chart claire told me about it before she asked me to work with him said hed been nonviolent since commitment but i should know what i was dealing with i said fine what he did was horrible but you dont end up at starkweather for shoplifting i took the job in the first place because i was interested in the endpoint the endpoint the extremehow low people can go she turned to me as if seeking approval i said extremes interest you i think extremes can teach us a lot what im trying to say is i wanted to see if i was really cut out for mentalhealth work figured if i could handle starkweather i could cope with anything milo said but the job ended up being repetitious theres a lot of routine i guess i was naive thinking i was going to see fascinating things between their medication and their disabilities most of the guys are pretty knocked outpassive thats what i meant by babysitting we make sure they get fed and stay reasonably clean keep them out of trouble give them time out when they pull tantrums the same as youd do with a little kid same thing over and over shift after shift dr argent was new to the job i said any idea if she liked it she seemed to did she talk about why shed transferred from county general no she didnt talk much only workrelated stuff nothing personal was she assigned to ardis peake or did she choose to work with him i think she chose tothe doctors have a lot of freedom we techs are pretty much bound by routine did she say why she wanted to work with peake she stroked her ponytail arched her back all i remember her saying about him was that he was a challenge because of how lowfunctioning he was if we could increase his behavioral repertoire we could do it for anyone that appealed to me learning from the extreme exactly what about the skills for daily living group i said what was her goal there she wanted to see if the men could learn to take better care of themselvesgrooming basic manners paying attention when someone else spoke even with their psychosis how were men picked for the group claire picked them i was just there to assist see any progress slow she said we only had seven sessions tomorrow wouldve been eight she swiped at her eyes any particular disciplinary problems in the group nothing unusual they have their moods you have to be firm and consistent if youre asking if any of them resented her not at all they liked her everyone did tug she chewed her cheek arched her back again it really stinks she was a good teacher very patient i cant believe anyone would want to hurt her even though she didnt get personal said milo did she tell you anything about her life outside work no im sorryi mean you just didnt sit down for coffee with her yet she referred to claire by her first name the instant familiarity of gen x she said i really wish i could tell you more the thing about peakeits nothing right probably nothing said milo but i will want to talk to him she shook her head you dont talk to him not in any normal way most of the time hes totally spaced it took claire and me months just to get him to pay attention well said milo well see what happens she reached back pulled a leaf from the tree and ground it between her fingers i guess i expected that better brace myself for a lecture from swig i probably shouldve gone through him first want me to run interference for you no i can handle it at least i know i did the right thing time to move on anyway maybe do some work with children how much more school do you have i said one more year for a bachelors then graduate work im paying for it all so itll take time one thing about starkweather the pays good but ill find something milo said so youre definitely leaving cant see any reason not to too bad you might be able to help some more help how by trying to draw peake out again her laugh was skittish no thanks detective sturgis i dont want to get any more involved and he doesnt really talk to me either he did the day before claire was killed that wasi dont know what that was all about she said milo smiled i cant convince you huh she smiled back i dont think so think of it as learning more about extremesa challenge if i want a challenge now i rockclimb a climber said milo im afraid of heights you get used to it thats the point i like all sorts of challengesphysical thingsclimbing parasaihng skydiving getting physicals especially important when you work in a place like starkweather having to watch yourself all the time but no exercise no movement anyway she looked at her watch id really like to go now okay okay she shook our hands walked away with an easy athletic stride milo said so what the hell is this thing with peake all about probably nothing i said he muttered something normally heidi wouldnt have noticed after claire was murdered she got scared little ms daredevil jumping out of planes is one thing murders another dr a bad eyes in a box he said what if its not pure gibberish what if peake had a buddy who got out someone who told him he was gonna do something bad to claire it doesnt sound as if peake has buddies heidi said he rooms alone no one wants to associate with him but maybe lets have a closer look at him ardis peake he said long time since he did his thing sixteen years ago i know exactly because id just started homicide first thing they hand me is a screwedup whodunit im sweating over it not getting anywhere wondering if i went into the wrong line of work a few days later peake does his thing over in whateverville some local yokel sheriff solves it the same day i remember thinking some people have all the luck asshole just hands himself over on a platter with garnish few years later when i took that vicap course at quantico the fibbies used peake as a teaching case said he was typical of the disorganized spree killer just about defined the profile raving lunatic with poor hygiene mind coming apart at the seams no serious effort to hide the crime bad eyes in a boxso now hes gone from psycho to prophet or he overheard another patient say something and repeated it i just cant see him involved in claires murder because he is disorganized borderline intelligence and whoever murdered claireand richardplanned meticulously thats assuming peake really is that messed up you think hes been faking all his life you tell meis it possible anythings possible but id say its highly unlikely youre saying hes part of some murderous duo then why would he brag about it on the other hand a guy like that withdrawn never talks someone might figure hes not tuned in let down their guard around him say something interesting if thats what happened maybe peake can focus enough to tell you who it was back to bedlam he said peachy we headed out of the park toward our cars i said one things consistent with what we were just saying about claire picking peake as a project because she wanted serious pathology but what if something else happened along the way in her attempt to open peake up she opened herself uphad the poor judgment to talk about herself in therapist jargon its called selfdisclosure and were taught to be careful about it but people mess up all the timefocusing on themselves instead of the patient claires specialty was neuropsych as a psychotherapist she was a novice she never got personal but with peake she related precisely because peake couldnt relate back so he said she tells him something about a box bad eyes whatever the hell that means and he spits it back maybe a box refers to some kind of bondage game back to dominance you really see her that way im just throwing out suggestions i said maybe claire selected peake out of some great sense of compassion robin disagrees with my impression of claires house she says it just sounds like claire wanted privacy something else he said something that made my little heart go plinkaplink when heidi mentioned peakes name at quantico his case summary was passed around i remember relatively seasoned guys looking at the photos and groaning a couple had to leave the room it was beyond butchery alex i wasnt a hardened bastard yet all i could do was skim he stopped so suddenly that i walked past him several steps what i said one of the photos he said one of the kids the older one peake took the eyes chapter william swig said you think that means something it was just after four pm and we were back in his office milos unmarked was low on gas so he left it at the park and i drove to starkweather on the way he made two calls on the cell phone an attempt to reach the sheriff of treadway california resulted in a rerouting to the voicemail system of a private security firm named bunker protection put on hold for several minutes he finally got through the brief conversation left him shaking his head gone he said the sheriff the whole damn town its a retirement community now called fairway ranch bunker does the policing i talked to some robocop with an attitude all questions of that nature must be referred to national headquarters in chicago the call to swig connected but when we arrived at the hospitals front gate the guard hadnt been informed phoning swigs office again finally got us in but we had to wait awhile before frank dollard showed up to walk us across the yard this time he barely greeted us impending evening hadnt tamed the heat only three men were out on the yard one of them chet waving his huge hands wildly as he told stories to the sky the moment we passed through the end gate dollard stepped away and left us to enter the gray building alone swig was waiting just inside the door he hurried us in to his office now he tented his hands and rocked in his desk chair a box eyesthis is obviously psychotic rambling why would you take it seriously doctor even psychotics can have something to say i said can they i cant say ive found that to be the case maybe its no big lead sir said milo but it does bear followup swigs intercom buzzed he pressed a button and his secretarys voice said bill senator tuck tell him ill call him back back to us so all this comes via heidi ott does she have credibility problems said milo another beep swig jabbed the button irritably the secretary said bill senator tuck says no need to call him back he was just reminding you of your aunts birthday party this sunday fine hold my calls please rolling back swig crossed his legs and showed us his ankles under his blue trousers he wore white sweat socks and brown rubbersoled walkers state senator tucks married to my mothers sister that should help with funding said milo on the contrary state senator tuck doesnt approve of this place thinks all our patients should be hauled outside and shot his views on the matter harden especially during election years must make for spirited family parties a blast swig said sourly where was i yes heidi the thing to remember about heidi is shes a rookie and rookies can be impressionable maybe she heard something maybe she didnt but either way i cant believe it matters even though its ardis peake were talking about him or anyone else the point is hes here locked up securely swig turned to me hes withdrawn severely asocial extremely dyskinesic has a whole boatload of negative symptoms rarely leaves his room since hes been with us hes never shown any signs whatsoever of any highrisk behavior does he receive mail said milo id tend to doubt it but he might id tend to doubt it swig repeated im sure when he was first committed there was some of the usual garbage screwedup women proposing marriage that kind of thing but now hes ancient history obscure the way he should be ill tell you one thing in the four years ive been here hes never received a visitor in terms of his overhearing something he has no friends among the other patients that i or anyone else on the staff is aware of but what if he did anyone he might have overheard would be confined here too unless someones been released recently no ones been released since claire argent came on board i checked i appreciate that no problem said swig our goals the same keep the citizens safe believe me peakes no threat to anyone im sure youre right said milo but if he was receiving mail or sending it no one on the staff would be monitoring it same with his phone calls no one would officially be monitoring content unless peake acted out but swig held up a finger punched four digits on his phone arturo mr swig are you aware of any mailletters packages postcardsanything arriving recently for patient three eight four four three peake ardis even junk mail youre sure anything at all since you can remember keep an eye out okay arturo no no authority for that just let me know if anything shows up thanks he put the phone down arturos been here three years peake doesnt get mail in terms of phone calls i cant prove it to you but believe me nothing he never comes out of his room doesnt talk pretty lowfunctioning subterranean any idea why dr argent chose to work with peake dr argent worked with lots of patients i dont believe she gave peake any special attention his finger rose again springing up he left the office closing the door hard milo said helpful fellow even though it kills him as heidi said he thinks publicitys the kiss of death i was wondering how such a young guy got to be in charge now i know uncle senator may not approve of this place but how much you wanna bet he had something to do with nephew getting the gig the door swung open and swig bounded in carrying a brown cardboard folder bypassing milo he handed it to me and sat down peakes clinical chart thinner than id have predicted twelve pages mostly medication notes signed by various psychiatrists a few notations about the tardive dyskinesia td no change td intensifies more lingual thrust td unsteady gait immediately after arriving at starkweather peake had been placed on thorazine and for fifteen years hed been kept on die drug hed also received several medications for the side effects lithium carbonate tryptophan narcan no change no behav change everything but thorazine had been phased out the test two pages bore four months of nearly identical weekly entries written in a small neat hand indiv sess to monitor verb soc assess beh plan h ott assist c argent phd i passed the chart to milo as you can see dr argent was monitoring his speech not treating him said swig probably measuring his response to medication or something like that how many other patients was she monitoring said milo swig said i dont know her total load nor could i give you specific names without going through extensive review procedures he held out his hand for the folder milo flipped pages for a second and returned it milo said did dr argent seek out severely deteriorated patients swig rolled forward placed his elbows on the desk expelled a short pufflike laugh as opposed to we dont house mild neurotics here so peakes just one of the guys no one at starkweathers one of the guys these are dangerous men we treat them as individuals okay said milo thanks for your time now may i please see peake swig flushed for what purpose were talking barely functioning at this point in my investigation ill take what i can get milo smiled swig made the puffing sound again look i appreciate your dedication to your job but i cant have you coming in here every time some theory emerges way too disruptive and as i told you yesterday its obvious dr argents murder had nothing to do with starkweather the last thing i want to do is disrupt sir but if i ignored this id be derelict swig shook his head poked at a mole tried to smooth the fluff atop his bald head well keep it short mr swig swig dug a nail into his scalp a crescentshaped mark rose on the shiny white skin if i thought that would be the end of it id say sure but i get a clear sense youre hellbent on finding your solution here not at all sir i just need to be thorough all right swig said with sudden anger he seemed to hurl himself upward after fiddling with his tie he took out a chrome ring filled with keys here we go he said jangling loudly lets peek in on mr peake on the ride up the elevator milo said heidi otts not in any hot water is she sir why would she be for telling me about peake swig said am i going to be vindictive christ no of course not she was doing her civic duty how could i be anything other than a proud administrator sir dont worry detective sturgis too much worry is bad for the soul we got out on c ward swig opened the double doors and we walked through room fifteen s r he said the halls were still crowded some of the inmates moved aside as we approached swig paid them no attention walked briskly midway down the hall he stopped and inspected the key ring he was wearing short sleeves and i noticed how muscled his forearms were the bulky sinewed arms of a laborer not a bureaucrat double dead bolts fastened the door the hatch was also keylocked milo said fifteen s r suppression and restraint not because he needs it said swig still shuffling through the keys the s r rooms are smaller so when a patient lives alone we sometimes use them he lives alone because his hygienes not always what it should be swig began shoving keys up the ring finally he found what he was looking for and stabbed both locks the tumblers clicked he held the door open six inches and looked inside swinging it back he said hes all yours sixbysix space unlike the hallways generous ceilings ten feet high or close to it more of a tube than a room high on the walls were mounted thick metal rings fasteners for the iron shackles now coiled up against the plaster like technosculpture soft walls pinkish white covered with some kind of dulllooking foam faint scuff marks said the material couldnt be ripped dim the only light came through a tiny plastic window a skinny vertical rectangle that aped the shape of the room two round recessed ceiling bulbs under thick plastic covers were turned off no internal switch just the one out in the hall a lidless plastic toilet took up one corner precut strips of toilet paper littered the floor no nightstand no real furniture just two plastic drawers built into the foam walls molded no hardware music came from somewhere in the ceiling sugary strings and belching hornssome longforgotten forties pop tune in a major key done by a band that didnt care on a thin mattress attached to a raised plastic platform sat something naked from the waist up skin the color of whey blueveined hairless ribs so deeply etched they evoked a turkey carcass the day after thanksgiving khaki pants covered his bottom half bagging on stick legs stretching over knees as knobby as handcarved canes his feet were bare but dirty the nails untrimmed and brown his head was shaved clean black stubble specked his chin and cheeks very little stubble on top said hed gone mostly bald his cranium was strangely contoured very broad on top the hairless skull flat at the apex furrowed in several places as if a childs fingers had dragged their way through white putty under a bulging shelf of a brow his eyes were lost in mooncrater sockets gray lids cavedin cheeks below the zygomatic arch the entire face tapered radically like a toosharpened pencil the room smelled foul vinegary sweat flatulence burning rubber something dead the music played on nice bouncy dance tune in waltz time ardis said swig peakes head stayed down i bent low caught a full view of his face tiny mouth pinched lipless suddenly it filled a dark wet tongue tip showing itself as a livercolored oval the tongue retreated reappeared peakes cheeks bellowed caved in inflated again he rolled his neck to the left eyes closed mouth open lots of teeth missing swig stepped closer came within three feet of the bed peakes head dropped and he looked down at the floor again his nose was short very thinnot much more than a wedge of cartilageand bent up to the left more putty the child twisting capriciously large but lobeless ears flared battishly narrow veinencrusted hands ended in tentacle fingers that curled over his knees living skeleton id seen a face like that somewhere peakes tongue darted again he started to rock moved his head from side to side rolled his neck blinked spasmodically more tongue thrusts the mouth had flattened gone twodimensional moistened by saliva the lips materializedportwine slash in the center of the triangle vivid against the doughy skin it opened again and the tongue extended completely thick purplish mottled like some cavedwelling slug it hung in the air curled wagged from side to side zipped back out again in again more neckrolling i knew where id seen the face poster art from my college days edvard munchs the scream hairless melting man clutching his face in primal mental agony peake could have posed for the painting his hands remained in his lap but his upper body swayed trembled jerked a few times seemed about to topple then he stopped righted himself looked in our direction hed butchered the ardullos at age nineteen making him thirtyfive he looked ancient ardis said swig no reaction peake was staring in our direction but not making contact he closed his eyes rolled his head another two minutes of tardive ballet swig gave a disgusted look and waved his hand as if to say you asked for it mik ignored that and stepped closer peake began rocking faster licking his lips the tongue emerging curling retreating several toes on his left foot jumped his left hand fluttered ardis its mr swig ive got some visitors for you nothing swig said go ahead detective no response to detective i bent and got down at peakes eye level milo did too peakes eyes had remained closed tiny waves seemed to ruffleeyeballs rolling behind gray skin his chest was white and hairless freckled with blackheads gray nipples a pair of tiny ash piles up close the burning smell was stronger milo said hey with surprising gentleness a few new shoulder tics tongue calisthenics peake rolled his head lifted his right hand held it in midair dropped it heavily hey milo repeated ardis his face was inches from peakes i got closer myself still smelling the combustion but feeling no heat from peakes body my names milo im here to ask you about dr argent peakes movements continued autonomic devoid of intent claire argent ardis your doctor im a homicide detective ardis homicide not an errant eyeblink milo said ardis very loud nothing a full minute passed before the lids lifted halfway then a full view of the eyes black slots pinpoints of light at the center but no definition between iris and white claire argent milo repeated dr argent bad eyes in a box the eyes slammed shut peake rolled his head the tongue explored air one toe jumped this time on the right foot bad eyes said milo nearly whispering but his voice had gotten tight and i knew he was fighting to keep the volume down bad eyes in a box ardis ten seconds fifteen half a minute a box ardis dr argent in a box peakes neuropathic ballet continued unaltered bad eyes milo soothed i was looking into peakes eyes plumbing for some shred of soul flat black lights out a cruel phrase for mental disability came to mind no one home once upon a time hed destroyed an entire family speedily lustily a oneman plague taking the eyes now his eyes were twin portholes on a ship to nowhere no one home as if someone or something had snipped the wires connecting body to soul his tongue shot forward again his mouth opened but produced no sound i kept staring at him trying to snag some kind of response he looked through meno that implied too much effort he was i was no contact neither of us was really there his mouth cratered as if for a yawn no yawn just a gaping hole it stayed that way as his head craned i thought of a blind newborn rodent searching for its mothers nipple the music from the ceiling switched to perfidia done much too slowly ostentatious percussion that seemed to lag behind wanwan trumpets milo tried again even softer more urgent dr argent ardis bad eyes in a box the tardive movements continued random arrhythmic swig tapped his foot impatiently milo stood knees cracking i got to my feet catching an eyeful of the chain on the wall coiled like a sleeping python the room smelled worse peake noticed none of it no behav change chapter outside the room swig said satisfied milo said why dont we give heidi a try with him youve got to be kidding wish i was sir swig shook his head but he hailed a tech standing across the hall get heidi ott kurt kurt hustled off and we waited among the inmates patients did it make a difference what you called them i started to notice lots of tardive symptomsa tremor here lip work therebut nothing as severe as peakes some of the men seemed oriented others could have been on another planet shuffling feet in paper slippers food stains on clothing swig went into the nursing station used the phone glanced at his watch he was back just as heidi ott came through the double doors hello heidi sir because of the information you provided detective sturgis has been trying unsuccessfully to communicate with ardis peake since youve got a track record why dont you give it a shot sir i dont worry said swig your sense of duty is beyond reproach the main thing is lets get to the bottom of this one thing before you go in there youre sure peake actually spoke to youreal words not just grunts yes sir tell me exactly what he said heidi repeated the story and this was the day before dr argent died yes sir had peake talked to you before not about dr argent what did he say nothing much mostly mumbles yeah no nods grunts when we asked him questions tug on the ponytail nothing really thats why i paid attention to when he did start you were monitoring his speech yes sir dr argent was hoping she might be able to increase his verbal output his behavioral output in general i see said swig any particular reason she wanted to do that heidi glanced at us like i told these gentlemen she said he was a challenge a faint scraping sound grew louder and we all turned paper soles on linoleum a few of the men in the hall had drifted closer swig looked at them and they stopped retreated he smiled at heidi looks like youve got the challenge now she went in alone stayed for twenty minutes emerged shaking her head how long do you want me to try thatll be enough said swig it was probably just an isolated incident meaningless rambling for all we know he does that when hes alone thanks heidi you can get back to work wed all better get back to work as i drove off the grounds milo said what the hell turns a human being into thaf answer that and youve got the nobel i said but weve got to be talking biology right no amount of stress can do that the airconditioning was on but sweat dripped offhis nose and spotted his trousers even in concentration camps people rarely went mad from suffering i said and schizophrenia has the same prevalence in nearly every societytwo to four percent cultural factors influence how madness is expressed but they dont cause it so what is itbrain damage genetics the highest risk factor is having a relative with schizophrenia but only a very small percentage of schizophrenics relatives become ill slightly more schizophrenics are born during winter and spring when virus levels are higher some studies have implicated prenatal influenza its all speculation hell he said maybe its just bad luck he wiped his face with a tissue pulled out a panatela unwrapped it and jammed it in his mouth but didnt light up i had a couple crazy relatives he said two auntsmy mothers cousins loony letitia had this thing for baking did it nonstop cookies every day hundreds of them she ended up spending all her money on flour and sugar and eggs started neglecting herself trying to steal ingredients from the neighbors they finally put her away sounds more like manic behavior than schizophrenia i said anyone ever try her on lithium this was years ago alex she died in the asylum choked on her dinner hows that for a bad joke then there was aunt renee stumbling around the neighborhood looking like a mess she lived till she was pretty old died in some county facility he laughed thats my pedigree i had a schizophrenic cousin i said brett two years my senior son of my fathers older brother as children wed played together brett had competed fiercely cheated chronically during college he metamorphosed from a young republican to an sds honcho by his senior year he was an unwashed silent recluse who accumulated narcotics arrests dropped out of sight for five years finally ended up in an iowa boardandcare home i assumed he was still alive thered been no contact between us for over two decades our fathers hadnt been close there you go said milo tainted stock starkweather here we come starkweathers only for the chosen few i said bad little madmen so what makes crazy people violent another nobel question the main ingredients seem to be alcohol and drug use and a strong delusional system but not necessarily paranoia psychotics who kill usually arent trying to protect themselves from attack theyre more likely to be acting on some paranormal or religious delusionwaging war against satan battling space aliens wonder what peakes mission was god only knows i said dope and booze were obviously in play maybe he thought the ardullos were mantises from pluto or nineteen years of twisted sexual impulses finally exploded or a random circuit in his brain shorted out we just dont know why some psychotics blow great ill never be out of work his voice drifted off in one sense i said peakes typical schizophrenic breaks occur most frequently in young adulthood and long before peake fell apart hed been showing signs of schizotypyits a fancy name for oddness low mental skills social ineptitude poor grooming eccentricities some eccentrics stay mildly strange others move on to fullblown schizophrenia oddness he said take a walk in the park walk out of a restaurant therere some odd guys wanting spare change which ones gonna start wielding the cleaver i didnt answer he said if peake had any sort of thought system he must have been in a helluva lot better shape than what we saw today probably though behind all the tardive symptoms there could still be some thinking going on what does tardive mean exactly lateonset its a reaction to thorazine is it reversible no at best he wont get worse and hes still crazy so what goods the thorazine doing him neuroleptics are best at controlling delusions hallucinations bizarre behavior what psychiatrists call the positive symptoms of schizophrenia the negativespoor speech flat mood apathy attentional problemsdont usually respond drugs cant put back whats missing wellbehaved vegetables he said peakes an extreme case possibly because he didnt start out with that much intellect his tds also very severe though hes not getting that much thorazine despite what bollard told us about highdosing peakes prescription has remained at five hundred milligrams well within the recommended range they probably havent needed to highdose him because he behaves himself behaves very little psychologically hes disappeared milo removed the cigar placed it between his index fingers and sighted over the tobacco bridge if peake was taken offthorazine would he be able to talk more its possible but he could also fall apart maybe even revert to violence and dont forget he was on thorazine when he talked to heidi so hes capable of speech while medicated are you still taking this inabox stuff seriously nah i guess i cant get away from the eye thinghey maybe im delusional and peakes a true prophet maybe satan has dispatched the pluto mantises maybe i said but would he inform peake he laughed chewed the cigar some more bad eyes in a box for all we know claire tried talking to him about his crime and sparked some kind of memory in a box could mean his own incarceration or something else or nothing at all okay okay enough of this he said pocketing the cigar back to basics check out claires finances and stargilfs go over richards file again too for the hundredth time but maybe theres something i missed and if youre not jammed nows as good a time as any to go see dr theobold at county maybe one of us will come up with something remotely resembling a factoid he grinned lacking that ill settle for some juicy delusions chapter i called dr myron theobolds office and got an appointment for tenfifteen the next morning by ninefortyfive i was clearing my head in the fast lane of the east enduring the crawl to the interchange moving with the smog stream toward san bernardino i got off a few exits later on soto street in east la drove past the county morgue and pulled into the main entrance of the duncolored metropolis that was county general hospital perenially underfunded and overstressed countys a wonder firstrate medicine for the tired and the poor last stop for the hopeless and the addled id done some clinical training here taught occasional seminars but it had been two years since id set foot on the hospital campus outwardly little had changedthe same sprawl of bulky homely buildings the constant parade of people in uniforms the halting march of the ill one of those hot overcast days that makes everything look decayed but after starkweather county seemed fresh almost perky theobolds office was on the third floor of unit iv one of the halfdozen nofrills annexes sprouting at the rear of the complex like afterthoughts dazedlooking men and women in openbacked pajamas wandered whitetiled halls two grim nurses escorted a heavy black woman toward an open door ivs in both her arms tears marked her cheeks like dew on asphalt in an unseen place someone retched the overhead pager recited names emotionlessly theobolds secretary occupied a space not much bigger man peakes cell surrounded by gunmetal filing cabinets a stuffed garfield clung to the handle of one drawer empty chair a note said back in min theobold must have heard me enter because he stuck his head out of me rear doorway dr delaware come on in id met him a few years ago and he hadnt changed much sixtyish medium height and build graying fair hair white beard large nose closeset brown eyes behind aviator specs he wore a widelapeled herringbone sport coat the color of iced tea a beige vest checked with blue a white shirt a blue tie i followed him into his office he was a psychiatry vicechairman and a respected neurochemistry researcher but his space wasnt much more generous than the secretarys haphazardly furnished with what looked like castoffs it sported another collection of file cases brown metal furniture a storm of books an attempt to freshen things up with a fauxnavajo rug had failed long ago the rugs threads were unraveling its color bands fading the desk supported a turbulent swirl of paperwork theobold squeezed behind the desk and i took one of the two metal chairs wrinkling the fake navajo so he said its been a while youre still officially faculty arent you courtesy faculty i said no salary how long since youve been down here couple of years i said his attempts at cordiality were deepening the lines on his face i appreciate your seeing me no problem he cleared the area around the phone papers flew i had no idea you led such an interesting life police consultant do they pay well about the same as medical he managed a chuckle so what have you been up to otherwise still at western peds occasionally i do some consulting mostly legal work a few shortterm treatment cases able to deal with the hmos i avoid them when i can he nodded so youre here about poor claire i suppose that detective thought id confide secrets to you that i withheld from him but therets really nothing more to tell i think he felt it was more a matter of knowing the right questions to ask i see he said persistent type sturgis smarter than he lets on he tried to disarm me by playing to class consciousnessim the humble workingclass cop youre the big smart doctor interesting approach does it work hes got a good solve rate good for him the problem is he was wasting his acting talents on me i wasnt holding back i have no inside information about claire i knew her as a researcher not as a person everyone seems to say that about her well then he said at least im consistent so no one has much to offer about her i nodded and here i thought it was methe way i run my projects what do you mean i like to think of myself as a humane administrator hire good people trust them to do their jobs for the most part keep my hands off i dont get involved in their personal lives im not out to parent anyone he stopped as if expecting me to pass judgment on that i said claire worked for you for six years she must have liked that i suppose howd you find her id put in for my grant and she applied for the neuropsych position she was completing a postdoc at case western had published two papers as a grad student sole author nothing earthshattering but encouraging her interestalcoholism and reaction timesmeshed with mine no shortage of alcoholics here i thought shed be able to attract her own funding and she did all facts id read in claires resume so she worked with you and on her own research twentyfive percent of her time was her research the rest she spent on my longitudinal study of neuroleptic outcomes nimh grant three experimental drugs plus placebo doubleblind she tested the patients helped organize the data we just got renewed for five more years i just hired her replacementbright kid from stanford walter yee who else worked on the study i said three research fellows besides clairetwo mds one phd pharmacologist was she friendly with any of them i wouldnt know as i said i dont meddle its not one of those situations where we fraternize after hours fiveyear renewal i said so there was no financial reason for her to leave not in the least she probably couldve renewed her own study too she had substanceabuse money from nih completed the final study before she left inconclusive results but well run very decent chance but she never applied he glanced upward never even told me she was allowing the grant to lapse so she must have been intending to leave for some time looks that way i was pretty irritated at her for not wanting to follow through for not communicating irked at myself too for not staying in touch if shed come to me most likely id have been able to raise her to fulltime or to find her something else she was very good at what she did dependable no complaints i managed to get dr yee on fulltime but she never bothered to i suppose youre right she wanted to leave i have no idea why so she never complained not once even the way she told me she was leavingno personal meeting she just sent in a summary of her data with a note that the grant was finished and so was she that reminded me of the way shed divorced joe stargill whod she work with on her own grant she got parttime secretarial help from the main pool ran all her own studies analyzed her own data that was also irksome im sure she couldve applied for ancillary funding brought more money into the department but she always wanted to work by herself i suppose i should be grateful she took care of herself never bothered me for anything the last thing i need is someone who requires handholding still i suppose i shouldve paid more attention a loner i said but all of us are in my group i didnt think id been hiring antisocial types but perhaps on some level wide smile did you know i started as an analyst really you bet classical freudian couch and all thishe touched the beardused to be a very analytic goatee i attended the institute right after residency got halfway throughhundreds of hours cultivating the proper hmm before i realized it wasnt for me wasnt for anyone in my estimation except possibly woody alien and look at the shape hes in i quit enrolled in the biochem phd program at usc im sure those choices mean something psychodynamically but id rather not waste time trying to figure out what claire seemed to me the same wayscientific focused on reality selfpossessed still she must have been terribly unhappy here why do you say that leaving for a place like that have you been there yesterday whats it like highly structured lots of highdose medication brave new world he said i cant see why claire would have wanted that maybe she craved clinical work nonsense he said sharply then he smiled apologetically what i mean is she couldve had all the clinical work she wanted right here no i must have missed something could i talk to the other fellows i said why not walt yee didnt know her of course and i dont believe shashi lakshman did eitherhes the pharmacologist has his own lab in a separate building but maybe she interfaced with the mdsmary hertzlinger and andy velman let me call shashi first a few seconds on the phone confirmed that dr lakshman had never met claire we took the stairs down to a secondfloor lab and found doctors hertzlinger and velman typing at personal computers both psychiatric fellows were in their thirties and had on white coats mary hertzlinger wore a short brown dress under hers she was thin with cropped platinumblond hair ivory skin wellformed but chapped lips andrew velmans coat was buttoned up high revealing a black shirt collar and the tight knot of a lemonyellow tie he was short broad with black wavy hair a gold stud hi his left ear i asked them about claire velman spoke first in a clipped voice virtual stranger ive been here two years and maybe we exchanged twenty sentences she always seemed too busy to hang out also i do the structured clinical interviews on the study and she did the neuropsych testing so at any given time wed be with different patients did she ever say why she was leaving to work at starkweather no he said i didnt even know about that until mary told me he glanced at hertzlinger so didtheobold she held her coat closed with one hand and said she told me a few days before she left low smooth voice i had a really small office on the floor below and she asked me if i wanted hers i went to look at it and said yes helped her carry some boxes to her car she said her grant had run out and she hadnt tried to renew it shed just written a note informing drtheobold theobold said what reason did she give you mary none what was her mood when she told you i said pretty calm not agitated or upset id have to describe her as calm and deliberate as if shed planned it for a while was at peace with it time to move on said velman did you socialize with her i asked hertzlinger she shook her head same thing as andywe had almost no contact ive only been here a year we saw each other in the cafeteria and had coffee maybe three four times never lunch i never saw her eat lunch sometimes when i was on my way out to the caf id pass her office and her door would be open and shed be at her desk working i remember thinking what a work ethic she must be extremely productive the times you did have coffee i said what did you talk about work data after i found out what happened to her i realized how little i knew about her its so grotesquedo the police have any idea who did it not yet terrible she said velman said had to have something to do with starkweather look at the patient population she got herself involved with i said only problem is the patients dont get out never so they claim he frowned did she tell either of you that she was going to starkweather velman shook his head mary hertzlinger said she told me the day we moved the boxes it surprised me but i didnt question hershe was like that you didnt get personal with her did she give a reason i said not really a reason she said but she did say something uncharacteristically flippant wed just loaded the car she thanked me wished me luck and then she smiled almost smugly what was funny said theobold exactly said hertzlinger i said something to the effect that im glad youre pleased about your plans thats when she said it its not a matter of being pleased mary so many madmen so little time chapter she was in a big damn hurry to work with psychotics said milo it was noon we were standing next to the seville on butler avenue across from the west la station she had plenty of psychotics at county i said she wanted madmen why to squeeze a few more syllables out of them to hell with all that alex im concentrating on the boring stuff for now located a safedeposit box at her bank actually managed to finagle my way in with the death certificate no cash no dope no b d videos no drooling letters from psycho pen pals stone empty so if she did have some secret life going she kept it very well wrapped maybe we should go back furthergrad school the years before she moved to la i can try talking to someone at case western sure but tomorrow youll have a chance at something better her parents are arriving on the redeye tonight i have a date with them at eight am down at the morgue no need for them to view the body tried to talk them out of it but they insisted after all that fun ill try to sit down with them ill give you a call where and when probably be late afternoon several young officers walked by he watched them for a while stared at the roof of the seville flicked dirt off the vinyl reviewing richards file was sobering not as much of a file as i remembered the only people i spoke to were richards landlady and parents and the staff at the restaurant where he worked no listings in the known associates column sound familiar i made another try at locating the film outfit that richard mightve auditioned forthin line still cant find a trace of them youd think even a rinkydink outfit would make a mark somewhere something about the movie bothers you theyve got carpenters on movie sets right all sorts of tools including saws plenty of knives in restaurants too maybe ill go back there one possible angle on thin line i said even flybynights need equipment a small outfit would be likely to rent rather than own why not check some of the leasing companies very good he said thank you sir he laughed any other case i wouldnt consider the film thing half a lead but these twoyou dont wanna blame the victim alex but the least they couldve done is relate to someone i wanted another look at claires resume so the two of us crossed over to the station and walked upstairs to the detectives room milo retrieved the box of material hed taken from claires house he hadnt booked it into the evidence room meaning hed planned some review himself he left to get a cup of coffee while i searched i found the resume near the middle neatly typed and stapled the witeout in the marital status slot was a chalky lozenge shed been born in pittsburgh lived there through college before moving to cleveland to attend case western thousands of miles from richard dadas arizona childhood little chance of a connection there i scrounged until i found the first study shed published the student research that had impressed myron theobold solo author just as hed said but at the bottom of the first page in very small print were acknowledgments and thanks to the case western graduate fund for supplies and data analysis to my parents ernestine and robert ray argent for their unwavering support throughout my education and to my dissertation chairman professor harry i racano for his thoughtful guidance one pm in la was four in cleveland using milos phone i dialed information none of the other detectives paid notice to a civilian using city equipment scrawling the number for case westerns psychology department i called and asked for professor racano the woman at the other end said im sorry but theres no one here by that name he used to be on the faculty let me check our faculty directory several moments passed no im sorry sir not in the current directory or the emeritus list is there anyone around who worked in the department ten years ago silence hold on please another five minutes before another woman said may i ask what this is about im calling from the los angeles police department literally unfortunately one of your alumnae dr claire argent was murdered and were trying to locate anyone who might have known her back in cleveland oh she said murdered my god thats terrible argent no ive only been here six years she must have been before my timehow terrible let me check i heard paper shuffling yes here she is on the alumni roster and she was professor racanos student yes maam well im sorry to tell you professor racanos deceased as well died right after i came on cancer nice man very supportive of his students racanos tolerance of claires solo launch suggested an easygoing nature is there anyone who might have known dr argent ms mrs bausch hmm im afraid there arent too many people in the building right now theres a big symposium going on over at the main auditorium one of our professors just won a prize i can ask around and get back to you id appreciate that i gave her milos name just as i put the phone down it rang milo was nowhere in sight so i took the call detective sturgiss desk a familiar voice said id like to leave a message for detective sturgis heidi its dr delaware oh hilisten im sorry i couldnt get anything out of peake today dont worry about it it didnt help my credibility with swig either after you were gone he called me into his office and made me go over the whole thing again what peake said when he said it was i sure i heard right sorry for the hassle it wouldve sure been nice to be able to prove it anyway i just wanted to call to let detective sturgis know ive decided to leave starkweather in a couple of weeks but if theres anything else he needs he can call me thanks heidi ill tell him so she said you actually work there right at the police station no i just happen to be here today sounds interesting meanwhile ill keep trying with peake maybe something will come up dont put yourself in any jeopardy what from ardis you saw his condition not exactly dangerous not that i let my guard downdo you think claire did dont know i said i keep thinking about her what happened to her it seems so strange that anything could touch her what do you mean she seemed like one of those peoplecaught up in their own worlds like she was happy being alone didnt need anyone else chapter i called home before leaving the station robin was out and all that awaited me was paperworkfinal reports on custody cases that had already been decided i told my own voice on the message machine that id be back by five talking to myself put a cell phone in a psychotics hand and he could fake normalcy the encounter with ardis peake had stayed with me monster hard to connect that mute emaciated husk with someone capable of destroying an entire family what better endorsement for mr swigs highly structured system what turns a human being into that id given milo the shortversion lecture and hed been gracious enough not to complain but i had no real answers no one did i wondered what questions had led claire to starkweather and peake shed gravitated to him shortly after taking the job why of all the madmen had he been the one whose pathology had drawn her in the other thing that troubled me was peakes assault on the eyes of the little ardullo girl had i been too hasty minimizing his gibbering at heidi or perhaps it was simple claire had learned about the eyes and discussed it with him had it elicited something in him guilt excitement a horrible nostalgia bad eyes in a box was the box a coffin peakes imagery of the dead child reliving the crime and feeding off the memory the way lust killers did it all hinged on learning more about claire and so far her ghost had avoided capture no entanglements no known associates not much impact on her world ardis peake on the other hand had been a star in his day i drove to westwood and used the computers at the us research library to look up the ardullo massacre the murders had been covered nationally for one week the periodicals index offered half a page of citations and i went looking for microfiche most of the articles were nearly identically worded lifted intact from wire service reports an arrest headshot showed a young peake stickfaced hollowcheeked sporting a full head of long stringy dark hair wildeyed startled a cornered animal the edvard munch screamer on jet fuel a large bruise spread beneath his left eye the left side of his face swelled rough arrest if so it hadnt been reported the facts were as i remembered them multiple stab wounds crushing skull fractures extensive mutilation cannibalism the articles filled in names and places scott and theresa ardullo thirtythree and twentynine respectively married six years both uc davis agricultural grads he the scion of a prosperous farming family had developed an interest in winegrowing but concentrated on peaches and walnuts brittany five years old justin eight months next came the happiertimes family photo scott hand in hand with a restlesslooking little girl who resembled her mother theresa holding the baby pacifier in justins mouth fat cheeks ballooning around the nipple ferns wheel in the background some kind of fair scott ardullo had been muscular blond crewcut grinning with the full pleasure of one who believes himself blessed his wife slender somewhat plain with long dark hair held in place by a white band seemed less certain about happy endings i couldnt bear another look at the childrens faces no picture of noreen peake just an account of the way shed been found sitting at the kitchen table my imagination added the smell of apples cinnamon flour a ranch superintendent named teodoro alarcon had found noreens body then discovered the rest of it hed been placed under sedation no quote from him treadways sheriff jacob haas said i served in korea and this was worse than anything i ever saw overseas scott and terri took those people in out of the goodness of their hearts and this is how they get repaid its beyond belief anonymous townspeople cited peakes strange habits he mumbled to himself didnt bathe cruised alleys pawed through garbage cans ate trash everyone had known of his fondness for sniffing propellants no one had thought him dangerous one other attributed quote everyone always knew he was weird but not that weird said a local youth derrick crimmins he didnt hang out with anyone no one wanted to hang with him because he smelled bad and he was just too weird maybe into satan or something no other mention of satanic rituals and i wondered if thered been any followup probably not with peake out of circulation treadway was labeled a quiet farming and ranching community the worst things we usually have said sheriff haas are bar fights once in a while some equipment theft nothing like this never anything like this and that was it no coverage of the ardullos funeral or noreen peakes i kept spooling found a threeline paragraph in the la times two months later reporting peakes commitment to starkweather using treadway as a keyword pulled up nothing since the murders quiet town extinct town how did an entire community die had peake somehow killed it too milo called in a message while i was out on my morning run mr and mrs argent the flight inn on century boulevard room one pm i did some paperwork set out at twelvethirty taking sepulveda toward the airport centurys a wide sad strip that cuts through southern la turn east off the freeway and you might end up in some gang gully carjacked or worse west takes you to lax past the bleak functionalism of airport hotels cargo depots private parking lots topless joints the flight inn sat next to a speedy express maintenance yard too large to be a motel it hadnt passed through hotel puberty three stories of whitepainted block yellow gutters cowgirlridinganairplane logo inconspicuous entry off to the right topped by a pink neon vacancy sign the bilevel selfpark wrapped itself around the main building no security in the lot that i could see i left the seville in a groundfloor space and walked to the front as a roared overhead a banner out in front advertised kingsize beds color tv and discount coupons to happy hour at someplace called the golden goose the lobby was redcarpeted furnished with vending machines selling combs and maps and keychains with disney characters on the fobs the black clerk at the counter ignored me as i strolled down the whiteblock hall fastfood cartons had been left outside several of the red doors that lined the corridor the air was hot and salty though we were miles from the ocean room was at the back milo answered my knock looking weary no progress or something else the room was small and boxy the decor surprisingly cheery twin beds under blue quilted floral covers that appeared new floatingmallard prints above the headboard a fakecolonial writing desk sporting a bible and a phone book a pair of hardpadded armchairs nineteeninch tv mounted on the wall two black nylon suitcases were placed neatly in one corner two closed plywood doors chipped at the bottom faced the bed closet and bathroom the woman perched on a corner of the nearer bed had the toogood posture of paralyzing grief handsome early sixties coldwaved hair the color of weak lemonade white pearlescent glasses on a gold chain around her neck conservative makeup she wore a chocolatebrown dress with a pleated bottom and white pique collar and cuffs brown shoes and purse diamondchip engagement ring thin gold wedding band gold scallopshell earrings she turned toward me firm angular features held their own against gravity the resemblance to claire was striking and i thought of the matron claire would never become milo made the introductions ernestine argent and i said pleased to meet you at exactly the same time one side of her mouth twitched upward then her lips jammed shuta smile reflex dying quickly i shook a cold dry hand a toilet flushed behind one of the plywood doors and she returned her hands to her lap on the bed nearby was a white linen handkerchief folded into a triangle the door opened and a man drying his hands with a hand towel struggled to emerge working at it because he could barely fit through the doorway no more than fiveseven he had to weigh close to four hundred pounds a pink egg dressed in a longsleeved white shirt gray slacks white athletic shoes the bathroom was narrow and he had to edge past the sink to get out breathing deeply he winced took several small steps finally squeezed through the effort reddened his face folding the towel he tossed it onto the counter and stepped forward very slowly rocking from side to side like a barge in choppy water the trousers were spotless poly twill held up by clipon suspenders the athletic shoes appeared crushed each step made something in his pocket jingle he was around the same age as his wife had a full head of dark curly hair a fine almost delicate nose a fulllipped mouth pouched by bladder cheeks three chins shaved close brown eyes nearly buried in flesh managed to project a pinpoint intensity he looked at his wife studied me continued to lumber mentally paring away adipose i was able to visualize handsome structure he pressed forward perspiring breathing hard and raspy when he reached me he stopped swayed righted himself stuck out a hamhock arm his hands were smallish his grip dry and strong robert ray argent a deep wheezy voice like a bass on reverb issued from the echo chamber of his enormous body cavity for a second i imagined him hollow inflated but that fantasy faded as i watched him struggle to get to the nearer bed every step sounded on the thin carpeting each limb seemed to shimmy of its own accord his forehead was beaded dripping i resisted the urge to take his elbow his wife got up with the handkerchief and wiped his brow he touched her hand for an instant thanks honey sit down rob ray both of them with that soft distinctive pittsburgh drawl moving slowly bending deliberately he lowered himself the mattress sank down to the box spring and creaked the box spring nearly touched the carpet rob ray argent sat spreadlegged inner thighs touching the gray fabric of his pants stretched shiny over dimpled knees pulled up taut over a giant pumpkin of a belly he inhaled a few times cleared his throat put his hand to his mouth and coughed his wife stared off at the open bathroom door before walking over closing it sitting back down so he said youre a psychologist like claire dark circles under his armpits yes i said he nodded as if wed reached some agreement sighed and placed his hands on the apex of his abdomen ernestine argent reached over and handed him the handkerchief and he dabbed at himself some more she pulled another white triangle from her purse and pecked at her own eyes milo said i was just telling mr and mrs argent about the course of the investigation ernestine gave a small involuntary cry honey robert ray said she said im okay darling almost inaudibly and turned to me claire loved psychology i nodded she was all we ever really had rob ray looked at her parts of his face had turned plumcolored other sections were pink beige whiteapplepeel mottle caused by the variable blood flow through expanses of skin he turned to milo doesnt sound like youve learned much whats the chance you find the devil who did it im always optimistic sir the more you and mrs argent can tell us about claire the better our chances what else can we tell you said ernestine no one disliked claire she was the nicest person she cried rob ray touched her shoulder with his hand im sorry she finally said this isnt helping what do you need to know well said milo lets get a basic time frame for starters when was the last time you saw claire christmas said rob ray she always came home for christmas we always had a nice family time no exception last christmas she helped her mother with the cooking said in la she never cooked too busy just ate things out of cans takeout consistent with the kitchen at cape horn drive christmas said milo haifa year ago thats right rob ray flexed his left foot that would be right around the time claire left county hospital and moved to starkweather hospital guess so milo said did she talk about changing jobs headshakes nothing at all more silence ernestine said she never talked about her work in specifics we never wanted to be nosy they hadnt known i watched milo hide his amazement rob ray tried to shift his weight on the bed one leg cooperated milo said did claire talk about any sort of problems she might be having someone who was giving her difficultyat work or anywhere else no said rob ray she had no enemies that i can tell you for sure how did she act during her christmas visit fine normal christmas was always a happy time for us she was happy to be home we enjoyed having her how long did she stay four days like always we went to a bunch of movies she loved her movies saw the pittsburgh ice extravaganza too when she was a little girl she skated the last day she came into our store helped us out a bitwere in giftware have to stay open somewhat during the holiday season movies i said joseph stargill had said the same thing thats rightthe whole family loves em said rob ray she was happy had no problems said ernestine the only problem for us was we didnt see her enough but we understood what with her career and travels hard for us the business no buckpassing when its yours said rob ray also i dont travel wellmy size but so what this had nothing to do with claires trip home or her problems thered be no reason for anyone to hate her this had to be some maniac on the loosesomewhere from that place she worked his skin had deepened to scarlet and his words emerged between rough inhalations i tell you i find out anyone put her in danger ill lets just say a lot of lives are going to be made miserable darling said his wife patting his knee to us what my husbands saying is claire was kind and generous and sweet no one couldve hated her generous to the nth rob ray agreed back in high school she was always the first to volunteer to help others old people at the hospital animals at the shelterdidnt matter she was there at the head of the line she loved animals especially we used to have a dog a little scottie you know how kids never take responsibility with pets its always the parents who end up with it not our situation claire did everything feeding it cleaning up after it she was always trying to fix thingsbroken wings on bugs anything we knew shed be some kind of doctor i wouldve guessed a veterinarian but psychologist was fine she always got good gradesit doesnt make sense detective sturgis at the morguewhat we just sawi just dont it had to be a maniacthis starkweather place is nothing but maniacs yes sir said milo its the first thing we looked at so far no leads apparently the inmates never get out sure said rob ray isnt there always some screwup that lets someone out some stupid mistake tears began coursing silently down the jelly of his cheeks youre right sir said milo but so far i havent come up with anything his tone had gentled suddenly he seemed like a much younger man well said rob ray i can tell youre good people where you from originally your folks i mean indiana satisfied nod i know youre trying suddenly one logarm moved with astonishing speed slamming upward to the big mans face as he ground the handkerchief to his eyes oh rob said his wife and she was crying again too milo went into the bathroom and brought them water rob ray argent said thanks im supposed to drink a lot anyway for my joints keep them lubricated half a shrug made his sloping shoulders jiggle he plucked shirt fabric out of a fat fold milo said so claire visited only on christmas yes sir is that since she moved to los angeles or since she went to graduate school in cleveland los angeles said rob ray when she was at case western she came home for thanksgiving easter summers she helped us out in the store summers once she moved to la how often did she write silence were phoners not writers said ernestine long distance is so economical nowadays we have one of those calling plans i remembered claires phone bills no recent calls to pittsburgh had she dialed her parents from the office or had she become a stranger to them adding them to the club of strangers wed encountered at every turn so she called said milo thats right said ernestine every so often milo scribbled what about her marriage and the divorce anything i should know about that ernestine lowered her eyes her husband took a long noisy breath she said shed gotten married in reno he said soon after one of her calls so she told you over the phone said milo did she seem happy about it id say yes said ernestine she apologized for not telling us before said it was one of those sudden things love at first sight she said the husband was a nice fellow a lawyer but you never met him im sure we wouldve but claire didnt stay married to him very long two years no contact so she visited on christmas while she was married no said ernestine not during the marriage last christmas she was divorced already milo said did she explain why she got divorced she called after it happened said she was fine everything was friendly she used that word said milo friendly or something to that effect she was trying to reassure me that was claire take care of everyone else she glanced at her husband he said i know this sounds weird to youour not meeting him no big white wedding but claire always needed her freedom she it wasthats just the way she was give her her freedom and she got straight as she was always a good kida great kid who were we to argue you do your best who knows how your kids are going to turn out she turned out great we gave her freedom focusing on me during most of the speech i nodded we asked to meet him he said the husband she said shed bring him by but she never did i got the feeling it didnt work too well from the beginning whys that because she never brought him out but she never actually complained about the marriage said milo she never said she was unhappy said rob ray if thats what youre getting at why do you suspect him of having anything to do with it no said milo just trying to learn what i can youre sure absolutely sir at this point hes not a suspect no one is unfortunately well said rob ray i know youd tell us if it was different the only mention she made of him was sometimes at the end of a conversation she might say joe sends his regards she did say he was a lawyer not a courtroom lawyer a business lawyer when she called he was never home i got the feeling he was always working she was too one of those modern marriages thats probably what happened they were too busy for each other ernestine said she did send us a picture of the wedding the chapel so we knew what he looked like a redhead i remember joking to rob ray about little gingerhaired grandchildren she started to cry again checked it apologized under her breath rob ray said youd have to know the kind of girl she was to understand very independent she always took care of herself took care of others too i said exactly so you can see why shed need to unwind and she unwinds by going off by herself to the movies or reading a book privacys a big thing with her so we try to respect that mostly she does things by herself except when we go out to the movies together she likes doing that with me were both crazy for the movies the lapse into present tense made my own eyes begin to ache he mightve realized it too his shoulders lowered suddenly as if someone had pushed down upon them and he stared at the bedcovers any particular kind of movies i said anything good he mumbled his face stayed down it was something we did together i never pushed her to do sports tell the truth being large i wasnt exactly ready to run around myself so i was glad she was that kind of kid could sit still and watch a movie even when she was tiny said ernestine she could amuse herself she was the sweetest little thing i could leave her in her playpen go about my housework and no matter what was happening all around her shed just sit there and play with whatever you put in there creating her own world i said her smile was sudden unsettling exactly doctor you put your ringer right on it no matter what was happening all around her she created her own world no matter what was happening all around her second time shed used the phrase within seconds did it imply some kind of family turmoil i said privacy as an escape rob ray looked up uneasiness in his eyes i tried to engage him he turned away ernestine watched him twisted the handkerchief about the way claire got married she said rob ray and i had a big church wedding and it put my father in debt for two years i always thought one of claires intentions was to be considerate what put a light in her eyes said rob ray was consideration helping people before mr stargill said milo did claire have any other boyfriends she dated said ernestine in high school i mean she wasnt some social butterfly but she went out local boys nothing steady a fellow named gil grady took her to the prom hes a fire lieutenant now what about later said milo college graduate school silence how about once she moved to la im sure said ernestine that when she wanted to date she had her pick she was always very pretty somethingprobably her most recent memory of her daughter gray damaged laid out on a steel tablecaused her face to collapse she hid herself behind both hands her husband said i cant see where this is leading us anywhere milo looked at me just one more thing please i said did claire ever get involved in arts and crafts painting woodwork that kind of thing crafts said rob ray she drew like any other kid but thats about it mostly she liked to read and go to the movies said ernestine no matter what was happening all around her she could always find some quiet time for herself rob ray said excuse me lifting himself laboriously he began the trudge to the bathroom the three of us waited until the door closed running water sounded through the wood ernestine began speaking softly frantically this is so hard on him when claire was growing up children made fun of him cruel children its glandular sometimes he eats less than i do she stopped as if daring us to debate hes a wonderful man claire was never ashamed never treated him any way but respectful claire was always proud of her family no matter what the last word ended too abruptly i waited for more her lips folded inward as she bit down on them her chin shuddered hes all ive got now im worried about what this will do to him another toilet flush several moments later the door opened and rob rays big head appeared repeat of the laborious exit the huffing trek to the bed when he finally settled he said i dont want you to think claire was some strange kid all locked up in her room she was a tough kid took care of herself wouldnt fall in with anything bad for her so this had to be an abduction some kind of maniac talking louder more forcefully as if hed refueled claire was no fool he went on claire knew how to take care of herselfhad to know because she lived alone i said becauseyes exactly my little girl was independent later sitting in a coffee shop on la tijera with milo i said so much pain oh man he said they seem like good people but talk about delusions making like its one happy family yet claire never bothers to bring the husband around never calls she cut them off alex why something the mother said made me wonder about family chaos she used the phrase no matter what was happening all around her three times emphasizing that claire coped well maybe there was turmoil but theyre sure not going to tell you now pretty memories are all theyve got and why would it matter he smiled all of a sudden the past isnt relevant its always relevant to someones life i said but it may not have had a thing to do with claires death at least i dont see it a maniac like the old man said he and his wife might be holding back family secrets but i dont think theyd obstruct you i said claires been out here for years i think las more relevant than pittsburgh or cleveland he gazed past me toward the cash register waved for service other than two redeyed truckers at separate booths we were the only customers a waitress came over young nasal eager to please when she left with our sandwich order i said if she grew up with disruption wanted her adult life quiet that empty living room makes a bit more sense but how it helped make her a victim i dont know milo tapped a front incisor dads size alone wouldve been disruptive kids making fun of him claire having to deal with it he drank coffee peered through the coffee shops front window an unseen jetliners overhead pass shook the building maybe thats it i said growing up with him could alsove made her comfortable with folks who were different but when it came to her personal life she drew a clear line no fuss no mess escaping to solitude just as she had as a child the waitress brought the sandwiches she looked disappointed when milo said thered be nothing else he took a bite of soggy ham as i assessed my burger thin shiny the color of dry mud i put it aside one of the truckers tossed cash on the table and hobbled out the front door milo took two more gulps of his sandwich nice how you worked the artsandcrafts question in hoping for some woodshop memories wouldnt that have been nice he bit down on something disagreeable and held the bread at arms length before returning it to the plate some scene at the morgue the coroner did his best to put her back together but it was far from pretty i tried to discourage them again from viewing they insisted mom actually handled it okay it was dad who started breathing real hard turned beet red braced himself against the wall i thought wed end up with another corpse the morgue attendants been staring at the poor guy like hes some freakoftheweek now hes really gawking i got them out of there thank god he didnt collapse neither of us talked for a while ever the prisoner of my training i lapsed into thoughts of claires childhood escape from something finding refuge in solitude because solitude spun layers of fantasy theater of the mind real theaters i said claires love of movies thats something both the parents and stargill mentioned what if it led beyond just watching caused her to have acting aspirations what if she answered a casting callthe same one richard dada answered she likes flicks so all of a sudden she wants to be a star why not i said its la maybe claire did a bit on blood walk too theres your link with richard the killer met both of them on the set everything weve learned about this woman tells us shes a privacy nut you think shed put herself in front of a camera ive known actors who were extremely shy taking on someone elses identity allowed them to cut loose i guess he said doubtfully so they both meet some loon on the set and he decides to pick them off for god knows what motive then why the time lapse between the murders maybe there are other murders in between that we dont know about i looked for similars anything in car trunk anything with eye wounds or saw marks nothing okay i said just a theory the waitress came over and asked if we wanted dessert milos barked no thanks made her step backward and hurry away i understand about roleplaying alex but were talking ms empty room her big thrill was being alone i can see her taking in a matinee by herself pretending to be sharon starlet whatever but going to the movies isnt being in the movies hell i still cant believe theres no link to starkweather the woman worked with homicidal murderers for gods sake and im expected to take it on faith that none of them got out and hunted her down meanwhile we sit here wondering about some hypothetical acting gig he pressed both temples and i knew a headache had come on the waitress brought the check and held it out at arms length milo shoved a twenty at her asked for aspirin ordered her to keep the change she smiled and hustled away looking frightened when she brought the tablets he swallowed them dry to hell with swig and his court orders time to get with state parole see what they can tell me about starkweather creeps flewing the coop since claire went to work there after that sure the movie thing why not equipment rentals like you suggested crumpling the aspirin packet he dropped it into an ashtray like you said its la since when has logic ever meant a damn thing here chapter in the coffeeshop parking lot he cellphoned sacramento billing through lapd authorization took a while so did being shunted from clerk to supervisor to clerk every few seconds a plane swooped down to land i stood around as he burned up calories keeping his voice even finally his patience earned him the promise of a priority records search from state parole which means days instead of weeks he said walking over to a nearby phone booth and lifting a chained yellow pages from its shelf dried gum crusted the covers one thing the supervisor did confirm starkweather guys do get out not often but it happens she knows for a fact because there was a case five years agosome guy supposed to be on close supervision returned to his hometown and shot himself in the local barbershop so much for the system i said maybe thats why swig was nervous the system is bullshit people arent machines places like quentin and pelican bay theres all kinds of trouble either you cage them completely or they do whatever the hell they please he began paging through the phone directory okay lets find some rental outfits play cinema sleuth most of the film equipment companies were in hollywood and burbank the rest scattered around the valley and culver city hollywood first he said where else it was just after three pm when i followed milos unmarked onto the and over to the we got off at sunset traffic was mean the hollywood outfits were in warehouse buildings and large storefronts on the west end of the district between fairfax and gower a concentration on santa monica boulevard allowed us to park and cover half a dozen businesses quickly the mention of thin line productions and blood walk evoked baffled stares from the rental clerks most of whom looked like thrashmetal band castoffs on the seventh try at a place on wilcox called flick stuff a bony simianlooking young man with a massive black hair extension and a pierced lip slouched behind a nipplehigh counter massively unimpressed by milos badge maybe twentyone too young for that level of worldweariness behind him were double doors with an employees only sign in the background a female vocalist shouted over power chords joan jett or someone trying to be her big hair wore a tight black tshirt and red jeans a slogan on the shut no sex unless it leads to dancing his arms were white and hairless more vein than muscle lumpy fibroid dope scars in the crooks said hed probably had police experience milo said were you working here twenty months ago sir sir made the kid smirk off and on he managed to slouch lower price lists were tacked to the surrounding walls day rates for sandbags western dollies sidewalls magliners wardrobe racks cardellini lamps greenscreens surprisingly cheap a snow machine could be had for fiftyfive bucks remember renting to an outfit called thin line productions i expected a yawn but big hair said maybe milo waited sounds familiar yeah maybe yeah could you check your files please yeah hold on hair opened the double doors and disappeared returned waving an index card looking ready to spit yeah now i remember them problems said milo big problems hair wiped his hands on the black tshirt the grubby steel ring through his upper lip robbed his expression of some of the injured dignity he was trying to project whatd they do said milo stiffed us fourteen grand worth i said thats a lot of equipment not for spielberg but for assholes like that yeah we gave em everything mikes props fake blood filters misters eye chamois coffee makers cups tables the fuckin works the big items were a dolly and a couple of cameras old gear no studio would touch em but still they cost supposed to be a tenday rental they had no history with us and it was obviously like a virgin voyage so we demanded double deposit and they gave us a check that we verified was covered i got id everything by the book not only didnt they pay up they fucking split with the equipment when we tried to cash the deposit check guess what he bared his teeth surprisingly white behind them something glinted pierced tongue no click when he talkedthe voice of experience were pain thresholds rising among the new generation would it make for a better marine corps i said what made you think it was a virgin voyage they putzed around didnt know what they were doing what pisses me off is i guided them man told them how to get the most for their money then they go and screw me you got blamed boss said i did the transaction i was assigned to find em try to recover i couldnt find shit you say they said milo how many people are we talking about two guy and a girl whatd they look like twenties thirties she was okaylooking blond hair light blond like marilyn monroe madonna when she was like that but long and straight nice body but nothing special okay face he was tall older than her trying to play hip how old said milo probably in his thirties she was maybe younger i wasnt really paying attention she didnt say much it was mostly him how tall was he said milo about your size but skinny not as skinny as me but nothing like you either smirk hair color said milo dark black long like yours he wished man his was curly like a perm maybe went to here he touched his shoulders platinum blond for her said milo writing long and curly for him maybe wigs sure they were said hair its not exactly hard to tell man what kind of clothing did they wear regular nothing special any other distinguishing marks hair laughed like on their foreheads nope unhuh could you identify them if you saw them again i dunno the pierced tongue slid between his upper and lower teeth the mannerism formed his mouth into a tragedymask frown probably not i wasnt really paying attention to their faces i was concentrating on getting them the most for their money but maybe you could recognize them why you have a picture not yet well bring one if you get it maybe no promises the fact they were wearing wigs said milo that didnt bother you why should it maybe they were hiding something hair laughed everyone in the industry hides something you never see a chick with a natural rack anymore and half the guys are wearing wigs and eye shadow big fucking dealmaybe they were acting in their own flick doing it all thats the way it is with a lot of these indie things they tell you anything about the flick didnt ask they didnt say blood walk said milo sounds like a slasher flick could be boredom had returned they rented fake blood couple gallons i picked out the best we had nice and thick then they buttream me like that boss loved that any hint it mightve been porn anythings possible said hair i know most of the porn people but theres always new assholes trying to break in i dont think so though they didnt have that virgin porn feel whats the virgin porn feel stonedhappy on ecstasy big fucking adventure they didnt say muchthinking about it they didnt say hardly nothing at all boss take it any further than having you look for them said milo what do you mean did he run a trace on them hire a collection agency he put em out to collection and when that didnt work he wrote it off we had a good year i guess he can piss away fourteen grand does this kind of thing happen all the time getting ripped off not all the time but yeah it happens but not usually for this much and usually we collect something do you still have their file i didnt throw it out could we please see it mr bonner vito bonner he wiped his hands again let me go back and check they rip someone else off that why youre here something like that man said bonner talk about stupid we warned the other companies in the neighborhood burbank and culver too a black sprig of false hair tickled his chin and he slapped it away i think we warned the valley too so anyone who rented to them after that deserves to get cornholed we sat in the unmarked and studied the file the tab read thin line blood walk bad debt the first page was a letter from an encino collection agency reporting an extensive search no results next came the rental application thin lines address was listed on abbot kinney boulevard in venice venice phone exchange with the notation that it traced to a pay phone bit of a drive to hollywood i said especially with rental outfits close by in santa monica they didnt want to foul their own nest milo pored over the form nodding the signature at the bottom was hard to read but a black business card stapled to the file folder said griffith d wark producer and president thin line prods the payphone number in the lower left corner white printing on black oldfashioned camera logo in the lower righthand corner bogus phone he said scam from the getgo wark sounds like a phony moniker griffith dw i said ten to one its an inversion of dw griffith ill also bet the w in dw was wark not very subtle but old vito didnt catch it old vito probably knows more about maglites than film history he flipped to the next page heres the bank verification on the deposit checkb of a branch out in panorama city these guys were all over the place he studied his timex too late to call the manager ill drive by the venice address see if they really did have a place there then ill get the file over to the lab just in case some old latents from known bad guys show up tomorrow its on the horn to every other prop house in the county see if mr wark talked anyone else out of gear you like the film thing now i said work with what youve got he said im an old stinkhound when something smells bad i go nosing the casting ad could have been another scamget wannabes to pay for auditioning wouldnt surprise me hollywoods one big scam anywayimage fiber alles even when its supposedly legit one of my first cases back when i was doing robbery was he named a wellknown actor got his start as a student doing artsy stuff using gear he stole from the universitys theater arts department when i caught up with him he was a real freshmouth no remorse finally he agreed to return everything and the u decided not to take it any further a few years later im watching tv and this assholes up for an oscar some socialissues film about prison reform making a holierthanthou speech and what about he named a major director i know for a fact he got his foot in the door by selling coke to studio execs yeah this wark found the right business for a psychopath the only question is how relevant his mischief is to my cases i got home just after six robins truck was in the carport the house smelled wonderfulthe salty bouquet of chicken soup she was at the stove stirring a pot her hair was loose tumbling down her back black sweats accentuated the auburn her sleeves were pushed up to her elbows and her face looked scrubbed steam from the soup had brought up some sweat down by her feet spike squatted panting ready to pounce for a scrap the table was set for two when i kissed her spike grumbled be a good sharer i said he grumbled some more and waddled over to his water bowl winning through intimidation i said robin laughed thought wed eat in havent seen enough of you lately sounds great to me want me to prepare something not unless theres something else you want i looked into the pot golden broth formed a bubbling home for carrots celery onions slivers of white meat wide noodles nothing i said moving behind her cupping her waist lowering my hands to her hips i felt her go loose this i said is one of those great fantasieshe chances upon her as she cooks and lusty stallion that he is she laughed let out two soft breaths leaned back against me my hands rose to her breasts loose and soft unfettered by the thin fleece of the sweats her nipples hardened against my palms my fingers slipped under the waistband of her pants she inhaled sharply you shrinks she said placing her hand over mine guiding it down spending too much time on fantasy not enough on reality chapter i woke up the next morning thinking about mr and mrs argents claim that claire had chosen psychology because she wanted to nurture people yet shed opted for neuropsychology as a specialty concentrating on diagnostics avoiding treatment on research diagnostics charts and graphs the hieroglyphics of science shed rarely ventured out of her lab on the face of it shed nurtured nothing but data at county until six months ago and the shift to starkweather maybe robin was right and the move represented getting in touch with her altruism but why now why there something didnt fit my head felt like a box full of random index cards i circled the office trying to collate robin and spike were out and the silence chewed at me there had been a time long ago when i was content living alone the knots and liberties of love had changed me what had claire experienced oflove the phone ring was glass shattering on stone small stuff first said milo joseph stargills not quite as rich as he claimed because some of his properties are mortgaged but he still comes out over four mil in the black his law practice brings in around a hundred and eighty k a year if hes a greedy psychopath or he hated claires guts i suppose three hundred k might motivate him but i cant find evidence of either and a probate lawyer tells me stargill would have a hell of a time getting hold of that property with no will the state takes most of it and claires parents get the rest stargills not off the suspect list completely i still have to nose around about any bad investments he might have but hes been kicked down several notches item two no other prop company reports being bilked by mr wark or thin line so maybe he wasnt out for a bigtime equipment ripoff just wanted to supply his own shoot decided to keep the gear when they were through no progress finding wark the blood walk script has definitely not been registered with any of the guilds no ones heard of thin line and theres no evidence the film was ever released i contacted filmdeveloping labs because if there was ever footage it mightve been processed somewhere nada at the b of a in panorama city no dice over the phone i have to come in present a warrant to get a look at the thin line account busy day i said with zippo to show for it im thinking this whole movie angle is a distraction especially with item three the clerk from state parole called me god bless her turns out a starkweather inmate was released seven months ago a guy named wendell pelley three weeks before claire went to work there its a narrow window but pelley couldve learned about claire from some buddy still in there or claire actually had contact with him think about it her official start date was three weeks after pelley got released but whats to say she didnt go to starkweather before then to take a look see if it was right for her lets say she runs into pelley by accidenthes about to be sprung so they make him a trustya tour guide like hatterson shes coming there to help people and heres a success story it could be appealing to her right sure i said but seven months ago means pelley was released one month after richard dadas murder so someone else did dada thats always been a possibility his tone said not to push it whats pelleys background i said white male fortysix got committed twentyone years ago for shooting his girlfriend and her three little kids up in the sierrasgold country apparently pelley was trying to do some mining brought the rest of them along to be one happy family got drunk convinced himself they were trying to rob his claim and went berserk diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia drug and booze history too wacky for trial whyd they let him out staff recommendation from starkweather is all state parole had swig approved the release i said so he held back plenty shmuck never liked him gonna look into his background but right now pelleys whereabouts are my main concern hes on the run i said released inmates are supposed to get counseling and random drug tests funny thing bout that isnt it pelley was bunking in a halfway house near macarthur park the operators havent seen him for a month they claim they notified his parole officer right away i tried to reach the po no callback yet whom would the parole officer be obligated to notify the local police ramparts division they cant find any record of notification the system huh would swig be notified maybe if so its something else he held back on not that hes any use to us at this point pelley wouldnt be likely to run back to starkweather so whats next i said a statewide alert nah he said thats for tv officially pelley hasnt done anything bad yet so no way does state parole or anyone else want to get the press on it panic the public if ramparts does get notified all it means is pelleys face and stats go up on a bulletin board in the station maybe if the desks feeling real cooperative they issue photo memos for the squad car dashboards meaning if pelley acts up publicly and a uniform gets there in time hes busted but if he doesnt cause problems he can probably fade into the woodwork out on the streets three weeks before claire joins the staff at starkweather i said you could be right she met pelley and he became her outpatient project hey he said she told that psychiatrist she was ripe for it so many madmen so little time and maybe pelley and peake maintained some sort of communication maybe peake talked to him because they had some kind of rapport they had one important thing in common they both murdered families as good a basis for friendship as ive ever heard he cursed heidi never mentioned policys release but she came on staff after claire might not have heard about it i want to talk to heidi again anyway he said so far shes the only one in that place showing any desire to help shes due on shift at three im gonna be out on the road all day trying to trace pelley so i left a message with your number as backup okay okay i can also try that head psychiatrist at starkweather aldrichsee what he knows about pelley no not yeti need to be discreet if it turns out pelleys our bad guy whoever okayed his release is gonna be up the creek no reason to warn them give them time to get their defenses up give swig a chance to get on the horn with uncle senator and unleash a paper barrier he sounded angry but exhilarated you have a good feeling about this i said dont know about that but i will tell you one thing this is a helluva lot more to my liking than movies and all that hocuspocus about peakes gibberish this is the world as i know it bad guy gets out on the street bad things happen guess my faith in crappy endings has been validated once again i heated up some of the leftover soup and chewed on a hard roll as i thought about milos enthusiasm for wendell pelley in addition to his being clear for the dada murder pelley had used a gun not a knife but maybe twentyone years had changed his killing style and he had bolted the halfway house still milo was relying on what he hated most theory if hed looked at it coldly he mightve tempered his enthusiasm i hadnt said a thing id continue to keep my doubts to myself one thing doing therapy had taught me timing is all my service rang at threetwentythree id been expecting a call from heidi ott but the operator said its a dr hertzlinger from county general hospital she says its about dr argent put her on click dr delaware mary hertzlinger i was calling detective sturgis but someone at the station gave me this number hes out asked me to take some messages whats up after you and he left i found myself thinking more about claire and i began to wonder if id misspoken about that strange parting shotso many madmen so little timeyou asked me if claire seemed upset when she said it and i said no she was actually smiling but the more i considered it the more i realized how unlike claire the remark was because shed never joked before never displayed any sense of humor really i dont mean that unkindlyshe was just a very serious person off the job i try not to analyze people but you know how it is anomalies attract me me too occupational hazard she laughed softly anomalies also make me wonder about anxiety you think claire was anxious about switching jobs its just speculation she said but she just rattled off that line as if shed rehearsed it had been reciting it to herself because lets face it it was a strange thing to do claires job was secure dr theobold liked her to just pick up and leave for a place like starkweather shed never worked with patients let alone homicidal psychotics it really doesnt make sense maybe after doing all that research she wanted to help people directly then why starkweather who gets help there so youre saying the decision scared her but she went ahead anyway i said yes but that doesnt make sense either does it if she was nervous why do it ill bet if shed marched into dr theobolds office and announced shed changed her mind hed have taken her back in a flash no questions asked so its confusing i tried to think back what her demeanor had been as we cleaned out those boxes what wed been talking about i couldnt remember much but i did recall something she mentioned leaving some material behind in the office closet said shed be back for it later in the afternoon but i was in the office all day and she never returned ever after i met you i went to check and sure enough there it was back in a corner two cartons with her name on them the flaps were closed but not sealed so i opened one upi hope i didnt ruin anything by doing that no i said find anything interesting mostly they were journal reprints claires own publications and some articles related to her alcoholism research but there was also a plastic bag full of newspaper clippings photocopies actually and when i read them i knew i had to call detective sturgis they were all about a mass murder that took place sixteen years ago the ardullo family i said ardis peake silence so you already know peakes at starkweather he was one of claires patients oh my so claire was interested in him before she went theremaybe he was one of the reasons she took the job but why would that be good question i said where are the clippings now right here in front of mei wont touch another thing havent even gone near the second box someone can pick them up any time before eight tonight and ill be back in around seven am thanks i said and thank you for calling soon as i can reach detective sturgis ill let him know this peake she said hes still in thereincarcerated yes so it couldnt have been him she said sounding relieved i started to read the clippings the things he did anyway thats it one more thing i said did claire ever mention loving the movies not to me why weve been told it was a main form of recreation for her i suppose that wouldnt surprise me she said sure i could see thatlosing herself in fantasy you saw her as someone with an active fantasy life i saw her as someone who mightve depended upon an active fantasy life because she didnti dont want to be cruel but the truth is she just didnt seem to have much of a real life interested in peake before shed taken the job her project trying to increase his verbal output or so shed claimed what about him had really caught her interest stashed the clippings along with her research data because she considered the clippings data why would an alcoholism researcher raised in pittsburgh and schooled in cleveland be concerned with a sixteenyearold atrocity in a california farm town a town that no longer existed i thought about the abolition of treadway an entire community obliterated what role had been played by ardis peakes savage night peakes blood walk i wrestled with it some more claire a researcher coming upon something it was threeforty and heidi ott still hadnt called i checked out with my service and

obliterated an entire town wiped off the map once sentimentality had been taken care of high real estate values had done the rest sad but i couldnt see any connection to claire or the demons hissing in ardis peakes head could she have had a family connection to the ardullos her parents hadnt mentioned it there seemed no reason for them to conceal history still people often hid their reasons i found a pay phone just outside the reading room phoned the flight inn and asked for the argents room rob rays familiar rumble said yes mr argent dr delaware oh hello sorry to bother you again sir but i had one more question lucky you caught us he said were on our way out the door and back home ill be quick mr argent do you have any relatives in california specifically in the farming business farming nope does the name ardullo mean anything to you no again i thought you might be calling about some progresswhats this all about the ardullos were a family claire showed some interest inshed read up on them held on to some newspaper clippings were a family he said something happened to them unfortunately they were murdered fifteen years ago and claire seemed to be interested in the case murdered the whole family he nearly choked on the last two words so what i dont mean so what they were murdered so what about claire no i dont know them never did it was probably just something professional doing her work have to go goodbye have a good flight i said oh yeah he said its going to be a great flightat least im getting out of your lousy city his anger rang in my head and i hung up feeling foolish and intrusive what had i hoped to accomplish what did big money and land deals have to do with claires murder now that i was thinking straight i realized there was a simple explanation for the clippings knowing she was transferring to starkweather claire had plugged the hospitals name into some data banks come across the description of peakes bloody night once she got there she looked him up found him near vegetative a challenge so many madmen so little time after all those years in the lab she was hungry for clinical raw meatfor a firsthand look at astounding criminal madness maybe shed even intended to write peake up if she made some kind of progress shed entered the world of madness butmilos enthusiasm for wendell pelley asidei wondered if that had anything to do with her death right at the beginning my gut had told me someone organizedtwisted but sanehad cut her throat stashed her in the car trunk made off with the bit of cash in the as yet undiscovered purse left no clues maybe the same person whod bisected richard dada maybe not any similarities between the two cases could be explained by abnormal psychology psychopaths werent that original confront enough evil and you smell the same garbage over and over no voices in the head here maybe pelley was now sane enough to pull it off maybe not in any case i couldnt help thinking we were up against something coldhearted orchestrated murder for fun a production there was nothing more i could do so i drove home spent some time outdoors weeding pruning feeding the fish netting leaves out of the pond just before five my service patched heidi ott through doctor she sounded buoyant i cant believe it but peakes talking again and this time swig cant accuse me of being hysterical i got it on tape chapter tuh whats that ardis tape buzz i clocked it twentytwo seconds what did you say ardis you just said something because you want to talk to me right ardis thirtytwo seconds ardis could you open your eyes please a minute ninety seconds a hundred heidi ott held up her finger signaling us to be patient it was just before midnight but her eyes were bright she and milo and i were in an interrogation room at the station a hot lysolsmelling yellow closet barely large enough for the three of us heidis hair was tied back and styled with a shark clip shed come straight from starkweather and the clip of her id badge protruded from a breast pocket the recorder was a tiny black sony just a bit more she said tapping her fingers on the steel table her voice on the tape said okay ardis maybe tomorrow thirtythree seconds footsteps tuh tuh ardis two two what twentyeight seconds ardis tuhguh togo tuh guh choo choo bang bang togo choo choo bang bang whatdoes that mean ardis fifteen seconds choo choo bang bang ardis is that some sort of game eighteen seconds ardis whats choo choo bang bang thirty seconds forty fifty what does it mean ardis eightythree seconds click she said at that point he turned away from me wouldnt open his eyes i waited awhile longer but i knew it was all i was going to get out of him choo choo bang bang said milo she colored i know its pretty stupid isnt it i guess i shouldnt have gotten so jazzed but at least its something right hes talking to me maybe hell keep talking whered you keep the recorder i said in my pocket she pointed to the navy photographers vest shed draped over her chair i tried yesterday too but nothing happened choo choo bang bang said milo bad eyes in a box ive been trying to figure out some connection said heidi suddenly she looked very tired probably wasting your time sorry no no said milo i appreciate your help id like to keep the tape sure she popped it out of the machine gave it to him placed the recorder back in the vest pocket collected her purse and stood milo held out a hand and they shook thanks he said really any information is helpful she shrugged i guess want me to keep taping i dont want you to do anything that violates regulations never heard of any regulation against taping its generally illegal to tape anyone without their knowledge heidi jail prisoners lose the presumption of privacy but whether or not that applies to the men at starkweather i dont know okay she said so i wont do it anymore shrugging she moved toward the door kind of strange isnt it protecting them thats another reason i dont want to stick around whats that swig talks all the time about humane care how theyre human beings too but i just cant find much sympathy for them and id rather work with people i care about at least they cant leave i guess thats the main thing speaking of which said milo one of them did get out her knuckles whitened around the purse handle i never heard that when before you came on staff who what was his name wendell pelley no she said never heard of himwhy is he some sort of suspect in claires murder no said milo not yet im just trying to cover all bases anything you could find out about pelley would be useful like did he and peake associate with each other i can try long as i stay at starkweather two more weeks yes but if theres something you think i can are you saying this pelley is what peakes little speeches are all about pelleys been communicating with peake sending him messages and peakes babbling them back at me i wish i knew enough to theorize heidi right now im simply looking into everything okay ill do what i can sharp tug of the ponytail looking troubled she opened the door milo and i walked her downstairs to the street her car was parked at the curb halflit by a streetlamp old dented chrysler minivan a bumper sticker read climbers get high naturally milo said whats the highest mountain you ever tackled im more of a wall person than a mountain person sheer surfaces the more vertical the better she smiled promise you wont tell the best one wasnt exactly legal power station near the nevada border we did it at three am then parachuted down adrenaline high said milo oh yeah she laughed got in the van and drove away got your junior gwoman on the job i said i think shes found a new source of adrenaline yeah shes a little hyper isnt she but at least someones cooperating so what do you think about peakes latest soliloquy if theres some deep psychological meaning its eluding me choo choo bang bang he laughed talk about loco motives we returned to the robberyhomicide room a dunkin donuts takeout box dominated miles desk he said shouldnt you be getting home to robin i told her it might take a while he studied the notes hed scrawled in the interrogation room heidi he said our little mountain girl too bad everything shes come up with is probably worth a warm bucket of spit choo choo bang bang whats next peake reads selections from dr seuss he rubbed his eyes stacked some papers squared the corners with his thumbs you think it was poor judgment he said asking her to check on pelley not if shes discreet worse comes to worst swig finds out gets all huffy he cant afford to make too big a deal of itbad publicity anything new on pelleys whereabouts i said zilch ramparts was notified by the po so theres something positive other than that the po wasnt very helpful caseload in the hundreds to him pelley was just another number i doubt he could point him out in a crowd he pulled a folded sheet out of his jacket pocket and handed it to me lapd suspect alert pelleys vital statistics and a photo so dark and blurry i couldnt see it being useful for anything all i could make out was a round cleanshaven caucasian face smudged with indeterminate features thin lightcolored hair serious mouth the crime was failure to report this is what theyre using i said placing the paper on the desk yeah i knownot exactly cartierbresson but at least theyre looking i did some looking too driving around the neighborhood checking out macarthur park lafayette park alleys con bars some other badguy spots i know visited the halfway house too old apartment building cons out in front some korean guy running the placesincere enough told me hed been a social worker in seoul but he barely speaks english and basically all he does is warehouse the residents do random drug tests maybe four times a year counseling consists of asking the cons how theyre doing the ones i saw hanging around didnt look at all insightful as for pelley all the korean could say was that hed been quiet hadnt caused problems none of the cons remembered a damn thing about him of course he reached for a piece of stale cinnamon roll he could be a thousand miles away by now i didnt do much better with stargills investment records the newport money managers wouldnt talk to me and they informed him id been asking around he calls me all irate i tell him im just trying to clear him how about he voluntarily gives me a look at his stock portfolio if everything checks out we call it a day he says hell think about it but i could tell he wont hiding something i said or just guarding his privacyeveryone gets privacy right even guys who cook and eat babies everyone except citizens who get laid out on steel tables some whitecoat peeling off their face doing the ycut playing peekaboo with their internal organs no privacy there chapter robin didnt stir when i slipped into bed beside her at one am visions of peakes crimes and the knowledge that i hadnt helped milo much kept me up for a while heart beating too fast muscles tight deepbreathing myself into an uneasy torpor i finally slipped off if dreams intruded i had no memory of them in the morning but my legs ached as if id been running from something by nine am i was drinking coffee and catching what passes for tv news in la cappedtoothed jesters hawking showbiz gossip the latest bumblings of the moronic city council the current health scare today it was strawberries from mexico everyone was going to die from an intestinal scourge back when id treated children the news had frightened more kids than any horror flick i was about to switch off the set when the grinning blonde gushed and now more on that train accident the story merited thirty seconds an unidentified man had lain across the metrorail tracks just east of the city limits squarely in the path of an empty passenger train the engineer spotted him and put on the emergency brake but not in time choo choo i called milo he picked up right away yeah yeah the little train that couldnt probably nothing or maybe peake really is a prophet and we should be worshiping him instead of keeping him locked up nothing much else on my plate so i called the coroner the deceased is one ellroy lincoln beatty male black fiftytwo petty criminal recordmostly possession and drank and disorderly the only thing that intrigued me was that beatty spent some time in a mental hospital camarillo thirteen years ago back when they were still open for that kind of business no mention of starkweather but you never know the accident happened in newton division i wish manny alvarado had the case but he retired and the new guy isnt great about returning calls i figured id head over to the morgue before lunch feel free to join me if it gets you hungry we can have lunch later like a big rare steak basically the head and the lower extremities said the attendant he was a short solidly built hispanic named albert martinez with a crew cut and goatee and thicklensed glasses that enlarged and brightened his eyes the crucifix around his neck was gold and handtooled vaguely byzantine the coroners office was two stories of square smooth cream stucco meticulously maintained back in east la back at county hospital claires old office was a few blocks away i hadnt realized it before but shed come full circle the rest of him is pretty much goulash said martinez personally i think its amazing we got what we did the train must have hit him at whatforty fifty miles per the room was cool immaculate odorless empty steel tables equipped with drain basins overhead microphones a wall of steel lockers a junior high student would recognize all of it too many tv shows had dimmed the shock but television rarely offered a glimpse at the contents of the lockers dead people on tv were intact clean bloodless props resting peacefully i hadnt been down here since internship wasnt enjoying the experience howd you identify him said milo welfare card in his pocket said martinez the lower extremities still had pieces of pants on and the pocket was in one piece all he had on him was the card and a couple of bucks the interesting thing is you could still smell the booze on him even with all the other fluids i mean it was really strong only other time i smelled it that strong was this woman died in childbirth must have drunk two bottles of wine that night and she arrested on the delivery table her amniotic fluid was redwinered you know almost purple she must have been saturated with thunderbird or whatever the baby was dead obviously probably lucky martinez touched his crucifix whens beattys autopsy scheduled said milo hard to say its the usual backlog why it might be related to something so youre saying beatty must have been pretty juiced to smell that strong sure my guess would be way over the limit he probably got blasted wandered onto the tracks lay down for a nap and boom martinez smiled so could i be a detective why bother said milo your jobs more fun martinez chuckled those tracksthey really should do something about them no fence no guardrail when they get close to the train yard i grew up around there used to play on the tracks but they werent running trains back then you remember last month the little kid who wandered on walking home from school not far from where beatty got hit that kid we didnt get anything recognizable on him they should put a fence up or something so anything else id like to look at beatty really how come i want to think of him as a person martinezs thumb and forefinger closed around the bottom of the crucifix a person huh well maybe looking at him isnt the right way to do that you know milo said humor me martinez walked over to a locker slid the drawer out silently drew back white sheeting the face was gray surprisingly intact except for a thatch of lacerations on the left cheek ash gray because in life ellroy beatty had been black white lint of kinky beard stubble maybe four five days worth untrimmed mass of gray hair the eyes were open dull dry the lips caked with pinkish crust that vacant look common to all dead faces no matter what your iq in life when the soul flies you look stupid below the neck was empty space clean decapitation except for a few fringes of trachea and jugular meaty muscle fibers protruding two feet down the table was a whitewrapped package that martinez needlessly explained was the lower extremities milo stared at the ashen chunk that had once borne the consciousness of ellroy beatty not blinking not moving i wondered how many times hed been down here just as martinez said okay the door opened and a man strode in he wore scrubs a hairnet paper slippers a loose mask around his neck about beattys age tall stoopshouldered with a deeply tanned face and a thick black beard he glanced at us read the index card in his right hand and headed for one of the steel lockers two rows away then he saw ellroy beattys head and flushed with anger what the hells going on here martinez said some kind of problem dr friedman id sure as hell say so who cut up my db your db said martinez thats what i said are you deaf albert friedman turned to milo and who the hell are you lapd i thought willis hooks was on this one no said milo hooks is central this is a newton case the detectives robert aguilar what said friedman jabbing the card the paperwork says central hooks how long have you been doing this mr aguilar milo said im sturgis doctor west la friedman blinked what the hell he stepped closer to ellroy beattys head let me tell you detective someones in deep dirt i had this db scheduled for a post and someone cut his goddamn head off and whats he doing in that drawer when hes supposed to be over here friedman waved the card no one moved him dr friedman said martinez he got put here right away and no one cut him this is the bullshit albert bullshit on toastbullets dont sever your damn head bullets dont this is db beatty said martinez the one who was hit by a i know who he is albert another wave of the card beatty leroy gunshot wound to the head brought in last night beatty ellroy said martinez leroy albert says so right here the card was thrust at martinezs face case number time of delivery threesixteen am martinez rolled up some of the sheeting covering beattys legs pulling out a toe tag he read ellroy beatty hit by a train tod threefortytwo am case number friedman looked down at the head then the card then the numbers on the steel drawers he yanked one open inside was an intact body naked gray exact same gray as ellroy beatty same face all four of us stared i looked from corpse to corpse minor discrepancies materialized leroy beatty had slightly less hair on top than ellroy but more on the bottom a full white beard no scratches on his face but a keloid scar puckered the right jawline probably an old knife wound the neat blackened hole in his forehead looked too innocuous to have killed him the impact had caused facial distortionswelling around the nose puffiness under the eyes bloodred eyeballs as if hed stared too long into the fires of hell friedmans head was swiveling now too twins said martinez brother ellroy meet brother leroy friedman turned on him dont joke albert what the hells going on good question said milo it took two hours to put it all together dr friedman left long before then muttering about having to work with incompetents i sat with milo in a morgue conference room detective robert aguilar from newton showed up first young goodlooking with a sleek black pompadour he wore a gray pinstriped suit tailored to his trim frame manicured nails he spoke very crisply a little too fast tried to come across lighthearted but couldnt pull it off milod told me he was new to the division a detective i for all i knew this was his first case last to arrive was willis hooks from central id met him when he worked southwest a series of killings of handicapped people that had given me a glimpse of a cowardly new world hooks was in his early forties black fivenine heavy with a clean head bulldog jowls and a thick drooping mustache his navy blazer had that baggy toolong look you sometimes see with bigchested men his shoes were dusty milo he said sitting down dr delaware fate keeps putting us in the same room aguilar watched and listened trying i guessed to gauge hookss mood to know with whom to align himself fate or just plain bad luck willis said milo hooks laughed hoarsely and spread pudgy fingers on the table milo said willis this is robert aguilar newton division said aguilar charmed said hooks yours is the train yup said aguilar ellroy lincoln beatty male black fiftytwo mines leroy washington beatty male black fiftytwo think they could be distantly related before aguilar could answer hooks winked and said mine went down around three am give or take mine too said aguilar how bout that hooks turned to milo it appears someones got it in for the beatty family maybe we should find out if theyve got any other siblings maybe theres some more beatty s all over townhell this could be a beatty holocaust if not least we should do is warn them aguilar frowned taking out a gold cross pen he began writing in his pad hooks said got some ideas detective aguilar looked up his lips were tight just charting the data flow hooks pursed his lips and his mustache bristled well thats good so tell me detective sturgis whats your connection to the bobbsey twins youre not going to believe this said milo we left the morgue at twelvethirty pm mission road was alive with pedestrians the air smelled like fried chicken grease said milo yum lunch not in the mood i said such strength of character hed left the unmarked in the red zone turnaround in front of the building along with other police vehicles id used a nearby lot a whiteandblue coroners van circled past us and cruised out to the street milo said choo choo bang bang a train and a gun he rested a foot on the unmarkeds front bumper bad eyes in a box both times peake spouts off the day before so when does the bastard go on the psychic hotline and start raking in serious money if the news got out im sure agents would be doing lunch with him at spago he huffed so what the hell does it mean alex two homeless men a psychologist a waiter i said wide range of ages both sexes blacks whites if theres a connection i dont see it maybe wendell pelleys behind some of it but he didnt do dada so if dadas part of the mix it means more than one killer same if the beatty brothers really were killed simultaneously fine fine theres a psycho army out there for all we know peake spouted off about richard too but till claire showed up no one was around to listen the question is how the hell does peake know the only logical possibility i said is that he has some link to the outside got to be pelley he said or another starkweather alum guys like that would know all the boozehound places like the train tracks the alley where leroy was shot booze and mental illness you said so yourself bad combination and pelleys history fits he was blind drunk when he shot his girlfriend and her kids now hes living on the streets again the beattys are just the kind of people hed run into why use the train i said why not shoot both of them the guys crazy maybe a voice told him to do it that way choo choo goddamn bang bang the main thing is theres some pattern here i didnt reply he said you have a problem with pelley no i said i just cant see any conceptual link even eliminating richard dada from the mix between claire and the beattys the beattys were alcoholics he said claire worked with alcoholics maybe they were her patients theyd fit the county profile i said but that still doesnt offer any motive to kill them it had to have something to do with peake his crimesthose clippings claire held on to she targeted him because there was something she wanted to learn about him or from him i went back into the newspaper files and got some background on the ardullo family scotts father was a major agricultural figure adamant about not selling farmland to developershed been wooed for years but refused then he died scott and his family got murdered and all the ardullo land was sold be interesting to know who inherited what he said were running off in a whole other direction the ardullos were eliminated for profit and peakes some corporate hit man cmon alex im more likely to believe peake can flow through walls at will off people and return to his beddybye at the loon farm i know peakes disorganized but big money always adds another dimension maybe you should at least visit treadwayfairway ranch maybe someone will be around who remembers remembers what the crime something just to be thorough right now being thorough means finding wendell pelley he placed both hands on the hood of the unmarked and gazed over at the coroners building then up at the milky sky behind us were dumpsters water pumps the rears of two antique hospital buildings sculpted cornices and ornate moldings topped crumbling brick more victorian london than east la jack the ripper wouldve found it cozy okay i said lets stick with hereandnow i can even give you a motive the beatty twins died at around the same time that has a ritual flavor to ita game my vote is slaughter for fun that also fits with the secondkiller scenario plenty of precedent leopold and loeb bianchi and buono bittaker and norris it could return richard dada to the victim list pelleys buddy killed dada before pelley was released but only a month beforethe crime would still be psychologically fresh maybe the buddys descriptions of how he did it turned pelley on got him back in the murder game and the other bastard could be some nutcase pelley hooked up with at the halfway house alex i saw the guys living there not the kiwanis club okay im going back gonna be a little more assertive gonna continue patrolling ramparts on my own too keep checking the bum haunts play more phone tag with other divisions neighboring cities in case pelley andor nut buddy has been a bad boy somewhere else though the site of the beattys murders says theyre still local which makes sense they probably have no wheels cant hit the freeway that reminded me of something the first time we discussed richard we talked about someone without a car maybe a bus rider same for claires phantom boyfriend there you go he said busriding lunatics you said he wouldnt look crazy how do you feel about that now pretty much the same i said all four murders were planned and meticulous whoever killed richard and claire had the sense not to steal their cars and murdering the beattys on the same night adds another level of calculation choreography so if pelley is involved hes probably not actively psychotic at least not externally dont forget they let him out he mustve appeared coherent when he kills hes neat that makes me feel a whole lot better shaking his head milo reached for the car door i said so thetreadway things off the table completely you dont want to let go of it those clippings bother me milo whatever pelleys role in all this something went on between claire and peake she sought him out made him a project he predicted her murder sixteen years ago he took out brittany ardullos eyes claires eyes were also targeted its almost as if hed been trying to connect the two crimessomehow relive his past using a surrogate the beattys eyes werent messed with but richards eyes were taken too much variation too much that doesnt fit peakes the only link if we understand more about himhis historyit may get us closer to pelley and whoever else is involved he swung the door open i just dont have the time alex but if you want to go out there fine i appreciate the effort ill even phone bunker protection see if i can get them to be cooperative meanwhile i go nuthunting right here on the streets good luck i said luck doesnt seem to be cutting it he withdrew his hand from the door and placed it on my shoulder im being a cranky bastard arent i sorry not enough sleep too much futility dont sweat it let me apologize anyway contritions good for the soul and thanks for all your time on this i mean it my thanks will be your getting good grades and cleaning your room he laughed much too loudly but maybe it helped chapter twenty miles north of la everything empties id stopped at home long enough to pick up and scan the articles id photocopied at the library gulp down some coffee and get back on the freeway the took me to the and finally interstate this time headed north the last fastfood signs had been five miles back and i shared the freeway with flatbeds hauling hay longdistance movers the odd car a few winnebagos lumbering in the slow lane i had a heavy foot speeding past brown rumpledblanket mountains groves of scrub oak and pine and california pepper trees the occasional grazing horse the heat hadnt let up but the sky was awash with pretty cloudslavendergray swirls satinshiny as if an old wedding dress had been draped over the world the clippings had given me three possible contacts teodoro alarcon the ranch superintendent whod found the bodies sheriff jacob haas and the only other person to comment on ardis peakes strange behavior without protection of anonymity a kid named derrick crimmins no listings on alarcon or crimmins but a jacob b haas had an address at fairway ranch i called his number and a hearty male voice on a machine told me jake and marvelle were unavailable but feel free to leave a message i said id be in town on lapd business and would appreciate it if sheriff haas could spare me some time the highway forked the truck route sprouting to the right and draining the traffic from three lanes radar surveillance warnings were all around but the eternity of open road before me was too seductive and i kept the seville at zipping past saugus and castaic the western ridge of angeles crest national forest the tejon pass then the kern county border shortly after eleven i exited at grapevine and bought some gas my freeway map showed me how to get to fairway ranch but i confirmed directions with the sleepylooking attendant thats for old people he said he was around nineteen crewcut tan and pimpled with four earrings in his left lobe visiting grandma i said he looked up and down the seville its pretty nice there rich people mostly they play a lot of golf the minitruck with the huge wheels and the radiohead bumper sticker parked near the garbage cans was probably his freshly waxed his eyes narrowed as he continued to stare at the seville i try to keep the car in good shape but its a and there are limits used to be another town around here i said his stare was dull treadway i said farms ranches peaches and walnut groves oh yeah profound indifference cool car i thanked him and left taking a narrow northeastern road toward the tehachapi mountains the range was gorgeous high and sharp peaks of varying height laid against one another masterfully more perfectly arranged than any artists composition could ever be the lower hills were dun the upper ridges the precise ashgray of the beatty brothers dead faces some of the more distant crests had faded to a misty purple wintry colors even at this time of year but the heat was more intense than in la burning through the clouds as if they were tissue paper the road rose sharply this was subalpine terrain i couldnt imagine it as farmland then ten miles in a sign reading fairway ranch a planned community directed me down a lefthand pass that cut sharply through walls of granite another signsteep grade reduce speedcame too late i was already hurtling down a rollercoaster chute a good two miles of chute at the bottom was flat green patchwork centered by a diamondbright aquamarine lake the lake was amorphoustoo perfectly shapeless it shouted manmade two golf courses hugged the water one on each side fringed by limecolored trees with feathery tops california peppers redtopped houses were grouped in premeditated plots spanish tile on cream stucco interspersed with trapezoids of green the entire layoutmaybe five miles widewas outlined in white as if drawn by a child too fearful to go outside the lines as i got closer i saw that the white was waisthigh beamandpost fencing an exact duplicate of the planned community sign appeared a hundred yards later over a smaller plaque that said bunker protection patrolled the premises no gates just a flat clean road into the development fifteen mph speed limit and warnings to watch for slowmoving golf carts i obliged and crawled past stretches of perfect rye grass lots more pepper trees shaggy and undulating subplanted with beds of multicolored impatiens a thousand feet in another dozen signs on a stout dark tree trunk that might have been walnut offered a crash course in the layout of fairway ranch balmoral golf course to the north white oak to the south reflection lake straight ahead the pinnacle recreation center and spa to the north walnut grove fitness center to the south in the center piccadilly arcade other arrows pointed to what i assumed were six different housing subdivisions chatham cotswold sussex essex yorkshire jersey the mountains were two or three miles away but seemed to be closer sparkling color and knifeedge detail said the air was pure beyond the tree post was a small single cube of a building the rounded edges and blatant texture of pseudoadobe more spanish tile letting the seville idle i looked around acres of grass and scores more california peppers a few clumps of peach trees with curling leaves a handful of larger trunks with bark that matched the color and texture of the signpost and had to be walnuts no fruit or blossoms dead branches and truncated tops imagining the stink of fertilizer the grind of machinery pickers moving through sundappled rows i thought of henry ardullos resolve never to sell out in the distance i could see assortments of housessugar cubes with red tile roofs not a hint of halftimber brick slate or wood shingle sussex essex english monikers southwest architecture in california escape from logic was sometimes construed as freedom i heard an engine start a pale blue ford sedan with blackwall tires was parked next to the cube now it drove forward very slowly and stopped right next to me understated shield logo on the drivers door crossed rifles above bp inc a security corporation no cherry on top no conspicuous display of firearms at the wheel was a mustachioed young man wearing a pale blue uniform and mirrored shades morning sir tight smile morning officer im here to visit jacob haas on charing cross road charing cross he said stretching it out so he could appraise me thats all the way over in jersey i resisted the temptation to say atlantic city or newark thanks he cleared his throat new around here first time i said relative of mr haas acquaintance he used to be the sheriff back when it was treadway he hesitated a moment before saying sure the same dullness id seen on the gas jockeys face treadway meant nothing to him either he knew nothing of the areas history how many people did i looked past him at the peach and walnut trees now just woody memorials nothing else from the ranching days remained certainly not a hint of the bloodbath at the ardullo ranch if jacob haas wasnt in or if he refused to see me id wasted my time even if he talked what could i hope to learn the security guards car phone buzzed and he picked up nodded told me jerseys way at the endgo straight through to the lake turn right youll see a sign pointing to the white oak golf course just keep on and itll be there i drove away watched him through my rearview mirror as he performed a threepoint turn and headed toward balmoral piccadilly arcade was a small shopping center due east of the security office grocery with a post office and atm dry cleaner two clothing shops leaning toward golf togs and velour jogging suits a sign outside the second said the movie tonight was top gun my drive to jersey took me past perfectly appointed public buildingsthe clubhouse the spatennis courts swimming pools the houses looked better from a distance they varied in size by development essex was the highrent districtdetached splitlevels and twostory hacienditas on postagestamp lots some landscaping lots of cadillacs and lincolns a few satellite dishes clear views of the lake fitlooking whitehaired people in activewear further inland yorkshire was mockadobe town houses clumped in fours and fives a little skimpier in the flowerandshrub department but still immaculate the lake was obscured now by peppers the trees were hardy drought resistant clean theyd been brought into the san fernando valley years ago by the truckload taking over the chaparral and contributing to the death of the native oaks a quartermile of shaded road before jersey appeared mobile homes in an open lot the units were uniformly white and spotless with plenty of greenery camouflage at the base but clearly prefab just a few trees on the periphery and no direct access to the lake but majestic views of the mountains the few people i saw also looked in good shape perhaps a bit more countrified parked in front of the mobiles were chevys fords japanese compacts the occasional rv the road that split the subdivision was freshly asphalted nofrills but the overall feel was still cleanliness good maintenance seniors settled in contentment i parked in one of the ten public spaces at the end and found charing cross road easily enoughfirst street to the right jacob and marvelle haas announced ownership of their happy traveler with a woodburned sign over the front door two vehiclesa buick skylark and a datsun pickupso maybe someone was home some improvements had been added to the unit green canvas window awnings an oak door that looked handcarved a cement porch stacked up to the entrance potted geranium and cactus at the top along with an empty fishbowl still housing a carbon filter the door knocker was a brass cocker spaniel around its neck hung a garland of tiny cowries i lifted the dog and let it concuss against the door a voice called out one minute the man who opened was younger than id expected younger than any of the residents id seen so far sixty if that with irongray hair brushed straight back and very acute eyes the same color he wore a shortsleeved white knit shirt blue jeans black loafers his shoulders were broad but so were his hips a lip of fat curled over his belt buckle his arms were long hairless thin except at the wrists where they picked up some heft his face was narrow sunspotted in places cinched around the eyes and sagging around the bone lines but his skin had a sheen as if someone had buffed him lovingly dr delaware he said in that same hearty voice but his expression didnt matchcautious tentative got your message jacob haas when we shook hands his grip seemed reluctantbare contact then quick pressure around my fingers before he pulled away and stepped back inside cmon in i entered a narrow front room that opened to a kitchenette a window air conditioner hummed the interior wasnt cool but the worst of the heat had been kept at bay no knotty pine no framed homilies no trailerpark cliches deep gray berber carpeting floored the mobile white cotton sofa and two matching easy chairs glassandbrass coffee table blueandwhite chinese garden bench serving as a perch for daffodils in a deep blue vase picasso prints hung on panel walls painted pale salmon black lacquer bookshelves held paperbacks and magazines a thirtyfiveinch tv with vcr and stereo setup and a skinny black vertical rack full of cds the four seasons duane eddy the everly brothers tom jones ferula clark rock and roll was old enough to retire the room smelled of cinnamon buns the woman on the sofa got up and said marvelle haas so pleased to meet you she wore a navy polo shirt white slacks white sandals looked to be her husbands age more wrinkled than he but a trim figure short wavy hair dyed mahogany her grip was strong have a nice drive up from la very nice beautiful scenery its even more beautiful when you live here something to drink no thanks well then ill be shoving off she kissed her husbands cheek and put her arm around his shoulderprotectively i thought you boys be good now now thats no fun haas said drive carefully hon she hurried to the door her hips rotated years ago shed been beautiful she still was when the door closed after her haas seemed to get smaller he motioned toward the chairs we both sat she decided to visit her sister in bakersfield he said because she didnt want to be here when you were sorry no not your fault she doesnt like unpleasantness crossing his legs he plowed his hair with one hand and studied me im not sure i want to be doing this myself but i guess i feel obligated to help the police i appreciate that sheriff hopefully it wont be unpleasant haas smiled havent been sheriff for a while quit right after the ardullos started selling insurance for my fatherinlaw two years later there was no need for a sheriff no more town who closed it down group called bca leisure bought all the land one of those multinational dealsjapanese indonesian british the american partners are a development group out in denver back then they were buying up land right and left was there any resistance from the residents not a peep he said farmings always been a tough life and intreadway only two families made a serious living from it the ardullos and the crimrninses between them they owned ninety percent of the land the rest of us were just here to keep their businesses goinglike sharecroppers so once they sold out it wasnt much of a brainer the sheriff job was only parttime anyway i was already living up in bakersfield near my inlaws doing bookkeeping for my fatherinlaw when did you move back here five years ago he smiled again like i said it was near my inlaws seriously i decided to pack it in when i figured i had enough policies tucked away to be comfortable and bakersfield was starting to look like la we were thinking out of state maybe nevada then this unit came upa lucky deal because fairway units dont stay vacant very long we said why not the airs great terrific fishing they show movies you can do all your shopping right here we travel half the year a small place is perfect we dont go mobiling this things as rooted as any regular house we fly vegas when theres a show we want to see alaska canada this year we did a big one london england saw the chelsea flower show because marvelle likes flowers beautiful country when they say green they mean it his tone had relaxed i hated what i had to do decided to approach the task indirectly the ardullos and the crimminses a boy named derrick crimmins was quoted in an article i read about the crime carson crimminss son the younger onehe had two boys derrick and carson junior cliff yeah i remember both of them hanging around the crime scene along with a bunch of other kids i dont remember derrick talking to the press but sure i can see him shooting off his mouth he always had a mouth on him so tell me why do the police send a psychologist to talk about the monster dont tell me its some kind of evaluation theyre thinking of letting him out no i said hes locked up tight no release in sight i just saw him hes pretty deteriorated deteriorated he said like what a vegetable close to well thats good he shouldnt be alive deteriorated the village idiot thats how everyone saw him myself included he was treated with kindness pity its a bigcity lie that smalltown people are prejudiced and intolerant like those morons you see on jerry springer the monster received more kindness in treadway than he ever wouldve in la him and his mother a couple of drifters not a penny in their pockets they just showed up one day and got taken in haas stopped waited for comment i just nodded he said she was no charmschool gal noreen and he was certainly no prize but no one let em starve was she a difficult person not difficult but not exactly pleasant either she was sloppylooking kind of puffy in the face like she cried all night youd try talking to her and shed hang her head and mutter not as crazy as ardis but if you ask me they were both retarded him more than her but she was no genius it was nothing but kindness on the ardullos part taking her and ardis in she could cook but terri ardullo was a fine cook herself it was charity pure and simple done it in a way to give them some dignity scott and terri were charitable people salt of the earth scott was a nice fellow but it was terri had the ideals religious involved in all the church activities the church was on land donated by butch ardulloscotts dad presbyterian butch was born a catholic but kathy his wifewas presbyterian so butch converted and built the church for her that was a sad thing demolishing that church butch and his crew built it themselvesbeautiful little whiteboard thing with carved moldings and a steeple they had made by some danish fellow over in solvang butchs house was something too three stories also white board with a big stone porch land stretching out in all directions they grew walnuts and peaches commercially but kept a small citrus grove out in back you could smell the blossoms all the way out to the main road they gave most of the oranges and lemons away the crimmins place was almost as big but not as tasteful two mansions opposite sides of the valley his eyes clouded i remember scott when he was a kid running around the groves always cheerful the house was happy they were rich folks but downtoearth he got up filled a glass with bottled water from the fridge sure you dont want a drink thanks i will he brought both tumblers to the coffee table two gulps and his was empty refill time he said dont want to parch up like a raisin need more btus on the ac another trip to the kitchenette he drained the glass ran his finger around the rim set off a highpitched note you still havent told me why youre here i began with claires murder her name drew no look of recognition when i recounted peakes babbling he said i cant believe you came all the way up here because of that right now theres very little else to go on mr haas you just said hes deteriorated so who cares what he says now what is it exactly you think i can help you with anything you can tell me about peake that night his hands flew together and laced fingertips reddened as they pressed into knuckles nails blanched the color of clotted cream ive spent a long time trying to forget that night and it doesnt sound like youve got any good reason to make me go through it again im sorry i said if its too difficult damn thirst he said springing up must be going diabetic or something chapter haas returned looking no happier but resigned it happened at night he said but no one found out till the morning i was the second to know ted alarcon called mehe was one of scotts field supervisors scott and ted were supposed to drive up early to fresno take a look at some equipment scott was going to pick up ted and when he didnt ted called the house no answer so he drove over went in the door was open i said no one locked their doors ted figured scott had overslept maybe he should go upstairs and knock on the bedroom door that shows you the kind of guy scott wasa mexican supervisor felt comfortable going upstairs but on the way ted passed through the kitchen and saw it her he licked his lips after that god only knows how he had the strength to go upstairs the papers said he followed the bloody sneaker prints ted was a gutsy guy vietnam vet saw combat any idea where i can locate him forest lawn he said he died a couple years later cancer he patted his sternum fifty years old he smoked but nothing will convince me the shock didnt break down his health he sat up straighter as if affirming his own robustness i said so ted went upstairs saw the rest of it and called you i was still in bed the sun had just come up the phone rings and someones breathing hard gasping sounding crazy i cant make head nor tail out of it marvelles saying whats going on finally i recognize teds voice but hes still not making any sense i hear mr scott miss terri he shook his head i just knew something bad had happened when i got there ted was on the front porch with a big pool of vomit in front of him he was a darkskinned fellow but that morning he was white as a sheet he had blood on his jeans and shoes at first i thought he d done something crazy then he started throwing up some more managed to stand up just about collapsed i had to catch him all the while hes crying and pointing back at the house putting his knees together haas hunched and sank lower on the couch i took my gun out and went in i didnt want to mess anything up so i was careful where i stepped the light was on in the kitchen i saw noreen peake sitting on a chair i mean you couldnt really tell it was her but i knew maybe it was the way she was dressed his hand waved stiffly teds boot prints were in the bloodhe wore westernsbut so were others sneakers i still didnt know if anyone was up there so i moved really quietly the lights were on wherever hedlike he was showing off what hed done scott and terri were next to each otherhugging each other i ran across the hall found the little girl he emitted a lowpitched noise like poorly oiled gears grinding the fbi interviewed me wrote it up for their research get your bosses at lapd to find you a copy i nodded what led you to peakes shack the damn blood it was obvious the trail had thinned but it ran down the back stairs and out the back door specks and spots but you could still see bits of sneaker prints it kept going maybe twenty yards on the pathway then it died completely at that point i didnt know i was looking for peake only that i should head back to the shack the sneakers were right inside peakes door clerk over at the fiveanddime said peake had tried to shoplift em a few weeks before and when she caught him he mumbled and paid something and she let him keep the damn things haas glared that was the trouble everyone was too nice to him he stumbled around town looking dumb and spooky we didnt have any real crime in treadway didnt recognize him for what he was it was a peaceful place thats why a parttimer like me could be the law mostly what i did was help people fix stuff check on shutins make sure someone didnt get in his car when he was blind drunk more of a damn social worker but peake he was always strange we were all too damn trusting his hands were working furiously time to give him some breathing room i said when treadway closed down what happened to all the town records boxed and shipped up to bakersfield but forget about finding anything there were talking maps plot plans and not much of it at that sounds to me like youre digging a dry hole doctor why dont you go back to la and tell your bosses to forget all this psychological stuff peakes locked up thats the main thing he looked at his wrist no watch he got up and found it on one of the bookshelves put it on checked the dial i said i appreciate your spending the time just a few more things the article i read said you found peake sleeping like a his mouth trembled i was going to say like a baby christyeah he was asleep lying on his back hands folded over his chest snoring face all smeared with blood at first i thought hed been killed too but when i looked closer i could see it was just stains and that made me jam the cuffs on him he wiped sweat from his cheeks that place id seen it from the outside but never been inside before a sty smelled worse than a dog run what little stuff peake owned was all jumbled and thrown around spoiled food armies of bugs empty bottles of booze cans of spray paint glue tubes porno magazines he mustve gotten somewhere else cause that garbage wasnt sold in treadway no one recalls peake traveling but he mustve for the dope too he had all kinds of pillsspeed downers phenobarbitol the prescription pharmacist was over in tehachapi and they had no record of any prescriptions so it must have been street stuff scum like peake can get any sort of thing was he stoned that night had to be even after i cuffed him and screamed in his face stuck my gun right under his nose i could barely rouse him he kept fading in and out got this real dumb smile on his face and then hed close his eyes and be in nevernever land again it was all i could do not to shoot him right there because of what he didwhat i found in his shack he turned away on his hot plate hed taken the knife with him the one he used on the little girl grabbed that baby boy out of the crib and he sprang up again hell no i wont go there took me too damn long to erase those pictures from my head goodbye doctordont say another word just goodbye he hurried to the door held it open i thanked him for his time again yeah sure just one more thing i said who inherited scott and terris estate bunch of relatives all over the state her folks were from modesto and scott still had family up in san francisco on his mothers side the lawyer in charge said there were two dozen or so heirs but no one was fighting none of them gave a damn about inheriting they were all broken up about how the money came to them do you remember the lawyers name no why the hell would it matter im sure it doesnt i said and scotts mother was already deceased years before heart condition why just being thorough well youre sure being that he started to close the door i said mr haas is there anyone else around here who might be willing to talk to me what he said furiously this wasnt enough as long as im up here i might as well cover all bases you were a lawman you know what its like no i dont and i dont want to forget it theres no one from the old days fairways for old city folk looking for peace and quiet im the only treadway hick in the place which is why they stuck me out with the trailers his laugh was cold i said any idea where derrick crimmins the crimminses are as gone as anyone else after carson senior and his wife got their money out of the land they moved to florida i heard they bought a boat did all this sailing but thats all i know if theyre alive theyd be old at least he would his wife was younger she was a second wife what was her name i dont remember he answered too quickly his voice had hardened and he had closed the door till only a fiveinch crack remained the halfface i saw was grim cliff crimmins is also gone motorcycle accident in vegasit made the papers he was into that motocross stuff stunt driving parachuting surfing anything with speed and danger both of them were like that spoiled kids always had to be the center of attention carson bought them all the toys they wanted the door closed id raised someone elses stress level some psychologist no end to justify the means either had he reacted with special vehemence when the topic was the second mrs crimmins or had i already primed his emotional pump so that anything i said raised his blood pressure walking back to the car i decided upon the former how likely would he be to forget the name of one of the richest women in town so something about mrs crimmins bothered him but big deal maybe hed hated her or loved her or lusted for her without satisfaction no reason to think it related to anything i was after i didnt even know what i was after dry hole it was still before noon and i felt useless haas claimed no treadway residents were around and maybe he was telling the truth but i felt unsettledsomething about his demeanorwhy had he agreed to see me started off amiable then turned probably just horror flashbacks still as long as i was up here id already exhausted the major news sources on the ardullo murders but small towns had local papers and treadways mightve covered the carnage in detail the records had all been shipped to bakersfield not much of it haas claimed but city libraries appreciated the value of old news as i reached the seville a baby blue security sedan nosed through the trailer park different guard at the wheel also young and mustachioed maybe that was the bunker protection image he cruised alongside me stopped the way the first man had staring no surprise hed been told about me i said have a nice day you too sir on my way out i tripled the speed limit back at the grapevine gas station i made a few calls and learned that the main reference library for kern county was beale memorial in bakersfield another fortyfive minutes of driving i found beale easily enough a tenyearold modernistic sandcolored structure in a nice part of town backed by a twohundredvehicle parking lot inside was a freshsmelling atrium and the feel of efficiency i told the smiling librarian at the reference desk what i was after and she directed me to the jack maguire local history room where another pleasant woman checked a computer database and said weve got twenty years of something called the treadway intelligencer hard copy not microfiche could i see it please all of it unless thats a problem let me check she disappeared behind a door and emerged five minutes later pushing a dolly bearing two mediumsized cardboard boxes youre in luck she said it was a weekly and a small one so this is twenty years you cant take it out of the room but were open till six happy reading no raised eyebrows no intrusive questions god bless librarians i wheeled the dolly to a table a small one indeed the intelligencer was a sevenpage green sheet and the second carton was half empty copies beginning with january were bound by the dozen and bagged in plastic the publisher and editorinchief was someone named orton hatzler the managing editor wanda hatzler i copied down both names and started to read widespaced text and a few photos with surprisingly good clarity weather reports on the front page because even in california weather mattered to farmers high school dances bumper crops science projects h club scouting expeditions gleeful descriptions of the kern county fair once again lars carlson has shown himself to be the peachpieeating champion of all time page two was much the same and three was reserved for wireservice snips abstracting the international events of the day and for editorials orton hatzler had been a strong hawk on vietnam butch ardullos name cropped up frequently mostly in stories related to his leadership in the farm organization a photo of him and his wife at a fresno charity ball showed a big man with a bulldog face and a gray crew cut hovering over a willowy refinedlooking darkhaired woman luckofthedraw genetics had favored scott with his fathers build and his mothers facial features scott had inherited athletic skills as well the first time i found his name was under one of those footballhero group shotsplayers selected for the kern county allstar game kneeling and beaming in front of a goalpost scott had played halfback fortehachapi high acquitted himself honorably no pictures of terri ardullo which made sense she wasnt atreadway native had grown up in modesto carson crimminss name showed up regularly too the other rich man in town from what i could make out crimmins had started out as butch ardullos ally in the fight for the family farm but had switched course by the early seventies expressing his frustration with low walnut prices and the rising cost of doing business and advertising his willingness to sell to the highest serious bidder no pictures of him no comments from butch ardullo the intelligencer avoided taking sides march an entire issue devoted to katherine stethson ardullos funeral references to a lingering illness and to the hiking death years before of the oldest son henry junior the article was augmented by old family snapshots and pictures of butch and scott at graveside heads hung low august orton hatzler mourned nixons resignation the following december a hard frost damaged both the ardullo and the crimmins crops butch ardullo said youve got to be philosophical ride out the bad times with the good no comment from carson crimmins march the death of butch ardullo two extra pages in a memorial issue this time scott stood alone in the cemetery carson crimmins said we had our differences but he was a mans man june announcement of crimminss marriage to the former sybil noonan of los angeles as we all know miss noonan a thespian who has acted under the name cheryl norman met mr c on a cruise to the bahamas the nuptials took place at the beverly wilshire hotel in beverly hills maid of honor was the brides sister charity hernandez and ccbest men were mr cs sons carson jr and derrick the newlyweds are honeymooning in the cayman islands two photos finally a look at carson crimmins black tie in the first shot he and his new wife cut a fivetiered cake he looked to be around sixty tall stooped bald with a toosmall face completely overpowered by a beak of a nose the nose bore down upon a fleshless upper lip a pencil mustache added movievillain overtones tiny dark eyes glanced somewhere to the leftaway from the bride his smile was painful a wary owl in a tuxedo the second mrs crimminsshe whod narrowed jacob haass eyes and hardened his voicewas in her late thirties short with full arms and a lush body packed into a tight silk sheath of a sleeveless wedding dress what looked to be a deep tan spiky tiara perched upon a pile of platinum hair lots of teeth lipstick and eye shadow a generous offering of cleavage no ambivalence in her thousandwatt smile maybe it was true love or perhaps the rock on her finger had something to do with it the second picture showed the crimmins boys flanking the newlyweds on the left was carson junior around seventeen haas had said derrick was younger but that was hard to tell both boys were thin rangy with prominent noses and a touch of their fathers avian look betterlooking than their fatherstronger chins broader shoulders the same thin lips carson junior was already his fathers height derrick slightly taller juniors hair was wild blond curly derricks dark and straight hanging past his shoulders neither boy seemed to share the joy of the day both projected that immovable sullenness unique to teenagers and mugshot criminals april the frontpage story was a visit to treadway by representatives of a company called leisure time development carson crimminss invitation scott ardullo said its a free country people can sell whats theirs but they can also show some guts and hold fast to the farming tradition no followup progress reports july the wedding of scott ardullo and theresa mclntyre the bridal gown a flowing affair complete with foot train and hand embroidery including belgian lace and freshwater pearls was imported from san francisco no cleavage here theresa ardullo had favored long sleeves and full cover i moved on to the next batch of papers a halfyear after the developers visit there was still no mention of land sales or negotiation offers from other companies crimminss overtures rejected because scott ardullo had refused to sell out and no one wanted to deal for half a loaf if so crimmins wasnt commenting on the record in july he and sybil took a cruise to the bahamas snapshots of her on deck doing justice to a flowered bikini a tall iced drink in one hand the text said shed entertained the other guests with lilting renditions of show tunes and broadway classics nothing of interest till january when i came across an account of the farm league new years ball and fundraiser at the silver saddle lodge in fresno mostly pictures of people i didnt recognize till the bottom of page four scott ardullo dancing but not with his wife in his arms was sybil crimmins whiteblond hair long and flowing over bare tan shoulders her gown was black and strapless her breasts were barely tucked into its skimpy bodice as they pressed against scotts starched white chest her fingers were laced with his and her big diamond ring sparkled between his digits he looked down at her she gazed up at him something different in his eyesat odds with the solidyoungbusinessman imagetoo much heat and light a hint of stupidity dopey surrender maybe it was too many drinks or the novelty of holding someone who wasnt your wife feeling her warm breath against your face or maybe a big party had offered the two of them the chance to flaunt something theyd been savoring in dark musky rooms it could be why jacob haas had tightened up when talking about sybil crimmins scott a boy hed long admired straying with a platinumhaired strumpet from la as i stared at the picture it seemed to give off waves of heat worth well more than a thousand words i was surprised the intelligencer had published it i found an editorial three weeks later that mightve explained that after much soulsearching as well as witnessing firsthand the triumphs and the travails of those noble enoughand some would say sufficiently quixotically inclinedto brave the elements of nature as well as the much more malignant forces of big government this newspaper must weigh in on the side of rationality and selfpreservation it s all fine and well for those born with silver spoons in their mouths to pronounce righteously about abstract ideals such as the sanctity of the family farm but to the bulk of the populace those hardy but bowed men entrusted with the daytoday backbreaking labor that keeps the ground fertile the branches laden and the trucks loaded with bounty the story is quite another one joe average in treadwayand we d venture to wager any agricultural communitytoils day after day for fixed wages with no promise of security or profit or longterm investment in most cases his meager plot of backyard and his domicile are all he owns and sometimes even that is tethered to some financial institution joe average would love to plan for the future but hes usually too overwhelmed by the present so when good fortune smiles in the form of rising land values offering said mr average the chance of real gain he cannot be condemned for seizing the opportunity to afford his family the same safety and comfort that the more fortunate regard as their birthright sometimes good sense and the rights of individuals must prevail at our last kiwanis luncheon mr carson crimmins said it best progress is like a jet plane fly with it or stand on the runway and you risk getting blown away those of more fortunate lineage but less vision would do well to realize this times change and change they must the history of this great country is based upon free will private property and selfreliance those who resist the voice of the future may find themselves in that godless state known as stagnation times change brave and smart men change along with them humbly o hatzler scott ardullo fallen out of editorial good graces still wouldnt the picture have embarrassed carson crimmins as well i read through subsequent issues waiting for scotts written response to the editorial nothing either he hadnt bothered or the intelligencer had refused to print his letter five weeks later orton and wanda hatzlers names were gone from the papers masthead in their place in ornate curlicued typescript sybil crimmins publisher editor and chief writer a pink sheet now and cut back to three pages flimsy as a supermarket mailer no more wirephoto material in its place gushing movie reviews that seemed copied from press releases barely literate accounts of local events and amateurishly drawn cartoons with no apparent point the toolarge signature derrick c three barely filled pages even twenty months later when the headline screamed slaughter at the ardullo ranch ratcatcher peeke arrested by sybil noonan crimmins publisher editor and chief writer treadways darkest hour has arrived or so it seemed when sheriff jacob haas was called by best buy produce supervisor teodoro ted alar con to the ranch and found a horrible massacre of unbelievable proportion their in the house sheriff jacob haas found several dead bodies namely the ranch cook miss noreen peeke who was subjected to unbelievable and unhumane treatment at the hand of a dark fiend upstairs were the other bodies the ranch owner scott ardullo who got the place from his dad butch ardullo scotts wife terri and their daughter little brittany who was around five years old it was all horrible but no sign of one other member of the family the babyjustin all of us remember how terri had such a hard labor with him and it wouldve been great for him to be okay but the terror continued sheriff haas followed the blood and walked all the way to the back of the house where noreen peekes son ardith was living at the time and their he found justin good taste says we wont go into detail but lets just say whoever did that to a tiny little infant is a fiend of unbelievable satanlike proportion we are sick over this ardith peeke was drunk and stoned on all sorts of drugs he was the ratcatcher on the ranch going after all sorts of rodents and other pests as well so he probably had all sorts of weapons and poisons but we dont know yet what he used on those poor people its really terrible and unbelievable that something like this could happen in a small peaceful place like ours but that seems to be the way the world is going look at the manson family and how they attacked people who thought they were safe because they had money and lived behind gates and the music of today no one sings about love and romance it s all nasty stuff and getting worse so the message i guess is trust in god only he can protectyou sheriff haas called in the fbi and the bakersfield police to consult on this because its way out of what he usually deals with he told me he was in korea but never saw anything like this my sources tell me ardith peeke has always been weird sometimes people tried to help himi know my sons cliff and derrick sure did trying to get him involved in some athletic activities and whatnot theater projects you name it anything to bring him out of his shell because they figured he was lonely but he wouldn t hear of it he just stayed by himself snorting paint and glue and whatnot my sources tell me he was too into himself to relate to other people some sort of severe mental illness why did he suddenly do such a terrible thing will we ever know everyone loved theardullos they were here so long working hard even when it wasn t sure that would help because crop prices were so low but working hard because thats what they believed in they were salt of the earth people they just loved to work how could this happen herein treadway in america but thats what happens when the mind goes i guess i wish i had the answers but im only a journalist not an oracle i wish god worked in ways that we could understand why should babies and children suffer like that what makes a guy just go crazy like that questions questions question when i get some answers iii keep you posted snc she never did last edition of the intelligencer chapter returning to the main reference room i pulled up san francisco bakersfield and fresno microfiche on the ardullo slayings nothing that hadnt been covered down in la in the modesto bee i found an obituary for terri mclntyre ardullo her death was described as untimely no mention of homicide the bio was brief girl scout volunteer for the red cross honor student at modesto high member of the spanish club and the shakespeare society ba from uc davis shed been survived by her parents wayne and felice mclntyre and sisters barbara mclntyre and lynn blount a wayne mclntyre was listed in modesto feeling like a creep i dialed and told the elderly woman who answered that i was conducting a search for relatives of the argent family of pennsylvania in anticipation of the first argent reunion to be held in scranton argent she said then why us your name came up on our computer list did it well im afraid your computer got it wrong were not related to any argents sorry no anger no defensiveness no idea what had interested claire about peake i pictured him in his room grimacing twitching rocking autistically nerve endings firing randomly as lord knew what impulses coalesced and scrambled among the folds of beclouded frontal lobes the door opens a woman enters smiling eager to help a new doctor the first person to show any interest in him in sixteen years she kneels down beside him talks soothingly wanting to help him help he doesnt want help that makes him angry put her in a box bad eyes i went searching in miami newspapers for items about the crimminses obituaries were the daily special the herald informed me that carson and sybil crimmins had died together twelve years ago in a yacht explosion off the coast of south florida an unnamed crew member had perished as well carson was listed as a real estate developer sybil as a former entertainer no pictures next came a las vegas sun reference to carson crimmins jrs death in a motocross accident two years later near pimm nevada nothing on the younger brother derrick too bad hed talked on record once maybe hed be willing to reminisce if i found him former intelligencer publisher orton hatzler was memorialized in a backpage paragraph of the santa monica evening outlook hed died in that beach town of natural causes at the age of eightyseven just a few miles from my house memorial services at the seaside presbyterian church donations to the american heart association in lieu of flowers the surviving widow wanda hatzler maybe she still lived in santa monica but if i found her what would i ask about id uncovered a financial battle between the ardullo and crimmins clans had played sherlock with a single photograph that suggested another type of competition but nothing suggested that the slaughter of the ardullos had resulted from anything other than one madmans blood feast i thought of the suddenness of the attack asian cultures had a word for that kind of unprovoked savagery amok something about peakes amok had caught claire argents interest and now she was dead along with three other men and peake had predicted the murders of two of them prophet of doom in a locked cell there had to be a common thread i abandoned the periodicals indexes and searched computer databases for wanda hatzler and derrick crimmins findaperson coughed up a single approximation derek albert crimmins on west th street in new york city i used a library pay phone called and participated in a confused ninetysecond conversation with a man who sounded very old very gentle and from his patois probably black w hatzler was listed in santa monica no address the womans voice on the tape machine was also elderly but hearty i gave her machine the same spiel id offered jacob haas told her id stop by later today before i left bakersfield i phoned milo he was away from his desk and not answering his cell phone route clogged up just past newhall an accident had closed the northbound lanes and caused rubberneck spillover in the opposite direction a dozen flashing red lights cop cars from several jurisdictions and ambulances parked diagonally across the freeway news copters whirring overhead an overturned truck blocked the mouth of the nearest onramp inches from its front wheels was a snarled mass of red and chrome a highway patrolman waved us on but inertia slowed us to a snail slide i turned on kfwb the accident was a big story some sort of altercation between two motorists a chase off the ramp then an abrupt uturn that took the pursuing vehicle the wrong way road rage they were calling it as if labeling changed anything it took over two hours to get back to la and by the time i reached the westside the skies had darkened to charcoal splotches underlaid with vermilion too late to drop in on an old woman i bought gas at sunset and la brea and called wanda hatzler again this time she answered come on over im expecting you youre sure its not too late dont tell me youre one of those morning people as a matter of fact im not good she said morning people should be forced to milk cows i called home to say id be late robins message said shed be in studio city till eight doing some onsite repairs at a recording session synchrony of the hyperactive i drove to santa monica wanda hatzlers address was on yale street south of wilshire a stucco bungalow behind a lawn of lavender wild onions thyme and several species of cactus an alarm company sign protruded from the herbs but no fence surrounded the property she was at the curb by the time i finished parking a big womannearly six feet with healthy shoulders and heavy limbs her hair was cut short the color was hard to make out in the darkness dr delaware wanda hatzler brisk shake rough hands i like your carused to have a fleetwood until orton couldnt drive anymore and i got tired of supporting the oil companies show me some identification just to play it safe then come inside inside her house was cramped warm bright ashpaneled and filled with chairs covered in at least three variations of brown paisley cotton georgia okeeffe prints hung on the walls along with some muddylooking california pleinair oils an open doorway peeked into the kitchen where soft dolls were arranged on the counterchildren in all sorts of native costumes propped up sitting a tiny stuffed kindergarten old white twoburner stove a saucepan sat above dancing blue flames and a childhood memory hit me the coldafternoon fragrance of canned vegetable soup i tried not to think of peakes culinary forays wanda hatzler closed the door and said go on make yourself comfortable i sat in a paisley armchair and she stood there she wore a deep green vneck pullover over a white turtleneck loose gray pants brown slipon shoes the hair was black well salted with silver she couldve been anywhere from seventy to eightyfive her face was broad bassethound droopy crumpled as used wrapping paper moist bluegreen eyes seemed to have suction power over mine she wasnt smiling but i sensed some sort of amusement something to drink coke diet coke hundredproof rum im fine thanks what about soup im going to have some no thanks tough customer she went into the kitchen filled a mug came back and sat down blew into the soup and drank treadway what a hole why on earth would you want to know anything about it i told her about claire and peake emphasizing a therapeutic relationship gone bad keeping prophecy out of it omitting the other murders she put the mug down peake i always thought he was retarded wouldnt have pegged him for violence so what do i know the only psychology i ever studied was an introductory course at sarah lawrence back in another century ill bet you know plenty she smiled why because im old dont blush i am old she touched one seamed cheek the truth is in the flesh didnt samuel butler say that or maybe i made it up anyway im afraid i cant give you any ideas on peake never had a feel for him now youre going to leave too bad youre goodlooking and i was looking forward to this to talking about treadway to maligning treadway how long did you live there too long never could stand the place at the time of the murders i was working in bakersfield chamber of commerce not exactly a cosmopolis but at least there was some semblance of civilization like sidewalks at night i helped my husband put the paper to bed such as it was she lifted the mug and drank have you read the rag twenty years worth lord whered you get hold of it beale memorial library you are motivated she shook her head twenty years worth orton would be shocked he knew what hed come down to he didnt like publishing he liked publishing fine he wouldve preferred running the the new york times he was a dartmouth boy the intelligencerdoesnt that reek of east coast sensibilities unfortunately his politics were somewhere to the right of joe mccarthy and after the war that wasnt very fashionable also he had a little problem she pantomimed tossing back a drink hundredproof rumdeveloped a taste for it when serving in the pacific lived to eightyseven anyway developed palate cancer recovered then leukemia went into remission then cirrhosis and even that took years to kill him his doctor saw an x ray of his liver called him a medical miraclehe was oodles older than me laughing she finished the soup got up poured a refill came back the intelligencer was orton hitting bottom he began his career at the philadelphia inquirer and proceeded to embark on a downward slide for the rest of his life treadway was our last stopwe bought the rag for next to nothing and settled into a life of crushing tedium and genteel poverty gawd i hated that place stupid people everywhere you looked social darwinism i suppose the smart ones leave for the big city only the idiots remain to breed another laugh orton used to call it the power of positive backpedaling he and i decided not to breed i made sure not to look at the dolls in the kitchen she said the only reason i stayed there was because i loved the guyvery goodlooking even handsomer than you virile too she crossed her legs were those eyelashes batting i said the ardullos dont sound stupid she gave a dismissive wave yes i know butch went to stanfordhe told anyone whod listen but he got in because of football everyone else liked him but i didnt pleasant enough superficially one of those fellows whos convinced hes a magnet for females puts on the galahad act too much confidence in a man is not an endearing trait particularly when its unjustified butch had no firestolid straightahead as a horse with blinders point him in a direction and he went and that wife of his an ohsodelicate victorian relic taking to her bed all the time i used to think it was phony baloney called her little miss vapors but then she surprised me and actually died of something she shrugged thats the trouble with being malicious occasionally one is wrong and a nasty little urge to repent seeps in what about scott smarter than butch but no luminary he inherited land grew fruit when the weather obliged not exactly einstein eh which isnt to say i wasnt shocked and sickened by what happened to him and his poor wifesweet thing liked to read i always suspected there might be an intellectual streak hidden somewhere her lip trembled the worst thing was those babies by the time it happened orton and i had just sold the paper and moved down here when orton read about the murder in the times he vomited sat down at his desk and wrote a storyas if he were still a journalist then he ripped it up vomited again drank daiquiris all night and passed out for two days when he woke up he couldnt feel his legs took another day to convince him he wasnt dying great disappointment for him he cherished the idea of drinking himself to death sensitive soul his big mistake was taking the world seriouslythough i guess in a case like that youd have to even i cried for the babies i wasnt good with children found them frightening too much vulnerability a big girl like me never seemed suited to those little twig bones hearing what peake had done confirmed all that i didnt sleep well for a long time she brandished the mug i havent thought about it in years wondered if raking it up might bother me but apart from thinking about the babies this is rather fun for twenty years we lived above the newspaper office scrounged for advertising took extra jobs to get by orton did peoples bookkeeping i tutored incredibly stupid children in english and wrote press releases for the yahoos at the c of c so you never had much contact with peake i knew who he wasrather conspicuous fellow lurching around in the alleys going through the garbagebut no we never exchanged a single sentence she recrossed her legs this is good knowing i can still remember a few things some juice in the old machine what else would you like to know the crimmins family morons she sipped more soup worse than the ardullos vulgarians carson was like butch uncreative obsessed by the dollar but minus the charm in addition to walnuts he grew lemons orton used to say he looked as if hed been weaned on them never seemed to take pleasure in anything im sure you have a word for it anhedonia there you go she said i shouldve taken intermediate psychology what about sybil slut gold digger dumb blonde right out of a bad movie out for crimminss money i said it sure wasnt his looks they met on a cruise line fawgawdsakes what a horrid cliche if carson had had a brain in his head hed have jumped overboard she caused him problems pause eyeblink she was a vulgar woman she claimed to be an actress and im the sultan of brunei what kind of difficulties did she cause i said oh you know she said stirring things upwanting to run everything the moment she hit town transform herself into a star she actually tried to get a theater group going got carson to build a stage in one of his barns bought all sorts of equipment orton laughed so hard telling me about it he nearly lost his bridgework guess who moved in wanda jean harlow harlow in horseshit who did sybil plan on acting with the local yokels she also tried to rope in carsons boys one of them i forget which had a minor knack for drawing so she put him to work painting sets she told orton they both had star quality i remember her coming into the office with her ad for the casting call leaning toward me she spoke in a chirpy littlegirl voice i tell you wanda theres hidden talent all over the place everyones creative you just have to bring it out she even thought shed rope carson in and just being civil was a performance for him guess what play she had planned our town if shed had a brain you could have credited her with some irony our dump she shouldve called it the whole thing fell apart no one showed up at the audition carson helped that along the day before the ad was supposed to run he paid orton double not to print it stage fright she laughed he said it was a waste of time and money he also said he wanted the barn back for hay was that pretty typical i said crimmins buying what he wanted what youre really asking is was orton corrupt when he dealt with wealth and power and the answer is absolutely she smoothed her sweater no apologies carson and butch ran that town if you wanted to survive you played along when butch died scott took over his half it wasnt even a town it was a joint fiefdom with the rest of us serfs balancing on a wire between them orton was caught right in the middle by the late seventies we decided we were getting the heck out one way or the other orton had qualified for social security and mine was about to kick in plus id inherited a small annuity from an aunt all we wanted was to sell the printing equipment and get something for ownership of the paper orton approached scott first because he thought scott would be easier to deal with but scott wouldnt even listen beating her chest she put on a gorilla face me farmer me do nothing else straight ahead and pigheaded just like his father so orton went to carson and to his surprise carson said hed consider it surprise because carson was uncreative and because everyone knew carson wanted to get out of treadway himself each year thered be talk of some new real estate deal how long had that been going on years the main problem was scott wouldnt hear of it and half the land wasnt very attractive to the developers the approach orton used with carson was to suggest the paper might be a good activity for sybil to keep her out of trouble she snapped her ringers that did the trick now i understood the intelligencers sudden editorial shift toward crimmins what other kind of trouble was sybil getting into i said she smiled archly what do you think i saw a picture of her and scott at a dance the smile faltered then changed course growing wider fuller ripe with glee oh that picture she sang we might as well have published them naked orton wasnt going to print it a gentleman to the last but that night he was sloshed to the gills so i put the paper to bed breathing in deeply she savored the exhalation i said what was the fallout nothing public i suppose there was tension among those directly concerned terri ardullo always impressed me as tightly wound but she didnt run around after sybil with a hatchet the ardullos were never the type to air their laundry in public same for carson what did the serfs have to say about it nothing that i heard doesnt pay to antagonize the nobility if you want to eat and it wasnt as if everyone didnt already know about scott and sybil the affair was public knowledge i said for months certainly since sybils production fell apart i suppose she needed another role she shook her head the two of them adopted a flimsy coven first scotts truck would speed out of town an hour later the sluts little thunderbird would zoom away shed always return first usually with shopping bags sometimes shed visit the peasants in the local stores showing off what shed acquired then sure enough scotts truck would zip past ludicrous how could they possibly think they were getting away with it so carson had to know i dont see how he couldnt have and no reaction at all he never tried to stop it carson was much older than sybil maybe he couldnt cut the mustard didnt mind someone else keeping her busy from time to time perhaps thats why he bought ortons line about finding sybil recreation we were certainly trying to exploit himdid you read the rag after she took over borderline coherent youre a charitable young man she stretched my this is great fun what can you tell me about jacob haas i said wellmeaning but a boob before he became sheriff hed been working as a bookkeeper in bakersfield he got the job because hed served in korea took some law enforcement courses in junior college didnt offend anyone meaning he wasnt aligned with either butch or carson meaning he never put their kids in jail was that ever a possibility i said not with scott but with the crimmins boys sure two obnoxious little buggersspoiled rotten carson gave them fast cars which they proceeded to race down main street it was common knowledge that they drank and took drugs so it was only luck they never killed anyone one of them paid for his recklessness a few years laterdied motorcycling any other offenses besides drunk driving general bad character they treated the migrants like dirt chased the migrant girls when the picking season was over they switched gears and bothered the local girls i remember one night very late id just finished with the paper walked outside to get some air when i saw a car screech to a stop down the block one of those soupedup things with stripes on the side i knew right away whose it was the back door opened someone fell out and the car sped away the person lay there for a second then got up and started walking down the middle of main street very slowly i went over it was a little mexican girlcouldnt have been older than fifteen and she spoke no english her face was all puffy from crying and her hair and clothes were messed and torn i tried to talk to her but she just shook her head burst into tears and ran away the street ended a block later and she disappeared in the fields whose fields i said her eyes narrowed then closed let me think about that north that would have been scotts alfalfa field so no consequences for cliff and derrick none how did they get along with their stepmother are you asking if they slept with her she said actually my imagination hadnt carried me that far why not dont you watch talk shows youre saying sybil no she said im not saying anything of the sort merely musing because she was a slut and they were healthy big boys to be fairsomething i generally detesti never picked up an inkling of anything quite so repellent but howd they get along who loves a stepmother and sybil wasnt exactly the maternal type but she managed to get them involved in her theatrical production only one of themthe one who drew derrick i said she wrote about it in the intelligencer still spoiled adolescents dont do things they hate she turned quiet yes i suppose he must have enjoyed it why all these questions about the crimmins clan derrick crimminss name came up in newspaper accounts of the murders commenting about peakes oddness other than haas he was the only person to speak on the record so i thought id track him down if you find him dont send regards of course hed jump at the chance to ridicule peake he and his brother delighted in tormenting peakeanother bit of their delinquency tormenting how i said what youd expect from rotten kidsteasing poking more than once i saw the two of them and a gang of others they ran with collecting in the alley that ran behind our office peake used to hang around there too inspecting garbage cans looking for paint cans and god knows what the crimmins brats and their friends must have been bored gone after some sport they circled him laughed cuffed him around a bit stuck a cigarette in his mouth but refused to light it the last time id had enough so i stepped out into the alley using some blue language and they dispersed not that peake was grateful didnt even look at me just turned his back and walked away from me i never bothered again howd peake react to the ridicule i said just stood there like this her facial muscles slackened and her eyes went blank the boy was never all there no anger nope like a zombie were you surprised when he exploded into violence i suppose she said it wouldnt surprise me today though what do they always sayits the quiet ones can you ever tell about anyone any theories about why he killed the ardullos he was crazy youre the psychologist why do crazy people act crazy i started to thank her and moved to stand but she waved me still you want a theory how about bad luck wrong time wrong place like walking off a curb getting hit by a bus her lips worked she looked ready to cry its not easy surviving i keep waiting for something to happen to me but my luck keeps running in the black sometimes its infuriating yet another day the same old routine another wave all right then be off abandon me i havent helped you anyway youve been very helpful oh please none of that but she reached over and took my hand her skin was cold dry so smooth it seemed inorganic bear that in mind doctor longevity can be hell too knowing things will inevitably go bad but not knowing when chapter when i left just after eight pm wilshire was a pretty stream of headlights under a blackpearl sky my head hurt stuffed with history and hints more hatred and intrigue in treadway than id counted on but still no connection to claire argent ready to end the workday i called my service from the pay booth in the parking lot an earful robin would be delayed till ten and a particularly obnoxious encino attorney wanted my help on a festering custody case he knew i worked only for the court not as a hired gun and he hadnt paid his bill for a consultation id done last year delusions were everywhere the fifth message was from milo ill be at my desk by seventhirty get in touch the operator said he sounded pretty irritated your detective friend i drove to the station announced myself at the desk waited as the clerk called up to the robberyhomicide room uniforms passed in and out no one paid me any attention as i scanned the wanted posters a few minutes later the stairwell door opened and milo bounded out brushing hair off his forehead lets go outside i need air he said not bothering to stop his suit was the color of curdled oatmeal the right lapel stained with something green his tie was tight his neck was suffering and he looked like a poster boy for national hypertension week we reached the sidewalk and started walking up butler dry acidic heat hung in the air and i wished id stopped for a cold drink nothing on pelley yet he said so dont ask its the beatty twins whove been occupying my day brother leroy told people he had an acting gig which people his fellow juiceheads willis hooks and i were down at the murder scene this evening not far from a liquor store where leroy used to hang along with some other grapesuckers couple of them said leroy had bragged about becoming a movie star how long ago was this i said time isnt a strong concept with these guys but they figure three four months leroy also told his drinking buds he was gonna get his brother involved with the moviesaid once the director found out he had a twin he offered to pay more the winos thought he was just running his mouth cause leroy tended to do that when he got sufficiently drunk they didnt even believe leroy had a twin hed never mentioned ellroy did leroy report back after the filming no he returned a week later cranky refusing to talk about it if hed gotten hold of any cash no one saw it his buddies figured hed gone on a bender flushed it all down his gullet or mr griffith d wark stiffed someone else i said now my mind was racing fragments of history coming together pieces fitting i thought of that he said none of them saw any tall white guy chatting up leroy did ellroys drinking pals have anything to say about the movie aguilar hasnt found any pals for ellroy yet he seems to have been the loner twin lived by himself near the train tracks one of the conductors remembers seeing him from time to time stumbling around figured he was crazy because he was always talking to himself he scratched the side of his nose so here i am stuck with the movie angle again maybe its a link between dada and the twins but still no tiein with claire except for the fact that she went to the movies hell cant you see me explaining that to her parents i showed her picture to the bums and they didnt recognize her no surprise why would she have gone down to some south central wino kip im gonna head back tonight to that place in toluca lake where richard used to wait tablesthe oak barrel its a long shot but maybe claire dined there for all we know mr wark picked up both of em thereand incidentally you were right about wark being dw griffiths middle name i looked it up so this asshole sees himself as a cinema hotshot he scratched his head this is exactly the kind of flaky bullshit i hate dealing with why would warkor anyone elsebump offhis cast keeping the budget low i said better not give the studios any ideas seriously whats going on here and howand whywould a robot like peake be clued in maybe warks filming murder a snuff thing that or a variantnot necessarily a sexual angle a chronology of unnatural deatha literal blood walk for the underground market that would explain why the scripts never been registered and why wark used a fake name to rent his equipment and cut out on the bill it could also explain the diversity of victims and methods and the ritualism we could be dealing with someone who sees himself as a splatter auteur playing god by setting up charactersreal people then bumping them off psychopaths depersonalize their victims wark could be accomplishing the ultimate degradation reducing his cast to prototypes the twins the actor that kind of thing its cruel primitive thinkingexactly the way kids play out their anger some angry kids never grow up as far as peake is concerned he could be involved because wark wants him involved because warks someone out of peakes past warks mightily affected by peakes crimes now hes creating his own production wants to integrate peake into the process and ive got a possible candidate for wark a fellow named derrick crimmins i told him everything id learned about treadway the longtime conflict between the ardullos and the crimminses scotts affair with sybil the crimmins boys antisocial behavior derricks involvement with sybils abortive theater group he had no special love for his stepmother milo but he stayed involved with her because the whole notion of theaterof productiongrabbed him personally he also matches the physical description vito bonner gave us of warktall thinand his age fits derrick would be in his midthirties now milo took a long time to think about that we were walking dark residential streets shoes slapping the pavement so all the crimminses except this derrick are dead father stepmother brother all by accidental death interesting isnt it now hes a family murderer too rigging accidents can also be seen as a form of productionsetting up scenes derrick was far from a model citizen wanda hatzler described him and his brother as spoiled bullies and possible rapists i stopped what he said something else just occurred to me sheriff haas told me that after the murder peake was found with lots of different drugs in his shack including some illegal prescription pills phenobarbital none was missing from the pharmacy in treadway and no one in the ardullo household had obtained a prescription for it so haas was certain it had to have been obtained out of town but no one ever saw peake leave treadway so maybe he had a dope source in town wanda saw derrick and his friends hanging around with peake mostly to harass him peake offered no resistance was extremely passive what if the crimmins boys were the ones who supplied him with drugshaving fun with the village idiot the night of the massacre peake got massively stoned his psyche broke down and he slaughtered the ardullos and derrick and his brother realized theyd played an indirect role in it someone else might be horrified by that but the crimmins boys had plenty of reason to hate scott ardullo his refusal to sell his land had obstructed their fathers big development deal for years and scott was sleeping with their stepmother what if they were pleased with what peake had done took some vicarious credit for it and in a sick sense it was a successful production the land deal went through the family became rich again that kind of high couldve been powerful stuff for a kid whod already shown some serious antisocial tendencies a few years later derrick tries his hand at something more direct blowing up daddy and stepmoms boat and once again he gets away with it or he said the boat thing really was an accident someone else gave peake his dope warks not derrick and derricks just some playboy drinking pifla coladas in palm beach while working on his melanoma all that too i said but as long as were being contentious ill go you one further derrick and cliffs involvement was more than vicarious they fed peake dope and played on his delusions intentionally prodded him to kill the ardullos they were dominant aggressive peake was passive impressionable maybe they learned that peake harbored some resentment of his own toward the ardullos and they used that perhaps they never really expected it to happenidle teenage dope talkand when peake ran amok they were frightened initially then amazed then pleased he knuckled his eyes what happened during your childhood to make you think this way too much spare time alcoholic father depressed mother dark hours alone in the basement fighting to escape the noise upstairs struggling to create my own world my my my at the very least i said wouldnt it be good to find out where derrick lives what his financial situation is does he have some sort of police record fine he said fine back in robberyhomicide he played with the computer no wants or warrants out on derrick crimmins no listings on the sex offender rosters or the fbis vicap file and as far as we could tell he wasnt occupying space in any california jail a call to the department of motor vehicles police info line revealed zero current registrations under that name same for griffith d wark findaperson yielded several d crimminses but no derricks no gd wark milo said ill follow up with social security tomorrow ill even check out the death certificates for the crimmins family just to show you i care where exactly did the boat thing go down all i know is out on the water off the coast of south florida i said brother cliff crashed on a motocross run in pimm nevada he scribbled closed his pad got up heavily whoever this wark is hows he contacting peake maybe with ease i said maybe he works at starkweather he grimaced meaning i need to get a look at personnel records my old pal mr swig if this blood walk is a megasnuff you think warks actually hoping to sell it or he just wants to keep it around for his own amusement if hes derrick and he inherited a bundle and doesnt need money it could be one big sick diversion a game i always thought the murders had a gamelike quality to them if only he said you were a stupid guy and i could kiss off your fantasies okay back to planet earth the oak barrel ill come with if you want he checked his timex what about hearth and home too hot to light a fire in the hearth and the homes empty for a couple more hours suit yourself he said you drive toluca lakes a pretty secret sandwiched between north hollywood and burbank the main drag is a curving eastern stretch of riverside drive lined with lowprofile shops many with their original forties and fifties facades the housing ranges from garden apartments to major estates bob hope used to live there other stars still do mostly those leaning toward the gop lots of the great western flicks were shot nearby at burbank studios and up in the surrounding foothills the equestrian complex is just a short drive away as is nbc headquarters a quick turn on either side of riverside takes you onto quiet streets emptied at night by permitonly parking and an attentive police force toluca lake restaurants tend to be dim and spacious leaning toward that unclassifiable fare known as continental cuisine once an la staple now nearly extinct west of laurel canyon white hair doesnt elicit sneers from the wait staff martinis arent the retro craze of the minute piano bars endure from time to time i testify in a burbank court and find myself down here thinking about the perfect suburbia of blackandwhite tv shows moderne furniture fat sedans dark lipstick jack webb tippling steelyeyed at a vinylpadded bumper winding down after a long day on the set nearby might be the guy who played ward cleaver whatever his name was id been to a few of the riverside drive restaurants but not the oak barrel it turned out to be a modest stack of bricks and stucco squatting on a southeastern corner halflit by streetlamps the caskandtankard logo discreetly outlined in green neon above the porte cochere a parking lot twice the size of the restaurant put the construction date at late forties early fifties no valet just a welllit asphalt skillet with scores of spaces a quarter of them occupied lincolns cadillacs buicks more lincolns the front door was oak inlaid with a panel of bubbled glass we walked in confronted a lattice screen stepped around it into a small reception area backed by the cocktail lounge four drinkers flashing elbow tv news winking above a wall full of bottles no sound on the set the air was icy seasoned with toodelicate piano music the lighting barely strong enough to let us make out colors but the maitre ds bright green jacket managed to work its way through the gloom he was tall at least seventy with slicked white hair roman features and blackrimmed eyeglasses a reservation book was spread out before him on the oak lectern plenty of open slots the lattice blocked a view of the main dining room to his left but i could hear silverware clatter conversational thrum the pianist was turning lady be good into a minuet the maitre d said good evening gentlemen capped smile clear diction peppered by an italian accent as we came closer he said ah detective nice to see you again a small gold rectangle on his jacket was engraved lew hey you remember said milo with joviality that mightve been real i still got a memory and we dont get too many police not here so this time you come to eat to drink said milo this way a green sleeve flourished you making any progress on richard wish i could say i was said milo speaking of which has this woman ever been here a photo of claire had snapped into his hand like a magicians dove lew smiled speaking of which huh you here to drink anything but information sure beer if you carry that lew laughed and peered at the picture no sorry never saw her why she know richard thats what id like to know said milo tell me is there anything else that came to mind since the last time i was here the maitre d handed back the photo nah richard was a good boy quiet good worker we dont usually hire the socalleds but he was okay the socalleds i said socalled actors socalled directorsmostly theyre punks think theyre overqualified for everything doin you a big favor to show up nine times outta ten they cant handle carrying a bread plate or they end up mouthing off to some regular and i gotta untangle everybodys shorts he reached behind his back and tugged upward we prefer old guys he said classy pros like me but richard was okay for a kid politemadam and sir not that goddamn you guys nice boy very nice boy thats why even though he wanted to be an actor i hired him also he begged me said he really needed the money and i was right about him good worker got the orders right no complaints cmon lets go over get you gents a nice drink the bar was an enormous lacquered walnut parabola rimmed with red leather brass bar red stools with brass legs the four drinkers were all glassyeyed middleaged men wearing sport coats one necktie three sport shirts with open collars spread over wide lapels plenty of space between them they stared into tall glasses on paper coasters dipped thick hands into dishes of nuts olives roast peppers sausage chunks pink curls of boiled shrimp pierced by red plastic toothpicks the bartender was pushing sixty darkskinned with luxuriant hair and the face of a carved tiki god he and a couple of the drinkers looked up as lew showed us to the end of the bar but a second later everyone had settled back into booze hypnosis lew said hernando bring these gents grolsch said milo i asked for the same and lew said some of that sauterne for me the reserve stuff but just a little hernandos hands moved like a chopsockey hero after hed delivered the drinks and returned to the center of the bar milo said you ever get a customer named wark work wark milo spelled it mid to late thirties tall thin dark hair could be curly claims to be a film producer the maitre ds eyes were merry plenty of claimstobes but no i dont recall any wark milo sipped his beer what about crimmins derrick crimmins he might have come in with a woman younger long blond hair might maybethis is still about richard maybe said milo sorry no crimmins either but people come in without reservations we dont know their names were talking eight nine months ago would you remember every nameeven with an excellent memory lew looked hurt you want me to check the reservation books im happy to do it but i can tell you right now weird names like that id definitely remember he closed his eyes tall and skinny huh richards customer could be i am thinking of one guy never gave me a name just waltzed in expecting to be seatedbut no girl just him i remember him clearly because he caused problems monopolized richards time to the point where the other customers werent getting their food they start complaining to the busboys the busboys gripe to me i have to deal with it another reason i remember was it was the only time i had any kind of problem with richard not that he gave me any lipit wasnt his problem it was the guys just kept gabbing to richard and richard didnt know what to do hed just been working here for a few weeks we drum into em the customers always right so this musta put richard in a situation know what i mean so i have to deal with it doing my best to be polite but the guy is not polite about it gives me the look like who am i to tell him know what i mean did richard say what the guy was talking to him about no but the guy did something like hey i could be his meal ticket you think he wants to work here for the rest of his life richards off at another table looking at me out of the corner of his eye letting me know this isnt his idea i offered the guy some comp wine but he just said something nasty threw down money and left barely covered the check not much left over for richard caesar salad veal parmigiana german chocolate cake so tell me said milo what song was the piano playing lew grinned probably you talk too much he shrugged im just lucky always had a memory never bother with that elderberry stuff ginkgo biloba any a that tell the truth sometimes its not fun i got two exwives i wouldnt mind forgetting his laugh was phlegmy you got pictures of this wark guy i can tell you right away if its the same one not yet said milo can you describe him sixtwo maybe three skinny those allblack clothes like they do now the socalleds my day that was going to a funeral hair long dark not curly though straight downlike a wig come to think of it it probably was a wig big nose little eyes skinny little mouth not a goodlooking guy hungry like know what i mean and tanlike he baked himself under a lamp how many times did he come in here just that once one thing that might help i saw his car corvette not a new onethe style with the big swoop in front bright yellow like a taxicab i saw it because after he left i cracked the door made sure he was really leaving youre saying he had something to do with richard getting killed sonofabiteh dont know said milo finishing his drink youve been very helpful i appreciate it is there anyone else working tonight who might remember the guy lew ran his finger around his wineglass the sauterne was brassy gold he hadnt touched it maybe angeloill check want a refill no thanks you didnt happen to get a look at the corvettes license plate even a few numbers ha said the maitre d youre one a those cockeyed optimists huh like in the songthink ill go tell doris to play that chapter angelo was a short bald waiter of the same vintage as lew rushing flushfaced between two large tables when the maitre d beckoned him away his frown turned a pencil mustache into an inverted v and he approached us muttering under his breath milo had talked to him too months ago but he recalled the interview only vaguely the troublemaker in black evoked nothing from him but a shrug this is concerning richard said lew richard was a nice kid said angelo milo said is there anything else you can tell us about him nice kid angelo repeated said he was gonna be a movie stargotta get back everyones bitching about not enough mushrooms in the sauce ill talk to the kitchen said lew good idea angelo left lew said sorry bout that his wifes sick give me your card and ill call you when i have a chance to look at those books driving back to the city i said maybe the meeting at the oak barrel was richards audition richard answers the casting ad wark says let me meet you where you work see you in your natural habitat like a hunter sighting prey it would also eliminate the need for wark to have a formal casting location pretty gullible of richard he wanted to be a star he sighed curly wig straight wigthis is starting to feel nasty now all we have to do is find mr w have a nice little chat youve got a car now a yellow corvette isnt exactly inconspicuous dmv doesnt list colors only make model and year still its a start if the vette wasnt stolen or never registered big fendersprobably a seventies model he sat up a bit a vette could also explain why richard was stashed in his own car vettes dont have trunks someone else to think about i said the blond girlfriend she fits the seconddriver theory she waits nearby until warks ditched richards vw picks wark up they drive away untraceable no reason to connect the two of them with richard every producer needs a bimbo right her i dont even have a fake name for taking out a cigar he opened the window coughed and thought better of it he closed his eyes and his fleshy features settled into what might have passed for stupor i stayed on riverside going west by coldwater canyon he still hadnt spoken but his eyes opened and he looked troubled something doesnt fit i said its not that he said its the movie angle all these years sweeping the stables and i finally break into showbiz i didnt hear from him in the morning and robin and i went for breakfast down by the beach in santa monica by eleven she was back in the shop with spike and i was taking a call from the obnoxious encino attorney i listened to one paragraph of oily spiel then told him i wasnt interested in working with him he sounded hurt then he turned nasty finally slammed down the phone which provided a bit of good cheer two seconds later my service phoned while you were on the line doctor a mrs racano called from fort myers beach florida florida made me think of the crimmins boating accident then the name clicked in dr harry racano claires major professor id called case western two days ago asking about him i copied down the number and phoned a crispvoiced woman answered mrs racano this is eileen its dr alex delaware from los angeles thanks for calling yes she said guardedly mary ellen at case told me you called about claire argent what in gods name happened to her she was abducted and murdered i said so far no one knows why i was asked to consult on the case why did you think harry could help you were trying to learn whatever we can about claire your husbands name showed up on one of her papers faculty advisers can get to know their students pretty well harry was claires dissertation chairman they were both interested in alcoholism we had claire at the house from time to time sweet girl very quiet i cant believe shes been murdered talking faster anxious about something claire worked on alcoholism here i said but a few months before she was killed she quit her job somewhat abruptly and took a position at starkweather hospital its a state facility for the criminally insane silence mrs racano i wouldnt know about any of that claire and i hadnt been in contact since she left cleveland did she ever show an interest in homicidal psychotics i said her sigh blew through the phone like static have you met her parents yes and but of course they wouldnt say anything oh dr delaware i suppose youd better know she gave me the basic facts i got the details back at the research library newspaper files the pittsburgh postgazette twentyseven years ago but it couldve been any major paper the story had been covered nationally family slain in youths rampage responding to calls from concerned neighbors police entered a west pittsburgh home this morning and discovered the bodies of an entire family and hiding in the basement the youth who is alleged to have murdered them james and margaret bmwnlee and their children carlo and cooper had been stabbed and beaten to death with a knife and a tenderizing mallet obtained from the kitchen of their oakland home brownlee was a delivery supervisor for purity bottled water and his wife was a homemaker both were described as early risers with regular habits and by noon yesterday when mr brownlee hadn t left for work and none of the other family members had appeared neighbors called thepolice the suspect denton ray argent was found crouching near the furnace still clutching the murder weapons and drenched with blood argent who lived with his parents and a younger sister three doors down from the brownlees was termed odd and reclusive a high school dropout whose personality had changed several years before he was around fourteen when it started said a woman who declined to be identified even before then he wasn t very socialquiet but the whole family was they kept to themselves but when he got to be a teenager he stopped taking care of himself real sloppy you d see him walking around talking to himself waving his hands around we all knew he was strange but no one thought it would ever come to this reports that denton argent had worked briefly as a gardener for the brownlees have not been confirmed argent was taken into custody at central jail pending booking and further investigation plugging denton argents name into the computer pulled up several more stories that reiterated the crime then nothing for a month until a pagethree item appeared family killer committed to hospital alleged mass murderer denton argent has been judged legally insane and incapable of assisting in his own defense by three courtappointed psychiatrists argent accused of slaying mr and mrs james brownlee and their two small children in a homicidal spree that shocked the quiet oakland neighborhood and the entire city was evaluated by doctors hired by both the prosecution and the defense it was pretty clear said assistant district attorney stanley rosenfield assigned to prosecute the case argent is severely schizophrenic and completely out of touch with reality no purpose would be served by going to trial rosenfield went on to say that argent would be committed to a state hospital for an indefinite term should he ever regain competence we ii haul him into court one week after that murderers family stays putand mum the parents of family killer denton argent have no plans to move from the chestnut street address where three doors from their wellkept house their son slew all four members of a neighboring family argent was judged criminally insane and incapable of assisting in his own defense against the charges of murdering james and margaret brownlee and their two young children carlo and cooper his parents robert ray and ernestine argent owners of a local gift shop have refused to talk to the press but neighbors report they have stated an unwillingness to run from what denton did their shop was closed for three weeks but later reopened reportedly with a substantial drop in business but the general attitude of the neighborhood was charitable these are decent people said another neighbor roland danniger everyone knew denton was strange and maybe they should ve tried to help him more but how could they know he d turn violent if i feel sorry for anyone its the little sister shes always kept to herself now you dont see her at all the reference was to argent s younger sister claire who was removed from her public junior high school and is reportedly being tutored at home five years later family slayer dies in asylum mass murderer denton argent has died of a brain seizure in his cell at farview state hospital authorities reported today argent murdered an entire family during a bloody earlymorning spree five years ago judged mentally incompetent he was committed to the state facility where he has resided without incident the seizure possibly due to a previously undiagnosed epileptic condition or to psychiatric medication caused argent to pass out in his locked cell and to choke on his own vomit in the middle of the night his body was discovered the following morning hospital authorities report no suspicions of foul play harry never found out until claires last year in grad school eileen racano had said it was a shock the poor thing carrying around that burden how did she bring it up it was during the time she was working on the final draft of her dissertation thats always a stressful period but claire seemed to be having an especially hard time writing didnt come easily to her and she was a perfectionist drafting and redrafting she told harry she was worried she wouldnt pass her orals was that a possibility i said her grades were excellent and her research was solid i let the unspoken but hang in the air back then personality issues couldnt be considered she said so your husband had reservations about claires temperament he thought she was a sweet young woman but too closed off and to grow up under a shadow like that harry felt she hadnt dealt with it that it might cause her problems later on how exactly did he find out i said one morning he came in to the lab and found claire there she looked awful it was obvious shed been working all night harry asked her why she was driving herself so hard and she said she had no choice she just had to pass it was everything shed lived for harry said something to the effect that there was life beyond grad school and claire fell apart sobbing telling harry he didnt understand that becoming a psychologist was all that mattered she had to do it she wasnt like other students harry asked in what way and thats when it all came out afterward claire just curled up on the chair shivering harry gave her his jacket and stayed with her until she calmed down after that we reached out more to claire invited her over for dinner harry was a wonderful man his students all loved him years after he went emeritus wed still get letters and cards and visits not from claire though after that one episode she closed up refused to talk about it harry couldnt demand that she receive therapy but he suggested it strongly claire promised she would but she never confirmed that she had so she passed her exams received her doctorate and went her own way believe me she said it troubled harry he even debated holding her uphe was in real conflict dr delaware but ethically he knew he couldnt claire had fulfilled all the requirements for graduation and he felt shed never trust anyone again if he went public with her story the funny thing was at her orals she was the picture of confidence charming in control as if nothing had ever happened harry chose to take that as a sign that shed gotten help but once she had her degree in hand she shut us out completely even after she received the fellowship right here at case medical school we never heard from her a year later we heard she got a job in los angeles harry said claires going off to the wild west the whole incident bothered him he wondered if he shouldve been more forceful in getting her to deal with the guilt she felt guilty about what her brother had done unjustified guilt but yes thats the way harry saw it and his insights were almost always correct he saw neuropsychology as an escape for claire testing numbers lab work no need to get into feelings he wondered if shed ever leave the field and now you tell me she did her brother died of a seizure i said did your husband wonder if claires career choice might have been related to her seeking an organic basis for dentons crimes that too but he worried that someday that defense would crumble because she wouldnt find any simple answers might grow disillusioned harry was a neuropsychologist himself but he was also a master psychotherapist along with his alcoholism research he worked with madd treating the families of drunkdriving victims he tried to teach his students the value of maintaining emotional balance claire didnt get the message the claire we knew didnt she was such a distant girl seemed to be punishing herself in what way all work no play never attending department functions no friendships with the other students id bet the dinners at our home were her main social contacts even the way she furnished her room dr delaware student housings never gorgeous but most students try to do something with what the university gives them one night it was especially cold and harry and i drove her home the way she lived shocked us all she had was a bed a desk and a chair i told harry it looked like a jail cell he wondered if she might be trying symbolically to share her brothers fate now i knew why claire had refused to talk about her family to joe stargill now i understood rob ray and ernestines willingness to let claire shut them out of her life monumental shame no matter what was happening around her id wondered about family chaos but my imagination hadnt stretched far enough like so many people who enter the helping fields claire had been trying to heal herself approaching it from a distance at first as she hid behind hard data and lab work working for myron theobold a man whod abandoned psychoanalysis for a phd in biochemistry i see myself as a humane administrator i dont get involved in their personal lives im not out to parent anyone staying with theobold all those years because he allowed her to remain a stranger then something changed professor racano had suspected professional escape wouldnt work forever and hed been right last year claire had gone looking for answersgoing about it with characteristic academic detachment scanning library files for rampages similar to her brothers why at that point in her life perhaps something had weakened her defenses the only thing that came to mind was the divorce because marrying joe stargill had been another sad stab at normalcy and it had failed i thought of how she and stargill had met that afternoon in the marriott bar impulsive just like the reno wedding yet ultimately claires motivation for pairing up with stargill had been anything but hasty most probably unconscious shed preserved the secrecy with which shed encrusted herself since adolescence by selecting a selfabsorbed child of alcoholics who could be counted upon to concentrate on his own problems and keep his nose out of hers casual pickup incredible sex the semblance of physical intimacy unencumbered by exploration stargill had described the marriage as the parallel movement of two busy roommates claire had made a brief stab at decorating her home and her life after stargill moved out she stripped the house bare not for serenity back to the cell punishing herself just as professor racano had suspected trying once again without consciously realizing it to replicate denton argents bleak fate in order to bond somehow with the brother whod polluted her formative years shed been twelve when denton slaughtered the brownlees but maybe much younger when she realized there was something differentmaybe dangerously differentabout her only sibling did she blame herself for not telling someone or was she simply ashamed to be linked genetically to a monster i thought of how the argents had refused to move remaining on the same block had to have been wrenching for them for the entire neighborhood had claire been shunned for the rest of her childhood when denton seized fatally shed been seventeen still living at home an upbringing capped at both ends by trauma shame and loss adolescence was hallmarked by the quest for identity what had happened to claires sense of self had she ever visited denton at the asylum or had her parents forbidden contact had she planned at some point to talk to her brother about his crimes tried to make sense of events that defied explanation if so dentons death had killed any hope years later she decided to look for answers anyway learning about the ardullo murders must have seemed like salvation the parallels between the two cases chilled my blood i could only imagine how claire had felt spooling microfiche only to come upon dentons doppelganger in ardis peake first shock then sickening spreading familiarity empathy in its worst incarnation finally a glimmer of reprieve one last chance to tackle the big why now that i knew what i did claires move to starkweather her zeroing in on ardis peake wasnt puzzling at all so many madmen so little time not a choice really a psychologically preordained dance backed by the choreography of pain a dead certainty chapter no luck said milo on what anything the corvette any sort of locale on either wark or derrick crimmins no social security on wark and crimminss last tax filing was ten years ago in florida didnt get to take it any further cause i was tied up in the courthouse trying to get three separate judges to okay warrants on peakes mail and his phone calls no go prophecy didnt impress them the third one laughed me out of chambers and told me to consult a palm reader it was nearly five hed pulled up in my driveway a few minutes ago now he was scrounging in the fridge bent sharply as he eyed a lower shelf the ridges and bulges of his service revolver protruding through his tootight tweed jacket claires relationship to peake didnt matter i said he shook his head pulled out mayonnaise mustard a packet of corned beef id forgotten about got some corn rye of similar vintage from the bread box slapping together a limplooking sandwich he sat down chomped out a semicircle gobbledygook was the operative word he said and psychotic meanderings they all said peake was at most a material witness if that also his mental state rendered him unlikely to provide significant materiality so the entire rationale falls apart another chunk of sandwich disappeared i didnt do any better on getting into warks b of a account a fictitious person only remotely and theoretically associated with an eightmonthold homicide doesnt cut the evidentiary mustard mommy i said i wanna be a policeman when i grow up his grin was savage now for the happy news wendell pelley is no longer a suspect at least not for the beatty brothers wendell pelley is deceased for well over a week before choo choo bang bang his body showed up in a county garbage dump in lennox six days ago sheriffs deputy happened to read the wire i put out and called the dumps organized so they were able to pinpoint what load pelley came in on commercial container behind an industrial laundry it was collected three days before he was found but the maggot feast indicates pelley could have been in there a while before that no sign of violence to the corpse looks like he fell asleep in the dumpster and got shipped out with the trash crushed to death no they spotted him before compactionwhat was left of him cause of death was extreme dehydration and malnutrition the sonofabitch starved himself i called the korean who runs the halfway house he said yeah pelley hadnt been eating much before he split probably weighed a hundred and twenty back then no he didnt see that as reason for alarm pelley wasnt causing problems talk about selfpunishment i said pelley made it all the way from ramparts to lennox on foot he probably walked through alleys in some notnice neighborhoods found his final resting place curled up and died not a trace of foul play nothing alex they filed it as a definite suicide i read the report and its pretty clear desiccation cachexia low hemoglobin count something about his liver chemistry that said he hadnt received adequate nutrition for a long time no wounds no broken bones his neck bones were intact and so was his skull the only damage was what the maggots had done staring at what was left of the sandwich he hesitated gulped it down wiped his face got himself a beer think about that alex feeling so low that you throw yourself out in the garbage he could still be good for claire i said if i could show that he and claire ever met maybe but now that hes dead also given the fact that hes not good for dada or the beattys my enthusiasm for him has faded considerably i got carried away like mr dylan said too much of nothing he returned to the fridge got an apple bit down noisily maybe i can throw you a little cheer i said for what its worth i know why claire sought out peake i told him about denton argents rampage his chewing slowed when i finished he put the apple down her brother never heard of the case me neither it happened twentyseven years ago i was in vietnam so what was she hoping to learn by glomming on to peake her conscious motive was probably wanting to understand psychotic violence being a psychologistand a researcher legitimized it but i think she was really trying to understand why her familyher childhoodhad been shattered and peake couldve told her that no i said but she would ve denied her motives so she attaches herself to peake tries to get him to open up about what he did maybe she did more than try i said if anyone could pry him open it wouldve been claire because she was the only person to spend any significant time with him during his commitment she cared what if she succeeded and peake told her something that put her in danger such as he hadnt acted alone hed been prodded by the crimmins brothers or believed he had alternatively peakes still hi contact with crimmins and told him claire was getting too nosy crimmins decided to fix the problem thats how peake knew about claires murder the day before it happened he knew he said bad eyes in a box aint exactly evidence as i was reminded three times today he picked up the apple twirled it by the stem very creative alex but i dont know it all hinges on peake having conversations faking out being a veg what if his mental dullness isnt all due to psychosis i said what if the bulk is caused by his medication the severity of his tardive symptoms and the fact that hes never had his dosage altered from five hundred milligrams show he reacts strongly to moderate amounts of thorazine lets say claire decided to experiment withdrawing pills in order to restore some clarity and it worked she tampered on the sly were talking intense motivation a woman who gave up her job just to get next to peake if she thought easing up on his thorazine would open him up why not she couldve rationalized that it was for his own goodthe meds were increasing his neurological problems he could get by on less the obvious risk would have been an increase in his violent impulses but she mightve felt confident she could deal with that heidi was working with him too he said she wouldnt suspect heidis medically and psychologically unsophisticated claire told her what she wanted her to know any changes may have been subtlea few sentences here and there and they may have occurred only in response to claires prodding claire was spending intense oneonone time with peake probing very deliberately she knew what she wanted a window into peakes violence and by extension dentons even if peake did say something to heidi thered be no reason for her to comprehend or care shed dismiss it as gibberish just as she did with the bad eyes recitation until claire turned up dead and with claire gone peake gets his full dosage again and lapses into incoherence okay he said let me take this all in peake blabs claire finds out someone else was involved and wark enters the picture because he and peake are somehow in contact because wark works at starkweather yeah yeah let me put this in order peake wakes up maybe he does get more violent or at least belligerent with wark he makes threatsive got this doctor whos really interested in me i told her you turned me into a monster she believes me shes gonna get me out of here even if claire never said that peake could believe itdelusional hes still crazy right i nodded still he said thats an awful lot of gabbing for old monster unless hes been faking i brought that up at the beginning you said it was unlikely the context has changed he shot out of his chair paced the room buttoned and unbuttoned his coat if wark was threatened why not kill peake why bother i said back on a full doseor a higher one if someones tinkering in the opposite direction peakes no threat hell live out his life in his s r room the tardive symptoms will intensify until hes neurologically cooked one day someone will walk in and find him dead just like denton claire could just do that he said pull pills with nobody noticing starkweather gives its staff plenty of latitude dr aldrich was claires nominal supervisor and he didnt seem to know much about her cases neither did swig in that respect working at starkweather was similar to her job with theoboldplenty of solitude the style to which shed become accustomed since childhood so he said i waltz in there again and ask to look at the personnel files swigs gonna roll out the carpet you can use the publicity threatfiling for warrants the media getting hold of it no reason for him to know the judges havent cooperated ask to meet with the men in claires group thats certainly reasonable while youre there try to work in the personnel records he circled some more one more thing the beatty brothers why would crimminswark tell peake about killing them on the contrary if peakes hassling him the last thing hed want would be for peake to know anything good point i said so maybe its column a peake and crimmins still are colluding carrying on the alliance that led to peakes original blood walk having fun with it recording it on film my gut tightened i just thought of something the eye wounds whats a camera lens he stopped pacing an eye an allseeing eye invisible omniscient director as god these crimes are about power and control actors as subjects subjected camera observation goes only one way i see you dont no eyes for you then why werent the beattys eyes messed with maybe because they were already impaired drunk blind drunk nutso he said back to the booby hatch maybe while im there ill rent a room okay ill set it up for tomorrow id like you there see what else you can pick up meanwhile ill do more tracing on crimmins see if i can find out the last time he surfaced under his own name learn more about those family accidents a big finger poked the expanse of washandwear that covered his heart he winced you okay i said laboriously he stood up just gasserve me something healthier next time chapter glossy walls painted a peach pink that managed to be unpleasant a dozen blond fakewood school desks lined up in two rows of six the facing wall was nearly spanned by a spotless blackboard rounded edges blunted the plastic frame no chalk two soft erasers directly in front of the board was an oak desk bolted to the floor nothing atop the surface the righthand wall bore two maps of the world equalarea and mercator projection posters taped to the walls offered treatises on table manners nutrition the basics of democracy the alphabet in block and cursive a chronology of us presidents duct tape fastened the posters no thumbtacks the american flag in the corner was plastic sheeting atop a plastic rod also bolted outward trappings of a classroom the students wore khaki uniforms and barely fit behind the blond desks six of them up front sat an old man with beautiful goldenwhite hair kindly granddad on a laxative commercial behind him were two black men in their thirties one mochatoned freckled and heavy with cokebottle glasses and a rashlike beard the other lean with a hewnonyx face and the glinteyed vigilance of a hunter surveying the plains at the head of the next row was a very thin creature in his twenties with hollow cheeks haunted eyes and blanched lips gray fists knuckled his temples he sat so low his chin nearly touched the desktop stringy brown hair streamed from under a gray stocking cap the hat was pulled down to his eyebrows and made his head appear undersized behind him was giant chet yawning flexing sniffing exploring the interior of his mouth with his fingers so big he had to sit sideways giraffe legs stretched into the aisle no hint of the bony horror concealed by khaki trousers he recognized milo and me right away winked waved blew a raspberry said yo bro my man whus shakin and bakin baked alaska juneau you know hot cold tightass dont sneeze on me homey you too homely homo fuck me up the ass the lean black man glared when wed seen chet the first day frank dollard hadnt mentioned hed been part of claires group today dollard wasnt saying much of anything he stood in a corner and glared at the inmates the last man was a small sallow hispanic with a shaved head and a greasestain mustache the room was airconditioned to meatlocker chill but he sweated rubbed his hands together craned his neck licked his lips more tardive symptoms i scanned the room for other signs of neurological damage grandpas hands trembled a bit but that couldve been age probably the freckled black mans gaping mouth though that might have been psychotic stupor or a twisted daydream frank dollard swaggered to the front of the room and positioned himself behind the oak desk morning gentlemen no more warmth in his voice than fifteen minutes ago when hed met us at the inner gate arms folded across his chest here again hed finally said making no move to free the lock milo said just couldnt stay away frank dollard huffed what exactly are you trying to accomplish solve a murder frank milos hand grazed the lock dollard took a long time pulling out his key ring locating the right key inserting it in the lock giving one sharp turn the bolt released several more seconds were taken up in pocketing the key finally dollard shoved the gate open once we were in he smiled sourly like i said what exactly are you trying to accomplish not waiting for an answer he smoothed his mustache and began walking across the yard the dirt stretched ahead of us brown and smooth as butchers paper milo and i started to follow dollard increased the distance between us the heat and the light were punishing inmates stared if one of them had come from behind dollard would have been no use at all three techs stood watch on the yard two hispanics and a blocky white man nothing close to derrick crimminss physical description dollard unlocked the rear gate and we approached the main building instead of entering he stopped several feet from the door and rattled his key ring you cant see mr swig not here where is he said milo hospital business he said to give you fifteen minutes access to the skills for daily living group thats it thanks for your time frank said milo too mildly sorry to be such a bother dollard blinked pocketed the keys gazing back at the yard he clicked his teeth together these guys are like trained animals you cant vary the stimulusresponse too much your coming in here is disruptive top of that its pointless no one here had anything to do with dr argent because no one gets out among other things wendellpelleygotout dollard blinked again his tongue rolled under his lower lip what does that have to do with the price of eggs a nutcase gets out a few weeks later one of his shrinks is dead dr argent was never one of pelleys shrinks i doubt she ever ran into him why was pelley released youd have to ask one of the doctors you have no idea frank i dont get paid to have ideas said dollard so you said the first time said milo but we both know thats crap whatd pelley do to get out dollards leathery skin reddened and his shoulders rose suddenly he chuckled more like what he didnt do act crazy he hadnt been crazy for a long time medical miracle said milo my opinion the guy was never really psychotic in the first place just a drunk im not saying he faked anyone out people who knew him when he was first committed said he was all over the placehallucinating acting wild at one point they had to put him in restraints but then a month or two later that all stopped even without meds so my opinion it was severe alcohol poisoning and he got detoxed then why wasnt he sent back to trial because when he got arrested we were still doing not guilty by reason he was off the hook lucky him said milo not so luckyhe still got cooped up here for twentyodd years longer than he wouldve been in prison maybe it wasnt just alcohol pelleyd been mining for years he couldve got some kind of heavymetal poisoning in his system or he was just a shortterm crazy freaked out and got better whatever he never needed any neuroleptics just some antidepressants year after year hes hanging around no symptoms guess they thought it didnt make sense antidepressants said milo sad sack why all the interest he cause problems on the outside only for himself frank starved himself to death dollards mouth twitched he never liked to eat so whered they find him in a garbage dump garbage dump said dollard as if visualizing it this is gonna sound bleedingheart but he wasnt really that bad of a guy at least when i talked to him he really felt remorse for what hed done to his girlfriend and those kids didnt even wanna get out which dont excuse what he did but he shrugged what the hell we all have to go sometime who was his doctor i said aldrich not argent youre sure he had no contact with dr argent dollard laughed cant be sure of anything but death and taxes and to answer your next question he wouldnt a known peake either pelley was on b ward peakes always been on c what about out on the yard i said neither of them ever went out onto the yard that i saw peake never leaves his damn mom so who did peake have contact with dollards eyes got cold i answered that last time you were here doc no one hes a damn zombo he looked at his watch and youre wasting my time lets get this over with turning he stomped past the big gray building bull neck pitched forward a welltrodden dirt path veered to the right when we reached the west side of the building the dirt kept snaking to a group of three low singlestory beige structures cooking in the full sun a sign said annexes a b and c behind the smaller buildings sprawled another brown yard as wide as the one in front locked and empty then more chain link and a bulk of forest not eucalyptus like at the entrance denser greenblack some kind of pine or cedar where does that lead said milo nowhere thought there was only one building these arent buildings theyre annexes said dollard smiling he hurried us past a doublelocked door plastic windows darkness on the other side of the panes no signs of habitation outside were a few plastic picnic benches and a cement patio swept clean the silence was punctured by occasional shouts from the main yard no birdsongs no insect chitters not even the faintest stutter of traffic annex b was empty too i sensed something behind me glanced over my shoulder the main building shielded from the morning sun had darkened to charcoal then the illusion of movement danced in a corner of my right eye and my head buzzed seized by splitsecond vertigo that passed just as quickly i looked back without stopping nothing but for that brief interval the entire structure had seemed to tilt forward as if straining on its foundation now it was immobile as a building had to be rows of windows dull and black blank as a series of empty scorecards dollard hurried to annex c stopped at the door nodded at the pair of techs standing guard two black men no wark they checked us out before stepping back dollard used his key opened the door wide peeked in let the steelreinforced panel swing back in milos face as he charged in morning gentlemen dollard repeated none of the men returned the greeting he said lets do the pledge and began reciting no one stood dollards tone was bored chet and grandpa and the lean black man joined in hey all you patriots said dollard when it was over born in the usa said chet to us top of the morning to ya morning becomes elektra electrified all those ions ioning boards gotta keep everything smooth pressed even the french cuffs fisticuffs cuffing up rodney king yo bro the lean black man angled his head toward chet and shook it disgustedly no one else seemed to pay attention to the giants ramblings though the old mans hands were shaking more conspicuously okay said dollard perching on the edge of the oak desk its been a while since you guys got together because dr argent no longer works here but fuck her said the sweating hispanic fuck her in the ass

people like that fuck you said chet cheerfully fuck everyone everything the old kama sutra pretzel bake about time we had some fun around here oral love oral roberts oral hygiene fuck her said paz sadly he closed his eyes his chest vibrated with every exhalation the vibrations slowed within seconds he appeared to be sleeping nightynight chet said fuck everyone equality for all rights and responsibilities and participatory democracy with liberty under god livery too riding a pale horse enough said the lean black man weary voice but clear calm almost parental good point jackson said dollard to chet enough big man chet remained cheerful his yellow beard was littered with crumbs and his eyes were bloodshot he gave a throaty equine laugh enough is too much enough is never enough unless which is a paradox so enough can be anything depending on the dimension of hey man said jackson sitting up straighter we all know you went to school youre a genius but hey okay baring his teeth

leg ran his hand along the pole of skinsheathed bone dollard said cover that up jackson had disengaged was staring at the ceiling kindly grandpa twiddled his thumbs and smiled sweetly paz let out a loud belching snore chet continued to fingerwalk up and down his own leg a smile spread slowly bristling the yellow beard another snore from paz cover it said dollard chet laughed and complied the heavy freckled black mans head lolled he seemed to be sleeping too grandpa caught my eye and favored me with a smile his cheeks were fresh apples the comb tracks in his hair were draftingtable precise the only one who hadnt moved was the pale thin man in the stocking cap his fists remained glued to his temples dollard said gentlemen these guys are from the police and speaking of dr argent they want to ask you some questions about her only grandpa and chet observed milos walk to the desk dollard remained in place for a moment as if unwilling to cede ground then he stepped aside police said chet good man gendarme right to bear two arms got to guard society from the dregs and the dross and the eggs and the boss born in the usa i was police myself polite poe edgar allan lite trained with special forces me and chuck yeager and annabel lee and bobby mcgee good said milo we need all the help we can get about dr argent a harsh whisper cut through the introduction the jews did it stocking cap he hadnt moved his face had all the life of bleached driftwood got a point there said chet karl marx violent overthrow all those other semites semiotics antibiotics no that was fleming no jew a scot the jews did it stocking cap repeated dollard said enough of that randall chet said maybe valid jack the ripper writing on the wall the jews are the men who didnt not do it or somesuch doubletriplenegative which in the alternate universe parallel systems parallelograms dodecahedrons you never know anythings possible randalfs a racist asshole said jackson he dont know shit and neither do you he showed teeth again began picking at his cuticles dollard glared at us look what you ve done randalls a racist motherfucker said jackson matteroffactly randall didnt react paz and the freckled black man remained asleep one more word out of you jackson said dollard and its s r jackson fidgeted wildly for several seconds but he kept silent dollard turned to milo finish up milo looked at me i moved next to him so dr argent was working with you guys kindly grandpa said would you be so kind as to inform us exactly what exactly happened to the poor woman dollard said weve already been through that holtzmann i realize that mr dollard said holtzmann she was murdered how tragic but perhaps if we knew the details we could assist these police officers gentle voice twinkly blue eyes coherent what had gotten him in here i gave you all the details you need to know said dollard pazs eyes opened and closed someone passed wind and the stink floated through the room then dissipated randalls head raised an inch his fists began grinding into his skull the stocking cap was filthy the hand slipped down a bit and i saw that the skin around his temples was red and raw scabbed in places i said if theres anything how did it happen said grandpa holtzmann was she shot if so was it a handgun or a long gun she wasnt shot said dollard and thats all you need to stabbed then said holtzmann what does it matter holtzmann well said the old man if were to be of assist chet said the modus is always a clue signature profilewise psychological penmanship so to speak to squeak was she stabbed said holtzmann pressing forward so that the desk bit into his trunk holtzmann said dollard theres no reason for she was stabbed the old man exclaimed fileted to the bone hallelujah working at his zipper with both hands he exposed himself began masturbating frantically singing out in a fine rich baritone stabbed stabbed stabbed glory be gut the bitch in pieces three dollard took him roughly by the shoulders and shoved him toward the door to us you too out meeting over as we exited chet shouted wait ive solved it cherchez la femme cherchez la femme outside dollard locked the door to the annex and handed holtzmann over to the other two techs the old man simpered but looked thrilled the taller tech said tuck yourself in now holtzmann obeyed dropped his hands to his side nice to meet you kindly grandpa again mr dollard if ive offended dont say another damn word dollard ordered him to the techs keep them in there while i deal with these two ill send mills back to help you the techs moved holtzmann to the wall had him face the stucco dont budge old man pointing at the door one of them said they okay in there frank chet bodines running his mouth like a broken toilet and jacksons ticked at him at randall toohes doing the aryan crap really said the tech lightly havent heard that in a while thought we had it under control yeah said dollard something must have tensed them all up when we were back at the main building he said now that was a good expenditure of taxpayers money milo said i want to see peake and i want to fuck sharon stone take me to peake frank oh sure just like that who the hell do you think again dollard checked his anger chuckled that requires authorization detective meaning mr swig and like i said hes not call him said milo dollard bent one leg because you order me to do it because i can be back here in an hour with serious backup and a warrant on you for obstruction of justice my bosses are antsy about this one dollard maybe swig will eventually be able to protect you but seeing as hes not here he wont stop you from going through the process im talking central booking you were a cop you know the drill dollards face was the color of rare steak his words came out slow and clipped you have no idea what kind of deep shit youre getting yourself into i have a real good idea frank lets play the media game bunch of tv idiots with sound trucks and cameras the slant ill give them is the police were saddled with a strokeinducing whodunit homicide and you did everything in your power to impede ill also throw in a nice little sidebar about how you geniuses judged a mass murderer sane and qualified for release and then he proves how sane he is by turning himself into garbage when all that hits the fan frank think uncle senators gonna help swig let alone you dollards jaw jutted he toed the dirt why the hell are you doing this just what i was going to ask you frank because this change of attitude on your part puzzles me excop youd expect something different makes me wonder frank maybe i should be looking closer at you look all you want said dollard but his head drew back and his voice lacked conviction squinty eyes examined the sky do your thing man why the change frank no change said dollard the first time you were here was courtesy the second time tolerance now youre a disruptionlook at what you just did to those guys murders a disruption said milo i keep telling you this murder had nothing to forget it what the hell do you want from me take me to peake after that well see dollards toe stirred up more dirt mr swigs in a serious budget meeting and cant be whos second in command no one only mr swig authorizes visits then leave him a message said milo ill give you five minutes after that im outta here and its a whole different game whens the last time you had your fingers rolled for prints dollard looked up at the sky again someone on the yard howled milo said okay doc were outta here dollard let us walk ten paces before saying screw it you get ten minutes with peake in and out no frank said milo i get what i want chapter we entered the main building milo got to the door first throwing off dollards rhythm lindeen schmitz was at the front desk talking on the phone she began to smile up at milo but a glance from dollard stopped her we rode up to c ward in silence on the other side of the double doors four inmates idled i could see the nurses in the station chatting cheerfully laughter shallow and grating spilled from the tv room dollard stomped to peakes room unlocked the peep hatch flipped the light switch frowned he released both bolts and opened the door cautiously a brief look inside not here trying to sound annoyed but puzzlement took over how about that said milo he never leaves his room im telling you said dollard he never does maybe hes watching tv i said we went over to the big room scanned the faces two dozen men in khaki stared at the screen canned yuks poured out of the boxa sitcom no one in the room was laughing peake wasnt in the audience back in the corridor dollard had flushed again the rage of a dogmatist proven wrong ill get to the bottom of this he was heading for the nursing station when a sluggish abrasive sound stopped him swish swish swish swish swish swish like a snare drum bottoming a slow dance seconds later peake stepped out from around the left side of the station swish paper slippers shuffling on linoleum heidi ott held his elbow as he stumbled forward eyelids halfshut each step causing his triangular head to bob like that of a rearwindow stuffed dog in the merciless fluorescence of the hallway the bits of stubble on his head and face looked like random blackheads the furrows on his skull seemed painfully deep he was bent over sharply as if his spine had given way as if gravity would have pulled him down but for heidis grip neither of them noticed us as she propelled him whispering encouragement dollard said hey and she looked up her hair was drawn back in a tight bun her expression bland peake couldve been any kind of invalid she his longsuffering daughter she held him back peake swayed opened his eyes but still didnt seem to be aware of our presence he rolled his head his purpleslug tongue oozed out curled remained suspended for several seconds before retreating whats going on said dollard taking a walk said heidi i thought some exercise might help help with what said dollard his thick arms snapped across his chest fingers digging into stout biceps is something wrong frank no everythings great terrificthey want to see him again be nice if he was where hes supposed to be sorry said heidi glancing my way is he on room restriction i didnt hear about it not yet he isnt said dollard go on put him back to milo do your thing ill be back in fifteen arms still folded he walked off heidi smiled uneasilya teenager embarrassed by dads outburst okay ardis exercise times over one of peakes eyes opened wider bleary unfocused he licked his lips extended his tongue again rolled his shoulders no one bothers to get him out said heidi i thought it might help with you know verbal output i said she shrugged it didnt seem like a bad idea cmon ardis lets get you back she guided him across the hall to his room led him to his bed sat him down he stayed exactly where she put him for several seconds no one said anything peake didnt budge for a while then the tonguethrusts renewed both eyes fluttered struggled to stay open couldnt heidi said could one of you please turn off the light i think it bothers him i flipped the switch and the room turned gray peake sat there licking and rolling his head the same reek of intestinal gas and charred wood seemed to press forward a putrid greeting triggered by our entry heidi turned to milo why was frank so bugged is something wrong franks not in a good mood so tell me has peake been talking at all since you taped him she shook her head no sorry ive been trying but nothing thats why i thought some exercise peake rolled his head rocked milo motioned us away from the bed we moved toward the doorway milo said so no elaboration on choo choo bang bang heidis eyes widened does that actually mean something milo shrugged let me ask you did peake ever mention anything elselike a name what name she said wark she repeated it very slowly doesnt really sound like a name more like a bark so he mightve blurted it and you wouldve thought it was just gibberish maybe but no he never said that she reached to tug her ponytail nothing there her hand rose to the tight bun wark no he never said that why who is it maybe a friend of peakes he doesnt have any friends old friend said milo are you still taping i tried when i could whys frank so uptight frank doesnt like being told what to do oh she said and youve got him actually working frank doesnt like to work she hesitated moved closer to the door looked out through the hatch this may not be true but i heard he got fired from some police department for sleeping on the job or something like that whod you hear it from said milo just talk on the wards hes also a sexisttreats me like i dont belong you saw his attitudei mean whats wrong with taking someone who never gets out for a walk all the other patients are watching tv its not like anyones getting neglected i said has frank been giving you other problems basically what you just sawattitude swig likes him so he doesnt have to do too much scut she glanced back at peake he continued to sit and rock and lick air youre saying peake actually has a friend from his past hard to believe i said sure is ive never seen him make contact with anyone milo said no mail not that i know about same with phone calls he never leaves his room till today i said well yeah i was trying to help out whats this wark done whats going on probably nothing said milo just working all the angles you drill a bunch of wells hope for a trickle every now and then sounds too slow for me said heidi no offense not like jumping off power stations she smiled very few things are we left peakes room and she locked the door milo said any idea where i could get a personnel list i guess in the front office why to see who else i should talk to if its about peake she said im the only one worth talking to no one else pays attention to him now that claires gone how much time exactly did she spend i said hrnm hard to say there were times when i was on shift when shed be in there as long as an hour sometimes every day usually every day she was like thatinvolved with everyone no she said not really i mean she spent more time with her patients in general than the other docs but peake was she seemed to be especially interested in him speaking of her patients i said we just met the men in the living skills group lowfunctioning just like you said any idea what criteria she used to pick them we never discussed that i was just the tech mostly i stood guard got supplies to be honest the group never really went anywhere claire seemed to be observing them more than training the group only met seven times before she was shaking her head stroking the bun sometimes it just hits me what actually happened to her do you have any background information on the men what they did to get here lets see theres ezzard jacksonskinny black guy he killed his wife tied her up in their house and burned it down same with holtzmannthe old man youd never think could do anything criminal he cut his wife up stored the pieces in the freezer marked them the way a butcher would flank loin randall shot his parentshe was into some nazi stuff had some delusion they were part of a zionist plot who else the other black guy pretty thats his name monroe pretty killed his kids four of them little ones drowned them in the bathtub one by one sam pazthe mexican guywent bonkers at his brothers wedding shot his brother and his mother and a bunch of bystanders all told i think six people died the giant chet bodine was living like a hermit killed some hikers so many madmen so little time i said all except chet victimized family members actually chet wasnt picked for the group she said he found out about it asked claire if he could join he was so verbal she thought it might stimulate the others so she agreed yeah youre right i never thought about it but she mustve been interested in family killers milo said any idea why she pulled a bobby pin from the bun slipped it back in to be honest it probably doesnt mean that much lots of the guys in here have murdered family members isnt that what crazy people usually do when they freak like peake he started with his mother right at least thats what claire told me what else did she tell you about peakes crimes she touched the tip of her nose just what he did his mom and an entire family what does any of that have to do with claire being killed maybe nothing said milo so are you gonna keep working with peake i guess if you want me to not that im accomplishing much dont get yourself in trouble heidi i appreciate whatever you do sure she said gnawing her lip is there a problem like i told you before i was figuring it was time to move on was kind of waiting until you got to the bottom of claires murder wish i could tell you it would be soon heidi he said meanwhile as long as dr delawares here he might as well give peake a try oh sure she said whatever the door closed after me with a pneumatic hiss i stood halfway between the door and the bed watching peake if he was aware of my presence he didnt show it i watched he did tongue calisthenics rocked rolled fluttered his eyes standing there immobile suspended in gray light i began to feel formless weightless my nose habituated to the stink keeping my eyes on peakes hands i edged closer a few more minutes of observation and i thought id detected a cadence to his movements tonguethrust curl and hover lingual retreat neck roll clockwise then counterclockwise approximately tensecond sequences six repetitions per minute played out against the constant rocking of his torso i took in other details his bed wasnt made looked as if it was never made the hands rested on rumpled sweatstained covers the fingers of the left hand were hooked in the sheeting halfhidden hands that had wreaked so much ruin i moved to within inches of the bed standing over him for a while no change in the routine i kneeled bringing myself down to peakes eye level his eyes were glued shut strainmarks at the corners said he was pressing the lids together tightly a few moments ago with heidi theyd been halfopen responding to that bit of stimulation withdrawing further once returned to isolation i heard a tapping from below looked down his feet barethe paper slippers had come off without my noticing two thin white feet oversized feet unnaturally long toes drumming the floor faster than the upperbody movements out of rhythm with the tardive dance so much motion but no flavor of intentthe inanimate dangle of a puppet all through it his eyes remained sealed this close i could see dry greenish crust flecking the lashes ardisisaid the beat went on i tried again nothing a few minutes later ardis this is dr delaware i want to talk to you about dr argent nothing claire argent no response i repeated myself peakes eyelids remained shut but started to ticlids contracting and releasing lateral movement visible under the skin a few green specks dropped onto his lap reaction or random movement i sidled closer had he wanted to kiss me or claw out my eyes he couldve ardis im here about dr argent another eyelid tica jerky wave traveling beneath the papery skin definite response on some level he was able to focus i said you were important to dr argent tic tic tic she was important to you ardis tell me why his eyelids quivered like a frog in a galvanic experiment i counted the time in tardive sequences one td two tdstentds twelve two minutes he stopped subjectively it seemed longer than a hundred and twenty seconds i was far from bored but time was dragging i started wondering how many minutes peakes rampage had consumed had the ardullos been fully awake or asleep or somewhere in betweena murky semiconsciousness as they died thinking it was all a bad dream i mentioned claires name again peakes eyes ticced but nothing more i thought back to his arrest photo the look of terror in his eyes it reminded me of somethinga vicious dog from my boyhood it had drawn lots of blood but when finally cornered by the dogcatcher had curled up and whimpered like a starving pup how much violence was fear catapulted back at the world was all viciousness cowardice at the root no i didnt think so was still convinced claires murderer had acted from a position of power and dominance fun had peake enjoyed his blood walk looking at him now i found it hard to imagine him extracting enjoyment out of anything as i watched at him now the notion of this husk decapitating his own mother stalking up the stairs bloody knife in hand running from room to room inflicting agony and death seemed impossibly remote as unlikely as kindly mr holtzmann sectioning and freezing his wife in this place logic meant nothing i said bad eyes in a box no flutter beneath the lids choo choo bang bang nothing i tried it again same lack of response back to basics claires name dr argent i said nothing had i turned him off dr argent cared about you ardis five tds six the eyes ticced why did dr argent die ardis eleven twelve tic tic tic what about wark fourteen griffith d wark sixteen seventeen nothing blood walk static eyelids maybe the tics meant nothing and id fooled myself into allowing a random neurological spark to take on meaning delusions were everywhere knowing this might be my last shot with peake i decided to keep going keep it simple moving close enough to whisper in his ear dr argent claire argent the eyelids jumped spasmodically and i retreated with a pounding heart he froze no more td for several seconds the eyes opened revealing a sliver of gray white looking at me seeing me i wasnt sure they closed dr argent cared i said no eye movementbut the cords of his neck tightened he craned toward me again i drew back involuntarily unable to see me but turning toward me and i couldnt help feeling he was engaging me his mouth gaped wider no tongue visible and now he was making a gagging sound as if choking on it suddenly his head thrust forward a snake darting the eyelids fluttering once again wildly i stared in fascinated horror as he tilted his head upward neck stretched so tight it seemed to elongate impossibly what little mandible he had pointed up at the ceiling i took another step backward his arms began climbing slowly painfully his eyes opened remained open wide very wide fixed on the ceiling as if heaven resided in the plaster as if he were praying to something he gurgled gagged some more how far had he retracted the slug of muscle into his gullet his arms rose higher supplication he coughed made no sound the neck rolls resumed more frantic than ever epileptically rapid more gagging his sunken chest heaved i thought of denton argent dead in his cell brain burned out from seizing and wondered if i should do something but peake seemed to be breathing fine not a seizure new pattern of movement he began rocking faster his scrawny buttocks lifted from the mattress as he thrust his chest upward offering himself his right hand sank to his mouth four fingers jammed inside he withdrew them and the tongue appearedyanked freeflapped like a fish on deck curled hovered return of the initial td sequence thrust curl hover retract but his rear remained inches above the bed feet barely touching the ground unnaturalit had to straindid he even feel pain then suddenly it was over and his head had lowered to its usual slump his arms were back in the bedcovers and the beat went on one tdtwo tds i sat there with him for five more minutes whispering coaxing to no effect now claires name left him silent as paint maybe a new approach would startle him into another outburst the beatty brothers i said ellroy leroy zero choo choo bang bang nothing one with a gun one run over by a train deaf blind mute still claires name had stimulated him i needed more time with him knew i wouldnt get much keep going one tdtwo i whispered the ardullos no change the ardullosscott ardullo terriyes yes yes there it was the eyelid tic faster than before much faster a churning of the lids as if the eyeballs were rotating at jet speed terri and scott ardullo i said the eyes opened alive now fixed on mine awake clear intent to do what he stared at me didnt move at all paying close attention to me success but i felt as if a scorpion were cakewalking along my spine i checked his hands those hands both knotted in the sheets keep a look out for sudden movement scott and terri ardullo i said the stare scott and terri brittany and justin the stare brittany and justin he blinked once twice six times twenty fortyeyelid convulsions which wouldntor couldntcease metronomic hypnotic i felt myself being drawn in avoid that watch his hands his arms rose again fear stabbed me and i stood up quickly backed away he didnt seem to notice stood himself unsteadily but managing to remain upright stronger than hed appeared out in the hallway in heidis grasp still staring hot stare hands curling slowly into fists straightening his spine stepping toward me okay you ve done it delaware success he moved another step closer i braced myself plotted my defense how much damage could he do unarmed so thin so feeble another step his arms reached out inviting embrace i retreated toward the door his mouth opened contortedno tonguethrusts just the excruciating labor of the lipless orifice struggling to change form fighting to talk or scream working so hard working working suddenly a shrill dry sound escaped soft wispy echoing soft but it pounded my ears his arms began to climb again very slowly when they were parallel with his shoulders they flapped birdlike not a bird of prey something thin deliberate delicatea crane without warning he turned his back on me and hobbled still flapping miming flightto the far corner of the room pressing his back to the wall keeping the arms stretched head tilted to the right above him the metal restraint hooks embedded in the wall hovered like warnings eyes still openwide openstretched open i could see wet pink borders all around wet eyes tears welling overflowing streaming down sunken cheeks his left leg crossed over its mate so that he was standing on one leg more avian posturingno no something elseposing unmistakable pose his body had formed a cross crucifixion on an unseen scaffold tears flooded his face uncontrollable silent sobs brutally paroxysmic each gush seizing ownership of his fragile body and shaking it like a wet kitten weeping jesus chapter he stayed that way just stayed that way how long had i been in there surely dollard hostile and impatient would be returning soon and ordering me out five minutes later it hadnt happened peake remained against the wall the tears had slowed but they hadnt stopped the stink had returned my skin itched senses returning heightening i wanted out knocking on the brown steel door produced only a feeble thump could it be heard out in the hall no sounds from the outside made their way inside the cell i tried the hatch locked released only from the outside the door hatch opened from the outside sensory deprivation what did that do to already damaged minds another knock louder nothing peake stayed frozen in the cruciform pose pinioned by invisible spikes the names of his victims had loosened his tears remorse or selfpity or something i could never hope to understand i thought of him entering the ardullo kitchen spotting his mother the strength it had taken to saw through the cervical spineupstairs swinging scott ardullos baseball bat the children their names had triggered the jesus pose martyr pose no remorse at all seeing himself as a victim suddenly the absurdity and futility of what i was doing hit metrying to pry information from a diseased mind that smoothly morphed sin and salvation what use could this be to anyone had claire prodded peake the same way died somehow because of her curiosity the narrow room started to close in on me i was up against the door couldnt get far enough away from the white dangling creature just a trickle of tears now crying for himself monster serene in his suffering his head rotated very slowly lifted a bit faced me something surfaced in his eyes that i hadnt seen before sharpness clarity of purpose he nodded knowingly as if the two of us shared something i pressed my back against the door the space opened behind me and i tumbled back heidi said sorry i shouldve opened the hatch and warned you first i regained my balance took a breath smiled tried to look composed milo watched me along with dollard and the trio of doctorsaldrich steenburg and swenson all in sport shirts as if theyd just gotten in from the golf course nothing playful on their faces heidi started to close the door looked into the room went pale whats he doing whats going on the others rushed over and stared peake had returned to the full jesus pose head cocked to the right but no tears i said he got up a few minutes ago positioned himself that way aldrich said my my has he done this before heidi no never he never gets off the bed she sounded scared dr delaware youre saying he actually moved on his own yes steenburg and swenson looked at each other aldrich said interesting the gravity of his tone bordered on comical trying to assume authority on a case he knew nothing about frank dollard said whatd you say to him to get him that way nothing i said you didnt talk to him milo said whats the big deal he used to think he was a vegetable now hes evolved into jesus dollard and doctors glared at him psychosis is a disease said aldrich its unseemly to ridicule sorry said milo swenson said has he ever talked about religious themes heidi no thats what im trying to tell you he doesnt talk much period swenson turned contemplative laced his hands over his belt buckle i see so its something altogether new dollard jutted his head in my direction youd better tell us what you were talking to him about we need to know in case he starts acting out aldrich said is there some problem frank these people are a problem dr aldrich they keep coming in here disrupting going at peake mr swig authorized only fifteen minutes with the sdl group no time with peake he pointed through the door look at that guy like that who knows what could happen and for what he couldnta had anything to do with dr argent i told em that you told em that mr swig told em that aldrich turned to milo what is your purpose here officer investigating dr argents murder aldrich shook his head thats not an answer why are you questioning peaket he said something that might have predicted dr argents murder doctor predicted what in the world are you talking about milo told him in a box said aldrich he faced heidi steenburg and swenson did the same when did he say this to you the day before it happened an oracle said steenburg oh please and now hes jesusam i the only one who sees a trend toward irrelevance swenson said at least its original relatively that is we dont get a lot of jesuses anymore he smiled plenty of elvises but not that many jesuses maybe its the godless state of our culture no one else seemed amused swenson wouldnt give up we can always do what milton erickson did with his jesusesgive him carpenters tools and have him fix something aldrich scowled and swenson looked the other way officer said aldrich let me get this clear on the basis of this supposed utterance youre back here its an unsolved homicide dr aldrich even so aldrich moved closer to the doorway and peered inside peake hadnt budged he closed the door dollard said they caused a ruckus in sdl too herman randalls all worked up shouting nazi stuff in his room we might think of upping his meds might we said aldrich he turned to heidi how about you and i meeting after lunch to review mr peakes file make sure what were seeing in there isnt some kind of regression id think just the opposite i said hes showing more mobility and affective response affective response he was crying dr aldrich aldrich took another look inside well hes not crying now just hanging there looking pretty regressed looks like catalepsy to me i said is there any chance of reducing his meds aldrichs eyes bugged why in the world would we do that it might loosen him up verbally loosen him up said swenson just what we need a loose jesus a couple of figures in khaki had drifted out of the tv room the inmates stared at us began heading our way swenson and steenburg stepped forward the men turned reversed direction collected near the door to the tv room returned inside aldrich said thank you for your opinion doctor however you and officer sturgis must leave immediately no further contact with mr peake or any other patients until cleared by myself or mr swig to steenburg and swenson wed better get moving the reservations at one crossing the yard dollard walked even farther ahead big chet was on the yard and he started to come over gesticulating and laughing rugging at his hair like a toddler dollards palm shot out stay back the giant halted pouted yanked a clump of hair out of his head the yellow filaments floated to the ground like dandelion petals his expression said look what you made me do idiot dollard growled chets eyes slitted dollard waved and two techs jogged over from across the yard chet saw them froze finally skulked away four steps later he stopped looked at us over his shoulder mark my words he bellowed cherchez la femme champs elysees dollard threw the gate open slammed it after us left without a word as we waited to get milos gun and my knife i said something sure yanked his shorts makes you wonder doesnt it he said the moment we got in the seville he was on the cell phone asking for the number of the hemet police department i let the car idle as he talked the car seat was a griddle and i cranked the airconditioning to an arctic blast milo got transferred half a dozen times maintained collegia cheer through every step but he looked as if hed swallowed something slimy the air inside the car cooled hit my face turned my sweat icy milo was drenched he hung up finally got a supervisor whod talk heidi was right dollard was a majorleague goldbrick ignored calls in his zone took unauthorized leaves put in for unjustified overtime they couldnt prove anything serious enough to prosecute himprobably didnt want to easier just to ask him to leave how long ago was this four years ago he went straight to starkweather supervisor made a crack about nutcases being perfect for frank no one to complain when he slacked off swig likes him i said tells you something about swig high standards all around i drove out of the parking lot convection waves rose from the asphalt what did you do to get peake to play jesus in the school play mentioned the ardullos names after i got a response to claires nameeye tics tensing up when i whispered brittanys and justins names into his ear he jumped up ran to the wall assumed the pose id been thinking of him as lethargic stuporous but he can move fast when he wants to if hed jumped me id have been unprepared so hes not a total veg maybe hes a sneaky bastard playing all of us makes sense when you think about how he walked in on his mother shes sitting there coring apples he gets behind her she has no idea what hes going to do he surprised the ardullos too i said sheriff haas said they left their doors unlocked everyones nightmare right out of a splatter flick the eucalyptus forest appeared a big gray bear split by a yawning mouth of road so he said was he crying real tears copiously but im not sure it was remorse when he turned and stared at me i started to feel something else selfpity the jesus pose fits that too as if he sees himself as a martyr sick bastard he said or maybe i said hearing the kids names evoked an overpowering memory recall of not acting alone of taking the rap for something the crimmins brothers put him up to maybe he communicated that to claire i didnt see anything close to speech but with a lowered dosage he cooled his hands on the airconditioning vent why do you think dollard turned so hostile antsy about our return visit something to hide milo didnt answer we exited the forest and summer light whitened the windshield the trees shimmered as they broiled i could sense the heat trying to claw its way in what about some kind of hospital scam i said financial mismanagement or trafficking in prescription drugs claire found out about it and thats what put her in jeopardy maybe peake knew too learned someone was going to hurt claire and the prophecy was his way of warning her we were free of the hospital grounds heading toward the sludge yards and the freight barns i wondered where the rear forest behind the annexes led was unable to see the tall dark trees from here how would peake find out he said loose lips everyone assumes hes vegetative cant process i saw enough today to convince me thats not true if dollard was involved in something illegal he mightve said or done something that peake noticed that careless how many cases have you closed because someone was careless peake warns claire he said now hes a hero maybe on some level he bonded with claire appreciated the attention claire was giving him then why warn heidi claire wasnt at work that day so peake did the next best thing told her assistant not a clear message because he was struggling to talk through the thorazine haze and his neurological problems everyone treats peake like hes wallpaper but hes sucking up information hes functioned like wallpaper for sixteen years it wouldnt be hard to get complacent that could be why dollard was so upset when he saw peake playing jesus now he realizes peakes capable of more hes nervous doesnt want us back there look how he badmouthed us to aldrich and aldrich played into it or aldrich is part of it bigtime staff racketeering like you said its not a tight ship either way dollard just got what he wanted we wont get through those gates again without a court order bad eyes in a box he said that has peake knowing someone is gonna gouge claires eyes and stash her somewhere closed i might be able to buy dollard blabbing to some compadre in general terms about getting claire but i cant see him laying it out in detail i had no answer for that he pulled out his pad made some notes closed his eyes seemed to doze we reached the freeway i floored the seville crossed over to the fast lane sped to the interchange headed west on the past the old brick buildings on the fringes of downtown surprise survivors of the big quake a huge blowup of a movie poster had been painted on one of them some hypertrophied bionic cop flashing fire from gunbarrel knuckles if only it were that easy milo said dollard a scamster our mr wark his partner but what about richard the beatty twins how do they connect to any hospital racket dont know i said but if wark is derrick crimmins his working there makes sense on another level he was drawn by peakes presence just as claire was because peakes rampage made a major impression on him and if my guess about his being peakes drug source sixteen years ago is right that would fit with the racket being a dope thing dollard smuggles out pharmaceuticals hands them over to wark who sells them on the street wark had enough money in that bank of america account to cover the gear rental when vito bonner called to validate the check so hes got some sort of cash source being the outside man would also make wark the perfect choice for ambushing and murdering claire dollard alerts wark gives wark claires address from personnel files wark stalks her kills her in west la dumps her in her own car no reason for anyone ever to connect it to starkweather whats the mantra everyone there keeps reciting it couldnt be related to her work i looked around the hospital today to see if anyone fit warks physical description the only one tall and thin enough is aldrich but hes too old and i doubt wark would masquerade as a doctortoo risky but there are over a hundred people on staff and weve run into maybe twenty and we get no access to the personnel records milo punched the dashboard lightly keeping his arm stiff i knew he wanted to hit much harder how about approaching it another way i said lets assume peakes presence is what attracted wark to starkweather initially but he also needed money and the job had to be something he could qualify for quickly that would eliminate anything with extensive trainingdoctor psychologist nurse pharmacistand leaves lowerlevel positions cooks custodians gardeners psych techs a wouldbe producer down on his luck might see the first three as beneath him psychiatric technician on the other hand has some cachet could be construed as almostadoctor and psych techs are licensed by the state the medical board keeps a roster milos smile spread very slowly worth a try the movieposter mural flashed in my head another reason for wark to take the job if he sees himself as some darkside cinema auteur what better place to dredge up bloody plots than starkweather that could explain richard and the beatty twins theyre part of warks film game the snuff extravaganza againwere all over the place with this like you said drill a few wells he massaged his temples okay okay enough talk i need to do something i put calls in to miami and pimm nevada this morning when we get back ill see if anyone called and the psych board for that tech list though for it to be of any use wark wouldve had to register under that name or crimmins or something close he rubbed his face long shots better than nothing i said sometimes i wonder chapter we were back in the detectives room by two pm friday most of the desks were empty del hardys was next to milos and milo waved me to dels chair del had partnered with milo years agoan early alliance cemented by mutual respect and shared alienation del had been one of the first black ds to get an assignment west of la brea now he had plenty of black colleagues but milo remained a oneman show maybe that had wedged them apart or perhaps it was dels second wife a woman with strong views on just about everything milo never talked about it i used dels phone to call the state psychiatric board got put on hold electronically milos desktop was clear except for a message slip taped to the metal he peeled it loose and read it and his eyebrows arched callback from orlando florida some guy named castro happy to talk about derrick crimmins he punched numbers loosened his tie sat down a recorded voice of indeterminate gender told me my call would be accepted as soon as an operator was free i watched milos shoulders bunch as his call came through detective srurgis for detective castro he said oh hi thanks for calling back really well thats interestinglisten could i put someone else on the line our psychological consultant yeah occasionally we doyeah its been helpful placing a hand over the mouthpiece he said hang up and punch my extension number the recorded voice broke in thanking me for my patience i cut it off made the conference adjustment introduced myself george castro said a thick voice on the other end we all set now yeah said milo dr delaware detective castro was just saying hes been waiting for someone to call him about derrick crimmins waiting a long time said castro this is like christmas in the summer tell the truth i gave up figured he might be dead whys that because his name never showed up in any crime list i could find but bad guys dont just give up and that kid was real bad got away with multiple murder his parents said milo you got it said castro him and his brothercliff cliff was older but derrick was smarter what a pair kind of a premenendez menendez only the crimminses didnt even come close to getting arrested it was my curse its been jammed in my craw ever since tell me what you have him on the little bastard nothing definite said milo cant even find him so far it looks like scamming and homicide well thats our boy to a t i got to tell you this really takes me back i was new to miami beach did a year on bunco then homicide moved down the year before from brooklyn for the sun never thought about what being named castro would mean in miami he stopped as if waiting for laughter and im puerto rican not cuban anyway i worked some pretty ugly stuff up north bedstuy crown heights east new york but none of the scum i met ever bothered me as much as those brothers killing your own folks for doughdad and stepmother actually it was a coast guard case because the boat blew up in the waterhalf a mile offshorebut we did the land work no doubt at all about it being dirty someone rigged a pipe bomb to the fuel tank and the whole thing turned into sawdust three people died actually old man crimmins his wife and some cuban kid theyd hired to captain they were out marlin fishing boom shreds of bone and thats about it did the crimmins boys build the bombs doubtful we had some theories about thatdown here theres quite a few characters with explosives experience floating around mobbedup types druggies marielitos alibis narrowed it down to half a dozen scrotes we hauled em all in but no one talked and no ones bank account had suddenly gotten fat i had my eye on two of them in specific pair of dominicans with a drycleaning joint as cover theyd been busted before on a nearly identical explosion in a clothing warehouse weaseled out on lack of evidence we pulled in every informant we had couldnt shake a rumor loose that tells me the payoff was big bucks the boys had money big allowancesfifty grand a year each back then you could have someone taken out for a hundred bucks one to five thousand would get you someone competent fifteen a stone pro we scoured the brothers bank accounts found some nicesized cash withdrawals during the weeks before the explosion but we couldnt make anything outa that because thats the way they lived in general the old man gave em the fifty at the beginning of the year they took out play money as they needed itfour five a month spent every penny so there was no change in pattern they used a smartmouthed lawyer he didnt give us an extra syllable you focused on them right away cause of the inheritance angle you bet said castro first commandment right follow the honey trail with the stepmother gone they were the old mans sole heirs figured to get millions also their alibis were too damn perfect both out of town they made sure to let us know that first thing it was like one minute of phony grief then oh by the way we were in tampa riding motorcycles showing us some admission ticket to a race theyd been inall ready with it and smirkingrubbing my face in it because wed had contact before back when i was on bunco which is the third thing that nailed them in my mind theyd been bad boys before fraud like i said murder and cons perfect fit what was the con said milo nothing brilliant they cruised the beach picked up senile old people drove them out to some swampland that they pitched as vacation lots then theyd head over to the marks bank wait while the marks withdrew cash for a down payment hand them some bullshit deed of trust and split they preyed on real deteriorated old folk most of the time the marks didnt even know theyd been fleeced and the withdrawals werent hugefive six hundred bucksso the banks didnt notice it ended when some old ladys son got wind of itlocal surgeon he waited with his mom on the beach until she pointed out derrick they serve time nah said castro angrily never even got charged because daddy hired a lawyerthe same smartmouth who shielded them on the boat thing the weakness was the identification angle the lawyer said hed have fun with the old people on the standshow they were too demented to be reliable witnesses the da didnt want to risk it a couple of bank tellers thought they could make an id but they werent sure because derrick and cliff wore disguiseswigs fake mustaches glasses stupid stuff amateurish they coulda dressed up like fidel for all the marks noticed we couldnt trace the phony deeds back to them eitherprimitive shit mimeographed jobs the whole thing was so lowlevel it woulda been funny if it hadnt been so cruel in the end the old man made restitution case closed how much restitution i think it was six seven thou not a major con but remember were talking a onemonth period and two kids in their early twenties thats what i found scary so young and so cold my experience was you got plenty violent kids at any age but it usually takes a few years to season a frosty con like that it wasnt like they were so brightneither of them went to college both just bummed around on the beach cliff was actually kind of a cabbagehead but they had that con edge they were lucky too one good id and they mighta gone downat least probation he laughed again lucky bastards the excuse they gave was the stupidest thing of all big misunderstanding die old folk were too mentally disturbed to know the difference between reality and fantasy the land thing was never supposed to be taken seriously it was all part of some movie they were doing on con games they even showed us the outline of a script one page of bullshitscam games and hot cars something like the sringmeets cannonballrun they claimed they were gonna sell it to hollywood he laughed again so they actually got out there huh derrick made it said milo cliff died a few years after daddy and stepmom motocross accident near reno oh boy said castro interesting very like i told you cold i always saw derrick as the idea guy cliff was a party dude betterlooking than derrick nice tan expert waterskiier pussy hound and yeah motorcycles too he had a bunch of them a collection they both did so derrick might very well know how to rig one i figured if anyone cracked itd be cliff my plan was to split them apart see if i could play one against the other but the lawyer wouldnt let me get close ill never forget the last time i talked to them im asking questions faking being civil and those two are looking at their lawyer and hes telling me they dont have to answer and theyre smirking finally i leave and derrick makes a point of walking me to the door big old house tons of furniture and he and his brother are gonna get it all then he smiles at me again likei know you know fuck you charlie the only comfort i got out of it was they didnt get as rich as they thought they would how much they get said milo eighty grand each mostly from the sale of the house the place was heavily mortgaged and by the time they paid estate taxes commission all that good stuff there wasnt much left they were figuring the old man was sitting on bigtime cash but turns out hed made some bad investmentsland deals as a matter of factwhich is funny dont you think leveraged up the yy hed even cashed in his insurance policies as collateral for some loans the only other assets were the furniture pair of threeyearold caddies golf clubs and a golf cart and the stepmoms jewelry half of which turned out to be costume and the rest new stuff which doesnt maintain its value once you take it out of the store the other funny thing was the boat hadn t been borrowed on apparently the old man loved it kept up with his slip fees and maintenance nicelooking thing from the pictures the old man had stuffed fish all over the house he laughed louder fifty grand worth of boat minimum free and clear and that they blew up so tell me more about what derrick did out there milo kept it sketchy whoa said castro creepy murder thats a whole new level makes sense i guess keep getting away with it you start thinking youre god the thing that interests me said milo is from what we can tell derrick isnt living well no car registrations no address in any swank neighborhood that we can find and he may have taken a lowpaying job under an alias so he must not have invested that eighty grand he wouldnt hed plow right through it just like any other sociopath i cant find any social security for him except when he lived in miami said milo so no jobs under his own name any idea what hes been doing all these years nah said castro he left town nine or ten months after the murder they both did left no trail the case was officially open but no one was really working on it in my spare time i kept following the money drove by some clubs they hung out at then one day a source at county records called meid asked to be told when the estate was settled thats when i learned how little they were gonna get the address on the transfer was in utah park city i traced it fob it was winter by then i figured the little fucks went skiing with the death money scams murder movies i said no known address need a closer fit milo shook his head i felt sparked by what wed just learned but he seemed dejected what is it first derrick offs his parents then his brother probably for cliffs share of the eighty grand this is professional evil what was left of cliffs share i said like castro said they probably chewed right through it maybe derrick chewed faster derrick the dominator arrogant just like youve been saying good criminal selfesteem i said and why not he does bad things and gets away clean and maybe he had practice with family elimination the ardullos he said spurring peake onwell your guesses have been pretty right on havent they aw shucks i said now all we need to do is find derrick let me get back on the line with the psychiatric board sure ill hit pimm again and park city maybe derrick tried a land scam there too if you want ill give you some other possibilities what aspen telluride vegas tahoe this is a party boy he goes where the fun is the dejected look returned those kinds of record checks could take weeks he said the guys right here polluting my city and i cant put a finger on him it took several calls to learn that psychiatric tech licenses were granted for periods ranging from thirteen to twentyfour months individual names could be verified but sending the entire list was unheardof finally i found a supervisor willing to fax the roster another twenty minutes passed before paper began spooling out of the sorrylooking machine across the room i read as it unraveled page after page of names no crimmins no wark another alias griffith d wark scrambling a film maestro manipulative pretentious arrogant and strangely childlikeplaying pretend games seeing himself as a major hollywood player the fact that hed never produced anything was a nasty bit of potential dissonance but the same could be said of so many coutured reptiles occupying tables at spago psychopaths could deal with dissonance psychopaths had low levels of anxiety besides there were other types of productions blood walk bad eyes in a box something else about human snakes they lacked emotional depth faked humanity craved repetition patterns so maybe wark had coopted other major directors i was no film expert but several names came to mind alfred hitchcock orson welles john huston john ford frank capra i scanned the tech list none of the above but wark was dw griffiths middle name what was hitchcocks i called the research library at the u asked for the reference desk and explained what i needed the librarian must have been puzzled but odd requests are their business and god bless her she didnt argue five minutes later i had what i needed alfred joseph hitchcock john no middle name huston frank nmn capra george orson welles john nmn ford real name sean aloysius ofeeney thanking her i turned back to the tech list no capras four fords one hitchcock no hustons no ofeeneys no obviously cute manipulations of hitchcock or fordthen i saw it gw orson coopting a genius delusions were everywhere chapter citizen creep said milo looking at the circled name gw orson got licensed twentytwo months ago i said thats about all i could get except for the address he put on his application form he studied the address slip south shenandoah street around eighteenth west la territory only a few blocks from the shopping center where claire was dumped the centers far from claires house so why would she shop there unless she went with someone else crimmins they had a relationship why not i said lets assume orsonand warkare both crimmins aliases we have no employment records yet but crimmins is a psych tech so its not much of a leap to assume he works at starkweather or did in the past he ran into claire something developed because they had two common interests the movies and ardis peake when claire told crimmins shed picked peake as a project he decided to find out more when crimmins learned claire was uncovering information potentially threatening to him he decided to cast hex in blood walk kills her films her dumps her he said it holds together logically now all i have to do is prove it i canvassed the shopping center showed her picture to every clerk whod been working the day she was killed no one remembered seeing her alone or with anyone else that doesnt mean much its a huge place and if i can get a picture of crimmins ill go back but maybe we can get a look at him in person he waved the address slip this helps bigtime first lets see if he registered his vette the call to dmv left him shaking his head no gw orson cars anywhere in the state lives in la but no legal car i said that alone tells us hes dirty try another scrambled directors name later he said pocketing the address this is something real lets go for it the block was quiet intermittently treed filled with plainwrap singlestory houses set on vestpocket lots that ranged from compulsively tended to ragged birds chirped dogs barked a man in an undershirt pushed a lawn mower in slomo a darkskinned woman strolling a baby looked up as we passed apprehension then relief the unmarked was anything but inconspicuous years ago the neighborhood had been ravaged by crime and white flight rising real estate prices had reversed some of that and the result was a mixedrace district that resonated with tense tentative pride the place gw orson had called home twentytwo months ago was a pale green spanish bungalow with a neatly edged lawn and no other landscaping a for lease sign was staked dead center in the grass in the driveway was a latemodel oldsmobile cutlass milo drove halfway down the block and ran the plates tbl properties address on wilshire near la brea he uturned parked in front of the green house a stunted old magnolia tree planted in the parkway next door cast some shade upon the olds nailed to the trunk was a poster cloudy picture of a dog with some rottweiler in it eager canine grin have you seen buddy over a phone number and a typed message buddy had been missing for a week and needed daily thyroid medication finding him would bring a hundreddollar reward for no reason i could think of buddy looked strangely familiar everything was starting to remind me of something we walked to the front of the green house stepping around a low chipped stucco wall that created a small patio the front door was glossy and sharpsmellingfresh varnish white curtains blocked the front window shiny brass door knocker milo lifted it and let it drop footsteps an asian man opened the door sixties angular and tanned he wore a beige work shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows matching cotton pants white sneakers creepily close to starkweather inmate duds i felt my hands ball and forced them to loosen yes his hair was sparse and white his eyes a pair of surgical incisions in one hand was a crumpled gray rag milo flashed the badge were here about george orson him weary smile no surprise come on in we followed him into a small empty living room next door was a kitchen also empty except for a sixpack of paper towel rolls on the brown tile counter a mop and a broom were propped in a corner looking like exhausted marathon dancers the house echoed of vacancy but stale odors cooked meat must tobaccolingered battling for domir nance with soap ammonia varnish from the door vacant but more livedin than claires place the man held out his hand len itatani you work for the owner sir said milo itatani smiled i am the owner he produced a couple of business cards tbl properties inc leonard j itatani pres named it after my kids tom beverly linda so what did orson do sounds like you had problems with him sir said milo nothing but said itatani he glanced around the room sorry theres no place to sit theres some bottled water if youre thirsty too hot to be cleaning up but summers prime rental time and i want to get this place squared away no thanks said milo what did orson do itatani pulled a square of tissue paper from his shirt pocket and dabbed a clear broad forehead no moisture on the bronze skin that id noticed orson was a bum always late with his rent then he stopped paying at all neighbor complained he was selling drugs but i dont know about that there was nothing i could do she said all kinds of cars would show up at night be here a short time and leave i told her to call the police did she youd have to ask her which neighbor right next door itatani pointed south milos pad was out so you never talked to orson about selling drugs i was going to eventually said itatani what i did try to talk to him about was the rent left messages under the doorhe never gave me a phone listing said he hadnt bothered to get one that shouldive warned me another swipe at the dry brow didnt want to scare him off with any drug talk until he paid the rent he owed me was this close to posting notice but he moved out middle of the night stole furniture i had his first and last and damage deposit in cash but he trashed more than was covered by the depositcigarette burns on the nightstands cracked tiles in the bathroom gouges in the wood floors probably from dragging cameras around cameras movie camerasbig heavy stuff all sorts of stuff in boxes too i warned him about the floors he said hed be careful he grimaced had to refinish a hundred square feet of oak board replace some of it totally i told him no filming in the house didnt want any funny business like what you know said itatani a guy like that says hes making movies but hes living here my first thought was something xrated i didnt want that going on here so i made it clear this was a residence not a budget studio orson said he had no intention of working here had some kind of arrangement with one of the studios he just needed to store some equipment i never really believed thatyou get a studio contract you dont live here i had a bad feeling about him from the beginningno references he said hed been freelancing for a while working on his own projects when i asked him what kind of projects he just said short films changed the subject but he showed me cash it was the middle of the year the place had been vacant for a long time i figured a bird in the hand when did he start renting sir eleven months ago said itatani he stayed for six months stiffed me for the last two so its been five months since he left said milo have you had other tenants since sure said itatani first two students then a hairdresser not much better had to evict them both did orson live alone far as i know i saw him with a couple of women whether or not he moved them in i dont know so whatd he do to get you down here a few things said milo what did the women look like one was one of those rockandroll typesblond hair all spiky lots of makeup she was here when i showed up to ask about the overdue rent said she was a friend of orsons he was out on location shed give him the message how old twenties thirties hard to tell with all that makeup she wasnt tough or anythingkind of polite actually promised to tell orson nothing happened for a week i stopped by again but no one was here i left a note another week passed orson sent me a check it bounced remember what bank it was from santa monica bank pico boulevard said itatani closed account hed only had it for a week i came over a third time looked through the window saw he still had his stuff here i couldve posted right there but all that does is cost money for filing even if you win in small claims try collecting so i left more messages hed call back but always late at night when he knew i wasnt in he ticked his ringers sorry been traveling there must be a bank mixup ill get you a cashiers check by the next month id had it but he was gone what about the second woman said milo her i didnt meet i just saw her with him getting into his carthats another thing his car yellow corvette flashy that he had money for the time i saw the second woman was around the same timefive six months ago id come by to get the rent no one was home i left a note drove away got halfway up the block saw orsons car turned around orson parked and got out but then he mustve seen me because he got back in and drove off fast we passed each other i waved but he kept going she was on the passenger side brunette id already met the blonde remember thinking he can tpay the rent but he can afford two girlfriends you figured the brunette was his girlfriend she was with him middle of the day they were about to go into the house what else can you tell me about her i didnt get much of a look at her older than the blonde i think nothing unusual when she passed me she was looking out the window right at me not smiling or anything i remember thinking she looked confusedlike why was orson making a getaway but i really cant say much about her brunette thats about it how about a description of orson tall skinny every time i saw him he wore nothing but black he had these black boots with big heels that made him even taller and that shaved headreal hollywood shaved head said milo clean as a cueball said itatani how old thirties maybe forty eye color that i couldnt tell you he always reminded me of a vulture big nose little eyesi think they were brown but i wouldnt swear to it how old was the brunette in the car itatani shrugged like i said we passed for two seconds but probably older than the blonde said milo i guess milo produced claires county hospital staffphoto itatani studied the picture returned it shaking his head no reason it couldn t be her but thats as much as i can say who is she possibly an associate of orson so you saw the brunette with orson five six months ago let me think id say closer to five not long before he moved out itatani dabbed his face again all these questions he mustve done something really bad whys that sir for you to be spending all this time i get burglaries at some of my other properties robberies its all i can do to get the police to come out and write a report i knew that guy was wrong milo pressed itatani for more details without success then we walked through the house two bedrooms one bath everything redolent of soap fresh paint new carpeting in the hallway the replaced floorboards were in the smaller bedroom milo rubbed his face any physical evidence of warks presence had long vanished he said did orson keep any tools herepower tools in the garage said itatani he set up a whole shop he kept more movie stuff in there too lights cables all kinds of things what kind of tools did he have in the shop the usual said itatani power drill hand tools power saws he said he sometimes built his own sets the garage was flatroofed and doublewidth taking up a third of the tiny backyard outsized for the house i remarked on that itatani unlocked the sliding metal door and shoved it up i enlarged it years ago figured it would make the place easier to rent inside were walls paneled in cheap fake oak a cement floor an openbeam ceiling with a fluorescent fixture dangling from a header the smell of disinfectant burned my nose youve cleaned this too said milo first thing i cleaned said itatani the hairdresser brought cats in against the ruleshe had a nopets lease litter boxes and those scratch things all over the place took days to air out the stink he sniffed finally milo paced the garage examined the walls then the floor he stopped at the rear lefthand corner beckoned me over itatani came too faint mochacolored splotch amoebic eight or nine inches square milo knelt and put his face close to the wall pointed specks of the same hue dotted the paneling brown on brown barely visible itatani said cat pee i was able to scrub some of it off what did it look like before you cleaned it a little darker milo got up and walked along the back wall very slowly stopped a few feet down wrote in his pad another splotch smaller what said itatani milo didnt answer what itatani repeated ohyou dont oh no for the first time he was sweating milo cellphoned the crimescene team apologized to itatani for the impending disruption and asked him to stay clear of the garage then he got some yellow tape from the unmarked and stretched it across the driveway itatani said still looks like cat dirt to me and went to sit in his oldsmobile milo and i walked over to the southside neighbor another spanish house bright white the mat in front of the door said go away very loud classical music pounded through the walls no response to the doorbell several hard knocks finally opened the door two inches revealing one bright blue eye a slice of white skin a smudge of red mouth what a cracked voice screeched milo shouted back police maam show me some id milo held out the badge the blue eye moved closer pupil contracting as it confronted daylight closer the voice demanded milo put the badge right up against the crack the blue eye blinked several seconds passed the door opened the woman was short skinny at least eighty with hair dyed crowfeather black and curled in marie antoinette ringlets that reminded me of blood sausages a face powdered chalky added to the agingcourtesan look she wore a black silk dressing gown spattered with gold stars three strings of heavy amber beads around her neck giant pearl drop earrings the music in the background was assertive and heavywagner or bruckner or someone else a goosestepper wouldve enjoyed cymbals crashed the woman glared behind her was a huge white grand piano piled high with books what do you want she screamed over a crescendo her voice was as pleasing as grit on glass george orson said milo is it possible to turn the music down cursing under her breath the woman slammed the door opened it a minute later the music was several notches lower but still loud orson she said scumbag whatd he do kill someone glancing to the left itatani had come out of his car and was standing on the lawn of the green house goddamn absentee landlords dont care who they rent to so whatd that scumbag do thats what were trying to find out maam thats a load of doubletalk crap whatd he dot she slapped her hands against her hips silk whistled and the dressing gown parted at her neckline revealing powdered wattle a few inches of scrawny white chest shiny sternal knobs protruding like ivory handles her lipstick was the color of arterial blood you want info from me dont hand me any crap mr orsons suspected in some drug thefts mrs ms she said sinclair ms marie sinclair drugs big boohoo surprise its about time you guys caught on the whole time that lowlife was here thered be cars in and out in and out all hours of the night did you ever call the police marie sinclair looked ready to hit him jesus almighty only six times your socalled officers said theyd drive by if they did lot of good it accomplished milo wrote what else did orson do to disturb you ms sinclair cars in and out in and out wasnt enough im trying to practice and the headlights keep shining through the drapes right there she pointed to her front window covered with lace practice what maam said milo piano i teach give recitals she flexed ten spidery white fingers the nails were a matching red but clipped short i used to do radio work she said live radiothe old rko studios i knew oscar levant what a lunaticanother dope fiend but a genius i was the first girl pianist for the cocoanut grove played the mocambo did a party at ira gershwins up on roxbury drive talk about stage fright george and ira listening there were giants back then now its only mental midgets and orson told mr itatani he was a film director mr itawhosisshe sneereddoesnt give a damn who he rents to after the scumbag moved out i got stuck with two sloppy kidsreal pigsthen a fag cosmetologist back when i bought this house when orson lived here did you ever see any filming next door said milo yeah he was cecil b demilleno never just cars in and out im trying to practice and the damn headlights are glaring through like some kind of you practice at night maam so what said marie sinclair thats against the law no maam i was just look she said her hands separated from her hips clamped down again im a night person as if its any of your business just woke up if its any of your business comes from all those years of clubbing she stepped onto the porch advanced on milo nighttimes when it comes alive mornings for suckers morning people should be lined up and shot so your basic complaint against orson was all the traffic dope traffic those kinds of lowlifes what was to stop someone from pulling out a gun none of those idiots can shoot straight you hear about all those colored and mexican kids getting shot in drivebys by accident i couldve been sitting in there playing chopin andpow she squeezed her eyes shut punched her forehead jerked her head back black ringlets danced when her eyes opened they were hotter brighter milo said did you ever get a good look at any of orsons visitors visitors hah no i didnt look didnt want to see didnt want to know the headlights were bad enough you guys never did a damn thing about them and dont tell me to turn the piano around because its a sevenfootlong steinway and it wont fit in the room any other way how many cars would there be on an average night ms sinclair five six ten who knows i never counted at least he was gone a lot how often maam a lot half the time maybe more thank god for small blessings did you ever talk to him directly about the headlights what she screeched and have him pull out a gun were talking scumbag thats your job i called you lot of good it did mr itatani said orson had a machine shop out in the garage did you ever hear sawing or drilling no she said why you think he was manufacturing the dope back there or cutting it whatever it is they do to that crap anythings possible maam no its not she snapped very few things are possible oscar levant will not rise from the dead that cancer in george gershwins genius brain will not never mind why am i wasting my time no i never heard drilling or sawing i never heard a damn thing because during the day when i sleep i keep the music ongot one of those programmable cd players six discs that keep repeating its the only way i can go to sleep block out the damn birds cars all that daytime crap it was when i was up that he bothered me the lights trying to get through my scales and the damn headlights are shining right on the keyboard milo nodded i understand maam sure you do she said too late too little anything else you can tell us thats it didnt know i was going to be tested milo showed her claires picture ever see her with orson nope she said she looks like a schoolteacher is she the one he killed the crimescene crew arrived ten minutes later itatani sat in his oldsmobile looking miserable marie sinclair had gone back inside her house but a few other neighbors had emerged milo asked them questions i followed as he walked up and down the block knocking on doors no new revelations if george orson had been running a dope house marie sinclair had been the only one to notice a pleasant old woman named mrs leiber turned out to be the owner of buddy the missing dog she seemed addled disappointed that we werent here to investigate the theft convinced buddy had been dognapped though an open gate at the side of her house indicated other possibilities milo told her hed keep his eyes open hes such a sweetie mrs leiber said got the courage but not any meanness we returned to the green house the criminalists were still unpacking their gear milo showed the stains in the garage to the head tech a black man named merriweather who got down and put his nose to it could be he said if it is its pretty degraded well scrape if it is blood should be able to get a basic hla typing but dnas a whole other thing just tell me if its blood i can try that now we watched him work wielding solvents and reagents swabs and test tubes the answer came within minutes opositive richard dadas type said milo fortythree percent of the population said merriweather let me scrape around here and inside the house itll take us the best part of the day but maybe we can find you something interesting back in the unmarked milo phoned dmv again crossreferencing vehicle registrations with the shenandoah address no match gunning the engine he pulled away from the curb tires squealing less urgency than frustration by the time we were back on pico hed slowed down at doheny we stopped for a red light and he said richards blood type orsons cutting out on the rent could explain why richard was cut in half and claire wasnt by the time he did her hed lost his machine shop didnt have the timeor the placeto set up all that stolen movie junk he has to keep it somewhere time to check out storage outfits be nice if itatani couldve ldd claire as the woman in the car if she was itatani saw her shortly before she was murdered maybe she and orson did go shopping at the center and thats why he dumped her there what stores are there montgomery ward toys r us food joints the stereos galore she was found behind stereos galore i said might they sell cameras he looked in his rearview mirror hung an illegal uturn the front lot was jammed and we had to park on the far end near la cienega stereos galore was two vast stories of gray rubber flooring and maroon plastic partitions scores of tvs projected soundlessly blinking throbbing entertainment centers spewed conflicting backbeats salespeople in emeraldgreen vests pointed out the latest feature to stunnedlooking customers the camera section was at the rear of the second floor the manager was a small darkskinned harriedlooking man named albert mustafa with a precise black mustache and eyeglasses so thick his mild brown irises seemed miles away he shepherded us into a relatively quiet corner behind tall displays of film in colorful boxes the cacophony from below filtered through the rubber tiles marie sinclair would have felt at home claire argents picture evoked a blank stare milo asked him about substantial video purchases six months ago he said five or six months ago said milo the name could be wark or crimmins or orson were looking for a substantial purchase of video equipment or cameras how much is substantial said mustafa whats your typical sale nothings typical still cameras range from fifty dollars to nearly a thousand we can get you set up with basic video for under three hundred but you can go hightech and then youre talking serious money every sale is in the computer right supposed to be do you categorize your customers based upon how much they spend no sir okay said milo how about checking video purchases over one thousand dollars four to six months ago start with this date he recited the day of claires murder mustafa said im not sure this is legal sir id have to check with the home office wheresthat minneapolis and theyre closed by now said milo im afraid so sir how about just spooling back to that one day mr mustafa see what comes up id really rather not milo stared at him i dont want to lose my job said mustafa but the police help us just that day eight creditcard purchases of video equipment that day two of them over a thousand dollars no crimmins wark or orson or argent nothing that brought to mind a scrambled directors name milo copied down the names and the credit card numbers as mustafa looked on nervously what about cash sales would you have records of those if the customer purchased me extended warranty if he gave us his address so we could put him on the mailing list milo tapped the computer how about scrolling back a few days mustafa said this isnt good but he complied nothing for the entire week mustafa pushed a button and the screen went blank by the time milo thanked him hed walked away chapter a few more detectives had returned to the robberyhomicide room i pulled a chair up next to miles desk and listened as he called social security and the franchise tax board two hits tax refunds had been sent to george orson place of employment starkweather state hospital the checks were sent to an address on picoten thousand five hundred commercial zone ten to one a mail drop also close to richards dump site okay okay somethings happening here i need to get more specific find out if he still works at starkweather what about lindeen the receptionist i said she likes you must be that masculine cop musk he grimaced yeah im a musk ox okay why not he jabbed the phone hello lindeen hi its milo sturgis right oh muddling along how bout you well thats terrific yeah ive heard about those sounds like fun at least you get to solve something uh well im not sure i have anything to think so well okay if i can get some free timeafter i clear dr argents case no wish i could say i was speaking of which does a psych tech named george orson still work there he spelled the surname nothing major but i heard he mightve been a friend of dr argents i know she didnt but his name came up from another party they said he worked at starkweather and knew her no he frowned could you thatd be great he lowered the mouthpiece the names a little familiar but she cant connect it to a face hundred employees i said whats the barter he started to answer moved the phone back under his mouth yup still here did he when was that any forwarding address his pen was poised but he didnt write so how long was he actually on staff scribble any idea why he left no i wouldnt call him that just checking every lead whats that that soon i wish i could say yes but unless the case clears im pretty pardon yeah okay i promise yeah it should be fun me too thanks lindeen and listen you dont need to bother mr swig about this ive got everything i need thanks again he hung up the barter is i come give a talk to some murdermystery club she belongs to they stage phony crimes give out prizes for solving them eat nachos she wanted me next month but i deferred to their big bash at christmas playing santa ho ho fucking ho i tell you its the musk yeah next time ill shower first the deal on orson is he joined starkweather fifteen months ago left after ten months of fulltime employment five months ago i said a month after claire got there so they had plenty of time to get acquainted the brunette in the car he said itatanis threesecond observation isnt much but with this maybe orsons file says he worked primarily on the fifth floor with the criminal fakershows mat for a match made in hell but he did do some overtime down on the regular wards so that gives him access to peake no infractions no problems he quit voluntarily his photos missing from me file but lindeen thinks she might remember himmaybe he had light brown hair probably being overly helpful or the guys got a wig collection little dip into the costume box i said he produces directs and acts five months ago is also shortly after richard dadas murder right when orson closed up shop at shenandoah packed up the machine shop he keeps himself a moving target saves money on rent and gets off on the thrill of the con his relationship with claire you think it couldve gone beyond an interest in peake who knows castro said he wasnt very smooth in miami but hes had time to polish his act for all her love of privacy claire mightve been lonely and vulnerable and we know she could be sexually aggressive maybe her interest in pathology went beyond the workday or orson promised to put her in pictures he knuckled his eyes let out air very slowly okay lets check out that pico address as we left the building i said one thing in our favor he may trip himself up because theres rigidity and childishness to his technique the way he scripted his miami con ill bet hes done the same here the way he stays in comfort zones dumping claire near one of his addresses richard near another he sees himself as some creative wizard but he always returns to the familiar sounds about right he said for a showbiz guy mailbox heaven northeast corner of a scruffy strip mall just west of barrington a stuffy closet lined with brass boxes and smelling of wet paper a young woman came out from the back room redheaded brighteyed brightening as milo showed her his badge opining that police work was cool george orsons box had been rented to someone else for over a year and she had no records of the original transaction no way she said we dont keep stuff people come and go thats who uses us we got back in the unmarked on the way to the station we passed the spot where richard dadas vw had been abandoned small factories auto mechanics spareparts yards just another industrial parka cleaner more compact version of the desolate stretch presaging starkweather comfort zones we sat parked at the curb not talking watching men with rolledup sleeves hauling and driving loafing and smoking no gates around the enclosure easy entry after hours empty dark acres the perfect dump site a flatbed full of aluminum pipe rumbled past a catering truck with rustspecked white sides sounded a clarion and men marched forward for burritos of dubious composition the noise had never abated but now i heard it for the first time compressors snapping and popping metal clanging against cement whining triumph as saw blades devoured wood i accompanied milo as he visited shop after shop asking questions encountering boredom confusion distrust occasional overt hostility asking about a tall thin bald man with a bird face who did woodwork maybe a wig black or brown curly or straight a yellow corvette or an old vw two hours and all the effort bought were lungfuls of chemical air milo drove me back to the station and i headed home thinking suddenly and inexplicably of a missing dog with a nice smile nighttime can be so many things shortly after eight pm robin and i were eating pizza on the deck tented by a starless purple sky just enough dry heat had lingered to be soothing the quiet was merciful robin had driven up an hour before feeling guilty about returning to starkweather without informing her id filled her in no need for confession youre here in one piece shed looked tired soaked in the tub while i drove into westwood to get the pizza i took the truck playing joe satriani very loud not minding the traffic not minding much of anything at all a couple of beers when i got back didnt raise my anxiety the bath had refreshed robin and staring at her across the table as she worked on a second slice seemed a great way to pass the time id allowed myself to feel pretty good by the time the unmarked zoomed up in front of the house the headlights made my head hurt tonight marie sinclair and i were kindred spirits the car stopped spike barked robin waved i didnt budge milo stuck his head out the passengers window oh sorry nothing earthshattering call me tomorrow alex spike had cranked up the volume and now he was baying like an insulted hound robin got up and leaned over the railing dont be silly come up and eat something nah he said you lovebirds deserve some quality time up young man now spike hurled himself down the stairs sped to the car stationed himself at milos door and began jumping up and down how do i interpret this said milo friend or foe friend i said youre sure psychologists are never sure i said we just make probability judgments meaning if he pees on your shoes i was wrong he claimed to have grabbed a sandwich but one and a half beers later he started to observe the pizza with interest i slid it over to him he got down four slices said maybe its good for methe spice cleanses the body sure i said its health food detoxify yourself he got to work on a fifth slice spike curled at his feet lapping the scraps that fell from his dangling left hand milo maintaining a poker face thinking robin and i werent noticing the covert donations robin said dessert dont put yourself out she patted his head and went into the house i said so whats not earthshattering found four more george orson bank accounts glendale sylmar northridge downtown all the same pattern he plants cash for a week withdraws right after writing checks checks for what havent been able to look at them yet after a certain amount of timeno one seems to know how longbad papers destroyed and the datas sent to some computer in the home office in minnesota i said no doubt these guys are addicted to paperwork dont seem to wanna help themselves glendale sylmar northridge downtown i said orsons spreading himself all over the city it might also mean hes a restless driver consistent with a funkiller anyone remember him not a one the crimes were duly documented police reports were filed but no one bothered to check for similars no one spent much energy following up next item the lab has complete hla typing from the stains in the garage i sent over samples of richards blood for comparison nothing showed up in the rest of the house too many cleanings by mr itataniwhere are negligent slumlords when you need them spike emitted a pulsating froglike croak milos left hand slid across the table slurp munch finally the lovely and outgoing ms sinclair did indeed report the nighttime traffic at the house a dozen complaints cruisers were sent out seven times but all the blues saw were some cars in the driveway no dope transactions i spoke to one of the sergeants he considers sinclair a crank i have cleaned up his language apparently bitchings her main hobby one time she called in at two am about a mockingbird in a tree she claimed was singing offkey intentionally some bird plot to throw off her piano playing in the warrant application i thought it best not to describe her psychological status in too much detail called her a neighborhood observer but what a whack job you guys will never be out of work too bad mrs leiber didnt notice anything i said whos mrs leiber the lady with the lost dog oh her all she cared about was the dog i keep thinking about the dog what do you mean his face stays with me dont know why its as if ive seen him before in a past life i laughed because it was the right thing to do milo slipped spike a long strip of mozzarella robin came out with iced coffee and chocolate ice cream milo finished the pizza and joined us sipping and spooning soon hed slid down in his chair nearly supine eyes closed head hanging over the back of the chair ah he said the good life then his beeper went off chapter swio he said returning from the kitchen someone told him about peakes jesus pose i said and hes going to make your life a living hell if you dont stay away on the contrary he offered a personal invitation to come over now why he wouldnt say just now not an order though a polite request he actually said please i looked at robin have fun she said oh please youll be pacing the house end up having one of your sleepless nights to milo take care of him or no more beer he crossed his heart i kissed her and we hurried down to the car as he sped down to the glen and headed south i said were you shielding robin or did he really not say the latter one thing i didn t say in front of her he sounded scared ten pm the night was kind to the industrial wasteland a hospital security guard was waiting on the road just outside the turnoff idly aiming a flashlight beam at the ground as we drove up he illuminated the unmarkeds license plate and waved us forward hurriedly straight through he told milo theyre waiting for you whos they everyone the guard in the booth flipped the barrier arm as we approached we drove through without being questioned no surrendering the gun i said when do they unfurl the red rug too easy said milo i hate it when things go too easy at the parking lot a black tech with saltandpepper hair pointed out the closest parking space milo muttered now i have to tip him when we got out of the car the tech said hal cleveland ill take you to mr swig hurrying toward the inner fence without waiting running ahead the way dollard had done he kept checking to see if we were with him whats the story milo asked him cleveland shook his head ill leave that to mr swig at night the yard was empty and different the dirt frosty and bluegray under highvoltage lights scooped in places like ice cream cleveland halfjogged it was nice being able to cross without fear of some psychotic jumping me still i found myself checking my back we reached the far gate and cleveland unlocked it with a quick twist the main building didnt look much different still ashen and ugly the clouded plastic windows gaping like an endless series of beseeching mouths another guard blocked the door armed with baton and gun first time id seen a uniformor weaponsinside the grounds he stepped aside for us and cleveland hurried us past lindeens cleared desk past the brassy flash of bowling trophies through the silent hallway past swigs office all the other administrative doors straight to the elevator a quick uninterrupted ride up to c ward cleveland wedged himself in a corner played with his keys when the elevator door opened another tech big and thick and bearded was positioned right in front of us he stepped back to let us exit cleveland stayed in the lift and rode it back down the bearded tech took us through the double doors william swig stood midway up the corridor in front of peakes room peakes door was closed another pair of uniformed guards was positioned a few feet away the bearded man left us to join two other techs their backs against the facing wall no men in khaki but for the hum of the air conditioner the ward was silent swig saw us and shook his head very hard as if denying a harsh reality he had on a navy polo shirt jeans running shoes the filmy strands atop his head puffed at odd angles overhead fluorescents heightened the contrast between his facial moles and the pallid skin that hosted them dark dots like braille punctuating the message on his face nothing ambiguous about the communication pure fear he opened peakes door winced gave a ringmasters flourish not that much blood a single scarlet python winding its way toward us from the far righthand corner of the cell about three feet from the spot where peake had played jesus otherwise the room looked the same messy bed wall restraints bolted in place that same burning smell mixed with something copperysweet no sign of peake the blood trail stopped halfway across the floor its point of origin below the body stocky body lying facedown plaid shirt blue jeans sneakers a head full of coarse gray hair arms outstretched almost relaxedlooking thick forearms the skin had already gone grayishgreen dollard said milo when we dont know said swig someone discovered him two hours ago and you called me fortyfive minutes ago we had to conduct our own search first said swig he picked at a mole brought a rosy flush to its borders and swig looked away we havent found him milo was silent look said swig we had to do our own search first im not even sure i shouldve called you its sheriffs jurisdictionactually its our jurisdiction so you did me a favor said milo you had an interest in peake im frying to cooperate milo stepped closer to the body kneeled looked under dollards chin looks like one transverse cut he said has anyone moved him no said swig nothings been touched who found him swig pointed to one of the three techs bart did the man stepped forward young chinese delicately built but with the oversized arms of a bodybuilder his badge photo was that of a stunned child bl quan tech ii tell me about it milo told him we were in lockdown said quan not because of any problems we do it during staff meetings how frequent are staff meetings twice a week for each shift what days it depends on the shift said quan tonight was for the eleventoseven sixthirty friday night the weekly summary the patients go in lockdown and the staff goes in there he pointed to the tv room no staff on the ward said milo one tech stays outside we rotate theres never been any problem the patients are all locked up tight milo looked at the body quan shrugged and dollard was scheduled to be the outside guy tonight quan nodded but your beeper never went off right so what made you look for him said milo the meeting was over i was doing a double and frank was supposed to talk to me about some patients give me the transfer datameds things to watch out for that kind of thing he didnt show up i thought he forgot was that typical said milo frank forgetting quan looked uncomfortable he glanced at swig dont worry said milo you cant embarrass him anymore quan said sometimes sometimes what quan shifted his feet milo turned to swig tell him anything you know said swig his voice had turned hoarse he rolled his fingers rubbed another mole sometimes frank forgot things said quan thats why i didnt make any big deal out of it but then when i went to get the charts i couldnt find one of thempeakes so i checked out peakes room you ever find the chart no what else said milo thats it i saw frank peake was gone i locked the door put out a code three alert easy we were already in lockdown mr swig came in we brought outside guards onto the wards and a bunch of us searched everywhere hes got to be somewhere it makes no sense what doesnt said milo peake disappearing like that you dont just disappear at starkweather milo asked for a key to peakes room got swigs closed the door and locked it then moved out of earshot and used his cell phone to call the sheriff he talked for a long time none of the guards or techs budged the silence seemed to amplify then it began to falter with sporadic knocks from behind some of the brown doors muffled scuffs faint as mouse steps cries moans escalating gradually but steadily into ragged shards of noise that could only be human voices in distress a chorus of cries the guards and techs eyed one another swig seemed oblivious shit said the bearded tech shut the hell up swig moved farther up the hall no one attempted to stop the noise louder and louder frantic pounding from within the cells the inmates knew somehow they knew milo pocketed the phone and returned sheriffs crimescene team should be here shortly squad cars will be searching a fivemile radius outside the hospital grounds tell your men in front not to hold anyone up at the gate swig said we need to keep this under wraps until what i mean is lets find out exactly what happened before we jump to what do you think happened mr swig peake surprised frank and cut his throat franks a strong man so it had to be a sneak attack what did peake use to cut him no answer no guesses said milo what about dollards own knife none of the techs are armed said swig theoretically theoretically and factually detective for obvious reasons we have strict milo cut him off you have rules an ironclad system so tell me are techs and doctors required to check in weapons at the guardhouse the way we were swig didnt answer sir that would be cumbersome the sheer number of milo looked over at the three techs no telltale evasive gestures the big bearded man stared back defiantly so everyone but staff is required to surrender weapons staff knows not to bring weapons said swig milo reached into his jacket pulled out his service revolver dangled it from his index finger dr delaware i produced my swiss army knife both guards tensed no one checked us tonight i guess the system breaks down from time to time said milo look said swig raising his voice he exhaled tonight is different i told them to facilitate your entry i had full knowledge so youre willing to bet dollard wasnt carrying the blade that killed him frank was very trustworthy even though he tended to forget things ive never heard that said swig you just did said milo let me tell you about frank hemet pd fired him for malfeasance ignoring calls false overtime i had absolutely no knowledge of so maybe there are other things you have no knowledge of look swig repeated but he added nothing just shook his head and tried to smooth down his filmy hair his adams apple rose and fell he said why bother youve already got your mind made up milo turned to the techs if i frisk any of you guys am i going to turn up something silence he walked across the hall bart quans feet spread as if ready for combat and the other two men folded their arms across their cheststhe same resistant stance dollard had adopted yesterday tell them to cooperate said milo do what he says said swig quickly efficiently milo patted down the techs nothing on quan or the tech who hadnt spokenan older man with droopy eyesbut the jeans of the heavy bearded man produced a bonehandled pocketknife milo unfolded the blade four inches of gracefully honed steel milo turned it admiringly steve said swig the heavy mans face quivered so what he said work with these animals you take care of yourself milo kept examining the blade whered you get it home shopping network knife show said steve and dont worry man i havent used it since i went hunting last winter kill anything skinned some elk tasty folding the knife milo dropped it in his jacket pocket thats mine man said steve if its clean youll get it back when i want a receipt quiet steve ordered swig you and i will talk later the bearded mans nostrils opened wide yeah right if i even want to stay in this dump thats up to you steve meanwhile the states still paying your salary so listen up go down to a and b wards make sure everythings in order complete foot circuits constant surveillance including door checks no breaks till youre notified the bearded man gave milo one last glare and stomped around the left side of the nursing station wheres he heading said milo staff elevator we didnt see any elevator when we toured the doors unmarked staff only said swig we need to keep searching can i free these guards sure said milo go swig told the uniformed men where said one of them every damn where start with the outer grounds north and south perimeters make sure hes not hiding somewhere in the trees swig turned to the two remaining techs bart you and jim search the basement again kitchen laundry every storage room make sure everythings as tight as it was the first time we looked barking orders like a general when everyone had dispersed swig turned to milo i know what youre thinking were a bunch of civilservice bumblers but this is absolutely the first time since ive run this place that weve had anything close to an escape as a rule nothing ever some people said milo live for the rules me i deal with the exceptions we walked up and down c ward as milo inspected doors several times he had swig unlock hatches as he peered inside the noise from within subsided cant see the entire room through these he said fingering a hatch door weve gone over every room said swig first thing everything checks out i said that unmarked staff elevator door i assume the inmates know about it we dont make a point of explaining it said swig but i suppose reason i mention it is that yesterday peake and heidi came from that direction it was the first time anyone remembers peake leaving his room for any length of time im wondering if he saw someone enter the elevator got an idea does it stop on every floor it can said swig has anyone checked it i assume milo bore down on him you assume my orders were to check everywhere your orders were not to carry weapons im sure said swig that fine to hell with it ill show you brown door slightly wider than those that sealed the inmates cells double key locks no intercom speaker swig keyed the upper bolt and a latch clicked the door swung open revealing yet another brown rectangle inner door no handle single lock in the center of the panel the same key operated it and a flick of swigs wrist brought forth rumbling gear noise that vibrated through the walls a few feet away was a smaller door maybe two feet wide and twice as high wheres the car coming from said milo no way to tell said swig its a little slow should be here soon the first time we were here i said phil hatterson called upstairs spoke to someone and got the elevator sent down you cant do that with this one right said swig the call box for the main elevator is in the nursing station a techs in there at all times to monitor meds part of station dutys also monitoring interfloor transport did frank dollard ever have that duty im sure he did the staff circulates everyone does a bit of everything when the elevators are keyed remotely what determines where they stop you leave the key in until the elevator arrives when an approved personsomeone with a keyrides up he can release the lock mechanism and punch buttons in the elevator so once the locks been released this operates like any other elevator yes said swig but you cant release anything without a key and only the staff has keys do you ever remaster the locks if theres a problem said swig which never happens said milo swig flinched it doesnt take something of this magnitude to remaster detective anything out of the ordinarya key reported stolenand we change the tumblers immediately must be a hassle said milo ah those keys to replace we dont have many hassles whens the last time the tumblers were changed mr swig id have to check but not recently that you can recall what are you getting at said swig one more thing said milo each ward is sectioned by those double doors every time you walk through you have to unlock each one exactly said swig its a maze thats the point how many keys do the techs need to carry to negotiate the maze several said swig i never counted is there a master key i have a master milo pointed to the key protruding from the inner elevator door the rumbling continued louder as the lift approached that it yes theres also a copy in the safe in one of the data rooms on the first floor and yes i checked it still there no tampering the door groaned open the compartment was small harshly lit empty milo looked in whats that pointing to a scrap on the floor looks like paper said swig same paper as the sandals the inmates wear swig took a closer look i suppose it could bei dont see any blood why would there be blood he cut franks throat there were no bloody footprints in peakes room said milo meaning peake did a nice clean job of it stepped away as he cut not bad for a crazy man hard to believe said swig what is just what you said peake mobilizing that much skill close this elevator said milo keep it locked dont let anyone in when the crimescene people come i want them to remove that paper first thing swig complied milo pointed to the smaller door whats that disposal chute for garbage said swig it goes straight down to the basement like a dumbwaiter exactly i dont see any latches or key locks said milo how does it open theres a lever in the nursing station show me swig unlocked the station three walls of glass a fourth filled with locked steel compartments the room felt like a big telephone booth swig pointed to the metal wall meds and supplies always locked i looked around no desks just builtin plastic counters housing a multiline phone a small switchboard and an intercom microphone set into the front glass was a sixinch slot equipped with a sliding steel tray too narrow to get their hands through said swig with defensive pride they line up get their pills nothings left to chance wheres the lever said milo reaching under the desk swig groped a snapping sound filled the booth we left the station and returned to the hall the garbage chute had unhinged at the top creating a small metal canopy big enough for a skinny man milo stuck his head in and emerged sniffing peake wasnt exactly obese swig said oh come on what else is in the basement the service areaskitchen laundry pantry storage believe me its all been checked thoroughly deliveries come through the basement level yes so theres a loading dock yes but how can you be sure peakes not hiding out in a bin of dirty laundry because weve checked and doublechecked go see for yourself milo tapped the elevator door does this go up to the fifth floor toowhere the fakers are kept swig looked offended the s yes does the main elevator go there too no the fifth floor has its own elevator express from ground level to the top a third elevator said milo for five only security reasons said swig the s come in and out using the main elevator for all that traffic would create obvious logistical problems the jail bus lets them off around the back at the reception center they get processed and go straight up to five no stopsthey have no access to the rest of the hospital except for the staff elevator they dont use the staff elevator theoretically factually said swig if you want to segregate the fifth floor completely why even have the staff elevator go there its the way the hospital was built said swig logical dont you think if something happens on five and the staff needs backup were ready for them ready said milo by way of a slow elevator how often does something happen on five rarely give me a number swig rubbed a mole once twice a yearwhat does it matter were talking temporary disruption not a riot some trying too hard to impress us with how crazy he is or a fight dont forget plenty of the evaluees are gang members swig sniffed contemptuously every society had its castes lets have a look at five said milo through the reception center i dont want anyone to touch that piece of paper even if it is an inmate slipper said swig that wouldnt make it peakes all the inmates are issued he stopped sure sure staff onlywhat was i thinking on the way down he said you think im some bureaucrat who doesnt give a damn i took this job because i care about people i adopted two orphans we got out on the first floor exited the way wed come in followed swig around the left side of the building the side wed never seen or been told about identical concrete pathway bright lights from the roof yellowed five stories creating a giant waffle of clouded windows another door identical to the main entrance the structure was twofaced a painted sign said intake and evaluation a guard blocked the entry ten yards away to the left was a small parking lot empty separated from the yard by a chainlinkbordered path that reminded me of a giant dog run the walkway veered bled into darkness not visible as you crossed the main yard not accessible from the main entry so there was another way onto the grounds an entirely different entry off to the right i saw the firefly bounce of searchlights the outer borders of the uninhabited yard wed seen yesterday hints of the annex buildings unlit too far to make out details the search seemed to be carrying on beyond the annexes fireflies clustering near what had to be the pine forest how many roads enter the hospital grounds i said two said swig one really the one youve taken what about there i pointed to the small parking lot for jail buses only special access path clear around the eastern perimeter the drivers have coded car keys even staff cant access the gates without my permission i indicated the distant searchlights and that side those pine trees how do you get in there you dont said swig no access from the western perimeter its all fenced he walked ahead and nodded at the guard who stepped aside the intake centers front room was proportioned identically to that of the hospital entrance front desk same size as lindeens gunboat gray bare except for a phone no bowling trophies no cute slogans lindeens counterpart was a bulletheaded tech perched behind the rectangle of countyissue steel reading a newspaper but when he saw swig he snapped the paper down and stood swig said anything unusual just the lockdown sir per your orders im taking these people up swig rushed us past a bare hall into yet another elevator and up fast ride to five during which he used his walkietalkie to check on the searchs progress the door slid open keep on it he barked before jamming the intercom into his pocket his armpits were soaked a vein behind his left ear throbbed two sets of double doors over each a painted sign i and e restricted access as opposed to what where the nursing station would have been was empty space the ward was a single hall lined with bright blue doors higher techinmate ratio a dozen especially large men patrolled milo asked to look inside a cell swig said we went roomtoroom here too let me see one anyway swig called out inspection and three techs jogged over detective sturgis wants to see what a looks like open a door which one said the largest of the men a samoan with an unpronounceable name on his tag and a soft boyish voice pick one the samoan stepped to the closest door popped the hatch looked inside unlocked the blue panel and held it open six inches sticking his head in he opened the door fully and said this is mr liverwright the room high and constricted same dimensions as peakes same bolted restraints a muscular young black man sat naked on the bed the sheets had been torn off a thin striped mattress torn into shreds royal blue pajamas lay rumpled on the floor next to a pair of blue paper slippers one of the slippers was nothing but confetti i stepped closer and was hit by a terrible stench a mound of feces sat in a drying clot near the prisoners feet several pools of urine glistened the walls behind the bed were stained brown he saw us grinned cackled clean this up said swig we do said the samoan calmly twice a day he keeps trying to prove himself he flashed liverwright a victory v and laughed keep it up bro liverwright cackled again and rubbed himself shake it but dont break it off bro said the samoan close the door said swig clean him up now the samoan closed the door shrugging to us these guys think they know what crazy is but they overdo it too many movies he turned to leave milo asked him whens the last time you saw george orson him said the samoan i dunno not in a while not tonight nope why would i he hasnt worked here in months who are we talking about said swig has he visited since he quit milo asked the samoan hmm said the samoan dont think so what kind of guy was he said milo just a guy the samoan favored swig with a smile love to chat but got to clean up some shit he lumbered off whos george orson said swig one of your former employees said milo watching swigs face i cant know everyone whyre you asking about him he knew mr peake said milo back in the good old days swig had plenty of questions but milo held him off we rode the fifthfloor elevator down to the basement took a tense deliberate tour of the kitchen pantry laundry and storage rooms everything smelled of slightly rotted produce techs and guards were everywhere helping them search were orangejumpsuited janitors whitegarbed cooks in the kitchen stared as we passed through racks of knives were in full view i thought of peake passing through deciding to sample the good old days milo found four outoftheway closet doors and checked each of them keylocked who gets keys besides clinical staff he asked swig no one not these guys indicating a pair of janitors not them or anyone else not engaged in patient care and to answer your next question nonclinical staff enter through the front like anyone else ids are checked even familiar faces are checked said milo thats our system do clinical staffers take their keys home swig didnt answer do they said milo yes they take them home checking in scores of keys a day would be cumbersome as i said we change the locks even in the absence of a specific problem we remaster every year every year said milo i knew what he was thinking george orson had left five months ago what date did that fall on ill have to check said swig what exactly are you getting at milo walked ahead of him lets see the loading dock sixtyfootwide empty cement space doored with six panels of corrugated metal milo asked a janitor how do you get them open the janitor pointed to a circuit box at the rear is there an outside switch too yup milo loped to the box and punched a button the second door from the left swung upward and we walked to the edge of the dock six or seven feet above ground space for three or four large trucks to unload simultaneously milo climbed down five steps took him into darkness and he disappeared but i heard him walking around a moment later he hoisted himself up the delivery road he asked swig where does it go subsidiary access same place the jail bus enters i thought only the jail buses came in that way i was referring to people said swig only jail bus transportees come in that way so theres plenty of traffic in and out everythings scheduled and preapproved every driver is preapproved and required to show id upon demand the road is sectioned every fifty feet with gates card keys are changed every thirty days card keys said milo so if they show id they can open the gates on their own thats a big if said swig look were not here to critique our system we want to find peake i suggest you pay more attention to what about techs said milo can they use the access road absolutely not why are you harping on this and what does this orson character have to do with it shouts from the west turned our heads several fireflies enlarged searchers approaching milo hopped down off the deck again and i did the same swig contemplated a jump but remained in place by the time i was at milos side i could make out figures behind the flashlights two men running one of them was bart quan the other a uniformed guard suddenly swig was with us breathing audibly what bart we found a breach said quan western perimeter the fence has been cut halfmile walk to the spot the flap was mansized snipped neatly and put back in place wires twisted with precision it had taken a careful eye to spot it in the darkness milo said who found it the uniform with quan raised his hand young thin swarthy milo peered at his badge what led you to it officer dalfen i was scoping the western perimeter find anything else not so far milo borrowed dalfens flashlight and ran it over the fence whats on the other side dirt road said swig not much of one where does it lead into the foothills milo untwisted the wires pulled down the flap crouched and passed through tire tracks he said any gates or guards on this side its not hospital territory said swig there has to be a border somewhere whats in the foothills nothing thats the point theres no place to go for a good three four miles the county clears trees and brush every year to make sure theres no cover anyone up there would be visible by helicopter speaking of which said milo by the time the choppers had begun circling nine sheriffs cars and the crimescene vans had arrived khaki uniforms on the deputies i saw swig tense up further but he said nothing had started to isolate himself in a corner muttering from time to time into his walkietalkie two plainclothes detectives arrived last the coroner had just finished examining dollard searching his pockets empty milo conferred with the doctor the paper scrap in the staff elevator had been retrieved and bagged as a criminalist carried it past swig said looks like a piece of slipper what kind of slipper said one of the detectives a fairhaired man in his thirties named ron banks milo told him bankss partner said so all we have to do is find cinderella he was a stout man named hector de la torre older than banks with flaring mustaches banks was serious but de la torre grinned unintimidated by the setting hed greeted milo with a reminder that theyd met party over at musso and franksafter the lisa ramsey case got closed my buddy here is good pals with the d who closed it petra connor said milo shes the one banks looked embarrassed im sure he cares hector to milo so maybe he rode down in that elevator no inmates allowed said milo so theres no good reason for there to be a slipper in there and dollards key ring is missing meaning peake lifted it the rest of the techs were in a meeting so peake couldve easily ridden down to the basement found a door out and hightailed it on the other hand maybe its just a scrap that got stuck on the bottom of someones shoe no blood in the elevator said banks not a drop the only bloods what you just saw in the room clean for a throat cut coroner says it wasnt much of a cut peake nicked the carotid rather than cut it more trickle than spurt came close to not being fatal if dollard had been able to seek help right away he mightve survived looks like he went into shock collapsed lay there bleeding out no spattermost of the blood pooled under him lowpressure bleedout said banks a nick said de la torre talk about bad luck peake didnt have much muscle on him said milo enough to do the trick said de la torre so who cut the fence whered peake get tools for that good question said milo maybe dollard carried the blade he was cut with maybe one of those swiss army deals with tools though thered be no way for peake to know that unless dollard had gotten really sloppy and let him see it the alternatives obvious a partner banks said this is some bigtime premeditated deal i thought the guy was a lunatic even lunatics can have pals said milo you got that right said de la torre check out the next city council meeting banks said any ideas about who the buddy might be milo eyed swig please go down to your office and wait there sir forget it said swig as director of this facility i have jurisdiction and i need to know whats going on you will said milo soon as we know something youll be the first to find out but in the meantime in the meantime i need to be swigs protest was cut short by a beeper he and all three detectives reached for their belts banks said mine and scanned the readout a cell phone materialized and banks identified himself listened said when where wiggled his fingers at de la torre and was handed a notepad tucking the phone under his chin he wrote the rest of us watched him nod emotionless clicking off the phone he said when we got your call i told our desk to keep an eye out for any psycho crimes in the vicinity this isnt exactly in the vicinity but its pretty psycho woman found on the five near valencia he examined his notes white female approximately twentyfive to thirtyfive multiple stab wounds to torso and face really messy coroner says within the last two hours which could fit if your boy has wheels tire tracks nearby said someone did she wasnt just dumped therelots of blood its almost certain thats where she got done what kind of facial wounds said milo lips nose eyesthe guy at the scene said it was really brutal that fits right eyes said milo my god said swig was she found on the northbound five i said yes said banks everyone stared at me the road to treadway i said hes going home chapter the last bit of news deflated swig he looked small crushed a kid with a mans job milo paid him no attention spent his time on the phone talking to the highway patrol informing the sheriffs of the towns neighboring treadway warning bunker protection the private firm must have given him problems because when he got off he snapped the phone shut so hard i thought hed break it okay lets see what shakes up he told banks and de la torre to swig get me george orsons personnel file its downstairs in the records room then thats where were going the recordsroom treasures were concealed by one of the unmarked doors bordering swigs office tight space hemmed by black file cabinets the folder was right where it should have been milo examined it as the sheriffs men looked over his shoulder missing photo but george orsons physical statistics fit derrick crimmins perfectly sixthree thirtysix years old the address was the mail drop on pico near barrington no phone number what else exactly did this guy do said banks series of cons and he probably killed his dad and mom and brother swig said i cant believe this if we hired him his credentials had to be in order the state fingerprints them he has no arrest record we know of so prints dont mean much said milo taking the file and flipping pages says here he completed the psych tech course at orange coast college no point following that up who cares if he bogused his education to swig would there be any record if he actually returned his keys his files in order that means he did any irregularity is picked up by the system i know of course even if he did return them seeing as he got to take them home every day he had plenty of chances to make copies each key is clearly imprinted do not duplicate gee said de la torre that would scare me swig braced himself against the nearest file there was no reason to worry about that the risk wasnt someone breaking in why dont you look for him instead of harping why would he come back must be the ambience said milo or maybe the new airconditioning he looked up at a small grilled grate in the center of the ceiling what about the ductwork wide enough for someone to fit no no no said swig with sudden conviction absolutely not we considered that when we installed used narrow ductssix inches in diameter it caused technical problems thats why the work took so long to he stopped peakes my only concern should we keep searching any reason to stop said milo if he killed that woman on the freeway hes miles away and if he didnt fineexactlygot to go need to supervise sure said milo do your thing outside the main building the fireflies continued to dance fragmented sporadically by the downslanting beams of circling helicopters milo yelled at a guard to get us out of there he and i and the sheriffs detectives reconvened in the parking lot next to the unmarked the white coroners van was still in place as were the squad cars and a peagreen sedan that had to be banks and de la torres wheels banks said so whats the theory here this orson or whatever his real name is snuck in somehow and got peake loose whats his motive milo flourished an open palm in my direction unclear i said it may have had something to do with peakes original rampage crimmins and peake go way back its possiblenow id say probablethat crimmins was involved somehow either by directly urging peake to kill the ardullos or by doing something more subtle i described the longterm conflict between the crimminses and the ardullos described peakes prophecies money said de latorre thats part of it but theres more the root of all this is power and dominationcriminal production orson derrick crimminssees himself as an artist i think he views the massacre as his first major creative accomplishment hes been working on something called blood walk at least three people associated with the film are dead there may very well be others i think crimmins has reserved a role for peake but i cant say what it is now hes decided its time to put peake in the spotlight sounds nuts said de latorre banks looked back at the yard funny bout that hector to me so crimmins is crazy too they hired a psychotic to work here crimmins comes across as a classic psychopath i said sane but evil sometimes psychopaths fall apart but not usually fundamentally hes a losercant hold on to money cant stick with anything has had to take jobs that he considers below him on some level that enrages him he takes out his anger on others but hes fully aware of what hes doinghas been careful enough to shift identities addresses pull off one scam after another all that spells rationality rational said de la torre except he likes to kill people he stretched both wings of his mustache distorting the lower half of his face releasing the hair he allowed his lips to settle into a frown okay now peake basically youre saying he was a headcase blood freak who turned into a vegetable here because they overdosed him but for him to cooperate in the escape hed have to be significantly better put together than a summer squash you think he couldve been faking how crazy he is the guys on five do it all the time said milo and rarely succeed i said but peakes a genuine schizophrenic for him it wouldnt be a matter of eitheror itd be the intensity of his psychosis at an optimal level its possible thorazine made him more lucid clear enough to be able to cooperate in the escape crimmins could have played a role too he was a significant figure in peakes life who knows what fantasies his showing up on the ward could have stimulated the good old days said milo like some damn reunion and once crimmins got here hed have seen right away how rinkydink the system was pure fun betcha he had keys to every door within weeks we know he floated overtime on peakes ward meaning he could wear his badge drop in whenever he wanted arouse no suspicion he shook his head peake mustve seen it as salvation crimmins dominated him before knows hes passive i said slips him a knife no one bothers to check peakes room for weapons because hes been nonfunctional for sixteen years crimmins cues peake that the times right peake sneaks up on dollard cuts his throat leaves on the staff elevator dollard was a perfect target lax about the rules and if he was involved in a drug scam with crimmins that would be another reason to hit him you asked swig if dollard had access to the drug cabinet so you were thinking the same thing or maybe crimmins sneaked in and did the cutting himself showed up on the ward during the staff meeting knowing he had only dollard to contend with what drug scam said banks milo explained the theory the cars in the driveway that had bedeviled marie sinclair whats better than pharmaceutical grade dollards the inside man crimmins works the street thats why dollard got so antsy when we kept coming back idiot was afraid his little side biz would be blown he shows his anxiety to crimmins tips crimmins that he cant be counted on to stay cool and signs his own death warrant crimmins has a history of tying up loose ends and bollards starting to unravel this said banks is colorful lacking facts i embroider said milo whatever the details i said the best guess is that crimmins managed to get peake down in that elevator i think he entered the hospital grounds tonight through that cut in the fence made his way across the rear yard maybe hid in one of the annexes easy enough no one uses them coming in through the foothills wouldnt be much of a problem crimmins used to race motocross he couldve brought a dirt bike or an offroader where does your vie come in said banks the argent woman milo said she couldve come across the drug scam or found out something from peake she wasnt supposed to or she was part of the drug scam silence why said de la tone did peake start prophesying because hes still psychotic i said crimmins made the mistake of divulging what he was going to do figuring peake would keep his mouth shut dont forget peakes been mum for sixteen years about the ardullo murders but recently somethingprobably the attention claire paid himopened peake up he got more verbal started to see himself as a victima martyr when i brought up the ardullos he assumed a crucifixion pose that could make him a threat to crimmins maybe the role crimmins has hi mind for him is victim not if hes the one sliced that woman up on the ifive not necessarily i said in this case monster and victim arent mutually exclusive banks ran his hands down his lapels looked up at the helicopters one more thing said milo that fence wasnt cut tonight there was some oxidation around the edges well rehearsed i said just like any other production thats the way crimmins sees life one big show he couldve come anytime set the stage what a joke said banks place like this and they take keys home not that it matters said de la torre to milo you ever seen a maximumsecurity prison that wasnt full of dope and weapons other than my motherinlaws house cant stop inhuman nature said banks so now crimmins and peake are heading back to the hometown why the only thing i can think of is more theater a script element what i dont get is why crimmins would leave that woman on the freeway its almost as if hes directing attention to treadway so maybe hes deteriorating or im totally wrongthe escapes a oneman operation and peakes fooled everyone hes a calculating monster who craves blood is out to get it any way he can banks studied his notes youre saying the ardullo thing mightve been financial revenge why kill the kids you ruin my family i ruin yours primitive but twisted justice derrick might have planned it but at twenty he lacked the will and the stomach to carry out the massacre himself then peake entered the picture and everything clicked the village lunatic living right there on the ardullo ranch derrick and cliff started spending time with peake became his suppliers for porn dope booze glue paint psychopaths lack insight about themselves but theyre good at zeroing in on other peoples pathology so maybe derrick spotted the seeds of violence in peake put himself in a position to exploit it and it was a norisk situation if peake never acted whod ever know the brothers had prodded him even if he said something whod believe him but he did follow through and it paid off bigtime carson crimmins was able to sell his land the family got rich and moved to florida where the boys got to be playboys for a while thats one big dose of positive reinforcement thats why i called peake a major influence on crimmins crimmins didnt worry about peake blabbing back then said milo but now its different someones listening maybe claire was involved in the drug scam i said but unless we find evidence of that my bet is she died because shed learned from peake that he hadnt acted alone and she believed him believed in him because what she was really after was rinding out something redeeming about her brother symbolically symbolically said de la torre if she suspected crimmins what was she doing getting in that corvette maybe she got involved with crimmins before peake started talking crimmins held himself out as a cinematic hotshot a struggling independent filmmaker trying to plumb the depths of madness or some nonsense like that he calls his outfit thin lineas hi walking the border between sanity and insanity maybe he asked her to be a technical adviser the guy was a con i can see her falling for it something else said milo if peakes blabbing to claire hes telling her about derrick crimmins the guy she knows is george orson that made my heart stop youre right claire couldve told crimmins everything fed him the very information that signed her death warrant eye wounds said milo like the ardullo kids only he sees no one else he rubbed his face or he just likes carving peoples eyes evil evil evil said banks in a soft tight voice and no idea where to find him the helicopters skydance had shifted westward white beams sweeping the foothills and whatever lay behind them waste of fuel said de la torre hes got to be on the road chapter milo and the sheriffs did more cellphone work better suits and they might have looked like brokers on the make the end result was more nothing no sightings of peake milo looked at his watch tenfifty if any reporters are playing with the scanner this could make the news in ten minutes that could be helpful said banks maybe someonell spot him i doubt crimmins has him out hi the open i said if hes with crimmins milo said chp says the vie from the freeway was transported i thought id hit the morgue fine said banks lets exchange numbers well keep in touch yeah said milo regards to petra sure said banks coloring when i see her in the past milo had sped through the eucalyptus grove now he kept the unmarked at twenty miles per used his high beams glancing from side to side stupid he said no way theyre anywhere near here but i cant stop looking what do you call that obsessivecompulsive ritualism habit strength he laughed you could euphemize anything okay i said its canine transformation the jobs turned you into a bloodhound naw dogs have better noses okay ill drop you off forget it i said im coming with why habit strength the body lay covered on a gurney in the center of the room the night attendant was a man named lichter paunchy and grayhaired with an incongruously rich tan a highway patrol detective named whitworth had filled out the papers just missed him said lichter the bronze skin gave him the look of an actor playing a morgue man or was i just seeing hollywood everywhere whered he go said milo back to the scene lichter placed his hand on a corner of the gurney gave the sheet a tender look i was just about to find a drawer for her milo read the crimescene report gunshot wound to the back of the head if thats what it says folding the sheet back milo exposed the face what was left of it deep slashes crisscrossed the flesh shearing skin exposing bone and muscle and gristle what had been the eyes were two oversized raspberries the hair thick and light brown where the blood hadnt crusted fanned out on the steel table slender neck bloodsplashed but undamaged only the face had been brutalized the eyes the slash wounds created a crimson grid like a barbecue grilling taken to the extreme i saw freckles amid the gore and my stomach lurched oh boy said lichter looking sad hadnt looked at it yet look like a gunshot to you lichter hurried to a desk in the comer shuffled through piles of paper picked up some stapled sheets and flipped through same thing here single wound to the occipital cranium no bullet recovered yet gloving up he returned to the gurney rolled the head carefully bent and squinted ahsee a distinct ruby hole dotted the back of the skull black crust fuzzed the edges and black dots peppered the slender neck stippling said lichter im just a body mover but that means an upclose wound right he released the head carefully another sad look maybe she got shot first and then they used a knife on her more like a hatchet or a machetea thick blade right but i better not say more only the coroners have opinions whos the coroner tonight dr patel he had to run out should be back soon with some genuine wisdom he began to cover the face but milo took hold of the sheet shooting then slashing right on the side of the freeway dont quote me on anything said lichter im not allowed to speculate sounds like a good guess now all we have to do is find out who she is oh we know that said lichter they pulled prints on her right away easy the fingers were fine detective whitworth said she came right up on prtntrakhold on he ran back to the desk retrieved more papers she had a record drugs i think yup here we go hedy lynn haupt female caucasian twentysix arrested two years ago for pc thats possession of cocaine for use or sale right i know it by heart because we get lots of that in here got an address on her too milo covered the distance between them in three strides and took the papers from him hedy haupt i said leaning down for a look at the face putting my face inches from the ruined flesh smelling the coppersugar of the blood the sulfur of released gases something light floralperfume the skin that unique greengray where it wasnt bloodrusty most of the head had been turned into something unthinkable the mouth kissed by a smear of blood the upper lip split diagonally yet the overall structure remained somewhat recognizable familiar freckles across the nose and forehead the ear that hadnt been hacked to confetti an ashen seashell i peeled back the sheet plaid blouse blue jeans even in death the body retained a trim tight shape something protruded from the breast pocket of the blouse half a loop of white elastic ponytail band i think i know who this is i said milo wheeled on me i said hedy haupt heidi ott the age fits the hairs the right color the bodys the right lengthlook at the right jaw that same strong line im sure of it this is her milos face was next to mine exuding sweat and cigar residue oh man he said another cast member remember what big chet kept shouting at us i said both in group and as we walked across the yard cherchez la femme search for the woman maybe he was trying to tell us something maybe maniacs are worth listening to chapter milo wanted to examine the body closely and to go over the paperwork in detail figuring i could do without either i left bought scalding poisonous coffee from a machine and drank it out in the waiting area facing the autopsy room the coffee didnt do much for my stomach but the chill that had taken hold of my legs started to dissipate i sat there thinking about heidi executed and mutilated on the everyone associated with peake and crimmins was being discarded like garbage it stank of a special malevolence monsters no peakes moniker notwithstanding these were people it always came down to people i pictured the two of them bound together by something i was really no closer to understanding stalking severing hacking shooting crimminss production the worst kind of documentary for the sake of what how many other victims lay buried around the city crisp rapid footsteps made me look up a perfectly groomed indian in his forties passed me wordlessly and entered the autopsy room dr patel i assumed i found a pay phone called robin got the answering machine she was asleep good i told the machine id be back in a few hours not to worry i finished the coffee cooler but it still tasted like toasted cardboard sauteed in chicory gravy heidi a narcotics record that started me off in a whole new direction viewing life through a new set of glasses the door swung open and milo shot out wiping his forehead and waving a sheet of paper full of his cramped urgent handwriting bodyoutline logo at the top coroners giftshop stationery heidis home address he said lets go we headed for the elevator whered she livei said west hollywood thirteen hundred block of orange grove not far from plummer park where we met with her not far from my own damn house he stabbed the elevator button cmon cmon cmon whos in charge i said sheriff or highway patrol highway patrol on the killing itself he said i reached whitworth at the scene he said feel free to check out her house hes staying there wants to make sure they scrape whatever physical evidence they can off the road before traffic thickens up they shot her and butchered her right there on the freeway turnoff wide turnoff far enough and dark enough for cover crimmins would know the road well i said growing up in treadway but still it was risky right there in the open so theyre loosening upmaybe losing it like you said peakes massacre wasnt exactly well thought out he left goddamn bloody footprints maybe crimmins is starting to freak too i dont know crimmins is a planner the escape says hes still pretty organized he shrugged what can i tell you the elevator arrived and he threw himself in did the coroner have anything to add i said the bullets still in there hell go digging ready for me to drop you off now not a chance i said you look wiped out you re not exactly perkyfresh his laugh was short dry reluctant want some chewing gum since when do you cany i said i dont the attendantlichtergave me a pack says he started doing it for any cops who come in says hes gonna retire next year feels like spreading good cheer and fresh breath outside the morgue the air was warm thick gasolinetinged even at this hour the freeway noise hadnt abated ambulances shrieked in and out of county general derelicts and deadeyes walked the street along with a few whitecoated citizens who didnt look much better off above us on the overpass cars blipped and dopplered a few miles north the interstate was quiet enough to serve as a killing ground i imagined the car pulling abruptly to the sidenot the yellow corvette something large enough to seat three crimmins and peake and heidi riding along a captive or a passenger the dope conviction i thought of the meeting at plummer park my roommates sleeping or i wouldve had you come to myplace would a live roommate be waiting for us at the orange grove address or my mind flashed back to the freeway kill heidi out of the car surprised asking crimmins what was up or immobilizedbound gaggedand terrified crimmins and peake haul her out shes a strong girl but they control her easily they walk her as far as they can from the freeway to the edge of the turnoff everyone swallowed by darkness now last words or not either way pop a searing burst of light and pain what was the last thing shed heard a truck whizzing by the wind the racing of her pulse they let her fall then crimmins gives a signal and peake steps forward blade in hand summoned camera action cut my guts pogoed as i got in the unmarked wanting to sort it all out to make sense of it before i said anything to milo he started up the engine sped through the morgue lot and turned left on mission we roared off orange grove showed no signs of ever having hosted citrus trees just another la street full of small undistinguished houses the house we came to see was hidden behind an untrimmed ficus hedge but the green wall didnt extend to the asphalt driveway and we had a clear view all the way to the garage no vehicles in sight milo drove a hundred feet down and we returned on foot i waited by the curb as he made his way up the asphalt gun in hand back to the garage around the rear of the woodsided bungalow even in the darkness i could see scars on the paint the color was hard to make out probably some version of beige between the house and the ficus barrier was a stingy square of dead lawn sagging front porch no shrubbery other than the hedge milo came back gun still out breathing hard looks empty the back doors mickey mouse im going in stay there till i tell you another five minutes ten twelve as i watched his penlight bounce around behind shaded windows a single firefly finally the front door opened and he waved me inside hed gloved up i followed as he turned a few lights on exposing a poverty of space first wedid an overall check of the house five small shabby rooms including a dingy lavatory grimy yellow walls the window shades crazed gray oilcloth patched in spots by duct tape colorless rental furniture where the space allowed the bungalow was filled with crisplooking cardboard boxes most of them sealed printed labels on the outside this side up fragile scores of cartons of tvs stereos video gear cameras pcs cassettes compact discs computer discs glassware silverware small appliances stacks of video cartridges and fuji film enough film to shoot a thousand birthday parties in a corner of the larger bedroom squeezed next to an unmade queensize mattress stood a pile of smaller boxes the labels claimed sony minirecorders just like the one heidi had used to tape peake the movie stuffs out in the garage said milo dollies booms spotlights crap i couldnt identify tons of it piled almost to the ceiling didnt see any saws but they could be buried under all the gear itll take a crew to go through it she was in on it i said hed moved into the bathroom didnt answer i heard drawers opening went over to see him remove something from the cabinet beneath the sink glossy white shoe box several more just like it stacked next to the pipes he lifted the lid rows of white plastic bottles nesting in styrofoam beds he extracted one phenobarbital all the other bottles in that box were labeled identically the next box yielded an assortment and so did all the others chlorpromazine thioridazine haloperidol clozapine diazepam alprazolam lithium carbonate candy sampler for a junkie said milo uppers downers allarounders he inspected the bottom of the box starkweather stamps still on here uncut pharmaceuticals i said it ups the price then i thought of something milo was looking the other way but i must have made a sound because he said what i shouldve figured it out a long time ago the missing dog buddy he was sticking in my head because ive seen him before that day in the park a tall man in black came by walking a rottweiler mix passed right by where we were sitting with heidi heidi was aware of him she watched him he was her roommate the one shed claimed was sleeping their little joke they were playing with us right from the beginning so much for powers of observation lot of good it does us now hey he said recording the drug inventory in his notepad im the socalled detective and i never noticed the dog crimmins stole him from mrs leiber taking what he wanted because he could for him its all about power he stopped writing no sign of any dog here he said no food or bowl anywhere in the house exactly heidi he said suddenly sounding tired it casts a whole new light on her story i said peakes prophecy peakes supposed prophecy his hand tightened around his pen he stared at me another scam has to be the only evidence we ever had was heidis account bad eyes in a box choo choo bang bang the tape too i said i led him back to the larger bedroom pointed at the stack of sonys the tape was nothing but mumbles unrecognizable mumbles couldve been anyone but we know who it was crimmins dubbing the soundtrack i said george welles orson like i said hes an auteur produces directs acts he cursed violently he murdered claire i went on then set peake up as a phony oracle to spice up his story linewho knows maybe he thought hed be able to use it one day write a screenplay sell it to hollywood we took it seriouslygreat fun once again hes screwed the law just like he did back in florida and nevada and treadway so when he eliminated the beatty brothers he did it again used heidi again once again no risk nothing he does with peake bears any risk no ones heard peake talk in almost two decadeswhos to say its not his voice on the tape the first time we met heidi she let us know she was going to quit the hospital that allowed her to do you a favor by sticking around gave her instant credibilitypersonally invited by the police from that point no one was going to suspect anything she did with peake except maybe chet cherchez la femme i said maybe chet noticed somethingsomething off about heidi maybe the way she related to peake or he saw her steal dope from the nursing station or get a little handoff from dollard but once again whod pay attention to his ramblings heidi was free to continue as crimminss inside woman she was there in the first place because crimmins wanted hershe joined the staff right after he left he gave her multiple assignments work with dollard to keep the drugs flowing make sure dollard didnt rip them off and attach herself to claire so she could report back what claire was saying about peake because he had to have discussed peake with claire that was the basis of their relationship cherchez la femme he said the guy collects them he looked around at the piles of contraband heidi traveling with him and peake tonight probably means she was in on the escape her being the inside woman would smooth the escape wouldnt it yesterday the last time we ran into her she was walking peake right near that service elevator dry run for tonight has to be she and crimmins needed to rehearse because whatever the state of peakes psyche hed been cooped up for sixteen years was unpredictable its also possible the timetable for the escape was sped up because you were getting too close that same day you asked heidi if peake had mentioned warks name and she hesitated for a second probably shocked that youd gotten on to the alias but she stayed cool said it was a funny name didnt really sound like a name edging us away from wark and diverting our attention to dollard by letting us know hed been fired for malfeasance because dollard had become a liability hed always been the expendable member of the dope scam crimmins and heidi came up with a killtwobirds plan get rid of dollard and break peake loose something else right after heidi told us about dollard she returned the conversation to wark started asking questions who was he was he actually peakes friend why would she care she was trying to find out exactly what we knew and we didnt notice because we saw her as an ally actress he said calm under pressurea very cold young woman the moment we were gone she was probably on the phone to crimmins informing him you were on to his alter ego he decided to act cool head he said lot of good it did her head cool but also reckless i said a coke conviction didnt stop her from stealing dope at starkweather flirting with danger was also behind her attraction to crimmins she told us she was a thrill seeker rock climbing skydiving off power stationsmaking sure to let you know that was illegal think of it telling a cop shed committed a crime smiling about it another little game getting off on clanger is probably also the way she hooked up with crimmins in the first place castro told us derrick and brother cliff were thrill chasers liked speed derrick and heidi probably met at some kind of daredevil club going for the adrenaline rush he said then it gets old so they move on to a different kind of high crimminss crimes have a profit motive but ive been saying all along that thrills the main ingredient crimminss thing is creating a twisted world and controlling it he scripts the action casts the players moves them around like pawns gets rid of them once theyve finished their scenes for a psychopath it would be pretty damn close to heaven heidi had similar motivations but she wasnt in crimminss league it was a fun ride for her but her mistake was thinking of herself as a partner when she was just another extra she must have been confused when crimmins pulled off the ifive and told her to get out i didnt feel like laughing but there i was doing it what he said just thought of something if crimmins had been lucky enough to really break into hollywood maybe none of this wouldve happened he took in the room and i followed his eyes cramped dingy nothing on the walls for heidi and crimmins interior decorating had meant something else completely cruel puzzles bloody scenes embroidery of the mind let me sort out the escape he said very softly double entry to starkweather crimmins enters the grounds from the back through that hole in the fence heidi drives right in through the front gate like she would any other night she waltzes right on to c ward heads over to peakes room gets him ready all the techs are at the weekly meeting except dollard whos patrolling heidi lures dollard into peakes roomno big challenge all she has to do is tell him peake is sick or freaking outassuming the jesus pose again dollard goes in locks the door behind himbasic procedure goes over to check on peake maybe peake jumps him maybe not in either case heidi gets dollard and cuts his throat or she distracts dollard and peake does the cutting she makes sure the coast is clear hustles peake over to the staff elevator no floor guide to tell anyone where its going down to the basement over and out and crimmins hiding in one of the annexes or nearby meets up with them i said heidi and crimmins lead peake out the back fence heidi returns and leaves the hospital the way she came in through the front while crimmins and peake escape into the foothills where theyve got a vehicle waiting that can handle the terrain peakes not in great condition but crimmins is a climber already knows the hills it wouldnt be a problem dragging peake along heidi as dollards cutter would also explain why the artery was only nicked not slashed clear through she was a strong girl without much of a conscience but if shed never actually cut anyones throat before her inexperience couldve showed it takes will to saw through someones neck and theres the gush factor she wouldve wanted to avoid getting bloodstained had to coordinate cutting and stepping back in timei can see cfimmins rehearsing her so she wounded dollard just deeply enough to open the jugular dollard collapsed so she thought shed finished him off he went into shock lay there draining once again they were luckyno one found him soon enough to save him crimmins seems to have lots of luck no sin unrewarded i said thats why he keeps doing bad things the nick could also mean peake did it he said atrophied muscles from all those years in the loony bin not if he chopped up heidis face those gashes took force what do you figure a hatchet patel said that or some kind of cleaver yeah youre probably right heidi cut dollard and peake cut heidi her murdering dollard would serve another purpose no need to hide a weapon in peakes room risk discovery techs carry you just proved that he pulled out his phone called ron banks told him about the drugs and the stolen goods heidis involvement yeah looks like she was listen im gonna snoop around her house some more but its west hollywood so you might as well get some of your guys over here to tape it off tell em im here what i look like so theres no misunderstandings thanks anything new over there yeah sometimes the job is boringyeah i think i will chippies still over there whitworth michael whitworth milo started to search in earnest the bedroom closet held blue jeans blouses and jackets in womens small and medium sizes and mens black jeans waist length black xl tshirts sweaters and shirts home sweet home he said shining his light on the floor three plastic cartons full of rumpled underwear and socks sat next to a jumble of battered running shoes and several pairs of thicksoled dirtylooking boots in the corner were four olivedrab packages the size of seat cushions festooned with straps us army stencil next to them scuba gear a single set of skis a box of amyl nitratepoppers another box full of polyester hair four womans wigs long and blond short spiky and blond raven black tomato red and curly three male toupees all black two curly one straight labels inside from a theatrical makeup store on hollywood boulevard toys said milo when you were over at fairway ranch see any good climbing spots the entire development is backed by the tehachapi mountains but a short walk through foothills is one thing serious climbings another crimmins would be limited by peakes condition even if peakes vegetable acts a fake hes no edmund hillary also if crimmins has returned to treadway its because it has psychological meaning for him so maybe hell stick close to home what kind of psychological meaning something to do with the massacremaybe hes reworking it for his movie rescriptingrelivinga major triumph back when he lived there treadway was essentially divided between the ardullo and the crimmins ranches wanda hatzler told me the mexican girl derrick and cliff threw out of their car ran toward the ardullo property on the north side that could narrow things down but which way would he go to the ardullo side because thats where the massacre went down or to his daddys place dont know i said maybe none of the above whats there now where the ranches were homes recreational facilities a lake big homes he said something that might remind crimmins of the ardullo place i didnt get that close a look its an upscale development whether or not that will trigger anything in crimminss head i cant say any obvious place to hide out its pretty open i said two golf courses the lake if they break into someones home therell be plenty of cover but even if crimmins is loosening up mentally that seems downright stupid maybe outside the development somewhere at the base of the tehachapis if derrick climbed as a kid he could have a special hiding place milo got back on the phone called bunker protection once again his side of the conversation was tense idiot rentacops no sign of any disturbance no disreputables have driven through tonight yawn yawn okay let me toss the rest of this palace the second bedroom the space where heidi and derrick crimmins had slept was narrow also devoid of personal touches with barely enough space for the queensize mattress and two cheap nightstands in the top drawer of the stand on the right were a halfempty box of tampons three goldwrapped godiva chocolates two energy bars a baggie of marijuana the bottom compartment held womans underwear an empty evian bottle some white powder in a glassine envelope the didnt make much of an impression i said first offenseshe probably got probation if that more fuel for her confidence coke and poppers wouldve helped too he checked under the mattress in the pillowcases moved around to crimminss nightstand pack of kools two foilwrapped condoms two matchbooks and a thin red paperback book entitled finding fame and fortune in hollywood writing your screenplay by the editors of the fame and fortune series the publisher was an outfit called hero press fob address in lancaster california the flyleaf said others in the series included buying real estate with nothing down options and commodities trading with nothing down start your own business with nothing down and live to the herbal way to longevity the scammer finally gets scammed said milo kneeling in front of the lower compartment inside was a black vinyl looseleaf he pulled it out turned to the title page typed at the top was blood walk a treatment for a major motion picture by d griffith crimmins president and ceo dgc productions thin line productions enterpeneur director producer and cinematographer the next page soiled and smudged bore several upslanting lines written in ballpoint curious sharpedged

florida i said reads like a twelveyearolds diarylook at the third alternative title daredevil avengerjustice for all superman fantasies he sees himself as a risk taker is thinking of himself as the hero who saves the world from peake milo shook his head number elevens the one he actually used for the name of his companywhos to say whos nuts asshole i say and you are he turned to the next page blank guess he ran out of ideas he said this kind of brilliance he definitely couldve gotten a legit job at the studios the light changed in the room something yellowing the window shades headlights a car idling next to the house in the driveway i thought of marie sinclair cranky and paranoid pays to listen to everyone milo moved quickly killing the room lights replacing the looseleaf pulling out his gun the headlights dimmed the engine dieseled for several seconds before quieting the whooshandclick of the car door closing footsteps scraping the driveway diminishing footsteps milo raced through the house made it to the front door said something to me stay put he explained later but i never processed it and i stayed on his heels he cracked the door looked outside flung it open ran in the driveway sat a lemonyellow corvette we ran past the ficus hedge a man was fifty feet up the street to the north walking casually arms swinging tall man thin a toobig headmuch too big some kind

penlight and tossed it to me shine it on his facelift up your face before the man could respond milo grabbed a handful of hair and helped him along the man gasped in pain i moved around in front and aimed the beam at his face thin face framed by long blond hair he had hat head from the watch cap that lay a few feet away on the pavement a few lights went on in neighboring houses but the street

both of us man we hang together but suzy dont hold no money im more responsible the deputies finally arrived milo let them take custody of soames and he and i hurried to the unmarked he pulled away fast sped north two cars means two drivers i said before the escape crimmins and heidi arranged a meet somewhere in hollywood but crimmins knew heidi wouldnt live out the evening and with her out of the way he needed someone to drive the second car most hollywood streets have parking regulations he couldnt risk a ticket also the vettes conspicuous why would he trust an idiot like soames to transport it the idiot followed through didnt he like i said crimmins is good at reading people or maybe he didnt care was finished with the vette just like that he walks away from a car and why would he be finished with it because tonight marks a new stage in his life i said and moneys not his thing it never was the moment he has any he lets it slip through his fingers he grew up with fast toys easy come easy go easy to replace too he steals movie equipment boosting another cars no big deal the jeeps not registered under any of the names we know about either for all we know hes got a fleet stashed somewhere supercriminal daredevil avenger lets face it milo you dont have to be a genius to get away with felonies in la he growled raced to sunset turned right i closed my eyes and sat back knowing exactly where he was headed moments later i felt the car swerve opened my eyes to see a freeway signpost the north very little traffic this late and the i interchange was only minutes away he pushed the unmarked up to ninety a hundred susanna galvez he said that hatzler woman told you derrick and his brother had a thing for mexican girls nostalgia i said exactly this whole things about reliving the good old days chapter the spot where heidi ott had been executed wasnt hard to find the rosy incandescence of highway patrol flares was visible half a mile away starbursts fallen to the horizon as we got closer a tapering row of red cones cordoned off the righthand lane milo drove between them showed his badge to a uniformed officer received a wary appraisal two chp cruisers a chp bike and a sleek nonregulation harleydavidson were parked on the turnoff the officer said okay mike whitworth there a thumb indicated a huge man in his thirties standing near an embankment several arc lights cast focused glare on a tapedoff area the white body outline was at the far edge of the turnoff inches from the merging of asphalt and dirt embankment fullscale version of the morgue giftshop logo life imitates art whitworth stood just outside the cones young and in good shape but he looked tired his ruddy babyface was centered by a small blond mustache his hair was buzzed so short the color was hard to determine he wore a peanutbuttercolored leather jacket white shirt dark tie gray slacks and black boots and he carried a motorcycle helmet milo introduced himself whitworth shook his hand then mine he pointed at the ground several ruby blotches the largest over a foot wide we found some bone bits and cartilage too probably part of her nose bone we get gore all the time plenty of bad stuff in garbage bags but this kind of damage he shook his head milo said i think the guys who did her are about to do another one he gave whitworth a breakneck account of derek crimminss history peakes escape heidis possible involvement ended with christopher soamess account the recruitment of suzy galvez out in the tehachapis said whitworth best guess the tehachapis behind his hometown its a place called fairway ranch now know it never heard of it said whitworth i live in altadena do most of my work closer to the city before grapevine or past right there i said crimmins probably has some climbing experience said milo but peake doesnt and if theyve got the girl with them its not gonna be any everest thing they could even be right on the developmentcommandeering someones house the private cops who patrol fairway say no but that doesnt convince me if they are in the mountains im figuring right at the base maybe some kind of sheltered spota cave an outcropping either way weve got to take a look whore the private cops and whats their problem said whitworth bunker protection out of chicago every time i try to convince them theres something to worry about they dont wanna know keep handing me this public relations crap nothing ever goes wrong here till it does said whitworth massaging his belt buckle okay lets get going i dont know about the jurisdictional aspect but to hell with all that he glanced back at the body outline were just about wrapped up so i can get you these four troopers right now call for more with etas of less than half an hour im on my bikei was going off duty when the call came in ill ride solo meet you there if the bunker yahoos give you a hard time well bulkintimidate them what about choppers milo turned to me what do you think would noise and lights stop him or egg him on depends whats in the script i said the script said whitworth hes following some sort of story line in terms of how hell react to a direct threat the problem is we dont know enough about his arousal level to predict safely arousal this is a sex thing his general physiological state i said psychopaths tend to function at a quieter level than the rest of uslow pulse rates and skin conductance high pain thresholds except when tension builds up then they can be extremely explosive if we confront crimmins when hes still relatively calmscheming planning taking controlits possible hell fold his tents and run or just give up but if we catch him at a peak moment he might just go for the big ending pull a koresh said whitworth how olds that girl fourteen course theres nothing to say he hasnt already done her milo said put the choppers on standby get me two three more cars along the same lines we drive into fairway quietly no lights no sirens to me where do the bunker people hang out theres a guardhouse right past the entrance okay he said to whitworth meet you at the main entrance alex give him directions youre the only one whos actually been there chapter the men in the powderblue shirts werent happy three guards surprised as they sat in the mockspanish guardhouse soft music on stereo the shirts freshly pressed neat clean building outside and in cozy interior spotless kitchenette oak table set with four matching chairs blue hats on a rack on the table were the remains of takeout mexican food taco fiesta valencia address next to a halfeaten burrito a trivial pursuit board three little plastic pies blue orange brown the last halffilled with tiny plastic wedges the door had been unlocked when milo and mike whitworth and i entered all three guards had stood up grabbed for guns that werent there across the room a metal locker said weapon depository next to it was a plaque with the crossedrifles logo of bunker protection now we were all outside in the peachscented air under a sky surprisingly deprived of stars the bunker guards kept their eyes on the chp cruisers that blocked the entrance to fairway ranch inside the cars the barest outline of men behind nightdarkened windshields as wed driven in milo had eyed the low white fence muttered no gate they couldve cruised right in moments later mike whitworth coasted up on his harley and said something to the same effect so you havent searched yet milo said to the tallest guard e cliff the one whod protested loudest until milo hushed him with a scolding index finger no he said its past two in the morning were not going to wake up the residents no reason to youd know if there was a reason said whitworth absolutely said cliff adding a barked sir whitworth stepped closer to him using his size the way milo does the way youre set up anyone could get inis it ed cliff tried to smile as he backed away eugene not correct anyone entering can be spotted from the guardhouse assuming the drapes are open cliffs head jerked toward the building they usually are milo said im usually charming he moved in on cliff too so tell me what category would two murderers driving right past you fall into sports and leisure arts and entertainment sir said cliff theres no reason to get disrespectful even with the drapes closed we see headlights assuming there were headlightsi know there usually are theres no reason milo stepped closer cliff was over six feet but reedy an elk confronting bears he looked at the other two bunker guards both just stood there milo said theres every reason to search the premises friend and were going to do it right now im sorry sir in terms of your jurisdiction cliff began milos nose moved a halfinch from his and the voice tapered at the least ill have to clear it with headquarters milo smiled in minneapolis chicago said one of the other guards nasal voice l bonaface call said milo meanwhile we start give me a map of this place there isnt one said cliff none at all not a real map with coordinates just a general layout jesus said milo this isnt arctic exploration hand it over before you call cliff looked at bonaface go get it for him bonaface went inside the guardhouse and returned with several sheets of paper i brought a bunch he said milo grabbed the maps and distributed them a single page of crude computergenerated diagram english street names printed in gothic the shops and golf courses reflection lake dead center no indication a mountain range loomed to the east whitworth said except for the golf courses its a small areathats in our favor already divided into six zones and ive got five officers plus me hows that for karma karmas for believers said milo but yeah do the golf courses first then the public buildings and the lake then doortodoor at each residence prioritize any place with anything jeeplike parked nearby if the vehicles got any film equipment in the back get really careful if were right about crimmins trying to film something there may be telltale lights i said in his notes he debated learning how to use the film cameras or sticking with video hes not one for honest labor so ill bet on video that means he may just be using a handheld cam keeping it very lowkey also i doubt hed be on either of the golf courses too open assuming hes even here said cliff im assuming youve got golf carts whitworth told him sure but theyre the property of law enforcement whitworth turned to milo youre doing the mountains if i can get out there well stay in radio contact howre you going to travel got a fourwheeler milo asked cliff the guard didnt answer hard of hearing eugene we have basically one samurai over behind the golf shop with the carts its a relief vehicle just in case in case of what in case we have to go out back like an old person getting lost but thats never happened yet we dont use it i cant even say if the tires have air or if its gassed up so youll inflate and siphon said milo bring it over cliff didnt respond milo bared his teeth pretty please eugene cliff snapped go at bonaface again bonaface hurried away milo asked whitworth the helicopters estimated time of arrival i could only get one said whitworth theyre holding it at bakersfieldfive ten minutes eugene is there a road leading from fairway out to the mountains not much of one how much of one cliff shrugged its maybe a quartermile long it was supposed to be for hiking but none of the residents hike it goes nowhere just ends and then all youve got is dirt and rocks he gave a small smirk decided to hide it by covering his mouth with his hand whitworth drew milo and me away from him the ott girl was shot so theyve got some kind of firepower we have vests how about you one said milo he looked at me none for you sit this out love to i said but youd better consider using me its a hostage situation with two hostage takers each with a different psychological makeup in both cases poorly understood im as close to an expert on peake and crimmins as youre going to get makes sense said whitworth i think weve got an extra vest milo shot him a sharp look whitworth said not that i want to tell you how to ive been through worse i said knowing what was going on in milos mind an undercover situation last year had gone very bad he blamed himself i kept telling him i was fine the worst thing he could do for me was treat me like an invalid robin will kill me he said only if i get scratched right now its suzy galvez whos got something at stake he looked up at the sky out past the development at high black unknowable mountains fine he finally said if theres a vest whitworth trotted over to one of the cruisers returned with a bulky black package i slipped the vest on scaled for someone milos size it felt like a giant bib stylish said milo okay lets get going one place you might check right away i told whitworth is sheriff haass trailer jacob and marvelle haas he arrested peake for the original massacre is a major link to the past he lives here right over in jersey i pointed south charing cross road whitworth said to eugene cliff get me the exact addressno take me there personally cliff jabbed his own chest what about me no protection whitworth looked ready to pound him into the ground take me within fifty yards and scram all of a sudden i work foryow whitworths arm shot up and for a second i thought hed hit cliff cliff believed it too he recoiled raised his own arm protectively whitworths arm kept going smoothing his buzz cut he jogged to his bike pulled another vest out of the storage box and slipped it on cliffs mouth was still trembling he forced it back into smirk mode bigtime swat attack you find this funny said milo i find it a waste of time and im calling chicago now he took a step waited for debate got none and walked away the remaining guard followed ten steps later cliff stopped and looked back remember these are seniors try not to give anyone a heart attack they pay a lot to live here and look where it gets them said milo just a little mindless violence and gracious living bites the dust the samurai was openroofed powder blue and noisy an aftermarket roll bar arced over the front seats bonaface left the motor chugging and got out its got half a tank but hell if id use it out there makes a shitload of noise and your lightsll be spotted a mile away milo checked the tires those are okay said bonaface he had a smooth pink face blond hair monkey features big blue eyes wouldnt use that buggy out there too easy to spot milo straightened you know the area not this exact area grew up in piru but out to the mountains its the same thing all over full of rocks and pits plenty of shit to tear up the undercarriage any caves at the base of the mountains never been out there but why not so who are these guys and why would they be here its a long story said milo getting behind the wheel and adjusting the drivers seat i climbed in next to him bonaface looked miffed youre using headlights he turned at the sound of his name cliff barking from the doorway of the guardhouse asshole muttered bonaface he stared at the vest smiled at me that things way too big for you chapter we drove through the center of the development passing the gentle swell of balmoral the northern golf course behind twelvefoot chain link moving slowly while trying to keep the samurai as quiet as possible tricky because low gear was the loudest i could hear the low hum of the golf carts but the vehicles were invisible except for an occasional suggestion of shadows shifting on the green headlights off same for the samurai the victorian streetlights glowed a strange muddy tangerine color barely rescuing us from depthless black we reached the end of the road the pepper trees that rimmed reflection lake the growth here was luxuriant fed by moist earth miserly light from a distant quartermoon turned the foliage into gray lace in the empty spaces the water was still and black and glossy a giant sunglass lens milo stopped told me to stay put took his ninemillimeter in one hand and his flashlight in the other and climbed out he walked to the trees looked around parted a branch and peered through finally disappeared into the gray fringe i sat there absently rubbing one thumb against the warm wooden stock of the rifle hed placed in my lap no animal sounds no air movement the place felt vacuum sealed maybe another time id have found it peaceful tonight it seemed dead i was alone for what seemed like a long time then scraping sounds from behind the trees tightened my throat before i could move milo emerged bolstering his gun if anyones out there i cant see them he looked at the rifle unconsciously id raised the weapon and pointed it in his direction i relaxed my hands the rifle sank he got behind the wheel when we were rolling again he said its pretty open once you get past the trees just some reeds and other low stuff on the other side no jeep or any other car in sight no ones filming grim smile unless its an underwater shootnew twist on creature from the black lagoon for all we know theyve already been here and gone did what they wanted to do dumped the girl in the water or they never came here in the first place i think they did i said no other reason to kill heidi on the route that leads straight up to fairway and crimmins paid the soames kid to take the corvette homejust a mile or two from hollywood if he was in the city he could ve driven the jeep home himself walked back in half an hour and gotten the vette why bother with soames unless he was planning to be far away because he has plans for soames nice little screen test that too tomorrow morning but thered be no reason to entrust him with the car whyd he kill heidi because he had no more use for her i said and because he could he chewed his lip squinted lowered his speed to ten miles per the map had indicated a service road that hugged the southern end of the white oak golf course and led to the rear of the development the streetlamps were less frequent now visibility reduced to maddeningly subtle shades of gray milo missed the road and we found ourselves at the sign marking the entrance to jersey lights out in all the mobile homes i remembered the street bisecting the subdivision as freshly asphalted in the darkness it stretched empty and smooth so perfectly drafted it appeared computer generated resumption of the tangerine light deep orange on black every night was halloween this is where haas lives he said first street to the right i can show you the trailer he cruised past the trailers up there is parking for visitors i said no visitors tonight theres charing cross haass place is four units in look for a cement porch a buick skylark and a datsun truck he stopped two houses away only the truck was parked in front backed by mike whitworths harley lights out no sign of whitworth and i saw milos face tighten up then the highway patrol man came out from behind the trailer and headed for the bike milo stagewhispered mike its milo whitworth stopped turned toward us focused came over in the neighborhood said milo so we dropped by if whitworth was offended by being secondguessed he didnt show it no one home nothing funny i spotted some unopened mail on the tablea days worth maybe two one of their cars is gone i said they have family in bakersfield probably traveling you see any justification for breaking in said whitworth milo shook his head im not comfortable with it either okay let me go see if any of my guys hit a hole in one you ready for the mountains yet on our way said milo whitworth looked out at the black peaks barely discernible against the onyx sky country skies were supposed to be crammed with stars why not tonight must be pretty during the day said whitworth kickstarting the harley sure you want to go it alone id better said milo gonna be hard enough to avoid being spotted with one vehicle he brandished his cell phone ill keep in touch whitworth nodded took another glance at the tehachapis keeping his engine low he rolled away turning the samurai around milo drove back through jersey lights went on in one of the mobiles as we passed but so far wed avoided attracting undue attention milo coasted without gas looking for the service strip almost missing it again unmarked just a carwide break in the peppers topped by arcing branches letting the samurai idle milo got out and shined his light on the ground hardpack maybe degraded granite tire tracks someones been here recently hell if i know jeb the tracker i aint he got back in and turned onto the road the passage was unlit and lined on the north side by more chain link on the south by a high berm planted with what looked and smelled like oleander the samurai traveled well below the berm level as if we were tunneling the fourbyfour rode rough every irregularity in the road vibrating through the stiff frame milos head bouncing perilously close to the roll bar nothing changed for the next halfmile more chain link and shrubbery then the road ended without warning and we were faced with the sudden shock of open space as if tumbling out of a chute no more gray just black i saw nothing through the windshield wondered how milo could navigate he began wrestling with the wheel pebble spray snaredrummed against the undercarriage followed by deeper sounds hollow like hoofbeats larger rocks the samurai began swaying from side to side seeking purchase on the grit beneath the floorboard the chassis twanged the next dip slammed milos head against the bar he cursed and braked you okay i said he rubbed his crown if i had a brain in here i might be in trouble what the hell am i doing i cant drive like this visibilitys zilch we hit a big enough rock this thing flips and we break our goddamn necks locking the parking brake he stood on the seat and stared over the windshield nothing he said whole lot of nothing i took the flashlight got out faced away from the mountains cupped my hand over the lens and tried to examine the ground with the resultant muffled light dry compacted soil inlaid with sharpedged stones and desiccated plants matted flat and embroidered by chevronshaped corrugations the tracks are still going he got down beside me yeah maybe someone went offroading that wild of california lifestyle he laughed very softly theyre supposed to be the crazy ones but they probably did it with headlights or at least low beams meanwhile i blind myself and even without lights were vulnerable all the empty space this things probably audible clear to the mountains standing he squinted at the tehachapis how far does that look to you two miles i said maybe three youre saying its time to go it on foot i dont see any choice if youre up for it that isscratch that stupid question of course youre up for it youre the one who thinks running is fun he tried to call whitworth got no connection walked a hundred feet back tried again same result switching off the phone he put it in his pocket along with the car keys the flashlight went into another pocket he took the rifle gave me the ninemillimeter handing a civilian my gun he shook his head not just any civilian i said even worse okay let me get rid of this thing he yanked off his tie and tossed it in the car and this in went his jacket mine too we began walking trying to follow the tracks moving on leathersoled shoes illequipped for the task nothing to guide us but the hint of the crisp peaks id seen during my daytime visit the quartermoon looked sickly degraded a childs rendering erased here and there to tissuepaper consistency set high and well behind the mountains the filmy crescent appeared to be fleeing the galaxy what little light filtered down to earth offered no wisdom about anything below the mountaintops the lack of spatial cues made it feel as if wed entered a huge dark room as big as the world every step was tinged by the threat of vertigo reduced to stiff small movements i edged forward feeling the rocks rolling under my shoes larger sharper fragments caught on the leather like tiny parasites attempting to burrow through as the stones grew progressively larger contact became painful i got past the discomfort but remained unable to orient myself clumsy with indecision i stumbled a few times came close to falling but managed to use my arms for balance several feet in front of me milo encumbered by the rifle had it worse i couldnt see him but i heard him breathing hard every so often the exhalations choked off only to resume harsher faster like a labored heart making up for skipped beats ten more minutes seemed to bring us no closer no lights up ahead nothing up ahead but walls of rock and i started to feel id been wrong about crimmins returning to the scene a fourteenyearold in his grasp and we were babystepping toward nothing what else was there to do but continue three times we paused to risk a quick cupped flashlighting of the path the tracks endured and immense boulders started appearing sunk deeply into the ground like fallen meteorites but no rocks directly in front of us so far this was a wellused clearing we kept moving at a pitiful pace shuffling like old men enduring the loss of orientation in angry silence finally the moonlight obliged a bit more revealing folds and corrugations in the granite but i still couldnt see two feet in front of me and each step remained constricted tension coursing up my tailbone finally i got a handle on walking by pretending i was weightless and able to float through the night milos breath kept cutting off and rasping i got closer behind him ready to catch him if he fell another hundred yards two hundred the peaks enlarged with a suddenness that shook me as if id taken my eyes off the road and were headed for collision i reassessed the distance between fairways eastern border and the tehachapis less than two miles maybe a mile and a half in daylight nothing more than a relaxed nature stroll i was sweating and breathing hard my hamstrings felt tight as piano wire and my shoulders throbbed from the odd stooped posture that maintaining balance had imposed on me milo stopped again waited till i was at his side see anything nothing sorry what are you apologizing for my theory better than anything else weve got im just trying to figure out what we do if we get there and its still nothing head straight back or trail along the mountains just in case they dumped a body i didnt answer my shoes are full of rocks he said let me shake them out a few thousand baby steps now the mountains were no more than a halfmile away reducing the sky to a sliver dominating my field of vision the contours along the rock walls picked up clarity and i could see striations wrinkles dark gray on darker gray against black now something else a tiny white pinpoint fifty sixty feet to the left of the track i stopped squinted for focus gone had i imagined it milo hadnt seen it his footsteps continued slow and steady i walked some more a few moments later i saw it again a white disc bouncing against the rock widening from sphere to oval paling from milk white to gray to black then disappearing an eye the eye milo stopped i caught up with him the two of us stood there searching the mountainside waiting watching the disc appeared again bouncing retreating i whispered camera maybe shes still alive i wanted to run forward and he knew it placing a hand on my shoulder he whispered softly but very quickly we still dont know what it means cant give ourselves away backup would be great one last try to reach whitworth any closer and its too risky out came the phone he punched numbers shook his head turned off the machine okay slow and quiet even if it feels like well never get there if you need to tell me something tap my shoulder but dont talk unless its an emergency onward the disc reappeared vanished circling the same spot to the left focused on what i yearned to know didnt want to know i stayed close behind milo matching my steps to his our footfalls seemed louder much too loud walking hurt and silence fed the pain the world was silent silent movie images flooded my head herkyjerky action corseted women men with walrus mustaches mugging outrageously over a plinketymanic piano score whitelettered captions framed ornately so its carving you want sir ill show you carving stop stupid keep focused fifty yards from the mountain forty thirty twenty milo stopped pointed the white disc had appeared again this time with a taila big white sperm sliding along the rock wriggling away still no sounds we reached the mountain cold rock fringed with low dry shrubs larger stones holding the rifle in front of him milo began edging to the left the ninemillimeter was heavy in my hand the disc materialized overhead white and creamy bouncing lingering bouncing gone now a sound low insistent flash whir click on off no human struggle no voices just the mechanics of work we moved along the mountain undetected got to within twenty yards before i saw it a high ragged rock formationan outcropping of sharpedged boulders sprouting like stalagmites from the base of the parent range clumped and overlapping ten to fifteen feet high pushed out twenty feet natural shield outdoor studio the sound of the camera grew louder we crept closer hugging the rock new sounds low unintelligible speech milo stopped pointed hooked his arm indicating the far end of the boulders the wall had acquired convexity continuing in a smooth unbroken semicircle no breaks in sight meaning entry had to be at the far north he pointed again and we edged forward inch by inch bracing ourselves with palms against the rock the wall curved radically killing visibility transforming every step into a leap of faith twelve steps milo stopped again something jutted out from the rock square bulky metallic rear end of a vehicle from the other side of the graniteflash whir mumbles laughter we edged to the vehicles rear tires squatted swallowed breath chrome letters ford explorer black or dark blue sand spray streaked the rear fender no license plate a partially shredded bumper sticker commanded engage in random acts of kindness onethird of the vehicle extended past the rock walls the rest nosed inside milo straightened and peered through the rear window shook his head tinted crouching again he secured his grip on the rifle moved around the explorers drivers side waited pointing his rifle at whatever was in front of him i joined him the two of us remained pressed against the truck partial view of the clearing plenty of light now from a spotlight on a pole an orange extension cord connected the lamp to a gray battery pack the bulb was aimed downward well short of the fifteenfoot walls that created the staging area fortyfoot stage roughly circular set on flat gray earth rimmed by the high seamed rock a few boulders were scattered in the corners like sprinkles of pebbles where the mountain had given way natural amphitheater derrick crimmins had probably discovered it as a youth driving out with his brother to stage god knew what the good old days when hed designed sets for his stepmother acquired a taste for production tonight hed gone minimalist nothing in the clearing but the single light a tackle box and several videocassettes off to the side three white plastic folding chairs the chair to the left was off by itself twenty feet from its neighbors on it sat a young brownskinned plainfaced girl arms and legs bound by thick twine dark hair tied in pigtails pink babydoll pajamas were her sole costume a pink spot of blush on each cheek red lipstick on a frozen mouth a wide leather belt secured her to the chair cinching her cruelly at the waist pushing her rib cage forward not a belta hospital restraint the same kind they used at starkweather her head hung to the right livid bruises splotched her face and breasts and dried blood snaked from her nose down to her chin a shiny red rubber ball was jammed into her mouth creating a nauseating cartoon of geewhiz amazement her eyes refused to go along with it open immobile mad with terror staring straight ahead refusing to look at what was going on to her left the center chair held another woman captive older middleaged wearing a pale green housedress torn down the middle the rip was fresh fuzzed by threads exposing white underwear loose pale flesh blue veins auburn hair the same kind of bruises and scratches as the girls one eye purple and swollen shut red ball in her mouth too her other eye undamaged but also closed the gun jammed against her left temple was small and squareedged and chromeplated next to her in the righthand chair sat ardis peake holding the weapon from our vantage only half his body was visible long white fingers around the trigger he had on his starkweather khakis white sneakers that looked brandnew big sneakers oversized feet tormenting the auburnhaired woman but showing no sign he enjoyed it his eyes were closed too beyond enjoyment into reverie the man holding the video camera prodded him handheld camera compact dull black not much larger than a hardcover book it sprayed a beam of creamywhite light peake didnt budge and the cameraman gave him a sharper prod peake opened his eyes rolled them licked his lips the cameraman got right in front of him capturing each movement whir peake slumped again the cameraman let the camera drop to his side the lens tilted upward and the beam climbed hitting the upper edges of the rock and projecting the eyedot onto the mountainside the cameraman shifted and the doteye died milos jaw bunched he edged around to get a fuller view i stayed with him no one else in the clearing the cameraman kept his back to us tall narrow with a small white round shaved head that glowed with sweat black silk shirt buccaneer sleeves rolled to the elbows black jeans dusty black boots with thick rubber soles some kind of designer label ran diagonally across the right patch pocket of the jeans from the left patch dangled the butt of another chrome automatic milo and i sidled farther froze as gravel spat under us no reaction from the cameraman too busy mumbling and cursing and prodding peake manipulating peake sitting peake up straighter poking peakes face trying to mold expression adjusting the gun in peakes hand adhering to peakes hand strips of transparent tape bound the weapon to peakes spindly fingers peakes arm was held unnaturally rigid by a tripod that had been rigged to support the limb tape around the arm forced pose milo narrowed his eyes raised his rifle aimed then stopped as the cameraman moved suddenly halfturning touching something a tight downslanting line that cut through nightspace nylon fishing filament so thin it was virtually invisible from this distance running from the guns trigger to a wooden stake hammered into the dirt slack line one sharp tug would force peakes finger backward on the trigger propel the bullet directly into the auburnhaired womans brain special effects the cameraman ran a fingertip along the line stepped back peakes gun arm remained stiff but the rest of him was rubbery suddenly a wave of tardive symptoms took hold of him and he began licking his lips rolling his head fluttering his eyelids moving his ringers just enough to twang the line the cameraman liked that focused on the woman the gun back to the woman seeking the juicy shot peake stopped moving the line sagged the cameraman cursed and kicked peake hard in the shins peake didnt react slumped again go for it fucker lowpitched gravel voice do it man peake licked his lips stopped his legs began to shake the rest of him froze okay keep those knees goingdont stop you psycho piece of shit peake didnt react to the contempt in the cameramans tone somewhere else completely the cameraman walked over and slapped him the auburnhaired woman opened her eyes shuddered closed them immediately the cameraman had stepped back was focused on peake peakes head whipped back bobbled drool flowed from his mouth fucking meat puppet said the cameraman the sound of his voice brought a whimper from the auburnhaired woman the crepe around her uninjured eye compressed into a spray of wrinkles as she bore down struggling to block out the moment the cameraman ignored her preoccupied with peake no other movements in the clearing the brownskinned girl was in a position to see us but she showed no sign of recognition frozen eyes fear paralysis or drugs or both milo trained the rifle on the back of the cameramans head thick ringers around his trigger but the cameraman was only inches from the fishing line if he fell the wrong way the gun would fire tucking the camera under his arm the filmmaker positioned peake some more peakes arms dangled he threw his head back more drool he inhaled noisily coughed blew snot through his nose the cameraman yanked the camera up and filmed it slapped peake again said some monster you are peakes head dropped unbound free to leave the chair but constrained by something stronger than hemp the cameraman filmed shifting attention from the woman to the gun to peake still inches from the rigged line more liplicking and headrolling from peake his eyelids slammed upward showcasing two white ovals good goodmore eye stuff give me eye stuff the cameraman was talking louder now and milo used the sound for cover charging out into the clearing raising his rifle the cameramans right thigh nudged the line made it bob he realized it laughed did it again watched the pull on peakes hand peake was able to pull the trigger but even tardive movement hadnt caused him to do so resisting again his head dropped the cameraman said wheres good help when you need it taking hold of peakes ear he shoved peakes head upward filmed the resultant gaping stare caressing the line with his own index finger as the camera panned the length of peakes body moving slowly from furrowed skull to oversized feet disproportionate feet puppet i understood insight was worthless i readied my gun but stayed in place milo had inched closer to the cameraman fifteen or so feet to his rear with exquisite care he lifted the rifle to his shoulder trained it once again on the cameramans neck snipers target the medulla oblongata lower brain tissue that controlled basic body process one clean shot and respiration would cease the cameraman said all right ardis ive got enough background one way or the other lets do the cunt the auburnhaired woman opened her good eye saw milo moved her mouth around the red ball as if trying to spit it out i knew who she was sheriff haass wifemarvelle haas mail on the table one day maybe two one car gone the wife left alone she began shivering violently the young girl remained glazed the cameraman turned toward marvelle gave us a full view of his profile deep lines scored the sides of a lipless mouth grainy tanned skin several shades darker than the white hairless head the head accustomed to wigs small but aggressive chin beak nose sharp enough to draw blood no facial fat but loose jowls stringy neck forearms wormed by veins big hands dirty nails derrick crimmins was turning steadily into his father his father had been a sour grasping man but nothing said hed been anything other than a flawed human being here in front of me was monstrosity yet open him up and thered be unremarkable viscera bouncing around the vault of his skull would be a lump of gray jelly outwardly indistinguishable from the brain of a saint a manit always came down to just a man marvelle haas closed her eyes again whimpers struggled to escape from behind the red ball all that emerged were pitiful squeaks milo crouched ready to shoot but crimmins was still too close to the line open your eyes mrs haas said crimmins give me your eyes honey come on i want to catch your expression the moment it happens he checked the tape around peakes hand adjusted the gun barrel so that it centered on marvelle haass left temple she squeaked he said come on lets be professional about this moved toward her away from the fishing line used to fish he said arranging her hair parting her housedress slipping a hand under the fabric and rubbing pinching look what i caught here still within arms reach of the line back when i fished he said a tug on the line meant youd caught something this time it means throwing something away she turned away from him he moved to the left focusing filming away from the line far enough away dont move drop your hands drop em drop em now derrick crimmins froze turned around the look on his owlish face was odd surprisedbetrayed then the flush of rage this is a private shoot wheres your pass drop your hand crimmins do it now oh said crimmins you talk so im supposed to listen asshole drop it crimmins this is the last time crimmins said okay you win he shrugged the lipless mouth curved upward oh well he said he lunged for the fishing line milo shot him in the smile chapter the explorer showed up on a hollywood division want list stolen from a strip mall at western and sunset two months before in the rear storage area were five sets of

griff had a bad feeling about him mrs haupt told milo carried a camera around and did nothing but take our picture wore nothing but black like someone died milo and mike whitworth found the tapes while excavating the mounds of stolen goods in the garage at orange drive sixteen cassettes in black plastic cases buried under thousands of dollars worth of motion picture gear that derrick crimmins had lacked the will or the ability to master sixteen death scenes the first recognizable victim was the fourth we viewed richard dada young handsome talking animatedly about his career plans unaware of what lay ahead cut to the next scene richards head yanked back by the hair exposed for the throat slash the body bisected with a band saw the darksleeved arms of the murderer visible but no face the camera was stationary making it possible for one person to murder and film other tapes featured a roving lens that necessitated two killers the log on the tape said dada had been killed at one am ellroy beartys tape featured two segments an initial shot of the homeless man sucking a bottle near the train tracks then four months later beatty prone and unconscious on those same train tracks followed by a long shot of an approaching express poor technique the camera jumped around and the moment of impact was just a blur next came brother leroy also in two installments smiling drunkenly as he talked about wanting to be a blues singer four months later a similar smile cut short as a black hole snapped onto his forehead like a decal and he collapsed both brothers killed the same night ellroy first his death mandated by the train schedule leroys turn two hours later midway through the stack was claire argents final day on earth like the others shed been unprepared crimmins had filmed her in front of a bare white wall whether it was her own living room couldnt be determined she talked about psychology about wanting to learn more about madness made allusions to the project she and the cameraman would be starting soon then said oh sorry im supposed to forget youre there right no answer from the cameraman claire talked more about the origins of madness about not jumping to conclusions because even psychotics had something to tell us then she smoothed an eyebrowprimping for the cameraand smiled some more five seconds of shy smile before she was smothered by a pillow long shot of her motionless body closeup on the straight razor twelve other home movies unlabeled seven females five teenage girls with the haunted look of street kids two attractive blond women in

marvelle haas the teenage pimp couldve been the goateed boy stabbed in the chest then dismembered but he fit street punk so my guess was christopher soames never had his audition lucky lad at the

teenage girls had been matched with runaways on various missing persons rosters all the girls it was believed had been living on the streets of hollywood hedy haupt wouldve understood that scene two

cocking her hip moving slowly seductively vamping smiling as she turned to look back saying howm i doingsexy enough just before her head disappeared in a flash no designation on the list perhaps derrick crimmins had conceived her as coke whore or maybe he had yet to dream up a designation creating characters killing them off folded in a pocket of crimminss black silk shirt was a copy of the blood walk title page wed found in his nightstand on the reverse were several handwritten paragraphs in the same sharpedged hieroglyphics used for the production notes the monster combenation of extreme evilmadness and supernatural psychic ability s to tell the future and to get into peoples heads locked up in the high security asylem just like haniball leckter he also cant be stopped like leckter can go through walls beam himself around change his moleculs like a startrek alien exits at will goes around killing at will various people all types just cause he likes it gets off on it not crazy all the time this is just what he does his job his callin in life no one will ever understand it because theyre not in the same dimension and he canot be stopped anymore than jason or freddie kruger or michael meyers except by the daredeveil avenger who understands him cause he grew up with him and hes also got the psychic powers but for good not evil once hhe was a kid now hes a man tall and muscular and silent a real john wayne dirty harry type but with a sense of humor true lies meets james bond doesn t waste action except whem it counts women love him the same as james bond but he has no time for them because only he knows what the monsters really capible of so only he can stop the blood walk which otherwise would be inevatable he wears black but hes the good guy keep it different creative the actions in the end always between him and the monster primeevil battle only at the end can we know how it turns out in the last scene the monster dies the worse death of all maybe burning maybe grinded up in some kind of hamburger machine or acid either way hes dead or maybe not if it works theres always a sequel chapter what the hell was he planning to do with it said milo take a meeting with some studio scrote he stuffed pretzels into his mouth no answer expected we were sitting in a bar on pacific avenue on the south end of venice not far from the marina jimmy buffett on tape sunroughened faces and zinc noses sports talk the pretzels mostly calls for beer on tap it was thursday id spent the afternoon just as i had every day this week out in bellflower with suzy galvez trying to break through milo had offered my services right after the rescue mr galvez a landscaper with a vicious scar running from his left ear to his shoulder blade had turned him down growling we handle our own problems three weeks later i got the call from mrs galvez meek halting slightly accented voice apologetic when she didnt need to be suzy was still waking up with screaming nightmares two days ago shed started wetting her bed and sucking her thumb she hadnt done any of that since the age of six i drove out the next day the house was a brown box behind freshly painted white pickets too many flowers for the space mr galvez greeted me at the door a scarfaced muscled keg of steam shaking my hand too hard telling me hed heard i knew what i was doing handing me a mixed bouquet cut fresh from the garden when i left marvelle haas was rumored to be seeing a therapist in bakersfield neither she nor her husband had returned anyones calls the task force was still looking for bodies contacting departments in other cities other states trying to figure out how many people derrick crimmins had murdered cases in arizona oklahoma and nevada seemed promising evidence on derricks brothers motorcycle accident was sketchy but cliff crimminss name had been added to the victim list milo snarfed more pretzels someone shouted for a bud the bartender a blackhaired croatian with four rings in his left ear palmed the tap we were drinking singlemalt scotch eighteenyearold macallan when milo asked for the bottle the croatians eyebrows lifted he smiled as he poured what the hell was it all for said milo thats a real question yeah ive used up my ration of rhetorical i was sorry he asked id thought about little else had answers good enough for talk shows but nothing real milo put his glass down stared at me maybe it was all for fun i said or preparation for the movie crimmins convinced himself hed write one day or he was actually going to sell the tapes we still havent found any underground market for that kind of crap okay i sipped so eliminate that i know he said theres an appetite for every damn bit of garbage out there im just saying nothings turned up linking crimmins to any snufffilm business deals and weve looked bigtime no cash hoard not a single bank account no meetings with any shifty types in long coats no ads in weirdo magazines and the computer crimmins had in the house wasnt hooked up to the internet nothing but basic software no files our guy says he probably never used it technologically impaired i said no sweat videos as good as film all im saying is it doesnt look like he was after the money stole all that gear but never tried to sell it we figure he was probably living off dope sales and heidis salary i said till she became superfluous no bank accounts means the two of them spent everything as it came in they werent living like royalty and they avoided paying rent so a good deal of it probably went up her nose his too coroner found some coke in his system a little meth too and something called loratadine antihistamine i said doesnt make you drowsy maybe crimmins was allergic to the desert needed to keep his energy level up for the big shoot milo refilled his glass blood walk whatever his specific motivation i said and he may have had several in his head it was a major production it was the process he loved he got hooked on playing god sixteen years ago he downed the scotch you really think crimmins did the ardullos by himself by himself or with his brother but not with peake peake was set up ill probably never be able to prove it but the facts support it think about peakes blood test just a residue of thorazine heidid been weaning him off his meds for a while just as claire probably had but claires motive was to get peake to talk about his crimes and unconsciously she wanted to find some virtue in his soul because that might say something about her brother heidi wanted peake sufficiently coherent so he could cooperate in the escape andmore importantperform on film killing marvelle and suzy on camerathe monster finally reveals itself but it didnt work he didnt perform you saw his condition with or without thorazine hes extremely lowfunctioning has been for years at his prime he had no more than a borderline iq adolescent paint and gluesniffing and alcohol knocked off a few more points thorazine and tardive dyskinesia numbed him further he was never in any shape to plan and conduct a crime spree even the disorganized massacre jacob haas found at the ardullo house he had nothing to do with heidis death or frank dollards no motive no means same for the ardullos the ardullos were your basic senseless crime he said maniac on the loose no need for a motive thats what derrick wanted everyone to think i said and he got his way but theres always some kind of motive psychotic or otherwise peakes no criminal superman just pathetic derrick plotted it all out good against evil derrick gives derrick takes away another drink poured milo said daredevil avenger on some level derrick probably started believing his own pr peake as surrogate monster derrick as angel of deliverance but peake just doesnt fit any type of psychotic killer hes never shown any indication of a delusional system bloody or otherwise never acted violently before the massacre or since hes a retarded man with advanced schizophrenia organic brain damage alcoholic dementia crimmins called him a meat puppet and thats exactly what he was right from the beginning derrick and cliff got him drunk borrowed his shoes they were able to even though they were much taller because peakes feet are disproportionately large one or both of them walked through the ardullo house slashing and bludgeoning two killers would have made it easier quicker the sneaker prints pointed to peake and led to his shack with that kind of proof why bother looking any further and dont forget who was in charge haas a parttime cop absolutely no homicide experience then the fbi came in and did an afterthefact profile milo had two more shots one other thing i said that night when peake had his hand taped to the gun he was experiencing plenty of tardive symptoms lots of movement youd think he wouldve pulled the trigger just by chance but he didnt and i swear there were times looking at him that
