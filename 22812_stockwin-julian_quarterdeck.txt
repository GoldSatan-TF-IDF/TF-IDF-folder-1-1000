julian stockwin quarterdeck prologue a clock ticked loudly in the silence the three commissioners experienced sea captains all stared implacably at the candidate waiting for his answer acting lieutenant thomas kydd had every reason to feel the terror that froze his bowels failure at this examination would see him stripped of his temporary rank and returned ingloriously to his old shipmates er well i would come come sir an easy enough questionyour certificate of service claims seatime in artemis a crack frigate as ever ive seen you must have seen a flying moor above a dozen times it was unfair here in this august navy office boardroom he was being asked to describe one of the most risky manoeuvres dropping anchor at speed and sailing on to the full scope of the cable then letting go another before falling back on the two anchors black jack powlett of the artemis would never have chanced his vessel so kydd thought indignantly then took a deep breath coming boldly up t the anchorage i er would range both cables out on the gundeckveering parties doublebanked o coursean at m furthest on let go th best bower then you do not feel it prudent to double bitt your cable first sir the first commissioner interjected then the second came in and we have heard nothing of setting this bower acockbill in readiness that is if your ship has not yet a trick stopper or similar the first added smugly kydd forced his mind to an icy resolve aye siri may have omitted t say that in getting the anchor off the bows it is first necessary it seemed to satisfy he dared a glance at the third member of the board who sat hardfaced and silent captain essington the captain of triumph in which he had served at the bloody battle of camperdown passing to navigation the first commissioner said flatly kydds anxieties returned he had learned his skills at the hands of a merchantservice sailing master who had taught him a plain yet solid understanding of his craft but kydd knew that the navy liked arcane descriptions and definitions well begin with basic understanding mr kydd what is your conceiving of a great circle er the plane o the equator when projected frm the centre on to a tangent plane becomes a straight line thank you the workings of an azimuth altitude will be familiar enough to you no doubtthen clarify for me the correction of the right ascension of the mean sun if you please kydd struggled but could see frowns settling glances exchanged failure was now more than a possibility and a cold dread stole over him if only they would ask mr kydd you are aboard a twodecker it was essington leaning forward kydd shifted position to face him directly there was no trace of compassion in the mans eyes shall we say in the caribbean you are scudding before a regulargoing hurricane and you sight landdead to looard you throw out both bowers the other commissioners looked at essington with curiosity they carry away one after the other only a sheet anchor is left to you to prevent the ship being cast ashore detail your actions if you will sir to forestall a wreck and grievous loss of life he leaned back unnerving kydd with his stare his fellow captains held back in surprise as essington finished acidly and shall we have a coral bottom kydd cast about for something to say the right action to take in such an extreme situationbut then it dawned on him he had been in exactly this plight in the old trajan and himself had been the one to pass keckling to preserve their last anchor called as lee helmsman by the master himself aye sir he said crisply first we need t ride out the blow a coral bottom means well have to pass a deal of keckling aroun the first two or three fathom of cable above the anchor clinch and then those desperate hours off the unknown island were burned into his consciousness that endless night the screaming hurricane the cold dawn and the fearful danger of their action in clawing off it steadied him the simple recounting of fine seamanship but to make an offing will be hard an we must wait fr the wind to shift a point or two but then we must take our chance and only one chance it is show small canvas and at th right time cut the cable an run fr the open sea the commissioners nodded expressionless i think thats enough gentlemen do you not essington said kydd held his breath there was mumbled conferring more frowns was it possibly more than coincidence that essington had brought forward that particular circumstance as if he had particular knowledge of his past and where are your certificates they were asking for attestations to his sobriety obedience diligence and skill in the profession of a seaman kydd handed over the journals and documents in a floodtide of hope if he had failed why would they be wasting time on the formalities the journals were leafed through but they had been meticulously kept for years and it seemed the certificates of age and rated service appeared acceptable his heart leaped the last hurdle was being overcome if my reckoning is correct we have a difficulty one of the commissioners held the original if somewhat crumpled certificate of service from kydds first ship duke william from this it does seem that mr kydd is according to regulations one year short of the requirement for seatime kydd had known of this deficiency but had prayed that the regulations would not be applied rigorously horatio nelson himself had been promoted to lieutenant before time but if a commissioner of the board wished to make an issue of it little could be done essington took the paper then looked up with a tigerish smile yesbut this is worthless it is in error i distinctly recollect when captain caldwell was removed from royal billy to culloden i rather fancy we would get a different date were we to ask him directly as it is captain caldwell is now in the west indies admiral of the leeward squadron if my memory serves i doubt he is to be troubled on this trivial matter his manner quelled all discussion the other commissioners gathered up the papers and returned them to kydd well it seems we are of one mind our recommendation will go forward to the navy office that for the good of the service you shall be confirmed in rank to lieutenant good day to you sir chapter the portsmouth mail made good speed on the highway south from london inside it smelt pungently of leather and old dust but thomas kydd did not care it would take a great deal more than this to subdue his growing excitement after the examination kydd had spent some days in yarmouth where tenacious had been taken out of commission for battle repairs and had prevailed upon the naval outfitter in the matter of a splendid lieutenants uniform determined to go home on leave in a handsome manner he stared out at the tranquil winter country scene of soft meadows and gnarled oak trees this was england at last his hearth and home after so many years away the postillions long horn blared and he leaned out of the window it was cobham guildford was not far away he glanced at his friend sitting next to him an hour nicholasan hour only an ill be seein m folks again renzi had been quiet since london his withdrawn ascetic expression discouraging talk he nodded politely and smiled then looked away heaven only knew what he was thinking about their years together had been full of perils and adventure but renzis friendship had brought kydd an insight into learning and respect for the riches of the mind and now they were returning to where their long adventure had started yet again kydd brought to memory how he had last left home when he and renzi had stolen away back to sea to artemis the famous frigate after founding a school to secure his familys livelihood there had been a world voyage that had ended in shipwreck rousing times in the caribbean adventures in the mediterranean it seemed half a lifetime but it was only four years or so here he was just twentyfive and the coach jerked to a stop and the horses were changed for the last stage to guildford the door swung open and a young lady was handed up her tall bonnet catching on the roof sill she settled opposite in a rustle of paleblue silk her eyes downcast an older gentleman followed acknowledged kydd and renzi then sat beside her the ostler offered a hot brick in worn serge which the man manoeuvred under the young ladys feet thank you dear papa she said demurely snuggling her hands into a muff the man favoured a bellywarmer which he settled inside his long coat uncommon cold for this time o year he grunted long inured to conditions far worse kydd caught renzis amused but discreet sideways glance er im sure yr right the girl looked up and noticed their uniforms oh she said prettily her hand at her mouth youre sailors the man coughed irritably theyre officers mdear naval officers not sailors dye see it is what i meant to say papa pray sirs were you in that dreadful battle of camperdown i have heard that it was quite the most shocking fight this age the man clicked his tongue in exasperation but kydds heart swelled with pride their coach still bore laurel branches from the helterskelter celebrations of only a week or so ago indeed this is so miss and you will understand how truly weary we are that we yearn for the blessings of peace and solitude for a period renzi said quietly of course sir please do forgive me her eyes rested briefly on kydd then she turned determinedly to stare out of the window kydd felt a pang of irritation but understood that renzi was sparing him idle chat so that he could enjoy the anticipation of his homecoming the mention of camperdown his first big fleet action brought back emotions that were still too raw and recent images of the nightmare of the great mutiny at the nore and its sequel his mind shied away from them and instead concentrated on the incredible fact that he had been promoted on the field of battle and officially confirmed he was now lieutenant kydd it was still too heady a thought so he let his mind return to the excitement of his homecoming the coach jolted over the infamous potholes at abbotswood guildford town was now minutes away almost too quickly the square greystone elizabethan grammar school passed on the left and the town proper began familiar buildings at the top of the high street the posthorns baying echoed off the almshouse opposite holy trinity drawing mildly curious glances from the townsfolk clattering over the old cobbled road they passed under the big clock and the driver tooled the mailcoach through the narrow black and white halftimbered entrance of the angel postinghouse kydd and renzi left their bags with the obsequious landlord then emerged on to the high street and turned left past shops and alleys well known to kydd the reek and colour of the town the bustle and shouts the passing tide of people all seemed to advance like a dream some glanced curiously at the two men others with admiration selfconscious kydd waited for someone to recognise him but perhaps the dark blue white and gold of his handsome uniform put paid to that he saw betty the fishmongers attractive daughter who stopped and stared in shock at the sight of him kydd doffed his brandnew cocked hat they reached the redbrick church of holy trinity and turned off past the glebe cottages to schoolhouse lane as it was now known there was no mistaking the little naval school ahead a huge blue ensign floated above for all the world to seethe flag under which kydd had fought at camperdown and as they drew near they could hear a muffled chanting on the air three sevens are twentyone four sevens are twentyeight five sevens they stepped into the tiny quadrangle two kings officers returned from the sea a youngster emerged at the run from a classroom and teetered to a halt he whipped off his cap and shrilled ill fetch th bosun if y please sir jabez perrott emerged out of the building and stumped importantly towards them his eyes widened and he gasped be buggered its master kydd be gob kydd opened his mouth but perrott reddening with pleasure grabbed for his silver call and emitted a piercing blast then in a lowerdeck bellow that had not softened with the years he roared aaaaall the hands haaaands to musterclear lower deck ye swabs haaaands to muster children boiled out of the classrooms screeching in delight at the antics of their strict boatswain mr perrott mr perrott what are you doing kydd recognised the voice and holding back tears advanced to meet his mother oh tom its you m darling boy its you and youve the rest was lost in a fierce embrace that went on and on knocking his hat askew mother so long kydds father had aged his form was stooped and his eyes sightless nevertheless he bore himself nobly in the black breeches of a headmaster er is that you son it is walter his mother said as the old man moved uncertainly towards kydd holding out his hand kydd took it then hugged him walter tom is an officer she looked anxiously to kydd for confirmationthe idea was so enormous aye mother its lieutenant kydd royal navy you must call me now or ill clap ye all in irons he spoke loudly so his father would make no mistake about what he was hearing carry on sir perrott said to kydd touching his hat er please do said kydd ships compny ahoy ill have yez in two lines afore the mastlets be havin ye he bawled at the children they shuffled eagerly into line now we dips our colours t a pair o eroes oo has jus come back ome frm such a battle as never was an were going t show how much we admires em lieutenants kydd and renzi stood solemnly to attention as god save the king and rule britannia were sung enthusiastically by the wideeyed youngsters a piercing squeal on the boatswains call brought quiet and the colours were dipped reverently to half staff with great dignity perrott turned to face kydd removing his hat taken by surprise kydd raised his own cocked hat at which the colours rose again silence perrott thundered at the awed children now lootenant kydd will talk t you about yr dooty kydd managed to splutter a few words yr duty is steadfast in all weathers courage at the cannons mouth king and country it seemed to be enough an eager child broke ranks and held up his hand please sir i want t be a sailorhow do i be a sailor soon a pinkfaced kydd was mobbed by shouting boys pipe down y scurvy crew n listen to the ltenant growled perrott happily kydd glanced across at his mother who was bursting with pride and knew there was only one thing to do he turned to his father and touched his hat capn sir permission fr liberty ashore t both watches oh er liberty his father stuttered yes yes er lieutenant kydd a halfholiday to er all hands the children screamed with delight and poured out of the school leaving a dazed happy kydd family standing in the quadrangle i shall withdraw at this point if i may renzi said quietly no no mr renzi mrs kydd insisted you must stay an tell us where you have been on the seayoull both have such tales i do declare she turned to kydd now ill ask mr partington to spare us his room for youhe can stay with his friend jonathan for mr renzi she trailed off then she resumed stiffly but then now thomas has a reputation hell want t have his own establishment his mothers words could not hide the essence of the matter the brutal truth and kydd felt a chill at the passing of his simple life he saw her colouring she had understood that her son was no longer hers from now on society events and invitations would firmly distinguish between the kydds we shall stay at the angel renzi said softly then we will take modest lodgings in town kydd mumbled agreement well then thats settled his mother said bravely its for the best o course come inside an take a possetyou must be frozen after yr journey as he cradled a mug of hot curdled milk at the kitchen table kydd listened to the flow of prattle from his mother felt the quiet presence of his father and caught the curious flash of the maids eyes his own kept straying down to his uniform the blue and gold so striking who could guess what the future might hold now a deep sigh escaped him he heard the approaching tap tap of footsteps his mother smiled ah that must be ceciliashell be so surprised to see you the last time he had seen his sister was in a wrecked boat in the caribbean he recalled her mortal terror as they had fought for their lives against the sharks what would she think of him now shes done very well with lord an lady stanhope thomas quite the lady companion she is now mrs kydd said proudly and dont go quarrellin with her if y please you know how it upsets your father the outside door rattled and cecilias voice echoed down the passageway fatherwhat is going on i saw quantities of your boys on the street and her voice died away as the two men rose to their feet she looked from face to face incredulous thomas you you kydd awkwardly held out his hands yere doin well mother says suddenly her expression softened to a deep tenderness and she seized her brother in a fierce hug oh thomas ive so missed you he felt her body heaving and when she looked at him again he saw the sparkle of tears his own voice was gruff with emotion as he said sisy remember in th boat she stopped him with a finger on his lips and whispered mother then she let him go crossed to renzi and placed a generous kiss on both his cheeks dear nicholas how are you youre still so thin you know renzi replied politely and cecilia turned back to her brother thomas and nicholas are going to take chocolate with me at murchisons and tell me all their adventures while you mother prepare such a welcome for this wandering pair she announced her eyes widened gracious meand if im not mistaken in the particularsthomas youre a ltenant kydd it is now cec he said happily the evening meal was a roaring success kydd became hoarse with talking and renzi was quite undone by the warmth of his welcome cecilia could not get enough of kydds descriptions of the venice of casanova even above his protestations that the danger of their mission meant he was hardly in a position to discourse on the republics attractions distant thumps and a sudden crackle sounded outside cecilia clapped her hands the fireworksi nearly forgot tonight well see your admiral onslowhe is to be a baronet and is now resting at clandon with his brother the earl its said hell make an address from the balcony of the town hall gentlemeni wish to attend i shall be with you presently she swept away imperiously to appear shortly afterwards in a pelisse at the height of fashion lemon silk lined and faced with blue she looked at them both with the suspicion of a pout and who will be my gentleman escort kydd hesitated but instantly renzi bowed deeply and offered his arm may i observe that i find mademoiselle is in looks tonight he said with the utmost courtly grace cecilia inclined her head and accepted his arm they went outside and without a backward glance at kydd moved off down the lane cecilias laughter tinkling at renzis sallies kydd watched them helplessly his sister had changed there was not a trace of childhood chubbiness left her strong features had developed into strikingly dark good looks and a languorous elegance her position with lady stanhope had allowed her to find an easy confidence and elegance of speech that he could only envy he followed them trying to look unconcerned crowds pressed everywhere while excited chatter and the smell of fireworks hung on the air people held back respectfully kydd was not sure whether it was in recognition of them as gentlefolk or because of the navy uniform closer to the torchlit balcony the throng was tightly packed and they had to remain some distance back cecilia kept renzis arm but pulled kydd forward attracting envious looks from other ladies oh im so proud of you she exclaimed her voice raised above the excited babble of the crowd she smiled at them both and kydd felt better it was th admiral gave me m step cecthere in th great cabin o monarch kydd paused remembering the scene but it were capn essington put me forward a deep thumping came from the other side further down the high street the royal surreys called out to do duty on this naval occasion thin sounds of fife and trumpet rose above the hubbub strengthening as they approached then with a pair of loud double thumps on the bass drum it ceased the crowd surged below the balcony and settled into a tense expectation torchlight illuminated upturned faces caught the sparkle of eyes the glitter of gold lace at the signs of indistinct movement within a rustle of anticipation arose and the mayor emerged on to the balcony in his best scarlet gown and tricorne resplendent with his chain of office m lords ladies an gennelmen pray silence for the mighty victor o the great battle o camperdown our ownadmral onslow the genial sea officer kydd remembered stepped out on to the balcony a furious storm of cheering met him a roar of wholehearted and patriotic acclaim onslow in his fulldress admirals uniform sword and decorations bared his head and bowed this way and that manifestly affected by the welcome kydd watched him turn again and again to face all parts of the crowd at one point he thought he had caught the admirals eye and wondered if he should wave back but there was no sign of recognition the noise subsided and onslow moved to the front of the balcony he fumbled in his coat and withdrew a paper he hesitated then put the paper back straightening to a quarterdeck brace m lord mayor an ladycitizens of guildford he began i thank ye for your fine and loyal address followin the action off camperdown but i must make something very clear to ye an admiral doesnt win battles the seamen do an i cannot stand here tonight without i acknowledge this before you all over there t larbd yes those two men ahoy be s good as to join me and show yselves these are two of your true victors o camperdown thomasgo cecilia squealed when it became obvious whom the admiral had singled out the crowd shuffled and fell back onslow was waiting for them and shook their hands warmly a fine thing t see ye both he rumbled his keen eyes taking in their new uniforms lets out an give em a sight then youll honour me with yr presence at the presentation they emerged together on the balcony to a roar kydd waving awkwardly renzi bowing kydds eyes searched out cecilia she was shouting something to him waving furiously and his heart swelled a capital choice renzi said removing his coat and standing in waistcoat and breeches it seems we shall be waiting out tenaciouss repair in a tolerable degree of comfort he settled into a substantial highbacked chair kydd rubbed his hands before the fire the agent had left and they had taken on this halfmansion below the castle for a reasonable sum the owner had apparently instructed that officers in his majestys service could rely on his patriotic duty in the matter of a lease not only that but agreeably they could share the services of domestic staff with the adjoining residence which as it was inhabited by an old lady should be no trial kydd looked around him with growing satisfaction albeit tinged with trepidation the rooms were not large but were bigger than anything he had lived in before hed always known that the heart of the home was the kitchen but here it seemed that this elegant room had taken its place the walls were a soft sage colour the broad generous sash windows were hung with muslin and festoon curtains and stout druggets lay beneath his feet instead of oiled floorcloths the furniture was reassuringly oldfashioned and sturdy he turned again to the fire with its plain but wellproportioned marble surround and mantelpiece and felt an unstoppable surge of happiness two or three months dye suppose he mused recalling the savage wounds tenacious had suffered i would think so renzi sat sprawled his eyes closed nicholas th sun is not yet above th foreyard but i have a desire t toast our fortune renzi half opened his eyes please do you will not find me shy of acknowledging that it is these same fates that determine whether one should die of a loathsome disease or clap a stopper on it brother kydd laughed ill go n rouse out somethin we cn i think not why pray touch the bell for the servant aye nicholas kydd said humbly he found the wellworn but highly polished silver bell and rang it selfconsciously sir a manservant in blue with a plain bob wig appeared renzi pulled himself upright should you unlock my grey valise you will find a brace of cognac pray be so good as to open one for us certainly sir the man said with a short bow and withdrew kydd tried to look unconcerned and toasted his rear until the servant returned bearing a gilt tray a votre sante renzi said a votter sonday kydd echoed awkwardly the brandy burned a passage to his empty stomach renzi stood up raising his glass to kydd our present fortune may this indeed be a true augury of our future aye an may we never find th need t deny our past ever kydd responded nicholas m true friend he looked sideways at renzi and seeing he was attending politely pressed on ive been athinkinyou dont care if i say my mind my dear fellow if it were any other i would feel betrayed well nicholas this is all moren i could ever hope for somethin that can only happen ifif yr destiny is written somewhere i reckon so im takin this chance wi both hands ill give it m rousin best copperbottomed doublebarrelled beveledged try i will renzi nodded of course brother so this is what i have t do kydd took a determined pull on his brandy ive seen yr tarpaulin officer come aft through the hawse a right taut son o neptune ye sees him on watch on th quarterdeck an it puts yr heart at ease but nicholas i dont want t be a tarpaulin officer theyre stayin ltenants all their days fine messmates im sure but who should sayplain in their habits the other officers step ashore tgether while they stays aboard n makes friends wi a bottle he glanced down at the glass in his hands i want t be a reglarbuilt kings officer and gentleman nicholas an i asks you what i cn do to be one o them renzis halfsmile appeared if this is your wish tomyet ill have you know there is no shame in being one of natures gentlemen if y will ah all in good time dear fellow this does require a mort of reflection it was all very well for kydd to ask this of him even if what he said was perfectly reasonablebut in truth the job was nigh impossible renzis eye covertly took in kydds figure instead of a finedrawn willowy courtliness there were strong shoulders and slim hips standing foursquare rather than a distinguished slender curve to the leg his kneebreeches betrayed sculpted musculature and in place of a fashionably cool pale countenance there was a hearty oaken one whose open good humour was not designed for societal discretion and yet he was undoubtedly intelligent renzi had seen his quick wits at work but kydd would have to learn to value politeness and conventionnot his strongest suit then there was his speechrenzi squirmed to think of the sport others would make of him behind his back the probable course of events then would be for kydd to retreat into the comfort of bluff seadoggery and thereby exclude himself from gentleborn society but this was his particular friend he could not refuse him mr kydd as now i must call you this is what i propose he fixed him with a stare should you choose this path then i must warn you that the way is arduous theres many a chance to stumble are you prepared for a hard beat to windd i am and there are er matters you must accept without question which are not on the face of it either reasonable or explicable do you undertake that you will accept from me their necessity without question kydd paused aye very well i will give you my full assistance in your worthy endeavour and if you stay the course for you may indeed wish to yield the race at any point never then i in turn agree to assist in your elevation into society kydd flushed i wont shame ye to yr friends if that is yr meaning that was not my meaning but let us make a start he reached for the cognac and filled kydds glass there is a beginning to everything and in this it is the understanding that for a gentleman it is appearances that define politeness the courtesies due to a lady these are held at a value far above that of courage out on a yard true saltwater seamanship it is unfair but it is the world now in the matter of the courtesies we have kydd persevered he was aware that renzis precepts were introductory only and that there lay ahead a challenge of insight and understanding far different from anything he had encountered before the morning lengthened and by the time renzi had reached the proper use of euphemisms kydd was flagging they heard the rap of the frontdoor knocker ill go kydd said rising you shall not renzis words stopped him and he subsided into his chair the manservant entered with a small silver tray in his gloved hands and went pointedly to renzi are you at home sir renzi picked up a card i am to this young lady thank you very well sir as the servant left renzi shot to his feet square away tomits your sister cecilia entered the sitting room eyes darting around er youre welcome cec kydd said trying vainly to remember his morning exercises in civilities she acknowledged renzi with a shy bob mother saidsuch a sillythat men are not to be trusted on their own in a domestic situation how insulting to you i do apologise miss kydd that we are not dressed to receive i hope you understand nicholas cecilia said puzzled but then her expression cleared but of courseyoure standing on ceremony for thomass sake she looked at her brother fondly kydd smouldered cecilia ignoring him crossed to a candlestand and delicately sniffed the nearest well its none of my business but i cant help observing that unless you have means beyond the ordinary beeswax candles must sadly be accounted an extravagance tallow will be sufficientunless of course you have visitors she crossed to the windows and made play of freeing the shutters you will be aware how vital it is to preserve furniture from the sun we cn manage kydd growled an ill thank ye to keep yr household suggestions to yrself thomas i came only out of concern for your cec nicholas is tellin me the right lay t be a gentleman please t leave us to it indeed dear miss kydd your kindness in enquiring after our situation is handsomely done said renzi yet i feel it is probably a mans place to impart to another the graces of a gentleman cecilia hesitated thats as maybe mr renzi but there is another purpose to my visit you appear to have forgotten that a naval uniform will not answer in all appearances in polite society i came merely to offer my services in a visit to the tailor at the tailors cecilia was not to be dissuaded she quickly disposed of kydds initial preferences a yellow waistcoat while undoubtedly fetching was apparently irredeemably vulgar dark green doublebreasted was more the thing she conceded on the gold piping at the pockets buff breeches a rustcoloured coat and for halfdress a bon de paris with discreet gold frogging would be of the highest tonshe was not sure about the lace an whats the reckonin so far kydd had done well in prize money in the caribbean and after camperdown there would be more but this must be costing a shocking sum cecilia pressed on relentlessly a dark blue frock coat was essential in the new style with cutaway skirts that ended in split tails for an elegant fall while horseridingit seemed frivolous to kydd who was more used to a sensible fullskirted warmth a quantity of linen shirts was put in train and material for a cravat was purchased that cecilia insisted only she might be trusted to make kydd rebelled at pantaloons long breeches that could be tucked into boots knee breeches were what he would be seen inno one would mistake him for a damned macaroni the tailor gratified at patronage by those so recently in the public eye promised that he would bend his best efforts to have them delivered soon kydd was then escorted to the bootmaker and finally to the premises of henry tidmarsh hosier hatter and glover where he found for himself a dashing lightgrey brimmed hat with a silver buckle as kydd tried on hats renzi came up beside cecilia quite a transformation he murmured yes nicholas agreed cecilia keeping her voice low but i fear he will be thought a coxcomb if his dress is not matched by his manners she turned to him her hand on his arm dear nicholas i know you are trying your best but thomas can be very stubborn if he chooses do bear him with patience i pray of course but the hardest for him will undoubtedly be his articulationshis speech damns him at once cecilia touched his arm is there anything perhaps that i can do renzis thoughts had taken quite another course she was no longer the ingenuous girlchild he had known from before cecilia was a desirable selfpossessed woman who would be an ornament to any social gathering er this is possibly something we could discuss together should you be at leisure he felt a flush rising at the implication of the words why nicholas cecilia said gaily if i didnt know you more id be obliged to consider you importunate she flashed him a smile and turned her attention to her brothers fancy in hats although he was now entitled to do so kydd could not indulge in the wigs that he had learned to make in his apprenticeship the comet the royal bird the long bobeven the striking cadogan puffwere now no longer fashionable he would wear nothing simply a neat black ribbon to hold back his hair at the nape of the neck hairpowder was taxed so it would be quite understood if he left his hair as nature intended true to his word the tailor delivered his work in only three days and kydd stood before the fulllength bedroom mirror regarding himself doubtfully a generous cut on the waistcoat avoided any tense wrinkling resulting from muscleplay beneath but the buff breeches seemed to cling indecently close however if he had to appear in public this was not a bad beginning he thought he gazed down approvingly at the white stockings and buckled shoes then whirled once about glad to see you in spirits brother came from behind him aye what must be said kydd adjusting a cuff are ye ready nicholas ah renzi waved a finger what oh i meant t say are you prepared mr renzi then let us sally forth on the world renzi was in brown a complete dark brown with breeches coat and even waistcoat in the colour relieved only by the cream gush of his cravat and the stockings in the manner of a romantic he sported a broadbrimmed dark hat worn at a rakish angle it was the first time kydd had used an ebony cane as they passed along chapel street it felt awkward to the hand whether he swung it at each pace to click on the ground or twirled it about he fought down a sense of fakery but after the second time a passerby made way respectfully for him he felt happier they passed under the big clock in the high streetthe beadle outside the town hall touched his hat to themturned down a sidestreet and entered a dingy doorway might i present msieur jupon he is engaged to be your dancing master a short but fierceeyed man swept down in the most extravagant leg to kydd then straightened fixing him with a challenging stare er pleased t meet ye kydd stuttered and essayed a jerky bow jupon and renzi exchanged glances msieur jupon will instruct you in the graces of movement and courtesy and you will attend here for one hour daily until you have mastered the elements ah mr kydd youre not boardin your ship now sir do try a little grace in yr movements the voice of the lady horsemaster carried effortlessly across the ring she could well be relied on to hail the foreyard from the quarterdeck in a blow kydd thought the horse however had sensed his innocence swishing its tail and playing with its bit its eyes rolled in anticipation while kydd struggled to heave himself up staggering onefooted in a circle renzi dismounted and came across he checked the girth and yanked on the stirrup ah the stablehand is having his amusement youd have your knees round your ears with this well ease awayso the stirrups descended the horse quieter under renzis firm hand he slapped the horse familiarly on the rump look heres a tip make a fist and touch the stirrup bar up here now swing the iron up under your arm and the right length for you will be when it just touches the body kydd swung up nervously into the saddle suddenly finding himself at a great height the horse snorted and tossed its head he felt that it was biding its time before wreaking some terrible revenge so we seem t have made up our mind to go ridin at last a sarcastic bellow came across the ring to him we start wi the walk the horse plodded in a circle and kydds confidence grew back straight mr kydd he forced his spine to rigidity and completed another circle jehosaphat moses keep yr back supple mr kydd let yr hips rock with the horse sir the trot was more to his liking with its brisk motion but the horse whinnied with frustration at the tight rein and kydd eased it a little a gate was opened into a larger field and renzi began to canter kydd followed behind feeling the thud of hoofs through the animals frame and hearing snorts of effort coming from the great beast beneath him it was exhilarating and he relaxed into it the horse seemed to sense this and responded with a more fluid faster motion well done mr kydd he heard collected an light in hand we say as he turned he saw the woman pull out a large fob watch to me she demanded impatiently kydd felt the horse respond to his signals with knee and reins and suddenly was reluctant to finish for the morning impulsively he clapped his knees to the beasts barrellike sides after a brief hesitation the horse responded and broke into a gallop instinctively kydd acted as he would aloft his standing crouch that of a topman leaning forward to hand a billowing sail the horse stretched out down the length of the field now wildly excited kydd caught a glimpse of figures staring at him as he thundered past the wind tore through his hair the din of hoofs and the animals rhythmic movements beat on his senses a gnarled wooden fence spread across his vision as they hurtled towards it kydd considered an emergency turn to larboard far behind him a faint bellow sounded bridge yr reins bridge your reins but he was too far gone the horse threw itself at the rails there was a momentary muscular tensing a lunge into space then all was quiet for a heartbeat before the beast landed with a mighty thud and a jerk kydd stayed aboard as the horse raced away through nondescript winterbrown bracken and into the woods beyond it hesitated in midstride then swerved on to a woodland path kydd ducking to avoid whiplike branches he became aware of hoofbeats out of synchrony with his own and indistinct shouting he guessed it would be renzi following but dared not look behind he shot past a gaping greenwood forager then reached a more substantial lane across their path the horse skidded as it negotiated a random turn but the mud slowed it and the gallop became less frantic it panted heavily as it slowed to a trot renzi caught up and grasped the reins how are you brother kydd flashed a wide grin spankin fine time nicholas s help me he said breathlessly his face red with exertion renzi hid a grin and what has happened to your decorum sir oh aye yes er a capital experience sir they rode together for a space the lane widened and a small cottage came into view ahead do dismount old fellow and ask directions back renzi suggested gingerly kydd leaned forward to bring his leg across the saddle but in a flash he had toppled backwards into the black winter mud still with one foot in a stirrup the horse stamped and rolled its eyes as kydd got ruefully to his feet and trudged down the garden path to the door it was answered by a stooped old man with alert bright eyes before kydd could speak he smiled ah master kydd i do believe thomas kydd aye yr in the right of it kydd said that is t say you have th advantage of me sir the man feigned disappointment kydds face cleared o course parson deane it seemed so long ago that as a boy he had taken delight in going to the lakeside with the old man and his dog after duck i hope i find you in health sir he said the parson glanced up at renzi who was still mounted oh sir this is mr renzi my particular friend mr renzi this is the revnd deane renzi inclined his head my honour sir our apologies at this intrusion we merely seek a more expedient way back to our manege deanes face creased in pleasure i shall tell you should you come inside and accept a dish of tea while thomas tells me where hes been spending his days they left the horses to crop grass outside the garden fence and went into the parsons house deane looked at kydd keenly clearly enjoying his sparse recital of his impressment and subsequent adventures so now youre an officer kydd grinned boyishly ltenant kydd he said with swelling pride then you are now in the eyes of the whole world a gentleman is this not so it seemed appropriate to bow wordlessly deane contemplated kydd for a long moment do you stop me if i appear impertinent he said yet i would later remember this moment with shame were i not to share with you now my thoughts concerning your station it would be fr my advantage mr deane he couldnt resist a quick glance of triumph at renziafter all he had remembered the polite wordsbut renzi responded with a frown obediently kydd turned all his attention to the old man it seems to me that the essence of a gentleman is to be found in his good breeding his impeccable civility to all including his servants manners maketh man as the good book teaches us outer manners reflect inner virtue renzi nodded slowly the worthy locke is insistent on this point he murmured it is never quite easy for the young to acquire the civil virtues the parson continued quo semel est imbuta recens servabit oderem testa diu was horaces view and by this you should understand kydd stirred restlessly in his armchair gettin to be a gallows sight moren a man cn take cec all thisn cecilia affected not to hear kydd glanced at her irritably i mean how much o this is going to stand by me at sea thats better cecilia said demurely but laid down her book now im sure the other officers will be polite and well bred so you must be the same kydd snorted renzi sighed you have still three issues of the gentlemans magazine to digest to my certain knowledge he said accusingly and a spectator cecilia chimed in how can you keep a lady entertained at table without you have smalltalk to share she looked at renzi in mock despair then brightened mr renzi have you seen our castle the merest ruin ill grant but of an age indeed mama will be persuaded to comeshe knows all the history im wore out said mrs kydd finding a wooden bench overlooking what remained of the castle keep you two have a good look roun by yrselves cecilia was agreeable and renzi took her on his arm for the stony path winding about the castle mound the winter sun had a fragile brilliance contrasting colour bright with grey and brown tints it grieves me to say it but thomas did not shine at the teaparty in any wise he opened he was uncomfortably aware of her touchit had been long years since last he had enjoyed polite female company and cecilia was now a beauty yesthe silly boy sitting there like a stuffed goose while the ladies made sport of him i despair nicholas i really do renzi assisted cecilia past a perilous rock she flashed him a look of gratitude then dropped her eyes but her hold on his arm tightened miss kydd began renzi thickly then stopped with his own feelings about her far from clear was it fairwas it honourableto engage her affections yes nicholas she said smiling up at him he pulled himself up i was your mother confides that you have secured the liveliest trust in your position with lady stanhope i have been very fortunate she said gravely then a smile broke through youve no idea how many of the highest in the land ive seen lady stanhope requires i attend her at all her routs and im sure its only to find me a husband and dont be a silly nicholas im sensible of my fortune in this and i do declare im not ready to forsake it all now for the tedium of domestic life she tossed her head eyes sparkling after another few paces she turned to him with a troubled expression thomashe he knew what concerned her her brother would find himself first ridiculed and later shunned if he could not hold his own in company time is short i agree do you not think that we are obligated to press him to enter in upon society in a more formal degree cecilia bit her lip then decided a dinner party now let me see we have the pick of guildford of course a hostess would die to entertain a brace of heroes from camperdown but i rather feel that at this stage thomas would not welcome the public eye too warmly she thought for a moment then said i knowill speak with mrs crawford advise her that after such a dreadful battle thomas relishes nothing better than a small intimate gathering ill be seeing her on thursday and shall speak to her then splendid responded renzi it would indeed be a suitable occasion for kydd if he could overcome his timidity in august surroundings he beamed approval at cecilia er nicholas she said offhandedly something that i keep forgetting to ask its just my illbred curiosity but youve never mentioned your own people she stopped to admire a singularly gnarled small tree my own well shall i say theyre just an old country family of wiltshire whom i havent attended as assiduously as i might kydd sat motionless at the bare table listening while cecilia explained and cautioned his expression hard but in control no thomas it just will not do we do not enter like a herd of goats to feed first to take their places are the ladies and they will occupy one end of the table when they are seated the gentlemen proceedbut mark this in strict order they will be placed at the table in the same succession cecilias eyes flicked once to renzi then turned back to kydd kydds face tightened but he kept his silence now mrs crawford always dines a la frangaise as you know thomas and allows promiscuous seating so a man may sit next to a lady though some find this too racy for the english taste and in this renzis sympathy was all too transparent i do rather think that tom is more a man of daring and action dear sister this posturing must be a disagreeable strain for such a one nevertheless he shall require his manners wherever he may be cecilia said coldly a gentleman does not put aside his breeding simply for the perils of the moment now please attend thomas miss cecilia kydd mr thomas kydd and mr nicholas renzi blared the footman the babble of conversations faded it was common knowledge that the two guests now arrived had suffered in the legendary october clash off the dutch coast and it had been said that they had chosen tonight to resume their place in polite society there were many curious rumours about these officers but no doubt before the night was over the details would have been made clear a wave of determined females advanced led by the hostess and the groups dissolved in a flurry of introductions enchanted said mr kydd making a creditable but somewhat individual leg to a gratified mrs crawford do say if you become too fatigued mr kydd she said eyeing his broad shoulders youll find us in the utmost sympathy with your time of trial that is most kind in ye dear mrs crawford the handsome sailorofficer replied gravely she turned reluctantly to the other one a sensitivelooking rather more austere gentleman and reclaimed by her duty murmured politely they sat down to dinner under the golden glitter of chandelier and crystal to polite approbation at the first remove may i help you t a portion of this fine shott miss tuffs said mr kydd politely the young lady on his left nearly overcome at being noticed by one of the principal guests could only stutter her thanks tinged with alarm at the resulting pile of roast piglet generously heaped to occupy the whole plate sir this toothsome venison demands your immediate attention might i the redfaced gentleman to the right would not be denied and placed a satisfying amount on mr kydds plate your servant sir said mr kydd inclining his head it was clear that the middleaged woman across from him was set on securing his attention the weather seems uncommon blowy for the time of year she said mr kydd thought for a moment and replied politely its a saying ashore only mrs wood when the wind is in the east tis no good to man nor beast and by this is meant that in the winter season we often shiver in th winds o tartary from the east now at sea we bless this wind mrs wood for it is a fair wind for our ships downchannel and fully satisfied in the matter of explanations mrs wood retired to contemplate at which mr kydd turned his attention to the redfaced gentleman gentlemans magazines interestin this weeksays about your electric fluid invented by mr volta all comes from frog legs in the end he remarked bravely the man shook his head slowly in amazement now thats something i never knew he said at length a look of barely concealed satisfaction suffused mr kydds face as he looked up the table to where mr renzi sat quietly nodding slowly a footman obliged with claret wine with you sir mr kydd said happily with all the joyous relief to be expected of one having passed through a personal trial and not been found wanting i give you lady fortune an may she always be one chapter aye ere she comes capting the inn porter said indicating the gig under sail coming around garrison point he held out his hand for a promised sixpence and left them to it their chests and other impedimenta in a pile on sheerness public jetty while they waited for the boat from tenacious kydds heart bumped this was the day he had been looking forward to these several months while tenacious was under repair the most important day of his life the day he joined his ship confirmed in his rank a kings officer the day or so aboard after camperdown didnt really counthe could hardly remember anything of the brute chaos and towering weariness in the wounded ship limping back to sheerness the coxswain a midshipman cautiously rounded into the wind twenty yards off two seamen brailed up and secured the sail for a pull under oars the final distance to the jetty steps it was not what kydd would have done the breeze although fluky was reliable enough for an approach under sail alone as the boat glided alongside the sailors smacked the oars across their thighs and levered them aloft in one easy movement just as kydd had done in the not so distant past his eyes passed over the boat and the four seamen as he recalled the old saying you can always tell a ship by her boats was caution a feature of this ship he wondered the sailors seemed capable longservice able seamen economically securing the seachests and striking them into the centre of the boat but kydd sensed darting eyes behind his back as they took the measure of the new officers he and renzi assumed their places in the sternsheets at leisure while the midshipman took the tiller the boat bobbed in the grey north sea chop and kydds new uniform was sprinkled with its first saltwater he tried to keep his face blank against surging excitement as they rounded the point to open up the view of the nore anchorageand his ship she was one of a straggling line of vessels of varying sizes moored in this transitory anchorage to await different destinies a wisp of memory brushed his consciousness it was at the nore that he had been taken as a bitter victim of the press gang so long ago now it seemed he glanced back to the scatter of dockyard buildings the low fort the hulks and a pang of feeling returned for kitty malkin who had stood with him during the dark days of the nore mutiny she had uncannily foretold his elevation and that she would not be a part of it other memories of the time came too dark and emotional the red flag of mutiny the spiralling madness that had ended in savage retribution and shame memories he had fought hard to dim kydd crushed the thoughts he would look forward not back take his good fortune and move into the future with it the phantoms began to fade shes storing renzi said as if reading something in his face er yes those are powder hoys alongside shes ready t sail kydd muttered his eyes fixed on the approaching bulk of tenacious the foretopmast was still on deck for some reason but her long commissioning pennant flew from her masthead repairs complete she now stood ready in the service of her country a faint bellow from the ship sounded over the plash of the bow wave the bowman cupped his hand and bawled back aye aye warning tenacious that her boat was bearing naval officers who would expect to be received as the custom of the sea demanded the midshipman again doused sail and shipped oars for the last stretch kydd resolved to attend to the young gentlemans seamanship when the opportunity arose the boat bumped against the stout sides and the bowman hooked on kydd held back as renzi seized the handropes and left the boat although their commissions bore the same date he was appointed fourth lieutenant aboard and kydd as fifth would always be first in the boat and last out the ships sides were fresh painted the thick wales black with the lines of guns set in natural timber smart in a bright preparation of turpentine and rosin a strong wafting of the scent mixed pleasingly with that of salt spray above a boatswains call pierced the clean winter air kydd was being piped aboard a manowar he mounted the sidesteps his eyes passed above the deck line to the boatswains mate with his pipe on one side and two midshipmen as sideboys on the other he touched his hat to the quarterdeck when he made the deck and approached the waiting officerofthewatch lieutenant kydd sir appointed fifth ltenant for a moment he feared this officer would accuse him of being an impostor but the man merely smiled bleakly cutting it a trifle fine dont you think he said then turned to the duty quartermaster and ordered the chests swayed inboard renzi came to stand with kydd captain houghton will want to see you immediately i should think the officerofthewatch said aye aye sir kydd replied carefully conscious of eyes on him from all over the busy decks he remembered little of her from the exhausted hours he had spent aboard after the battle fighting to bring the damaged vessel to safe harbour but all ships had similar main features he turned and went into the cabin spaces aft renzi reported first there was a rumble of voices then the door opened seems pleasant enough he whispered to kydd kydd knocked and entered the captain sat behind his desk facing him taking advantage of the wan light coming through the stern windows he was glowering at a paper ltenant kydd come aboard t join sir dont sit the captain said heavily youre to hold yourself ready to go ashore again but sir why you are owed an explanation i believe houghton said looking at kydd directly ive been given to understand that your origins are the lower deck that is to say you have come aft through the hawse as the expression goes eraye sir then this must be to your great credit and shows evidence no doubt of sterling qualities of some kind however he leaned back in his chair still fixing kydd with hard grey eyes i am determined that tenacious under my command shall have a loyal band of officers of breeding who will be able to represent the ship with um distinction and who may be relied upon in the matter of courtesy and gentle conduct you should understand that it is no reflection on yourself personally when i say that i am applying to the commissioner to have you replaced with a more suitable officer for this vessel there is no question in my mind that your services will be far more valuable to the service perhaps in a sloop or gunboat not in a sailoftheline he stood in the meantime you may wish to avail yourself of the conveniences of the wardroom carry on please kydd stuttered an acknowledgement and left he felt numb the swing from exhilaration to the bleakness of rejection was as savage as it was unexpected the mateofthewatch waited on the open deck sir kydds chest and personal possessions lay in a small heap leave em for now kydd felt every eye on him as he went below to the wardroom the only inhabitant was a marine captain sitting at the table pencilling in an order book he looked up some sort o mistake kydd mumbled im t be replaced oh bad luck old trout kydd took off his coat and sat at the other end of the table as desolation built he tried to subdue the feeling of homelessness of not belonging in this select community he got up abruptly and pulling himself together stepped out on deck he had seen renzi with a party forward getting the topmast ataunt renzi would have no problems of breeding with this captain and later he must find his friend and bid him farewell the officerofthewatch caught sight of kydd and turned with a frown some waiting seamen looked at him with open amusement face burning kydd returned to the wardroom it was halfway through the afternoon and the marine captain had left a young wardroom servant was cleaning the table ah sorry sir ill leave he said collecting his rags no younker carry on kydd said any company was better than none he looked about it was a surprisingly neat and snug space with louvred cabin doors looking inward to the long table along the centreline and the fat girth of the mizzen mast at one end the bulkheads and doors were darkly polished rich mahogany and at the other end there was plenty of light from the broad stern windows even the privacy of a pair of officers quarter galleries she would be an agreeable ship for far voyaging this old class of s were surprisingly numerousstill probably near thirty left in serviceand were known for their usefulness as convoy escorts they could easily crush any predatory frigate yet at a pinch could stand in the line of battle in home waters the mainstay of the major battle fleets was the but overseas vessels like tenacious were the squadron heavyweights kydds depression deepened as he wandered about the wardroom on the rudder head he found a wellthumbed book the sermons of mr yorick raising his eyebrows in surprise he found that it was instead a novel by a laurence sterne and he sat to read halfway into the first chapter and not concentrating he heard a piping of the side and guessed that the captain had returned with news of his replacement word was not long in coming a midshipman pelted down and knocked sharply lootenant kydd sir capn desires you wait on him on deck the officerofthewatch looked at him accusingly his chest and bags obviously a hindrance had been moved to the base of the mainmast be getting rid o them soon kydd said defiantly and went inside to see the captain this time houghton stood up i wont waste our time were under notice for sea and theres no officer replacement readily at hand i see you will be accompanying us after all mr kydd a leaping exultation filled kydds thoughts then a cooler voice told him that the explanation for his change of fortune was probably the inability of the commissioners office to change the paperwork in timean officers commission was to a particular ship rather than the navy as a whole and could not easily be put aside ill not pretend that this is to my liking mr kydd the captain continued but im sure youll do your duty as you see it to the best of your ability he stared hard at kydd you are the most junior officer aboard and i need not remind you that if you fail me then most assuredly you will be landed at the first opportunity i will not fail ye sir umm quite so well perhaps id better welcome you aboard as the fifth of tenacious mr kydd he held out his hand but his eyes remained bleak show your commission and certificates to my clerk and he will perform the needful my first lieutenant has your watch details and you will oblige me by presenting yourself on deck tomorrow morning for duty excitement stole back to seize kydd as he stood in the wardroom supervising his gear being carried down his cabin was the furthest forward of four on the larboard side and he opened the door with trepidation only a short time ago this had been officers private territory it was small he would be sharing his nighttime thoughts with a gleaming black eighteenpounder below and his cot triced up to the deckhead for now ensured that he could never stand upright he would have to find room for his chest cockedhat box sword personal oddments and books a cunningly designed desk occupied the forward width taking advantage of the outward curve of the ships side he pulled at its little drawers and wondered which dead officer had unintentionally left it behind for others the gunport was open at sea it would be closed and then the cabin would be a diminutive place indeed but he had been in smaller he tried the chair at the desk it was tiny but well crafted to fit into such a space tightly but comfortably enfolding his thighs he eased into it and looked around spartan it might be but it was the first true privacy he had ever experienced aboard ship his eyes followed the line of intersection where the bulkhead met the overhead beams the thin panels were slotted at beat to quarters this entire cabin would be dismantled and struck down in the hold below over the door he noticed a ragged line of colour where a curtain had once been fastened to cover the door space he could have the door open and still retain a modicum of privacy it was adequate it was darkly snugand it was his he went to his chest and rummaged around carefully stored at the bottom was his commission undoing the red silk ribbon he unfolded the crackling parchment and read it yet again by the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of great britain lieutenant thomas kydd we to appoint you lieutenant of his majestys ship the tenacious strictly charging the offcers and all the ships company all due respect and obedience unto you their said lieutenant kydd savoured the noble words it concluded sombrely hereof nor you nor any of you may fail as you will answer to the contrary at your peril and for so doing this shall be your warrant it was signed evan nepean secretary to the admiralty and the date of seniority january with the scarlet admiralty seal embossed to the left this single document would figure prominently for the rest of kydds life defining station and position rank and pay authority and rule he creased it carefully and put it away a deep breath turned into a sigh which he held for a long time he turned and found himself confronting a black man tysoe sir james tysoe your servant he said in a wellspoken tone kydd was taken aback not that tysoe was black but at the realisation that here was proof positive of the status he had now achieved ah yes he had had a servant in the gunroom before but this was altogether different then it had been a knowing old marine shared with all the others here the man was his personal valet do carry on if y please kydd said carefully tysoe hesitated i think it were best sir should i stow your cabin thank ye no ill take care of it kydd said with a smile there was nothing too personal in his possessions but the thought of a stranger invading his privacy was an alien notion sir i can do it tysoe said softly something in his voice told kydd that he should let the man go about his business then he realised that of course tysoe needed to know the location of everything if he was to keep his master well clothed and fettled well just be steady with the octant kydd admonished him lieutenant kydd i believe renzi chuckled as he entered the wardroom kydds heart was full but he was still unsettled by his unfortunate welcome to the ship and could only manage aye do i see lieutenant renzi before me renzi dumped a number of wellused order books on the table well my friend it does seem this is a task it would be prudent to begin immediately if not earlier regulations orders directions covering every possible situation each in careful phrasing ensuring that every subordinate in the chain of command would be in no doubt that if any disagreeable situation arose it would not be the fault of his superior from the admiralty article the captain is to demand from the clerk of the survey a book with the inventory of the stores committed to the charge of the boatswain and carpenter article if any be heard to curse or blaspheme the name of god the captain is strictly required to punish them for every offence by causing them to wear a wooden collar article the lieutenant is expected that he do provide himself with the necessary instruments maps and books of navigation and he is to keep a journal according to the form set down and at the end of the voyage shall deliver copies thereof signed by himself into the admiralty and navy offices article no commander shall inflict any punishment upon a seaman beyond twelve lashes upon his bare back with a cat of nine tails according to the ancient practice of the sea the commander in chief of the north sea fleet had his own instructionsfrom the timing of the evening gun when at anchor to conduct when in sight of the enemyall in all a dizzying succession of domestic detail mixed with grave admonitions to duty kydd sensed movement outside well now if im not mistook heres our fourth and fifth lootenants it was a pleasantfaced young officer rubbing his hands with cold ah thomas kydd sir at your service well then my dear sir i am your humble and obedient gervase adams third of this barkywas junior luff in raven sadly no more kydd shook hands grateful for the friendliness adams turned to renzi give you joy of your step renzi he said formally holding out his hand renzi had served for a small time in tenacious as masters mate hed been part of the ships company at camperdown kydd realised that they assumed his origins to be a senior midshipman promoted not someone from forward as he was adams looked over kydds shoulder at the books this is what you should be boning up on m boy he tapped one marked captains orders this owner is new to me but if hes running to form hell expect you to have it by heart in a daythis is the word of the lord hear ye and obey there was a knock at the door and adams crossed to answer it ltenant kydd seems first luff has need of the solace of your company at this time kydd hesitated partly out of concern for the reception he would receive from the captains deputy partly out of confusion as to where to go he knew the first lieutenants cabin would be here in the wardroom the largest one to starboard and right in the stern but it was unoccupied in harbour he sets up shop in the coach next to the captains cabin youll find adams paused bryant the beatific the men call him bulllast ship a frigate and he wants his own command so bad it stinks id steer small with him kydd to be sure sit sir bryant finished his scrawling so mr kydd youre the fifth and junior ive put you with mr bampton as second officerofthewatch until you can prove yourself and ill have you know sir that if you dontand that damn soonill see you broke that i promise understand sir he consulted his paper and youll take the afterguard where youre under my eye he looked up heard you came aft the hard wayand heard elseyoull not be shy in a fight an i like that now you bat square with me and youll do right aye sir kydd was not sure what he was implying and answered cautiously the man with his aggressive outthrust jaw and direct almost angry manner unsettled him ah yesand youll be signal lootenant o course but sir i then youll learn damn it like we all did bryant snapped youve got a signal midshipman rawson and two steady hands on the bunting do y want a wet nurse as well ill do m duty right enough kydd felt himself reddening bryant eased back in his chair lets see you were entered as a landman in ninetythree then shipped in artemis frigate around the world did a few years in the caribbean and came back a masters mate earned their lordships approbation in the late mutiny at the nore and didnt disgrace yourself at camperdown he slapped the papers back into their pack im sure youll do your duty mr kydd he rose now keep station on meits a new wardroom we need to make our number to each other the long table was laid with a starched white cloth and silver was much in evidence it was close on four oclock supper time aboard ship it was always taken considerably earlier than on land kydd lost bryant in a swirl of officers as old friends warmly greeted each other and new ones respectfully made themselves known renzi was deep in conversation with a plainly dressed man who had a curiously neat and sensitive face kydd made to cross to him but a glass was thrust into his hand and adamss pleasant face appeared a tincture with you m friend he said leaning back while a seaman politely plied a bottle the wine was deep and red and eased kydds trepidation your very good health sir kydd said adams smiled then turned to an older lieutenant but before he could speak bryant attended by a steward took the head of the table his back to the stern windows we sit now warned adams and led kydd quickly to the opposite end of the table to one side of the thickness of the mizzen mast growing up at the end then he swung round deftly and sat opposite a buzz of talk arose bryant roared down the table wine with you mr kydd the table fell quiet and kydd caught covert glances in his direction he tried to gather his wits cconfusion to the french he called raising his glass to bryant the words seemed weak and theatrical after the hearty oaths of seamen the marine captain raised his glass and declaimed drily and to ourselvesas no one else is likely to concern themselves with our welfare damn right bryant said vigorously and drank deeply then held up his empty glass talk began again but bryant banged a spoon on the table gentlemen he demanded loudly today sees tenacious with her company of officers complete were in commission and well be rejoining the north sea fleet very shortly i believe its not too soon to make our acquaintance of each other kydd could hear a bottle being opened out of sight as he positioned his glass he was grateful to the wine for settling his apprehensions im your premier my last ship was thetis thirtyeight in the indian ocean where we saw not much o the french worth a spit i hope to see some better sport before long he pitched his voice to the older lieutenant now you sir bampton second luff only officer surviving after camperdown served two years with the north sea fleet in tenacious before he added drily ah was you at the nore mutiny the marine wanted to know yes kydd froze and no i was set ashore by the mutinous villainsbut had the pleasure later of seeing em at a yardarm he gave a thin smile and sipped his wine bryants gaze slipped to adams who took up his cue gentlemen you see before you one gervase adams relict of the raven eighteen firbuilt and cast ashore take heed all ye who would place baltic fir before good british oak and renzis manner was perfect his easy affability brought approving grunts from around the table he raised his glass in kydds direction might i bring forward my particular friend thomas kydd whom you see before you as junior aboard but whose shining parts his modesty forbids him to mention his actions in thwarting a fearful case of barratry while still a child of the sea is well remarked and i owe my continued existence to his acting forcefully in a curious circumstance on an island in the great south sea he it is who conned the longboat in the caribbean that preserved lord stanhope and in all gentlemen we must conclude that mr kydd be truly accounted a favoured son of neptune bryant rumbled loudly hear him kydd reddened and mumbled something the table remained silent that may be so exclaimed adams but be advised kydd its the custom of the service that if youve been around the cape of good hope youre entitled to one foot on the table if youve doubled cape horn both feet on the table but nothing entitles you to spit to windd there was warmth in the easy laughter that followed the old saw kydd had no idea that there was such a fraternity in the officers in their wardroom and he longed to be truly one of them introductions continued the marine turned out to be a captain pringle with a wellpolished line in wardroom wit it seemed that later a brandnew lieutenant of marines would also grace the ship renzis new friend was a mr peake a quietly spoken and erudite gentleman who would be their chaplain and completing the company further along was one not in uniform but wearing a comfortable greenstriped waistcoat he announced himself laconically as pybus the ships surgeon the wardroom dissolved into talk and laughter and a violin out of sight behind the mizzen mast began a soft piece kydd did not recognise at the same time the smell of onion soup filled the air and silently a bowl appeared before him simultaneously a number of covered dishes arrived kydd dear fellow may i assist you to some of these fresh chops adams said as kydd finished his soup sadly we shant see their like again i fear before we next make port behind the chair of each officer stood a seaman or marine to wait at table tysoe was at the back of kydd adams waited until he had withdrawn to see to kydds glass that old blackamoor you have there come down in the world since he was valet de chambre to codrington who you might recollect died of an apoplexy in our very great cabin he leaned forward you dont have to stay with the old fellowask pringle for a marine they know the sea service kydd looked round at the other servants there was none who appeared to be above thirty tysoe had substantial grey in his bushy hair having seen the scrimmages that sometimes took place as servants jostled to see their masters needs met first he had his doubts that tysoe would hold his own but something about the mans quiet dignity touched kydd there were advantages to youth but different ones with maturity and besides were they not both outsiders er no ill keep tysoe kydd answered he saw the glow of contentment in the others as his eye roved over the animated officers eddying talk rose and fell then lulled he heard bampton call down to him his voice studied and casual kydd something or other tells me youre no stranger to the lower deck can this be right bryant frowned the table fell quiet and faces turned to kydd he took a deep breath true very true sir i was untimely taken up as a pressed man and unable t run i find myself still here awkward grins surfaced and pringle murmured to the table in general that wont please the ownernot by half it wont bampton persisted was this not alarming for your family is what i mean damn it all bryant exploded glaring at bampton we were promised figgy duffwhere the devil is it it was a pearly calm winters day when kydd appeared for duty on the deck of the manowar a kings officer after their pressed men had been claimed and come aboard the ships company would be mustered by open list into divisions and kydd would see his men for the first time a hoy from the receiving ship came alongside in a flurry of flapping canvas and shouted orders kydd continued to pace the quarterdeck the arrival of pressed men not his concern out of sight in the waist below the first lieutenant would be setting up to receive them rating the seamen by their skills and consigning the restlandmento the drudgery of brute labour kydd felt contentment at the thought that within a week or so this deck would be alive and heeling to the stern winds of the open ocean renzi fell into step beside him nicholas how did y sleep kydds own experience had not been of the best alone in the dark he had tried to keep the thoughts that surged through him under control the cot a squaresided canvas frame suspended from the deckhead was comfortable but he had not realised that bedding was his own responsibility and were it not for tysoes silent intercession he would have gone without well it must certainly be admitted our elevation to society in this watery world has its distinct attractions renzi wore an indulgent smile which triggered a jet of frustration in kydd after his own experiences it was galling to see renzi take to his new life so easily it is agreeable perhaps but today we get th measure of our men he said impatiently adams was on the opposite side of the deck deep in conversation with a masters mate and also appeared anxious to be started mr kydd he turned to see a dignified older man in plain uniform the man touched his hat hambly sir sailing master good morning mr hambly kydd replied a full master royal navy paying his respects the highest professional being in kydds universe before the mans steady look had a quality of appraisal cool judgement thought id make yr acquaintance sir before kydd could speak he continued mr jarman is m friend kydd remembered the master of the topsail cutter seaflower who had patiently taught him the elements of navigation and whose octant he now used pressed on him after his famed openboat voyage a fine man mr hambly kydd said sincerely i owe him much the master smiled slowly touched his hat to kydd then renzi and left a double strike on the bell sounded forward this was the time for the officers to repair to the great cabin where the shape of things to come would now become apparent gentlemen be seated the captain remained standing staring out of the stern windows i wont keep you long he said it is my intention to conclude the fitting of this vessel for sea as soon as possible i desire that today you shall muster the people by open list and prove your divisions the first lieutenant has assured me he has now a complete watch and station bill bryant nodded emphatically then glanced around at the officers meaningfully there had been frantic work by his writer and clerks the previous night houghton continued sternly he wishes that this shall be advised to all handswith a view to shifting to sea routine within a small space of days the quarters bill will be posted this evening i am assured he withdrew a silver watch shall we say divisions at five bells mr lawes kydd addressed the only masters mate among the group of about twenty men aye sir pleased t see you kydd said touching his own hat at lawess salute he turned to survey the men drawn up on the poopdeck most of his division the able seamen landmen and idlers would still be below for these first proceedings our petty officers mr lawes sir these men were the hard centre of his division the ones in local charge of the seamen at masts yards and guns they would also be at his right hand when his division was tasked for special duty whether the boarding of a prize or the cutting out of an enemyand they would be looking directly to him for their lead this is mr rawson signal midshipman it was the previous days coxswain of the ships boat kydd remembered and mr chamberlain midshipman he was absurdly youthful thought kydd observing his curls and slight build yet he knew this boy had a status and duties that placed him well above the hardiest able seaman samuel laffin bosuns mate darkfeatured and oddly neat in his appearance on his hat he wore a ribbon with tenacious in gold lettering henry soulter quartermaster kydd recognised a natural deepsea mariner and warmed to his softly spoken ways and there were others whom he knew he should remember petty officers of the fighting tops quarter gunners petty officer of the afterguardand rarer birds such as captain of the hold yeoman of the powder room and the carpenters mates in all he would have a fair proportioning of the five hundredodd of tenaciouss company such that most of the skills of a manowar would be at hand if mr kydds division was called away as a unit kydd stepped forward and braced himself to address them they would be expecting some words to set the tone yell find that i play fair but i expect the same from you all you know i come frm before the mast thats no secret but chalk this in yr logi know the tricks an if i see any of em ill be down on ye like thunder i like a taut ship if y see an irish pennant send a hand t secure it if the jobs not finished b end of watch stay until its done and look after yr men if i see you warm n dry on watch while a man has a wet shirt ill have ye exchange with him he felt their eyes on him and he knew what they were thinking how would all this translate to action or was it mere words would he leave it to them the senior hands to deal with things on the spot so long as the objective was achieved to administer justice in the timehonoured ways of the sea in effect would their status be properly acknowledged y have your lists each petty officer would have the watch and station details of every man he was responsible for and lawes would have a master list after today there would be no excuse for any seaman not to know where he should be in every circumstance foreseeable by experience and necessity mr lawes i shall inspect my division in one bell the territory allotted for mustering mr kydds division was the after end of the main deck his men assembled in order three rows on each side facing inboard their ditty bags of clothing at their feet there was controlled bedlam as watch and stations were explained noted and learned friendships discovered between those of like watch and partofship and newrated petty officers got to grips with their duties kydd paced quietly down the middle he could leave it to lawes to muster the men and report when ready while he eyed them surreptitiously a royal navy warship was divided into as many divisions as there were officers in this way each man could claim the ear of his own officer for complaint requests and someone to speak for him at a courtmartial it was a humane custom of the navy but it required that the officer was familiar with his men but the men had other allegiances apart from the specialist artisans the idlers the crew was divided into two watches for routine working of the shipstarboard and larboard watches these would in turn be divided into partsofshipthe focsle maintop afterguard on the quarterdeck and so on as officerofthewatch kydd would therefore be certain to meet his men in another guise if there was a break in routine as when a ship came to her anchor or took in sail for a storm each man had his own particular post of duty his station whether this was up at the main yard fisting canvas or veering anchor cable when hands for mooring ship was piped he had to close up at his station or risk the direst punishment now before tenacious faced the open sea was the time to establish that the ships company was primed and ready for their duty sir division ready fr your inspection said lawes cautiously he was an older masters mate and kydd suspected that his origins were also from before the mast they stepped forward together to the front row the sailors looked ahead vaguely but kydd knew he was under close scrutiny in the future he could be leading them into the hell of a boarding the deadly tensions of a night attack in boatsor seeing them spreadeagled on a grating under the lash you sir whats your name the grogblotched skin rheumy eyes and flaccid ditty bag were a giveaway isaac hannaford s please yer sir and the mans eyes shifted uneasily cant rightly recolleck he finally answered first o starbd sir afterguard lawes said heavily lets see yr clothing then hannaford kydd said the ditty bag was upended to reveal a forlorn unclean assortment mr lawes whats in this mans list sir shirts two stockings four hannaford was an old hand and knew the ropesbut he had sold his clothing for illicit grog come now hannaford youre an old haulbowlings cant you see without kit youre not going t be much use to the barky there was no use waiting for an answer and he rounded on lawes to see th purser for slops t make up his list it would be stopped out of his pay whether that would have any effect was doubtful and each sunday t prove his kit to the petty officer of his watch as lawes scrawled in his notebook kydd passed to the next man thorn sir kydd nodded and moved on he stopped at a finelooking seaman so tall that he stood stooped under the deckhead havent i seen you afore now was it bacchante the med twas right enough sir the man said with a surprised smile but you was masters mate thenno i tell a lie quartermaster as was saw yez step ashore in venice i remembers at kydds expression he hurried to add an its william poulden waist sir second o larbd kydd decided he would see if he could get this good hand changed from the drudgery of being in the waist with the landmen to something more rewarding he stopped at a shylooking youngster with a stye on one eye whats yr station for reefing at th fore ahfore t gallant sheets n clewlines sir the boy said after some thinking hmmm this was a topmanhe should have been quicker to respond and mooring ship t attend buoy an fish tackle he said instantly kydd knew that the quick reply was a guess no topman would be left on the focsle while taking in sail mr lawes this man cn claim his tot only when he knows his stations and he sees the doctor about his eye the rest of his division seemed capable he noted the odd character eyeing him warilybut he would see their quality soon enough when he stood his first watch a distant call sounded from forward a single long note the still the captain was beginning his rounds straighten up then mr lawes see they toe the line properly if you please the rows shuffled into line to kydds eyes their alert and looselimbed bearing infinitely preferable to the perfect rigidity of a line of soldiers he saw the captain approach accompanied by the first lieutenant looking under pressure with the captains clerk and pringle kydd whipped off his hat and prepared for inspection but the captain managed only a rapid glance a nod at kydd and a few words with lawes before he passed to the gundeck below the officers assembled for sail drill had no indication of the captains mind when he appeared from his cabin his fixed expression could mean disappointment at the quality of the men he had seen earlier or satisfaction with the relative ease with which tenacious had been manned in any event now would be the time that reputations were won or lost weakness and strengths revealed not least of which would be that of the captain himself as he reacted to the success or otherwise of the mornings evolutions kydd felt the tension his eyes met renzis and provoked a slow halfsmile as both turned to face their captain loose and furl by mast and watch i shall not want to exercise further todaybut if we are not striking topmasts within the space of three days already at his station on the quarterdeck kydd watched the other officers move to the focsle main deck and forward of the mainmast larbd watch o the handshaaaands to stations for making sail two hundred seamen raced to their stations the fore main and mizzen shrouds black with men heading for the tops others ran to the pin rails at the ships side and the massive square bitts at the base of each mast around which hung a complex maze of ropes along the deck men hurried to the belaying points for important lines running aloft braces halliards sheets petty officers pushed and bullied the hapless landmen into their places showing no mercy to the slowwitted it all seemed so straightforward now but kydd recalled his first daunting experiences at tailing on to a rope in the old gun duke william in these very waters when the muttering cursing and murmuring had settled the captain lifted his speaking trumpet foremast loose all sail to a bowline adams clearly tense and waiting for the start instantly lifted his head and blared up lay aloft royal yardmen lay aloft belay that houghtons face was red with anger and the hard edge in his voice carried forward brace around damn it lay the yard first you fool adamss command had been a mistake firmly anchored and with but one mast with sail abroad there was no opportunity to use another mast with sails backing to balance the forces his order would have seen the ship move ahead and strain at her moorings crimsonfaced adams stood down his men at the halliards shifting them to the forebraces and brought the yards round as he should have done before sending the men aloft to set the sail kydd knew his turn would come the exercise went on at the foremast sail cascaded down at the volley of commands to hang limply forward minutes later men returned to the yards this time to furl the sail to a seamanlike stow houghton said nothing his furrowed brow evidence of the direction of his thoughts mainmast loose all sail to a bowline houghton ordered he was staying with the larboard watch and moving along the masts kydd at the mizzen would be facing his test so much the earlier would his petty officers be reliable enough on the job up there on the mizzen top there was no chance that he himself would ever again be up there with them to see their work intervene if needed chase down laggards it took an effort of will to remain aloof and outside the real action merely to direct in generalbut at the same time the responsibility was his alone mizzen loose all sail to a bowline kydd turned instantly lay aloft an loose mizzen topsl no point in going through the orders in detail from the deck when the captain of the mizzen top was perfectly capable of taking charge on the spot kydd wheeled around and snapped let go brails and vangsman the clew outhaul and out spanker the mizzen did not have a course spread on the crojack to worry about but it did have a mighty fore and aft sail the spanker and this with not only a lower boom but a substantial gaff that had to be bodily raised apeak get those men movin the maudling old women he threw irritably at the petty officer of the afterguard in charge of the halliard crew on deck this was no time to be cautious here directly under the captains eye the mizzen topsail yard was nearly hoisted kydd bit his lip but the sail came tumbling down at just the right time he had been right to trust the men in the top lay aloftloose t garnsl men swarmed up the higher shrouds while below the topsail was settled with the sail hanging down limply as it was kydd had foreseen the need to haul out the foot forward and used the old trick of untoggling the top bowlines from their bridles and shifting them to a buntline cringle he stole a quick glance at houghton the captain stood impassive waiting the topgallant set it was then just the mizzen royaland the gaskets came off smartly at just the time the spanker gaff reached its final position kydd judged that there would be no need on this occasion for play with a jigger at the spanker outhaul and simply waited for the motion to cease start the halliards b a foot or two he warned the afterguardthey had unwisely belayed fully before the order sheepishly they threw off the turns but kydd was startled by a blast of annoyance from the captain what the devil are you about mr kydd not yet finished the sprightly sound of roast beef of old england on fife and drum echoed up from the main deck the men had already taken their issue of grog and gone below for the high point of their noonday meal leaving the deck to the officers and indispensables of the watch as they returned to work to partofship for cleaning kydd thankfully answered the call and made his way to the wardroom the table was spread wine was uncorked and splashing into glasses expressions were easing after the mornings tensions laughter erupted at one end of the table and the fragrance of roast pork agreeably filled the air your good health brother renzi grinned at kydd over his glass he had done tolerably well at the mainmast that morning avoiding the captains wrath at the last moment by quickthinking at the braces thank ye and yours old friend kydd replied there was a lot to think about not the least of which was his standing in this world so utterly different from that of the seaman an insistent tinkling intruded into his thoughts it was the second lieutenant tapping his glass with a spoon gentlemen may i have your attention he waited until the talk died i dont have to tell you that we shall soon be rejoining the fleet which means of course that we shall need to provision against some months at sea he looked pointedly at kydd there are some who are victualled bare navy but have nevertheless seen fit to accept the hospitality of this mess mystified kydd turned to adams who merely raised his eyebrows this is neither fair nor honourable but be that as it may in my humble post as mess caterer i have calculated that we shall need to consider the sum of fifty pounds per annum as a minimum subscription preposterous thats moren five poun a head bryants glass trembled in midair what do we get for that bampton heaved a theatrical sigh the mess commensal wine by quarter cask is half a pint a day captain to dinner once a month we lay in the usual cheeses barrel oysters tea and raisins other conveniences for the pantry such as cloves pickles ginger and the like and when we consider breakages in glasses and dishes kydd thought of the seamans broadside mess with its square wooden plates and pewter tankards the men using their own knives there was little that could be considered breakable and even the petty officers carried few crockery items in their mess racks he decided to lie low while discussions raged about the mess subscription he himself was not pressed for money and he had taken the precaution of appointing an agent the caribbean prizes had long yielded their bounty but camperdown was promising not only a medal but gun money in surprising degree thats settled then bampton made a pencil note and sat back we agree to subscribe the sum of five guineas per head the officers wine store is near empty and with the usual allowance i believe you shall find room for four dozen apieceyou will be laying in your own cabin stores of course now it is usual to empower the mess caterer to go ashore on the wardrooms behalf i shall do so in yarmouth and will expect one guinea in advance from each officer chapter over the next few days the rumble and squeak of gun trucks was a neverending background to shipboard life not content with exercising the company of tenacious at ship drill their captain had a quarter gunner and his four gun crews in turn hard at work from dawn to dusk houghton had been on a gundeck in the longdrawnout battle of the glorious first of june different ships different longsplices was the saying before the mast some captains were particularly keen on appearances others favoured the niceties of seamanship with this one it was gunnery kydd had realised quickly then the awaited sailing orders came within minutes houghton had summoned his officers to his cabin i have here the admiraltys instructionsand i have to say they are not what i was expecting houghton lifted his eyes from the paper enjoying the suspense indeed not it would seem that their lordships believe that after camperdown the north sea fleet may be safely reduced and therefore we are to be sent to join the north american station excited talk broke out sir if we should fit foreign then the first lieutenant needed details not only did there have to be a wholesale holdrestowing but there would no doubt be official impositions from carrying mails to chests of specie for a garrison to prickly passengers and returning prisoners now where in hades do we find real foulweather gear in sheerness pringle muttered gets cold as charity in halifax quite agreed houghton but we shall touch at falmouth for a convoy if my memory serves there is adequate chandlery servicing the atlantic packets id advise you all to wait and procure your cabin stores there youve been to halifax sir i have but not since his highness took up his post sir his royal highness prince edward our only overseas possession to boast a prince of the blood quite turned society on its head ive heard houghton stood up gentlemen may i remind you there is not a moment to be lost the first lieutenant will provide a list of actions that will result i trust in our being under way for the downs in two days haaaands to unmoor ship aaaall the hands all hands on deck although expected the order brought a rush of excitement at the first move in putting to sea for a voyage of who knew how long a smack poled away from the sides of the ship the tender now released from its workaday fetching and carrying her crew waved up at the big twodecker flying the blue peter at the fore masthead she was outward bound to foreign parts to mysterious worlds across the oceans while they remained at home kydd stood easy on the focsle waiting with his party to bring the anchors to final sea stowage decks below in the fetid gloom the capstans would be manned and the fearsome job of winning her anchors would be acted out thankfully this was not his concern the soft green of the land held a tinge of melancholy how long before he would see these shores again what adventures lay waiting just a brief stop in falmouth to pick up the convoy then he might be looking on his native england for the last timedeaths by disease and accident far exceeded those from enemy action kydds thoughts were interrupted by a swirl of muttering from his men as they watched a fishingboat putting out from the shore under every stitch of sail and heeled to her gunwales it was making directly for tenacious kydd went to the deckedge and saw it come to clumsily at the sidesteps a redcoat stood up swaying and started waving and shouting the man obviously wished to board but the sideropes were no longer rigged kydd could hear shouting as a number of sailors gathered at the ships side a rope was flung down knocking the man to his knees the fishermen fashioned a bowline on a bight and passed it under the mans arms and to barely muffled laughter he was hoisted spinning and kicking aboard tenacious his baggage followed quickly this would be the longexpected junior marine officer kydd guessed but when he looked next both marine and baggage had disappeared he glanced up the men aloft were at their placethe cast would be to larboard and his men deployed accordingly bampton waited at the gangway watching kydd with disdain but with a clear hawse and the tide not yet on the make kydd was confident he knew what to do over the bow the starboard cable curved down into the greybrown sea the anchor buoy bobbing jauntily seventy feet ahead from the low hawse hole the twentytwoinch cable gradually tautened a heavy shuddering settling to a steady passing inboard checking yet again that the cat and fish falls were led properly along the deck kydd watched the anchor buoy inching towards the ship until the buoy boat grappled it the process grew slower the steeper the angle of cable until at last it was up and down short stay he growled at a seaman who whipped up a white flag the quarterdeck at the other end of the ship now knew that the anchor was ready to be tripped from the seabed it would be essential to loose sail the instant this happened the ship under way and therefore under control immediately otherwise she would simply drift with the wind all waited in a tense silence kydd looked over the fat beakhead the cable had stopped passing in and he could imagine the savage struggle taking place at the capstan suddenly the cable resumed its movement and kydd sensed the ship feel her freedom shes atrip he snapped the mans arm came down with anchor aweigh tenacious was now no longer tethered to the land she was at sea houghtons voice sounded through the speaking trumpet sail dropped from yards and staysails jerked aloft he was taking a chance that the remainder of the cable would be heaved in and the anchor duly catted by the powerful tackle before the ship got too much way on kydd looked over his shoulder down the deck when he saw houghtons challenging figure he knew he must not fail the first ripple of water appeared about the stem at the same time as the inchesthick anchor ring broke surface stoppers roared kydd it was now a race to uncouple the anchor from the cable and heave it clear of the water before the wake of the ship established itself hook on he leaned over the side to see men were furiously passing the stoppers on the cable which would then be ready for hauling in at the hawse he wheeled round and cannoned into the second lieutenant winding him have a care damn you sir bampton said venomously aye sir kydd burned the officer had no right to be there in a difficult operation for which he had no responsibility the situation was well in hand on hearing the hook on the quickwitted focsle party had without orders taken the strain and begun hauling vigorously on the big catfall kydd had seen pouldens leadership in this and blessed his recommendation to have the seaman transferred from the waist the squealing of sheaves stopped as the anchor rose to the projecting cathead well there the cat it had done its duty by hoisting the anchor out of the sea he turned back to the side and called down pass th ringpainterget that stopper on fast the three and a half tons of forged black iron was now being buffeted by passing waves there was a problem with the stoppering the ropes passed to restrain the great weight of the cable a hundred pounds in every six feet it was a slithering monster if it worked free another focsleman swung round the beakhead to help but with the vessel now under way and a frothy bowwave mounting the situation was getting out of control poulden kydd barked get down an get the fishtackle on the tall seaman dropped to the swaying anchor and balancing on its arms like a circus acrobat took the fishtackle and applied it firmly below the inner fluke kydds early intervention enabled the anchor to be hauled up sideways out of the race of water while the crossed turns at the cable were cleared away walk away with the fish y sluggards kydd ordered satisfied he had been right tenacious was a seakindly ship her regular heave on the open sea reminiscent of a large frigate even if there was more of the decorum of the mature lady about her kydd lingered on the focsle after the party had secured the hypnotic lift and crunch of the bows was soothing and he closed his eyes for a moment in contentmentbut when he opened them again he saw four seamen looking at him resentfully straightening he took off his hat the sign that he was there but not on duty and left it was their focsle and the men off watch had every right to their relaxation he no longer belonged there he had left their world and entered a higher one but in its place did he now have anything that could provide the warmth and companionship he had enjoyed before on the way back as he passed the belfry there was a sharp clang seven bells of the forenoon watch until safely anchored once again there would always be for every hour of the day or night a full complement of hands taking care of the ship keeping watch and ward over their little community in the endless wastes of ocean kydd was due to go on duty with mr bampton as officerofthewatch and himself as second he made his way to the quarterdeck where the captain held conference with the first lieutenant they paced along the weather side deep in conversation while kydd waited respectfully on the leeward at ten minutes before the hour bampton mounted the main companion to the deck he was in comfortably faded sea rig with the modest gold lace allowed a lieutenant bleached to silver a few months at sea would have kydds brandnew blues in the same way kydd was at his post early and he said peevishly i thought to see you below mr kydd sir kydd touched his hat no matter pray keep station on me and dont trouble to interrupt if you please bampton waited impatiently for the captain to notice him sir to take the deck if you please kydd heard the captains wishes passedcourse and sail set special orders i have the ship sir bampton said formally and thereby became commander pro tem of hms tenacious his eyes flickered to kydd then he turned to the mateofthewatch ill take a pull at the lee forebrace he said and the same at the main he looked up considering send a hand to secure that main tgallant buntlineand i mean to have all fore n aft sail sheeted home in a proper seamanlike manner if you please he turned on his heel and paced away down the deck kydd didnt know whether to follow or stay at attention he compromised by taking a sudden interest in the slate of course details stowed in the binnacle nobbut a jib n staysl jack he overheard the quartermasters low growl to his mate and saw no reason to correct the observation it was a hard beat down channel a relentless westerly heading them and the brood of merchant shipping that was taking advantage of the company of a ship of force they clawed their way tack by tack driven by the need to make falmouth and the convoy on time the wind strengthened then fell and eased southerly allowing a tired ships company to shape course past the eddystone albeit in an endless succession of rain squalls the master put up the helm and bore away for falmouth as the yards came round and the wind and seas came in on the quartera pleasant lift and pirouette for him a lurching trial for the landmenkydd looked ahead hed never been to falmouth the legendary harbour tucked away in the craggy granite coast of cornwall it would be the last stop in england before the vastness of the atlantic ocean the master stood hunched and still raindrops whipping from his dark oilskins and plain black hat this man held a repository of seamanship experiences and knowledge that even the longestserving seaman aboard could not come close to he could bring meaning and order into storm calms and the unseen perils of rock and shoal kydd moved up and stood next to him my first visit t falmouth mr hambly he said id be obliged should you tell me something of the place the head turned slowly eyes cool and appraising your first mr kydd i dare say it wont be yr last while this war keeps on he resumed his gaze forward a fine harbour falmouth in the lee of the lizard and big enough for a fleet at the beginning o last year you may recollect the great stormtwas then four hundred sail sheltered fr three weeks in falmouth without we lost one fine port mr kydd then why doesnt we have the channel fleet there instead of plymouth the masters expression cracked into a smile why now sir thats a question cant concern an old shellback like me th hazards no hazards sir we have nine mile o tenfathom water inside carrick roads and no current moren a knot or two the coast firmed out of the clearing grey rain a repelling blueblack only now showing here and there a tinge of green to larboard of them the great promontory of the lizard thrust into the channel the hurrying seas had changed direction and were now heading in the same direction as tenacious hambly pointed to a jumble of broken coastline the manacles kydd had heard of their reputation an here is where youll find the great sea wrack and th bloody sea dock hambly added seaweed in course the bottom grey sand mixed wi bits o shell and brown gravel but as soon as y finds barley beards or cornets think t turn up th hands an shorten sail when approaching a coast in fog or other murk the only indication of its proximity was a change in the appearance of what was brought up in the hollow base of the hand leadline armed with tallow to kydd this was singular these tiny sea mites had been born and died deep in the bosom of the sea the first time they met the light of this world was when they were hauled up by a seaman to convey the means of preserving the life of half a thousand souls held in thrall kydd stared over the grey seascape and its here youll fin the sea grampusan the baskin shark o course as big as yr longboat he is but as harmless as a sucking shrimp mr hambly bampton cut in sharply from behind be so kind as to attend your dutieswere but a league from st anthonys aye aye sir hambly said calmly and crossed to the binnacle in front of the wheel he picked up the traverse board and deliberately matched the march of its pegs with the scrawled chalk of the slate log then looked up at the impassive quartermaster very good son he said and resumed his vigil forward an occluding head of land opened to an indentation and the smaller sail accompanying them began to converge on the same place st anthonys hambly murmured as the headland fringed with white pulled back to reveal an opening in the lowering coastline no more than a mile wide on the western side was the stark squat greyishwhite of a broad castle turret pendennis an falmouth lies beyond he turned to the officerofthewatch topsls will suffice sir by this time the captain had appeared on deck but he made no attempt to relieve the officerofthewatch bosun all hands on deck pipe hands to shorten sail kydd wondered at bamptons order to his eyes there was no urgencythe watch on deck were quite capable of taking in the courses one by one the calls pealed out and men tumbled up from below to take in the big lower sails keep the men on deck if you please bampton ordered youll beware black rock hambly warned bampton a pile o broken rocks squatting athwart th entrance right in our course he pointed to a flurry of white around a mound of black right in the centre of the harbour entrance which side mr hambly bampton asked the eastern sir deepest channel a point to starboard snapped bampton the quartermaster spoke quietly to the helmsman who set the bowsprit pointing off to starboard of the gloomy black whaleback not as youd say difficult hambly said you sees black rock at halftide and on th overflow you cn be sure theres three fathom over the bar within a coastal brig sailing at the same rate converged on the eastern passage with tenacious both vessels were before the wind they drew closer the smaller vessel seemed to ignore their presence the captain snatched up the speaking trumpet from its bracket the brig ahoy sheer off bear away this instant a shipoftheline was far too ponderous to play games he means to head us through houghton exclaimed in disbelief you villains bear off you must give way to a kings ship damn you houghton stalked forward eyeing the menace of black rock ahead give him a gun forrard he roared a sixpounder on the focsle banged out the gunsmoke was borne away in a body through the entrance but the brig paid no heed her main yard dipping and swaying closer and closer to their own lower rigging we take the eastern channel let that villain choose the west houghton snapped the brigs shallower draught would allow him the passage aye aye sir lay black rock close to larbd and hold your course bampton acknowledged just two hundred yards from black rock the brig diverged to the other side of the danger the seaweedcovered rocks were now in close detail all eyes followed the rogue vessel still under full sail plunging past the hazard sir the helmsman called urgently unable to release the wheel he indicated vigorously with his head with all attention on the brig they had not noticed two fishing smacks closehauled under fore and aft sail crossing their bows to leave harbour they shot into view from behind st anthonys head to starboard seeing the brig they changed their minds and tried to go about floundering in stays dead ahead bamptons mouth openedbut closed again the channel was only a few hundred yards wide with black rock to one side and the high headland of st anthony to the other it didnt take much imagination to see that running downwind as they were backing or dousing sail to stop their way was impossibleeven if this was achieved tenacious would probably slew helplessly round to cast up on shore the smacks were doomed helm alarbd hambly calmly told the man at the wheel keep with th land a cable or so no bampton hesitated he could not utter the words of contradiction that would firmly sheet home to him responsibility for the next few minutes the master kept his eyes ahead his face tranquil tenaciouss bows slowly paid off towards the raindark coast towering so near to starboard individual tumbling rock formations could be made out seagulls perched on them watching the big ship curiously the swash of their wake the slat and creak of shipboard noises were loud in the silence theyd avoided the smacks but another danger presented sprawled across their track was a new headland with a round castle prominent on its heights but hambly kept his course should you hambly did not deign to notice bampton kydd saw the problem if they could not come hard round their only other action to starboard was to head ignominiously into a creek just opening up he held his breath then felt the first puff of a playful easterly coming down the creek depth of water close to local windsthe master had known the edge of their sails shivered and hambly said over his shoulder well brace up i believe as they did so kydd saw that without any movement at the helm the ships bow swung safely away from the shore aye the set of th ebb hambly said and unexpectedly smiled hms tenacious found her course again and came to anchor in the spacious expanse of carrick roads and falmouth kydd hugged his boatcloak around him as the officers gig left the shelter of the ships side sails to a single reef he pulled his hat tighter and smiled weakly at renzi through spats of spray a straggle of low buildings along the shoreline falmouth was a small town tucked away just inside the western headland around from the ruined pendennis castle inside the harbour clusters of smaller ships were moored close before the town but the majority of shipping assembling for the convoy crowded into carrick roadsa mass of merchant ships of all kinds and destinations with boats under sail or oar crisscrossing the waters fish strand renzi told the coxswain as they approached the town the gig headed past the anchored vessels for the tiny quay return before dusk if you please he ordered and the two friends stepped ashore if you should desire a restorative the first and last on market street seemed to meet the billwith a jolly tavernkeeper and roaring fire in the taproom to accompany their hot spiced rum fish strand kydd said cupping his toddy indeed mr pringle assures us that somewhere about here well find all we need to preserve the soul in the wilderness of nova scotia renzi pulled a battered guinea from his pocket and it seems that i should return with a proof suitable for a diminutive midshipman against boreass worst lieutenants did no watches in harbour this was a duty for masters mates and midshipmen kydd acknowledged that it was very satisfactory to be free to go ashore as the spirit moved and he was privately relieved to be away from the atmosphere in the wardroom a greyhaired man of some quality entered the alehouse he saw the two naval officers and inclined his head then signalled to the potboy and came across good afternoon gentlemen do i see officers of that fine twodecker in the roads you do sir renzi answered lieutenants kydd and renzi of his majestys ship tenacious at your service greaves lawrence greaves and your noble vessel is bound for north america she is ah then you will be our guardian angel our protector of this trade perhaps greaves was clearly no stranger to sea passagesa trade was the common maritime term for a convoy may i sit with you he asked my wife and i will be embarked on the city of sydney for halifax the potboy hovered the same or would you prefer wine the grey was confined to his sidewhiskers and his eyes were genial your first visit it will be kydd admitted but ill wager this is not your first sir no indeed im commissioner for lands in halifax as it happens returning to my post then sir it puzzles me t know why you dont take the packet serviceits much the faster kydd said seeing a smart brigantine with the blue peter at her masthead through the tavern window no mystery my friend my wife is no sailor and insists on the conveniences of a larger vessel and for me i much prefer the comforting presence of one of his majestys menowar about me do you know much of these packets not a great deal sir but that they do carry inviolable protections against the press said renzi well then the postoffice packet small but fast the mails of the kingdom are entrusted to these and not only that but passengers and speciebullion for treasury interchange they risk tempest and privateers to make a fast passage and i ask you to conceive of the value to a merchant of receiving his letterofcredit by reply within fifteen weeks of consigning his petition to an atlantic crossing kydd murmured an appreciation but greaves leaned forward a nest of villains sir they carry the kings mails but should they spy a prize they will not scruple to attack at risk of their cargoand worse even under the strictest postoffice contract they weigh down their vessel with private freight to their common advantage and should this not be enough it is commonly known that while the post office will recompense them for a loss at sea to an enemy profit may just as readily be won from the insurances a crack of gunfire drew their attention to the brigantine her blue peter was jerking down with vigorous activity at her foredeck windlass ah yes shell be in halifax two weeks before usif the privateers let her kydd put down his glass mr greaves have you any suggestions fr preserving body n soul in halifax weve heard it can be grievous cold at times why yes but youll be paying over the odds here youll find pray wait until halifax and you will quickly acquire an embarrassment of stout gear shall we raise a glass to the success of our voyage just curious kydd said as they strolled down the seasmelling streets of falmouth the keening herring gulls raucous along the seafront clouds of them swooping on the boats landing freshcaught fish then if you must here is one such with a pang kydd reflected that this was like the old days when he and renzi had been carefree sailors wandering together in seaports around the world outside the shop a large signboard announced the falmouth bazaar prop james philp stationer perfumer patent medicines and dealer in fancy goods to the falmouth packet service the interior was odorous with soaps and perfumery an aladdins cave of massed fabrics baubles and necessaries the tawdry and the sublime no passenger facing the prospect of more than a month at sea would lack for suggestions of what to include in their baggage the shopkeeper approached them if i cn be of service to you gennelmen he said gripping his lapels you have a fine range o stock kydd said fingering a lace shift of unusual stoutness we have indeed said the shopkeeper and what may i enquire might interest you further into the store kydd saw a couple looking curiously their way what do y have for the run t halifax he asked leather an velvet reticules pursesprings clarionets o superior tone dissected maps pope joan boards wi genuine pearl fish ivory walkin stick with sword aye that will do said kydd ignoring the ingratiating tone ill think on it the two left then turned on to killigrew street where they came across bampton kydd lifted his hat politely mr kydd he responded archly i admire your sangfroid sir there is a convoy assembling to sail tolerably soon and you see fit to linger ashore at your pleasure when as signal lieutenant you know there is a convoy conference to conduct you must be confident it will not sail this age convoy conference why of course a signal lieutenant do you not read your standing orders his sniff of disdain incensed kydd flagship of the escort and the first lieutenant has not a staff for signals i shouldnt wonder that at this moment he has the ship in a moil looking for her signal lieutenant hardly a flagship thought kydd as he left the first lieutenants cabin just two menowar the shipsloop trompeuse and the sixpounder brig viper both near hidden by the increasing numbers of merchant ships assembling in carrick roads bryant had not been searching for him he seemed mildly surprised that the new signal lieutenant had cut short his run ashore to hurry back on board papers for the ships masters had not yet been completed and in any event houghton had not yet indicated his wishes in the matter of the signal codes to be used in the convoy loyally renzi had returned on board with kydd and joined his friend as he headed for the upper deck are we to panic do you think he murmured not as who should say but t play the ignoramus does not sit well wi me what are youll see with a bored look on his face the duty masters mate was standing by the main shrouds with his telescope of office he was clearly taken with the idea kydd put to him bosuns mate desire midshipman rawson to present himself on the quarterdeck mr rawson said kydd to the wary youth your boathandling im sorry t say is not of the standard we expect aboard a sailotheline and a flagship at that rawson mumbled something but kydd clapped him on the shoulder but dont ye worry lad today you an i will go asailing together and you could learn something t your advantage renzi looked at him curiously but kydd went on an then you shall show me what y know of signals for the rest of the forenoon kydd took away the twentyfivefoot gig and a boats crew and in his turn rawson discovered what it was to sail under kydds patient direction and in the brisk winds of the roads the lug foresail and mizzen were dipped and backed brailed and reefed while rawson found how to read a wind to give best to a squall and when to ship washstrakes while the boat plunged between the anchored merchantmen kydd hid his apprehension before long he would have to stand alone on the quarterdeck taking command as a full officerofthewatch in a major warship the afternoon saw a changed rawson respectful increasingly confident and ready to fall in with kydds wishes we shall rig for signalling if y please sir for exercise hands to stations fr signalling kydd repeated firmly aye aye sir rawson said hastily it took some time to find the other signal midshipman and four seamen and just as long to find the little table for the signal log are we ready kydd checked on his signals crewrawson and three of the seamen at the flaglocker and his own midshipman messenger with another sir then we shall begin mr rawson please t change places with yr young friend i want you on hand now ye see trompeuse lying there fine t larboard were senior and will want to have her responding to our motions ive spoken with her commander he is persuaded t exercise his own signals crew so we will play the admiral the flaglocker was set snugly across the taffrail right at the after end of the raised poopdeck handy for the mizzen peak signal halliards the locker had dozens of neat miniature doors each with a brightly painted image of a flag have you a list of these b chance kydd asked casually rawson brought over a dogeared pocket book this belonged to the last signal ltenanthe didnt survive camperdownand now its yours it was a handwritten notebook of useful information gleaned from the fighting instructions and other sources sir in the front here we have our flags this is the code of admiral howe that we carry and its just numbersought to nine we have some others the affirmative the preparative an that but its best you see em in action all we do is look in this part of the signal book and we have codes for two hundred and sixty signals spelled out by number he glanced at kydd doubtfully and continued so if we want to tell our ships break through the enemy line and engage em from the other side then we look up in the headings find the signal and its twentyseven which we hoist seems clear enoughbut what if we want t tell them to stay about all together how do we let em know when t put the helm down ah thats easy the order is hoisted up so all cn see it then when they all say theyre ready we pull it down sharply which is the signal or we can use the preparative flag if the admiral wants to give us time t get ready but what if we want t do something that doesnt have a code in the book what do we then rawson scratched his head cant send it he admitted so that was the reason kydd realised for the many occasions he had known when his ship had laboriously come up within hail of a senior and the two ships had rolled along together while angry communications took place by speaking trumpet he tried not to think of the impossibility of doing this in the smoke and violence of battle and took up the little signal book again so lets amuse trompeuse i see here i can order her to open fire on th closest enemyso lets be having it i find the code here er begging your pardon mr kydd but we hoists trompeuses pennant first so he knows the signal is for him which we finds here at the flaglocker a yellow and blue pennant was taken deftly toggled to the signal halliard then sent soaring aloft on another halliard the twoflag code was hoisted close up kydd waited for a reaction a red and white pennant jerked aloft from the brig the answering pennant crowed rawson they see and will obey their own signal brought down one made its way up the mast of the little ship rawson dived for the book ninesevenone i have to report there has been undue mortality in my rats at kydds expression he explained gleefully its a sign means they could have fever aboard the evening grog issue cut short their sport and kydd went below with the signal book the system seemed rational enough but he could foresee problems what if the wind was gusting towards them from a ship it would set her flags endon and in any kind of battle with its vast amount of powdersmoke flags would be invisible so signals is the life for you adams said seems t be all plain sailing to me and is a mort better than chokin on smoke in the gundeck adams adjusted his cravat it was an open secret that a certain landlady was bestowing her favours liberally under certain expectations not unconnected with adamss solitary visits ashore pray dont be too cocksure dear chap he said with feeling a reputation can be destroyed by false bunting just as easily as putting a ship ashore kydd smiled but closed the book he felt reasonably secure in his knowledge of signals and despite bamptons acid words surely there could not be much more to add that he needed to say to a crowd of merchant seamen with the ship about to sail it made sense to sup on the fat of the land while they could nicholas i have a fancy to step ashore again are you interested falmouth renzi ruminated hiding a smile this is the valubia of virgilyou have probably overlooked that passage in the aeneid describing falmouth let me see est in recessu longo lo cus insula portum it goes as i remember you will recognise the dryden too where vale with sea doth join into its purer hands twixt which to ships commodious port is shown sir it was a small midshipman at the door the captain sir desires mr kydd to attend on him before he lands should it be convenient the convoy instructions have arrived mr kydd houghton grunted his clerk scratched away to one side a sizeable pile of paper mounting beside him sir and the convoy will sail in two days houghton looked up at him i am senior officer and i will be calling a conference of ships masters for tomorrow afternoon at two you will attend of course and will probably wish to prepare my clerk when hes finished will disclose to you my private signals and wishes in respect of the escorts mark my words i mean to brook no insolence from the master of any merchant vessel and i will have obedience i want you to make this quite plain aye aye sir kydd said turning to go and may i have a convoy signal list houghton started in annoyance of course not have you forgotten they are secret the losing of just one such can lead our convoy into ambuscade the loss of millions disgrace to our flag all are accounted for sir and are now under guardim surprised you see fit to ask such a thing it was a shock first the level of secrecy to which he was now privy but second that he had not given it much thought simple courage and seamanship were no longer the only things that would matter in the future houghton grunted very well you may study a signal list in the lobby while mr shepheard is working any notes you take will be kept by him also that is all mr kydd his heart sank the mass of detail about fleet signals was exhaustive once under way and at sea each ship would be an island unreachable except for these signals kydd leafed through the orders for distinguishing signals and vanes then the instructions on to the formation of the convoy it would apparently be a multicolumn square advancing over the ocean the name of each ship was filled in and assigned a number which turned out to be its column and row position and the three escorts were positioned around them tenacious with a tiny flag added to her name in the van the bulk of the details however was taken up with resolving problems before they occurred he turned more pages in dismay even putting to sea in good order required special flags to be hung out from odd places about the ship a red and white weft at the mizzen peak indicated that a ship wished to speak probably for some urgent concern a signal of required the unfortunate ship concerned to hoist a yellow flag and steer straight for an enemy in a warlike manner imitating the action of a warship it went on kydds eyes glazed he began to resent the implied assumption that a naval officer could do anything at a moments notice and tried not to think of what he had to face in less than a day was it possible to get to grips with so much in that time marines at the landing pier clashed to present arms when captain houghton stepped out of the boat and more lined the way along arwenack street to the customs house where the conference was due to take place with their marine guard kydd paced along stoically behind houghton and his first lieutenant lugging the padlocked bag of signal instructions and trying to ignore the curious glances of the townsfolk at the customs house a big squarelooking stone building with a brace of captured french cannon at the entrance they were met by a prosperouslooking individual wearing an oldfashioned tricorne hat capn houghton raddles collector o customs welcome to falmouth an your convoy gentlemen are awaitin within they passed inside along a mustysmelling passage been here before sir without waiting for an answer he went on the long room is where they meets mostly they entered a large room with barnstyle beams and imposing floorlength windows it was noisy as some hundreds of plainly dressed and weatherworn seamen were present the babble died as they entered and those standing in groups moved to take chairs kydd followed houghton up the aisle to the front conscious of heads turning there was a small lectern a chalkboard and a table just three chairs facing the hundreds seated waited houghton took the centre chair and kydd the left bryant was on the right the talking died away the collector introduced the officers briefly with a bow and a gesture then left the captain wasted no time he stepped up to the lectern and fixed his glare on the audience i am senior officer of the escorts on this voyage you will have ships of force with you and need fear nothing from the french as long as you sail agreeable to the plan runners will not be tolerated unless arrangements are in hand do i make myself clear kydd knew that runners were individual ships that tired of the slower speeds of a convoy and struck out ahead alone they were taking a chance and were on their own but stood to gain a lot when theirs was the first cargo landed we have a favourable wind and i intend to proceed tomorrow forenoon with the tide if you have any objections to the sailing plan you may see me in tenacious up to six hours before we weigh otherwise i will take it that you agree to its provisions and will abide by them he gripped the sides of the lectern have you any questions no a restless stirring went through the meeting houghton relaxed his stance lieutenant kydd here will present the sailing plan and explain the signals kydd felt a moment of panic but remembered to nod and smile under the scrutiny of so many eyes he had a deep sense of responsibility that so many merchant seamen were putting their trust in the navy then it is only left for me to wish you fair winds and a successful voyage good day gentlemen to kydds relief houghton and the first lieutenant strode together down the aisle and left he had no wish for his performance to be seen by anyone from tenacious aware of a rustle of expectation he moved to the lectern and stood before the sea of stony faces ltenant kydd signal lieutenant in tenacious his voice came out thin and unconvincing i want t talk to you about our convoy to halifax an newfoundland he said trying to toughen his tone and especially the conduct o your ships when given direction by th escorts my captain has particularly asked me to so what if we cant agree wi your direction young feller a hardfaced man towards the front had risen to his feet the kings service knows aught o what worries us so why should we do everythin you tell us eh kydd stuttered a weak reply another master got up more to the back but his voice boomed out effortlessly tell us mr lootenant kydd truly now have ye ever crossed the atlantic in a blow come on son don be shy when its blowin great guns n muskets squalls comin marchin in aweather lee gunnels under half th time have ye er myself im no stranger t foul weather good then youll be able t tell us how in hades we cn spy all your flags an numbers in a fresh blow an all the two captains sat down to a murmur of agreement in front of him were experienced seamen who had been to sea before he was born and whose sea wisdom cast his own into pale insignificance kydd saw that bryant had returned and was standing at the end of the hall listening to him should ye not make out our signal y keep the answering pennant at the dip he went on hesitantly he saw some leaning forward straining to hear if th weather bryant marched up the aisle grimfaced kydd yielded the lectern to him im ltenant bryant first o the tenacious he began challenging them with his tone and glowering at them individually ltenant kydd is my assistant he flashed a dispassionate glance at kydd now we have a convoy to get under way afore noon tomorrow so no more nonsense if y please any who wants to argue with a kings ship knows what to expect he took a wad of instructions and held them up as you all know this is how we conduct our convoy as usual ill start at th beginning remembering all youve been told about keepin this under lock n key convoy assembles in falmouth roads outside the harbour each ship t rig their coloured vane to fly at the fore or main accordin to the instructions not forgetting your number good and plain on each sternquarter order o sailing and first rendezvous you should have by you before we leave bryant leaned forward on the lectern now heres a thing my captains a right tartar he is a hard horse driver whos always on our necks hes your senior officer now so i advise you all t spread what canvas you need to keep the convoy closed up an all together he allowed that to sink in then went on signal code for the convoy is in two parts and provision is made the presentation continued kydd stood awkwardly beside bryant resentful yet admiring of his easy competence then the conference drew to a close and a line of merchant captains came forward to sign the register and take custody of their convoy instructions they left to return to their ships the blue peter would soon be at each masthead kydd picked up his gear avoiding bryants eye he was startled to hear him give a quiet laugh they falls out o the line of sailin you know what we do give em a shot in the guts sets em into a more cooperative frame of mind it does bryant helped kydd heap paper rubbish into the bag this would later be burned but the biggest threat we can use is to report em to lloyds he continued they show stubborn we tell lloyds an then they have to explain to their owners why their insurance premiums just doubled before kydd could say anything bryant had consulted his watch and stalked off chapter god blast his eyes houghtons fists were clenched and he shook with fury ill see this rogue roast in hell hoist his number on the lee fore halliard and give him another gun the signal for lie to and await orders before proceeding still flew from tenaciouss mizzen peak together with lady anns distinguishing number it was inconceivable that the shabby timber ship could not understand the need to form up the convoy properly before their voyage began she seemed intent on heading off into the general distance vaguely bound for the west despite the plain sight of so many other ships hove to with brailedup canvas waiting for the remainder of the convoy to issue out from the inner anchorage kydd marvelled at the sight in front of him ships large and small a vast mass of vessels filling the wide bay bustling between them were the two smaller escorts the whole scene was an expression of economic strengthand vulnerability if britain could preserve this great stream of trade goods arriving and leaving the kingdom her survival was assured if not the end of this cataclysmic war would not be far off at last lady ann slewed and hove to but her actions had meant tenacious had moved well out of station and had to heave round back to the assembly points her captain was fuming his officers on edge and the ships company thoroughly badtempered the last of the joiners came through the harbour entrance past black rock and into the open sea convoy will proceed roared houghton glaring at his signal lieutenant as though it was all his fault kydd found the place in the signal book and hastily shouted the hoist to those at the taffrail flaglocker flags were bent on soaring up the halliards as the thump of their focsle gun drew attention to them have they acknowledged yet snapped houghton kydd had his telescope up trying to locate trompeuse and viper just two sail among so many well kydd saw the three gunboats of the ports standing force which had been detached to see the convoy to sea and were temporarily under houghtons command but he could not spot the low halfdecked twomasted craft good god do i have to viper acknowledges sir it was bampton at the officerofthewatchs telescope and trompeuse kydd added finding the small shipsloop then he spotted the vessel sliding into the line of sight from behind a bulky saltcarrier a red and white pennant at her signal halliards a gunboat answers sir houghton took a deep breath then hoist and execute for pennant ships damn your eyes rawson already had the signal bent on and swooping up the rigging where it fluttered gaily for several minutes then jerked down one by one from random places in the milling ships trusted merchant vessels followed the lead of tenacious and hoisted a yellow triangular flag above an unmistakable red and white squarethe halifax convoy first tenacious then the pennant ships marking leading positions in the convoy purposefully set their bowsprits to the open atlantic and a pattern formed after them ship after ship fell into column jockeying with shortened sail into their order of sailing menowar chivvied and snapped at the heels of the laggardly and the vast fleet headed away from the land the gunboats returned to port well before they had left the outer falmouth roads and laid the deadly manacles to starboard the signal for escorts to take station was made tenacious led the convoy she and her consorts on the windward side of the mass of shippingthe best position to drop down quickly on any of their charges if they were attacked viper to leave the stragglers and come up to station houghton ordered testily never know whats waiting for us out there the inevitable late starters would have to catch up as best they could one lumbering merchantman was caught flat aback when avoiding another and kydd could see its helpless gyration through his glass as it gathered sternway and turned in reverse in obedience to the last helm order a greywhite wall of drizzle approached silently in the westerly wind the craggy loom of the peninsula to starboard was no threat but when they reached its end the notorious lizard they would leave its shelter and face whatever the atlantic ocean could bring damn bampton cursed the light rain had reached them and was beginning a damp assault while houghton kept the deck no one dared go below and all had to suffer coats heavy with wet and rivulets of cold water wriggling down their necks the captain stood aggressively as the rain ran down his face kydds crew shivered and clutched their coats but none dared ask to leave the deck suddenly houghton started who has the watch i sir responded bampton i shall be in my cabin houghton wheeled round and left other officers followed his example and went below but kydd knew he must stay so he moved down from the exposed poopdeck bampton called for his watchcoat and kydd his oilskins but then the rain ceased and the wind resumed a chill buffeting kydd used his signals telescope to survey the slowmoving convoy once they made the open sea beyond the lizard they would spread more sail for best speed but if the stragglers could not make up the distance before they met the friendless ocean they would be in trouble in the main they were closing manfully but a small gaggle were now miles astern locked together kydd shuddered with the cold and lowered the telescope but something made him raise it again the larger of the stopped vessels had one corner of her main course drawn up to the yard a peculiar action at sea he steadied the glass leaning back with his elbow braced on his chest to see better there was activity but it was not coordinated straining to make it out he waited for a spasm of shivering to subside and concentrated on the other vessel something about hershe was not low in the water sir he said loudly seems the stragglers are being taken what said bampton incredulously he brought up his big telescope are you mad thats nothing but a parcel of lubberly merchantmen got in a tangle but the main course its up to what are you babbling about mr kydd she still flies her pennant the other vessel has her vane aflyleave them to it i say sir should we not send viper down to em and put her to looard and having to beat back just when we make the open sea im surprised at your suggestion mr kydd and can only ascribe it to your er lack of experience in these waters the captain appeared from the cabin spaces ah mr bampton alls well yes sir th stragglers are bein snapped up fr prizes kydd blurted out what give me that said houghton taking kydds telescope im sorry sirmr kydds enthusiasm sometimes exceeds his experience and why do you say that houghton snapped at kydd main course its goosewings now but that would be so if they only had time to haul one clew up to the yard not both and if the lubbers hadnt yet loaded the signal guns or shipped aprons against the rain they bampton broke in what are you wittering about kydd those vessels have their numbers hoisted they have not hauled down their colours or signalled distresstheyre in a godawful mess ive seen it many times before and so will you houghtons telescope steadied viper and trompeuse to close and investigate he bawled to the poopdeck he rounded on bampton mr kydd knows his signalshaul up your main course and two guns to weather is the signal for the approach of strange sail they must have been caught napping by some damned privateer disguised as one of our ships who knows our procedures and that our attention is all ahead trompeuse hurried back along the convoy keeping to the windward edge viper angled off downwind the master came up to watch developments but remained silent what is that idiot in viper up to bampton said kydd had his own ideas about why the gunbrig had clapped on all sail away to the east well to leeward of the action but kept his silence tysoe arrived with kydds oilskins and a warm jersey which kydd struggled into under his waterproofs sail hoooo the masthead lookouts hand was flung out to seaward as the lizard opened up to the westward a respectablesized frigate under easy sail close inshore came into view no colours growled houghton but we know what shes up to quarters mr bampton then tenacious heard the heartstopping thunder of the drums in anger for the first time this voyage kydds post in battle was at the signals he had but to send for his sword and see to the leadlined bag ready for sinking secret material should the need arise she thinks t fall on the convoy while the escorts are to looard dealing with the brigthey wouldnt guess a ship o force was waiting for em the master said with grim satisfaction kydd spared a glance astern the enemy must have seen events swing against them for both the hapless goosewinged merchantman and the anonymous brig loosed sail hurriedly and swung aboutbut it was too late the reason for vipers move had become clear she was now squarely between the enemy and his escape spankin good sailin kydd burst out with trompeuse now coming down fast from one direction and viper well placed in the other the end was not really in doubt the smoke of a challenging shot eddied up from viper the ball skipping past the enemy and her prize the two came briefly together probably to recover crew before one broke out french colours and crammed on all sail to try to make off leaving the other with ropes slashed and drifting helplessly so close to falmouth there would be no trouble recovering the abandoned prize as the brig attempted to pass viper she made a perfect target for raking fire and viper did not waste it when the smoke of her broadside cleared the brig had already struck her colours jubilation rang out on tenacious from the deck below and satisfied smiles were to be seen on the quarterdeck but as tenacious thrust towards her the frigate shied away and bore southeast towards the distant french coast when she had drawn away and tenacious stood down from quarters kydd saw that the convoy was now much closer together and in impeccable formation as one the argosy rounded the lizard taking atlantic rollers on the bow in explosions of white hauling their wind for the southwest the wanly setting sun and the thousands of miles that lay ahead your health mr kydd the surgeon leaned forward as usual in his accustomed eveningwear of a worn green waistcoat he had an odd detached way of regarding people part earnest part sardonic thank ye mr pybus kydd answered its always a pleasure t have a doctor wishing me good health the wardroom was abuzz with chatter besides the charge of anticipation that a new voyage always brought there was the tension of getting the convoy to seaand their first brush with the enemy sharp of his nibs to spot the wolf among the sheep said pringle helping himself to another cutlet adams leaned across for the asparagus did hear that you helped him to a conclusion kydd he said and when his eyes flicked towards the head of the table kydd guessed that the story of his contretemps with bampton was now common knowledge always like t help when i can he said cautiously bampton was talking with the purser but kydd occasionally caught his eyes straying to himself louder adams went on to the devil with modesty old fellow tell us what put you on to him er his lee clew t the course was speak up dear chap were working to windd to make her offing of wolfs rock in the night the ships taut rigging was causing the length of her hull to creak in noisy protest i said with only one clew to the yard an the chance her guns were yet not primed shed be tryin t let us know she was in trouble and could not if she had her vanes an colours correct seems to me she was surprised and then th boarders let all stand to make us think she was a vessel retirin back to falmouth he grinned but then i thought t take a look at her draught a brig outward bound an sittin high in th water stands to reason you didnt tell me that bamptons voice cut through the talk which quickly died away if id known what you saw it was on the tip of his tongue to remark that with his bigger telescope bampton was better placed to see the same thing but kydd remained guarded ah in fact there was not really time enough t tell it bampton held rigid the next morning the land was gone there was just empty sea and the convoy in loose columns they bucketed through the long heaving swells from the west substantial hudson bay traders with fine passenger cabins hardy vessels headed for the newfoundland cod fishery slabsided timber ships that would return with precious masts for the dockyards of the kingdom and impoverished immigrants crammed among supplies for the settlements the nighttime shortening of sail now became a resetting of plain sail to reach maximum speed of the slowest a tedious schedule of hauling and loosing was necessary to adjust speeds the leadingedge ships had to be reined in while slower ones which had slipped to the back during the night were bullied into lengthening their stride routine was only reestablished midmorning when tenacious was free to go to quarters for exercise of the great guns after an hour or more of hard work the welcome sound of the tune nancy dawson drifted up from the main deck announcing grog and dinner for the hands but first on an open deck nearly deserted of seamen the officers gathered on the quarterdeck for the noonday sight every officer performed the duty including the midshipmen but only the workings of the lieutenants were pooled for reliability this would be kydds first occasion as an officer for although since those years in the caribbean he had known how it was now that his contribution would be a valid element in the navigation of a kings ship he readied his octant an old but fine brass and ebony instrument by setting the expected latitude down to the tangent screw this would shorten the time needed to do a fine adjustment in the precious seconds of a meridian altitude next he took the precaution of finding his heightofeye on the quarterdeck there was an appreciable correction to be madefrom there the distance to the horizon of a shipoftheline was a full seven miles cradling his instrument kydd took his place feeling the long swell come in fine on the bow in a heave down the length of the ship he estimated it at no more than twelve feet which meant another correction to heightofeye then like the others he trialled the sunclose but some minutes to go he was aware of the helmsman behind him silently flicking the wheel to catch a wave glancing up at the weather leech of a sail then resuming his blank stare ahead kydd knew what he was thinkingthe wielding of sextants the consulting of mysterious figures in the almanac marked out an officer from a common seaman he lifted the octant again the reflected lower edge of the sun was getting near the horizon kydd waited patiently shifting the vernier with delicate twists of the tangent screw then it was time the sun was at its highest altitude reflected by the octant its image kissed the line of the horizon stop he called his voice mingling with the others the time to a second was recorded by a masters mate this was the exact instant of local noon along this line of longitude the meridian by the elevation of the sun above the earth the distance along that line from the equator the latitude could be found and where the two intersected would be the ships position he lowered his instrument and through habit glanced into the binnacle at noon on the meridian the sun was exactly due south so this was a good time to check the compass in the wardroom the table filled quickly with paper and books kydd jotted down his octant reading returned the instrument to its case and found his moores nautical almanac in practised sequence he entered the tables applied the corrections and neatly summarised his workings his final latitude and longitude boldly there for all to see thank you gentlemen the master said collecting the workings they agreed within a minute or so but kydds was the closest of all to hamblys own mr kydd the captain was standing on the weather side of the quarterdeck aye sir kydd replied moving quickly to him as you must be aware he said gruffly with four watchkeeping officers having a second officerofthewatch forces them to watch on watch off the first lieutenant has asked that the ships officers now move to single watches sir therefore you will oblige me by assuming your own watch he said drily should you feel unsure in any situation you will call me at once do you understand instantly sir carry on please mr kydd the last dogwatch was nearly over when kydd appeared by the wheel to take the next watch in the early nightdarkness the men stood about quietly their faces eerily lit from beneath by the dim light of the binnacle lamp mr bampton kydd said in greeting the second lieutenant grunted and turned to look at kydd course souwest b south courses are in to topsails one reef last cast of the log five and a half knots he glanced once at the dark near invisible sea speckled prettily with golden pricks of lanthorn light where the convoy sailed on quietly through the night convoy still seems to be with us carpenter reports nine inches in the well we have two in the bilboes these unfortunates would spend all night in leg irons until hauled before the captain in the morning but it was necessary to pass on the information in the event that the ship was in danger of foundering they must be released you have the ship im going below if you get into a pother dont call me good night it was done a momentary rush of panic then exultation the man standing on the quarterdeck in command around whom the world that was hms tenacious would revolve was thomas paine kydd a duty quartermaster held out the chalk log the watch always started with a clean slate and kydd took it his notations of course and sail now holy writ to be transcribed later to the masters log he heard the quartermaster murmur the heading to the new hand on the wheel then saw him squint at the compass before returning to report souwest b south brown on the wheel sir much as kydd himself had done not so very long ago the figures dispersed leaving the new watch in possession of the deck kydds midshipman messenger was behind him and the mateofthewatch with his boatswains mate stood to leeward waiting for orders the rest of the watch were at different positions around the deck under their station captains for now kydd as an officer could never treat with them directly eight bells clanged forward it was the first watch and in accordance with practice the ship went to evening quarters messdecks were transformed as ditty bags were taken down benches stowed below messtraps placed in racks and the hinged table removed once again the broad space reverted to its true purposea gundeck with martial rows of heavy cannons at the guns the fighting tops and in the waist of the ship men stood ready it was a time to muster them to ensure they knew their place in combat intimately and also it was an opportunity for the seamen to learn about those in authority over them but this did not concern kydd who maintained his watch from on high over them all quarters over the men were released hammocks were piped down from their stowage in the nettings around the bulwarks and slung below in the same hour the space passed from a dining room to a ship of war and then a dormitory the ship changed from a busy working place to a darkened domain of slumber it was a clear night with the wind steady on the beam kydd stepped inside the cabin spaces to the lobby where a small table bore a chart it was now his duty to think of the bigger picture a seaman before the mast simply accepted that a course was set to a compass heading beyond that it was of no interest to someone who could have no say in his destiny but who at the same time did not have to worry about it kydd lowered the dim lanthorn so its soft golden light was enough to see their pencilled course pricked out they were heading mainly south with the canary current to avoid the strong trade westerlies and to pick up later the countervailing seasonal northeasterlies in a swing across the width of the ocean kydd stepped out on deck again he had been in countless night watches and been comforted by the nocturnal sounds the slaps and dings of ropes against masts sails occasionally cracking with a highspirited flourish the neverceasing spreading groan and creak of timbers the ghostlike susurrus of wind in the lines from aloftall had been a soothing backdrop before now its character had changed any number of hazards might lie in wait to challenge his still untutored judgement a started strake even now spurting black water into the depths of the hold a wrung topgallant mast tumbling to sudden ruin a sleepy merchant ship yawing across their bows lawes prove the lookouts it sounded more urgent than he meant in response to his mateofthewatchs hail came answering cries of aye aye from around the deck kydd moved along the weather gangway thumping on ropes if they gave a satisfying hard thrum they were well taut but a dead feel under his fist meant a job for the watch on deck he returned by the lee gangway looking up at the pale expanse of sail they drew well but there was no compelling need for speed locked in as they were to the speed of the convoy he had no wish to be known as a jib and staysail jack always trimming yards and canvas to the annoyance of the night watch back on the quarterdeck the ships easy motion was reassuring the stolid presence of the helmsman and quartermaster companionable and his tense wariness subsided the masteratarms came aft from the main hatchway with a midshipman and corporal alls well sir an lights out below he reported very good carry on please kydd said echoing the words of the countless officersofthewatch he had known the masteratarms touched his hat leaving them to their solitude the accustomed tranquillity of a night watch began to settlebringing a disengagement of mind from body a pleasant feeling of consciousness being borne timelessly to reverie and memories kydd pulled himself together this was not the way an officerofthewatch should be with all his responsibility he turned and paced firmly to the mainmast and back glaring about the night wore on it was easy sailing he could hear the monotone of one of the watch on deck forward spinning a yarn there was a falsetto hoot and sudden laughter but for him there would be no more companionable yarns in the anonymous darkness he spun on his heel and paced slowly back towards the binnacle catching the flash of eyes in the dimness nearby as the quartermaster weighed the chances of a bored officerofthewatch picking fault with his helmsman reaching the binnacle kydd glanced inside to the soft gold of the compass light their course was true all along the decks lines bowsed taut what could go wrong his imagination replied with a multitude of possible emergencies he forced them away and tried to remain calm pacing slowly to one side of the deck low talk began around the wheel it stopped when he approached again could they be discussing him years of his own time at the wheel told him that they were and anything else that might pass the hours of a night watch oddly comforted he made play of going to the ships side and inspecting the wake as if he was expecting something but his senses suddenly pricked to full alertnessthere were sounds that did not fit he spun round an indistinct group of men lurched into view from the main hatchway even in the semidarkness he could see that two were supporting a third slumped between them another followed behind he recognised the voice of the boatswain but not those of the other men who were moaning and arguing kydd hurried to the light of the binnacle yes mr pearce he snapped at the boatswain the moaning man was lowered to the deck in a sprawl fetch the corporal with a nightlanthorn kydd snapped and ask the doctor to sir pearce began heavily ordnary seaman lamb sir taken in drink in th orlop whats this y useless skulker think t swill out o sight do you kydd spat venomously the violence of his anger shocked him and he knew he had overreacted he pulled himself together whats yr division ltenant adams sir lamb said thickly touching his forelock in fear said its his birthday sir the white face of the offender stared up at kydd from the deck lamb struggled to stand but fell back kydd could easily picture what had happened with typical generosity his messmates had plied him with illicitly hoarded rum in celebration he had staggered down to the orlop to sleep it off then had the misfortune to encounter the boatswain on his rounds kydds sympathies swung to the lad life on the lower deck in the cold north atlantic was not pleasant and seamen looked for any kind of releasegenerally rum but there was no real escape a ship of war that might in minutes find itself yardarm to yardarm with an enemy was no place for a drunken hand at the guns kydds duty was plain sleeps it off in irons t front the captain in the forenoon houghton would have no mercy and tomorrow there would be pain and suffering at the gangway kydd turned his back and paced away he had no stomach for any scenes of pitiful begging but there were only muffled gasps and grunting as the young sailor was hauled away bring him forward houghton stood rigid his lips clamped to a thin line his hands behind his back as lamb was brought before the lectern take orf that hat growled the masteratarms the youths thatch of hair ruffled in the wind that buffeted down over the halfdeck his open face was set and pale but he carried himself with dignity on one side of the captain kydd attended for the prosecution on the other was adams well snapped the captain turning to kydd sir ordinary seaman lamb last night at six bells o the first watch the boatswain haled this man before me under suspicion o drink caught by the boatswain prostrate with drink before the officerofthewatch there was not the slightest chance of denial but the grim ritual of the trial must be completed and was he kydds answer would be the boys condemnation hehe was incapable he had had as much chance of avoiding those words as lamb had of escaping the lash i see mr adams sir this lad is young it was his birthday and his shipmates plied him with grog in celebration but sir in his youth and inexperience he was unable to resist their cajolery its nothing but youth and warm spirits this is of no account at sea there is no excusing a manowars man being found beastly drunk at any hour when paid by the king to hold himself in readiness to defend his country have you anything to add as witness to his character er lamb is a willing hand his ropework is admired by all in the maintop and er he volunteered into tenacious and is always forward in his duty the captain glanced once at adams then fixed lamb with a terrible stare have you anything to say for yourself you rogue lamb shook his head and bit his lip then i find you guilty as charged two dozen lamb went white this was savage medicine quite apart from the theoretical limit of a dozen strokes allowed a captain at sea haaands lay aft to witness punishmentaaaall the hands boatswains mates strode about above and below decks with their piercing silver calls summoning witnesses to justice as would be the way of it from now on kydd remained out of sight below in the wardroom avoiding conversation until the word was passed down for the final ceremony officers t muster squeaked a messenger at last solemnly the officers left the wardroom and made their way up to the quarterdeck there the gratings were rigged one lashed upright to the halfdeck bulkhead and one to stand on the ships company were mustered ready a space of open deck then a sea of faces stretching forward kydd avoided their gaze moving quickly up the ladder to the poopdeck the captain stalked forward to the pooprail much as kydd had seen so many times before from the opposite side looking up as a foremast hand now with the other officers he stood squarely behind him seeing only the back of his head blackly he saw that his view of proceedings was obscured by the break of the poop and that therefore on all those occasions before the officers must have seen nothing of the lashes and the agony marines stood to attention at the rails a drummerboy at the ready lamb stood before his captain flanked by the powerful figures of two boatswains mates a brief rattle of the drum brought a subdued quiet articles of war barked houghton his clerk passed them across article two all persons in or belonging to his majestys ships or vessels of war being guilty of drunkenness uncleanness or other scandalous actions in derogation of gods honour shall incur such punishment as the nature and degree of their offence shall deserve he closed the little book carry on boatswains mate the prisoner was led over to the gratings and out of sight but kyddflogged himself onceneeded no prompting to know what was going on stripped and lashed up by the thumbs lamb would be in a whirl of fear and shame and above all desperately lonely in minutes his universe would narrow to one of pounding neverending torment kydd had seen floggings by the score since his own but this one particularly affected him the drum thundered away then stopped kydds skin crawled in anticipation of that first shocking impact in the breathless quiet he heard the unmistakable hiss of the cat then the vicious meaty smack and thud as the body was driven against the gratings a muffled choking sob was all that escapedlamb was going to take it like a man there was a further volleying of the drum again the sudden quiet and the sound of the lash there was no sound from lamb it went on and on one part of kydds mind cried outbut another countered with cold reason noone had yet found a better system of punishment that was a powerful deterrent yet allowed the offender to return to work ashore it was far worse prison and whipping at the carts tail for a like offenceeven children could face the gallows for little more the lashing went on the noon sight complete the officers entered the wardroom for their meal your man took his two dozen well gervase pringle said to adams as they sat down he tasted his wine quite a tolerable claret adams helped himself to a biscuit i wonder if canada rides to houndst would be most gratifying to have some decent sport awaiting our return from a cruise theyve quite fine horseflesh in nova scotia ive heard be satisfied by the society old chap not often we get a chance at a royal court if thats your bag society i spent all winter with my cousin at his pile in wiltshire plenty of your county gentry but perilously short of female company for my taste conversation ebbed and flowed around kydd as usual he kept his silence feeling unable to contribute although renzi had by degrees been drawn up the table and was now entertaining bryant with a scandalous story about a visit to the london of bagnios and discreet villas pringle flashed kydd a single veiled glance and went on to invite bampton to recount a barbados interlude leaving him only the dry purser as dinner companion the afternoon stretched ahead kydd knew that renzi had come to look forward to dispute metaphysics with the erudite chaplain and had not the heart to intervene having the first dogwatch he took an early supper alone and snapped at tysoe for lingering melancholy was never far away these days he went up on deck early and approached the master good day to ye mr hambly an you too sir er do you think this nor easterly will stay by us it will sir these are the trades o course hambly was polite but preoccupied ive heard y can get ice this time o the year the master hesitated sir i have t write up the reckonings he touched his hat to kydd and left at four he relieved bampton who disappeared after a brief handover once more he took possession of the quarterdeck and the ship and was left alone with his thoughts an hour later renzi appeared just thought id take a constitutional before i turn in he said if it does not inconvenience he sniffed the air kydd dear fellow have you ever considered the eternal paradox of free will your oriental philosopher would have much to say should he consider your tyrannous position at the pinnacle of lordship in our little world kydds spirits rose there had been little opportunity so far to renew their old friendship and he valued the farranging talks that had livened many a watch in the past shall ye not have authority and allow a false freedom to reign in bedlam he said with a grin falling into pace next to renzi quite so but mr peake advances an interesting notion concerning the coexistence of free will in the ruled that requires my disabusing the gentleman of his patently absurd views he stared out pensively to leeward kydd stopped dead bitterness welled and took focus renzi stopped concerned what is it brother are you nothing kydd growled but did not resume his walk may i your venrable peake is waitinggo and dispute with him if it gives you s much pleasure kydd said bitterly renzi said softly there is something that ails you i should be honoured were you to lay it before me my friend it was not the time or placebut kydd darted a glance around the quarterdeck no one was watching he looked across to the conn team at the wheel and caught the quartermasters eye then pointed with his telescope up the ladder to the poopdeck the man nodded and kydd made his way with renzi up on to the small deck the furthest aft of all it was not a popular place dominated as it was by the big spanker boom ranging out from the mizzen mast and sometimes activity in the flaglockers at the taffrail they were alone kydd stared out over the wake astern a ragged white line dissolving to nothing in the distance ever renewed by their steady motion and the noisy tumbling foam under their counter his dark thoughts were full but refused to take solid form and he hesitated nicholas how cn i say this here i stand an officer a kings officer moren i could dare t dream of before and itsits not as it should be renzi waited patiently gazing astern kydd continued weakly y see i dont feel an officerits as if i was playin a role dressin up for the part like a common actor the frustrations boiled up and he gulped with emotion i know th seamanship the orders an things butnicholas look at me when the others talk t each other theyre talkin to the squire the gentrytheir father is lord o the manor of some fine family they talk of ridin with the hounds calling on the duke in london whats the latest gossip his voice thickened and me what can i talk about at table without i open m mouth and be damned a yokel renzi murmured encouragement paradoxically this made it all the worse for kydd and his frustration took a new path its easy enough fr you youve been born into it he said bitterly lived that way all yr life this is why you can talk yr horses an estates n politics with the others and have you thought how it is fr me i sit there sad as a gib cat hearin all this jabber and feelin as out of it as the carpenter interrupted them with his report and kydd processed the information mechanically twentyfour inches in the well if he left it the night watch would have to deal with it manning the big chain pump with all its creaking and banging rendering sleep impossible for the watch below hed see to it before he left the deck renzi spoke quietly tom do you consider awhile we all have had to learn the graces the manners and ways of a gentleman its just that weve had much longer than you to learn you see you will learn in time then be damned kydd choked do ye take me fr a performing monkey learn more tricks and bring em out in company is this how to be a gentleman renzis face set youre being obnoxious my friend he said softly an im gettin sick o your wordgrubbin ways youre no frien if all you can say is renzi turned on his heel nicholas ii didnt mean t say renzi stopped kydds hand strayed to his friends shoulder but there was no response renzi merely turned folded his arms and looked coldly at him ive been thinkin a lot nicholas about who i am is the short of it he lifted his chin obstinately afore now ive been proud t be a manowars man life fr me has been simple an true now ive gone aft its all gone ahoo ive lost m bearingsan all my friends do i take it that you still wish to be an officer kydd looked away for long moments nicholas you may account me proud or stubbornbut i will not be a tarpaulin to pity fr his plain ways an officer left t one side when it comes to society an promotion gentlemen officers laugh at the poor sot behind his backgets afuddle wi drink ashore cos he dont know what t say id rather be cream o the shit than shit o the cream damn it renzi winced you may regret turning your back on fortune did i say i was i just dont know is all renzi coughed gently possibly i am in no small measure to blame in this dear fellow but still i feel there is only one logical course and one you seem to have already rejected for as long as it will take you must apply your best and most sincere endeavours to fitting yourself out for a gentleman officerin look word and deed then and only then you may take your rightful place in society my friend at kydds moody silence renzi insisted on an answer ill think on it was all he could achieve they were heading north to where the labrador current from the icy fastness of the polar region met the unseen river of warm water driving up from the caribbean the gulf stream such a confluence was highly likely to result in the navigators nightmare fog ahead there were several days of slow sailing across the mouth of the great st lawrence before they made the shallower waters of the grand banks then the doubling of cape race for st johns and landfall the halifaxbound leaver division of the convoy had parted and now the convoy was mainly smaller ships bringing out supplies for the important cod fishery with some larger vessels who would touch at st johns before making south for the united states kydd knew them all by sight now and it would be strange after a month and a half of ocean travelling when their familiar presence was no longer there with the wind dropping all the time the seas lost their busy ruckling of the long easy swell there was hardly a gurgle or a splash from the ships languorous sliding through the grey water quite different from the fetid heat and glassy calms of the doldrums this was simply the removal of energy from the seas motion a sudden cry came from the masthead lookout saaail hoooo sail t the norard standin towards a distinct stir of interest livened the decks this was much too early for the sloops and gunboats of st johns they were to meet and a single sail would be bold to challenge a shipoftheline my duty to the captain and i would be happy to see him on deck the officerofthewatch adams told his messenger but it was not necessary houghton strode on to the quarterdeck grimfaced youd oblige me mr kydd should you go aloft and let me know what you see kydd accepted a telescope from adams and swung up into the rigging feeling every eye on him his cocked hat fell to the deck as he went round the futtock shroudshe would remember to go without it next timeand to the main topmast top joining the lookout who politely made room for him where away kydd asked controlling his panting breaking the even line of the horizon was a tiny smudge of paleness against the greyright in their path he brought up the telescope it was difficult to control even in the calm sea the slow roll at this height was sufficient to throw off the sighting he wedged himself against the topgallant mast feet braced against the crosstrees then got his first good look at the pale pyramid of sail head on his heart jumped the glass wandered and the small image blurred across what do you see houghton bellowed from below kydd swept the telescope to each side of the pyramid nothing tantalisingly he caught brief glimpses of it now getting sharper and larger but there was never enough time to fix on it he prepared to lean over to hail the deck then noticed wan sunlight shafting down close to it he would give it one last try a glitter of light moved across the sea towards it he raised his telescopeand saw it transformed deck hooo an ice island the whole incident had gone unnoticed by the convoy for the heightofeye of tenaciouss lofty masts ensured she saw it well before any other but all were able to take their fill of the majestic sight as they passed hours later up close it was not all pure white there were startling pale blues greens and dirty blotches and such a size there was an awed silence along the decks as men came up to stare at the silent monster from the frozen north the wind died leaving a lethargic swell and the ship creaking and groaning under a dull pearly sky while houghton paced up and down in frustration kydd noticed one of the larger vessels of the convoy far to the leeward edge as with all ships her sails hung lifeless from her yards but for some reason she had none on her foremast not even headsails odd he mused to the master then a signal jerked hastily aloft from her mizzen peak halliards without wind to spread the flags it was impossible to make out the message but there was clearly activity on deck damn the fellow houghton snapped virtually dead in the water there was little tenacious could do to investigate further i thought so the master said seeing the dead white of a fogbank advancing stealthily in eddying wreaths that hugged the sea surface and eventually engulfed the ship in a blank whiteness the muffled crump of two guns sounded from somewhere within the white barrier in conjunction with the flags this was the agreed signal for distress houghton stopped all eyes turned towards him they could not lie idle if there were souls in need of them away launch if you please mr pearce he paused to consider a bosuns mate and ten men and well have two carpenters mates in with emand pass the word for the surgeon he looked about the deck and caught kydds eye see what all the fuss is about mr kydd if the ship is at hazard of foundering and our men can save her do so otherwise advise her master in the strongest terms that a kings ship is not to be troubled in this way kydd knew perfectly well why he had been selected for this dutyas the most junior officer he would be the least missed if he were lost in the fog as the yardarm stay tackles were hooked on to the boat houghton added take an arms chest too mr kydd some of the ships carried convicts for the defensive works in st johns kydd went to his cabin and found his sword part of the uniform and authority of a naval officer when boarding a strange vessel tysoe helped fasten the cross strap and buckle on his scabbard sling nothing but a merchantman all ahoo kydd chuckled at the sight of his grave expression get a boat compass kydd told rawson as he came back on deck seamen tumbled into the big launch then helped sway down the arms chest there was no point in shipping mast and sails in the flat calm rawson returned with a small wooden box with a fourinch compass set in gimbals kydd had the bearing of the hapless vessel and checked that the indication with the boat compass was good this was handed down and he watched rawson go aboard the launch correctly wearing his midshipmans dirk kydd then went down the side last to board take the tiller if y please kydd told rawson taking his place in the sternsheets the surgeon sat patiently on the opposite side why mr pybus you havent any medicines he said seeing no bag or chest oh you know what it is then i must treat wounds inflamed callibisters one of a dozen poxes i tried to persuade these brave fellows to load aboard my dispensary entire but houghton called down loudly from the ships side ill thank you to lose no time mr kydd aye aye sir kydd threw back get moving he muttered to rawson fend off forrard rawson ordered out oarsgive way together kydd gently wedged the compass into the bottom of the boat careful to ensure there was no iron near their lives might depend on it the men stretched out it was a good three miles to pull but conditions were ideal not any kind of sea and the air was cool and dryit might be different in the fogbank kydd saw that thorn the stroke oar was pulling well long and strong and leaning into it he was a steady hand with a fine gift for ropework further forward was poulden who kydd vowed to himself he would see as a petty officer in tenacious rawson stood with the tiller at his side his eyes ahead mr rawson kydd said quietly you havent checked your back bearing this last quartermile the youth flashed an enquiring glance astern at the diminishing bulk of tenacious and looked back puzzled kydd continued mildly if were runnin down a steady line o bearing then we should fin that where we came from bears exactly astern if it doesnt then at the baffled response kydd finished means that were takin a current from somewheres abeam then we have t allow for it if we want to get back cuffin he had been checking surreptitiously for this very reason the white blankness of the fogbank approached and suddenly they left a world with a horizon a pale sun and scattered ships and entered an impenetrably white one where the suns disc was no longer visible its light wholly diffused and reduced to a weak twilight mens voices were muffled and a dank moisture lay on everything as a tiny beading of slippery droplets they pulled through the wreathing fogsmoke kydd making certain of their courseits reciprocal would lead them back to their ship paradoxically the heavy breathing of the men at the oars sounded both near yet far in the unpleasant atmosphere that was weighing heavy on his sleeves and coat and trickling down his neck from his hat sir poulden cocked his head intently on one side sir i cn hear a boat oars snapped kydd the men ceased pulling still absolute silence in the boat they lay quietly rocking slightly it was long minutes of waiting with the cheerful gurgle and slap of water along the waterline an irritating intrusion men sat rigid avoiding eyes listening then there was something a distinct random thump a bang of wood against wood and a barely synchronised squeaking which could only be several oars in thole pins or rowlocksand close it was probably innocent but what boat would be abroad in these conditions without good reason the sound faded but just as kydd was about to break the silence it started again somewhat fainterbut where the swirling clammy white was a baffling sound trap absorbing and reflecting making guesses of direction impossible kydd felt a stab of apprehension break out the armsill take th tiller quickly he hissed the wooden chest emptied quickly cutlasses were handed along with a metallic slither one or two tomahawks six boarding pistols kydd saw that they were ready flinted and prayed that the gunners party had them loaded he drew his sword the fineedged weapon which had seemed so elegant now felt flimsy and insubstantial beside the familiar broad grey steel of a cutlass he laid the naked blade across his knees and experimentally worked the tiller rawson fingered his dirk nervously but the surgeon lolled back with a bored expression he had no weapon and in reply to kydds raised eyebrows gave a cynical smile waiting for the men to settle their blades safely along the side kydd held up his hands for quiet once more in the breathless silence a drip of water from oars the rustle of waves and an occasional creak were deafening kydd concentrated with every nerve nothing he waited a little longer automatically checking that their heading remained true then ordered quietly oars give way together the men swung into it and the bluffbowed launch got under way again in one heartstopping instant a boat burst into view headed directly for them in the same moment kydd registered that it was hostile that it was a french chaloupe and that it had a small swivel gun in its bow his instincts took over down he yelled and pulled the tiller hard over the swivel cracked loudlykydd heard two shrieks and felt the wind of a missile before the bow of the enemy boat thumped heavily into their own swinging forepart french sailors their faces distorted with hatred took up their weapons and rose to their feet in a rush to board the launch swayed as the british responded snarls and curses overlaid with challenging bellows as they reached for their own weapons in a tangle of oars and blood pistols banged smoke hung in the still air one frenchman collapsed floppily his face covered with blood and grey matter another squealed and dropped his pistol as he folded over it was the worst form of sea warfare boat against boat nothing but rage and butchery until one side faltered an arm came out to grasp the french gunwale and pull it alongside a tomahawk thudded across the fingers which tumbled obscenely away get th bastards kydd roared waving his sword towards the enemy the boats came together oars splintering and gouging enemy opponents within reach the furious clash and bite of steel echoed in the fog kydds sword faced a redfaced matelot flailing a curved north african weapon the smash of the blade against his sword numbed kydds wrist but the man triumphantly swept it up for a final blow leaving his armpit exposed kydds lighter steel flashed forward and sank into the soft body the man dropped with an animal howl there was an enraged bellow and a large darkjowled man shouldered his way into his place a plain but heavy cutlass in his hand his face was a rictus of hatred and his first lunge was a venomous stab straight to the eyes kydd parried but the weight of the mans weapon told and kydd took a ringing blow to the side of the head the man drew back for another strike he held his weapon expertly leaving no opening for kydd the next blow came smashing across and kydds awkward defence did not stop a bruising hit above his hip he felt cold fearthe next strike might be mortal as the man stepped on to the gunwale he cunningly swept a low straightarm stab at kydds groin and at his hasty defence jerked the blade up for a lethal blow to kydds head kydds sword flew up to meet it an anvillike ringing and brutish force resulting in the weapons deflectionand a sudden lightness in his hand kydd looked down his sword had broken a couple of inches from the hilt the man gave a roar of triumph and jumped into the launch kydd backed away flinging the useless remnant at him jostled by another fighting pair the man stumbled before he could land his final stroke kydd cast about in desperation and saw a bloodied cutlass lying in the bottom of the boat he wrenched it up in the process taking a stroke from the frenchman aimed again at the head but kydds blade was now a satisfying weight in his hand and hed kept the blow from landing fury building he swung to face his assailant the man paused taken aback by kydds intensity kydd went on to the attack with the familiar weapon he smashed aside the mans strikes landing solid clanging hits in the confined space it could not last as he thrust the broad blade straight for the belly kydd brought one foot forward to the other the mans cautious defence was what he wanted as the man readied his own thrust the spring in kydds heel enabled him to lunge forward inside the mans own blade the cutlass drawing a savage line of blood on one side of his head the man recoiled but met the side of the boat and fell against it mercilessly kydd slashed out his blade slithering along the top of his opponents to end on the mans forearm the frenchmans cutlass fell as he clutched at his bloody wound je me rends he shouted hoarsely kydds blade hovered at the mans throat death an instant away then he lowered it down he snarled gesturing lie down the man obeyed the blood mist cleared from kydds brain and he snatched a glance around him as quickly as it had started the brutal fight was ending in the launch the three or four frenchmen who had boarded were dead or giving up and the bulk of the british were in the chaloupe forcing back the remainder the end was not far away tell em t lie down he yelled dont let the bastards move an inch highpitched shouts came from the french boat they were yielding kydd felt reason slowly return to cool his passions he took a deep breath secure the boats tgether he ordered the bloodstained cutlass still in his hands his body trembled and he had an overpowering urge to rest but the men looked to him for orders he forced his mind to work poulden into th frogs boat and load the swivel the pettyofficer gunner was nowhere to be seenhed probably not survived while poulden clambered over the thwarts and found powder and shot kydd looked around there was blood everywhere but he was experienced enough in combat to know that just a pint looked mortal the wounded men were being laid together in the widest part of the launch as pybus climbed back in when he caught kydds eyes on him he defiantly handed over a tomahawkbloodied kydd noted at pouldens call the french were herded weaponless back into their chaloupe and the swivel brought round inside to menace the boat pointblank hey you mongseer kydds exasperated shout was lost on the sullen men in the boat he turned to his own boat any o you men speak french the baffled silence meant he would have to lose dignity in pantomime but then he turned to the midshipman rawson tell em theyll be hove overside if they make any kind o false move let him make a fool of himself kydd realised he was still clutching his cutlass and laid it down sitting again at the tiller his hip throbbed and his head gave intermittent blinding stabs of pain it was time to return to tenacious and blessed rest he would secure the frenchy with a short towline they could then row themselves close behind under the muzzle of the swivel he would send another three men to stand by poulden pybus was busy with the men in the bottom of the boat so we go home kydd said searching around for the compass now do ye remember what course ashenfaced rawson held out a splintered box and the ruins of a compass card with an icy heart kydd saw that their future was damned the wall of dull white fog pressed dense and featureless wherever he looked no hazy disc of sun no more than a ripple to betray wave direction all sense of direction had been lost in the fight and there was now not a single navigation indicator of even the most elementary form to ensure they did not lose themselves in the vast wastes of the atlantic or end a broken wreck on the cold lonely newfoundland cliffs kydd saw the hostility in the expressions of his men they knew the chances of choosing the one and only safe course he turned to rawson get aboard an find the frenchys compass he said savagely the midshipman pulled the boats together and clambered into the chaloupe in the sternsheets the man kydd had bested held up the compass rawson raised his hand in acknowledgement and made his way aft then staring over the distance at kydd with a terrible intensity the frenchman deliberately dropped the compass box into the water just before rawson reached him disbelieving gasps were followed by roars of fury and the launch rocked as men scrambled to their feet in rage well scrag the fucker get im poulden fingered the swivel nervously if they boarded he would no longer have a clear field of fire stand down y mewling lubbers kydd roared poulden no one allowed t board the frenchy he spotted soulter the quartermaster sitting on the small transverse windlass forward soulter thats your division forrard he said loudly encompassing half the men with a wave youre responsible t me theyre in good fightin order not bitchin like a parcel of old women sir the darkfeatured laffin levered himself above the level of the thwarts from the bottom boards where he had been treated for a neck wound thank ee laffin kydd said trying to hide his gratitude if it came to an ugly situation the boatswains mate would prove invaluable well square away now i believe all useless lumber over the side wounded t mr pybus smashed oars splintered gratings and other bits splashed into the water dead men sir there was a tremor in rawsons voice kydds face went tight were still at quarters they go over if they met another hostile boat corpses would impede the struggle after a pause the first man slithered over the side in a dull splash his still body drifted silently away it was the british way in the heat of battle the french always kept the bodies aboard in the ballast shingle another followed the floating corpse stayed with them and did not help kydd to concentrate on a way out of their danger the fog swirled pitilessly around them is there any been on th grand banks before kydd called keeping his desperation hidden there was a sullen stirring in the boat and mutterings about an officers helplessness in a situation but one man rose i bin in the cod fishery once he said defensively kydd noted the absence of sir report if y please the man scrambled over the thwarts this fog how long does it last the man shrugged hours daysweeks mebbe no use then in waiting it out gets a bit less after dark but dont yez count on it he added what depth o water have we got hereabouts it might be possible to cobble together a hand lead for sounding or to get information on the seabed he vaguely remembered seeing on the chart that grey sand with black flecks turned more brown with white pebbles closer to the newfoundland coast ah depends where we isfifty hunnerd fathoms who knows there was nowhere near that amount of line to be found in the boat kydd could feel the situation closing in on him er do you ever get t see th sun no never dolike this all th time the man leaned back regarding kydd dispassionately it was not his problem y cn see the moon sometimes in th night he offered cynically the moon was never used for navigation to kydds knowledge and in any case he had no tables there was no avoiding the stark fact that they were lost there were now only two choices left to drift and wait or stake all on rowing in a random direction the penalty on either was a cold and lengthy death we got oars we get out o this muttered one sailor to stroke oar there were sufficient undamaged oars to row four a side more than needed but the comment crystallised kydds thinking hold yr gabble kydd snapped we wait he wasnt prepared to explain his reasons but at the very least waiting would buy time the fog took on a dimmer cast dusk must be drawing in now they had no option but to wait out the night danger would come when the cold worked with the damp of the fog and it became unendurable simply to sit there in the chaloupe the french sat tensely exchanging staccato bursts of jabberwere they plotting to rise in the night and now in the launch his men were talking among themselves low and urgent he could order silence but as the dark set in it would be unenforceable and it might cross their minds to wait until it was fully dark then fall upon kydd and the others claiming they had been killed in the fight the choices available to kydd were narrowing to nothing he gripped the tiller his glare challenging others for some reason the weight of his pocket watch took his notice hed bought it in falmouth taken by the watchmakers claims of accuracy which had been largely confirmed by the voyage so far he took it out squinting in the fading dusk light nearly seven by last local noon as he put it back he saw derisive looks openly mocking now night was stealing inthe fog diffused all light and dimmed it accelerating the transition and soon they sat in rapidly increasing darkness alls well laffin hailed loyally poulden kydd called sir the man was fast becoming indistinct in the dimness as if to pour on the irony the dull silver glow of a halfmoon became distinguishable as the fog thinned a little upward towards the night sky if only then two facts edged from his unconscious meshed together in one tenuous idea so fragile he was almost afraid to pursue it but it was a chance feverishly he reviewed his reasoningyes it might be possible rawson he hissed listen to this see if you cn see a fault in m reckoning there was discussion of southing meridians and the day of her age and even some awkward arithmeticbut the lost seamen heard voices grow animated with hope finally kydd stood exultant out oars were on our way back lads they broke free of the fogbank to find the convoy still becalmed and away over the moonlit sea the silhouette of a gun shipoftheline that could only be tenacious a mystified officerofthewatch saw two manowar boats hook on as the missing kydd came aboard at the noise the captain came out on deck god bless my soul houghton said taking in kydds wounds and empty sword scabbard brush with th enemy sir kydd said as calmly as he could compass knocked t flinders had to find some other way back in fog and at night id be interested to learn what you did mr kydd caused us quite some puzzling sir but ill stake m life that mr rawson here would be very pleased to explain th reasoning rawson started then said smugly oh well sir we all knows that fr any given line o longitudethe meridian i meanthe moon will cross just fortynine minutes after the sun does and falls back this time for every day after that its easy get on with it then well sir we can find the moons southing on any day by taking the day of her age since new and multiplying this by that fortynine if we then divide by sixty we get our answerthe time in hours an minutes after noon when shes dead in the south which for us was close t eight o clock then we just picked up our course again near enough and houghton grunted its as well mr kydd had such a fine navigator with him you shall take one of my best clarets to the midshipmens berth unexpectedly the captain smiled while mr kydd entertains me in my cabin with his account of this rencontre chapter the newfoundland convoy was now safely handed over off st johns along with viper and trompeuse the ship signalling distress in the fog missing presumed lost tenacious hauled her wind to sail south alone to land her french prisoners and join the fleet of the north american station in halifax as they approached there was a marked drop in temperature chunks of broken ice were riding the deep atlantic green of the sea and there was a bitter edge to the wind thick watchcoats able to preserve an inner retreat of warmth in the raw blasts of an english winter seemed insubstantial landfall was made on a low dark land it soon resolved to a vast black carpeting of forest barely relieved by stretches of grey rock and blotches of brown a hard cold aspect kydd had studied the charts and knew the offshore dangers of the heavily indented rockbound coast flanking the entrance to halifax im advising a pilot sir the master said to the captain but have you not sailed here before houghtons voice was muffled by his grego hood but his impatience was plain a pilot would incur costs and possibly delay hambly stood firm i have enough times t make me very respectful may i bring to mind sir that its lessn six months past we lost tribune thirtyfour within sight o halifaxterrible night only a dozen or so saved of three hundred souls while tenacious lay to off chebucto head waiting for her pilot kydd took in the prospect of land after so many weeks at sea the shore a barren bleached greywhite granite sombre under the sunless sky appeared anything but welcoming further into the broad opening there was a complexity of islands and then no doubt halifax itself the pilot boarded and looked around curiously admirals in bermuda still he said in a pleasant colonial drawl newfy convoy arrived and he not here hell be in a right taking houghton drew himself up follow the motions of the pilot he instructed the quartermaster of the conn with a southeasterly fair for entry hms tenacious passed into a broad entrance channel and the pilot took time to point out the sights chebucto headthe whole place was called chebucto in the old days the ship gathered way over yonder he indicated a hill beyond the foreshore thats what were callin camperdown hill after your mighty victory right handy for taking a line of bearing from here straight into town running down the bearing he drew their attention to the graveyard of tribune up on rising ground they saw the raw newness of a massive fortification york redoubtand over to starbd we have mr mcnabs island where the ladies love t picnic in summer the passage narrowed and they passed a curious spit of land then emerged beyond the island to a fine harbour several miles long and as big as falmouth kydd saw that as there a southerly wind would be foul for putting to sea but at more than half a mile wide and with an ebb tide it would not be insuperable tenacious rounded to at the inner end of the town there to join scores of other ships her anchors plummeted into the sea formally marking the end of her voyage gentlemen houghton began be apprised that this is the demesne of prince edward of the blood royal i go now to pay my respects to his royal highness i desire you hold yourselves ready and when the time comes i expect my officers to comport themselves with all the grace and civility to be expected of a kings officer in attendance on the civil power the wardroom took the orders with relish every port had its duties of paying and returning calls some were more onerous than others with entertainments that varied from worthy to spirited but this promised to be above the usual expectation for kydd it would be high society as he had never dreamed of receptions royal dinners lofty conversations all grand and unforgettable but would he be able to carry it through like a true gentleman just how could he strut around as though born to it it was dauntingimpossible soon the wardroom and spaces outside became a beehive of activity with servants blacking shoes boning sword scabbards polishing decorations and distracted officers finding deficiencies in their ceremonials the ship however lay claim to attention first dockyard stores brought from england were hoisted aboard lighters and taken in charge and a detachment of the th royal fusiliers came aboard to escort the regimental paychest ashore fore and aft tenacious was thoroughly cleaned down then put in prime order the cable tiers were lime whitewashed brickdust and rags were taken to the brasswork and cannon were blackened to a gloss with a mixture of lampblack beeswax and turpentine bryant took a boat away and pulled slowly round the ship bawling up instructions that had the yards squared across exactly one above the other then the first invitations came the captain disappeared quickly and pringle who had old friends in halifax vanished as soon as he was decently able accompanied by lieutenant best the others prepared to find their own way ashore spit it out man adams demanded the note handed in by a messenger was addressed to renzi who gravely announced to the wardroom that it seemed both himself and lieutenant kydd were invited to the home of the commissioner for lands mr lawrence greaves ah as this eminent gentleman no doubt wishes to honour tenacious in the proper form said adams smoothly it would be seemly therefore that a more senior officer be present as it happens gentlemen i shall be at leisure the boat landed them next to the careening wharf where a carriage waited the stone steps of the landingplace were reasonably dry but when they moved forward the hems of their boatcloaks brushed the snowmush on leaving the dockyard area they turned north away from the town and had their first glimpses of a new land kydd marvelled at the rugged appeal of the snowpatched raw slopes the countless spruce and jackpineand the silence at their destination a gravel track led to a mansion and as they drew up their falmouth acquaintance came to the door this is most kind in you renzi said with a bow may i present lieutenant gervase adams sir who cannot be denied in his desire to learn more of your remarkable realm greaves acknowledged him with a bow and slight smile calm seas and a prosperous voyage indeed gentlemen your brisk action at the outset of our voyage has been particularly remarked they settled inside by the large fire calibogus greaves offered at the puzzled looks he smiled a nova scotian cure for the winds chillspruce beer stiffened with rum i believe we will have kings calibogus which is taken hot and is a sovereign remedy mrs greaves joined them to an english eye our country may appear outlandish gentlemen but to us it is an arcadia indeed she said proudly with the fisheries to bring wealth and substance to your being renzi replied the cod kingdom you will find in the north in newfoundland here we glory in tradeyou have seen our convoys hundreds of ships and sailing almost every month such a crowd of shippingall from nova scotia adams asked puzzled ah no sir greaves said this is the trade of the north american continentnot only canada but the united states as well the seas are alive with privateers and other vermin and without a navy of their own cousin jonathan likes to consign his goods here for safe passage across the ocean renzi rubbed his hands as the generous pinewood fire blazed warming and cheering this is spring he ventured i believe in truth it may be said your winter is worse it can be a sad trial at times greaves replied but when the snows come and the great st lawrence freezes a hundred miles from bank to bank halifax with its fine harbour is always free for navigation his wife added gravely last winter was dreadful very severe our roads were impossible with ice and snow and we ran uncommonly short of the daily necessariesthe army could get no beef and the common people were being found frozen in the street goodness knows how the maroons survive in his surprise kydd forgot himself and interjected maroons you mean black men frm jamaica yes can you conceive they were in rebellion and given settlement here it quite touches my heart to see their poor dark faces among all the snow and icy winds kydd remembered his times in the west indies as master of the kings negroes could even the noble and powerful juba have survived in this wilderness to be sure m dear greaves said yet in their maroon hall you will see some of our best workers and you remember that when they were offered passage back to africa only a few accepted in my opinion theyre much to be preferred to that homeless riffraff on the waterfront adams stirred restlessly and leaned forward the prince how do you find having a prince o the blood among you all a fine man he has done much for halifax i believe did not king george his father send him here into exile and is he not now living in sin with his mistress julie we do not speak of such matters greaves said coldly when his royal highness arrived this place was raw and contemptible now it has stature and grace with buildings worthy of a new civilisation and is strong enough i fancy to secure all canada from a descent sir i didnt mean do you care to see the town perhaps we have time to make a visit and return for dinner you are very obliging sir halifax consisted of one vast rampart an imposing hill overlooking the harbour it sloped down to the shoreline with a massive fortification dominating the crestthe citadel with its enormous flag there the party stepped out to admire the view greaves had provided fur coats against the chill bluster of the winds which under leadcoloured skies intermittently drove icy spicules of snow against kydds skin he shivered at the raw cold around them was broad open ground cleared to give the citadel a good field of fire the vegetation emerging from snowmelt was bleached a drab lightbrown and mud splashes showed where others had walked before but the view was impressive the expanse of harbour below stretched out in the distance the sea a sombre dark grey modellike ships lay at anchor black and still and the rugged country blanketed by the monotonous low blackgreen of subarctic forest extended like a dark shadow as far as the eye could see kydd caught renzis eye his friend was rapt this is a land like no other he breathed one we might say is in perpetual thrall to the kingdom of the north there is an unknown boreal fastness here that lies for countless miles to the interior which has its own bleak beauty that dares men greaves smiled as they tramped back to the carriage you could not be visiting us at a worse time of the year he said after the snow and before the greenup you may find it hardly credible but in no more than a month there will be delicate blooms of wild pear and trees all along argyle street that will surprise you with the green of old england just below the citadel the first buildings began substantial stone structures that would not have been out of place in england the air was chill and raw but smoky from countless fires that promised warmth and company now theres a sight adams said with satisfaction as they reached the town proper houses shops people all the evidence of civilised living the streets were rivers of mud and horsedung but everywhere there were boardwalks to protect pedestrians feet after weeks of familiar faces at sea the variety of passersby seemed exotic ladies with cloaks and muffs picking their way delicately escorted by their gentlemen a muffin man shuffling along in sharp contrast to a pigtailed ranger halfindian with cradled long rifle and bundle to kydds surprise sedan chairs toiled up the steep slope a sight he had not seen since his youth we do tolerably well in the matter of entertainments greaves murmured may i mention the pontac a popular coffeehouse with quite admirable mutton pies or merkels if tea and plum cake is more to your taste at adamss expression he added drily and of course there is mannings tavern which is well remarked for its ale and respectability sir there is a service you may do us renzi said if you could indicate a chandlery or such that is able to outfit us in the article of coldweather clothing that i can certainly do and close by at formansyou shall need my advice i suspect the emporium in question was well patronised and they were met with curious looks from weatherworn men and capablelooking women an overpowering smell lay on the air sea gear if you please greaves told the assistant goin north the broad canadian twang was noticeable against greavess more english tones he means to newfoundland and the arctic would this be so do you think not in a sailoftheline i believe well capting here in formans we has somethin fer all hands aloft its tarred canvas th best but theres many prefers their rig less stiff sort o thing uses boiled linseed oil instead an regular seamen on watch always takes heavy greased homespun under their gear as well he swung out a set of what seemed to be heavy dark leather gear norsky fishermen swear by thisn selecting an impossibly sized mitten he added boiled wool then feltedyou dont fear fishhooks in the dark wi this watching their faces for a reaction he chose another garment er you gents are goin to be more satisfied wi these i guess the jacket was of heavy cloth but much more flexible however with every proud flourish he made a rank animal miasma arose catching at the back of the throat see here the assistant said opening the garment and revealing pale yellowish smears along the seams this is guaranteed t keep you warm n dry prime bear grease forewarned by lady jane schooner halifax prepared for the arrival of the north american squadron from its winter quarters in bermuda as if in ironic welcome the mornings pale sun withdrew lowering grey clouds layered the sky with bleak threat and tiny flakes appeared whirling about the ship kydd shuddered obliged to wear outer uniform he had done his best to cram anything he could find beneath it but the spiteful westerly chilled him to the bone long before the squadron hove in sight regular thuds from the outer fortresses marked its approach six ships in perfect line finally emerged around the low hump of georges island indifferent to the weather resolution seventyfour someone said pointing to the leading ships admirals flag floating high on the mast the rest of the conversation was lost in the concussion and smoke of saluting guns as the two biggest ships present resolution and tenacious acknowledged each others presence then deigned to notice the citadels grand flag just as her first anchor plunged into the sea the flagships launch smacked into the water and sails on all three masts vanished as one drawing admiring comments from tenaciouss quarterdeck kydd tensed aware of a warning glance from bryant standing next to the captain but he was ready in resolution the white ensign at her mizzen peak descended simultaneously in tenacious the huge red ensign of an independent ship on its fortyfoot staff aft dipped in its place in time with the flagship a vast pristine white ensign arose signifying the formal accession of the to the north american squadron the snow thickened large flakes drifting down endlessly and obscuring kydds sight of the flagship if he should miss anything a threeflag hoist shot up resolutions main kydd anxiously pulled out his signal book but rawson knew without looking all captains he sang out gleefully almost cherubic in his many layers of clothing kydd hurried down to the quarterdeck but houghton had anticipated the summons and was waiting at the entry port resplendent in full dress and sword his barge hooked on below the sidesteps and snowflakes glistening on his boatcloak he vanished over the side duty done tenacious settled back to harbour routine the snow began to settle deck fitments and spars brightwork and blacked cannon all were now topped with a damp white as expected all officers was signalled at eleven boats put off from every english manowar in the harbour to converge on the flagship the officers were in full dress and sword with a white ensign to denote their presence it was the pomp and majesty of a naval occasion which kydd had seen many times before but from the outside he stood nervously with the others as they were welcomed cordially by the flaglieutenant on the quarterdeck and shown below by a seriousfaced midshipman the great cabin of resolution extended the whole width of the deck inside a large polished table was set for dinner with crystal and silver kydd overawed by the finery took an end chair next to him a lieutenant nodded amiably and kydd mumbled a polite acknowledgement the hum of conversation slackened and stopped as vice admiral of the white george vandeput commanderinchief of the north american squadron came into the cabin the massed scraping of chairs was deafening as the officers rose murmuring a salutation dye sit gentlemen he called finding the central chair he whirled the skirts of his frock coat around it as he sank into it and beamed at the company id be obliged at yr opinion of this rhenish he said affably as decanters and glasses made their appearance kydds glass was filled with a golden wine that glittered darkly in the lanthorn light he tasted it a harder mineral flavour lay beneath the flowery scent unsure he sipped it again vandeput looked down the table but most officers remained prudently noncommittal renzi sat three places along holding his glass up to the light and sniffing appreciatively a fine workmanlike rheingau he said or possibly a palatinate though not as who should say a spatlese the cabin fell quiet as several commanders and a dozen senior lieutenants held their breath at a junior lieutenant offering an opinion on his admirals taste in wine but vandeput merely grunted ah yes i feel inclined t agreea trocken it is not but youll excuse me in th matter of taste its origin is a danish prize whose owner seemed not t value the more southerly whites renzi nodded and the admiral shot him an intent look then steepled his fingers gentlemen fr those newly arrived for the season a welcome he held attention while he gazed around the cabin recognising some politely acknowledging others we have some fresh blood here following our famous victory at camperdown so im taking the opportunity t meet you all the north american squadronoften overlooked these days but of crucial importance i declare the convoy of our mastships alone justifies our being where would the sea service be without its masts and spars an half the worlds trade flows through this port including the west indies of course kydd was transfixed by the glitter of the admirals jewelled star the gold facings of his coat the crimson sash which were grand and intimidating but vandeputs pleasant manner and avuncular shock of white hair set him almost at his ease therefore our chief interest is in the protection of this trade i rather fancy we wont be troubled overmuch by french menowarrather its these damn privateers that try my patience yet i would not have you lose sight of the fact that we are a fleetto this end i require that every ship under my command acts together as one concentrating our force when ordered and for so doing you signal lieutenants shall be my very nerves a rustle of amusement passed around the table the flagships smartness was well marked and life would not be easy for these junior officers we shall be exercising at sea in company as opportunities arise i commend my signal instructions to you with particular attention to be given to the signification of manoeuvres my flaglieutenant will be happy to attend to any questions later i wish you well of your appointment to the north american squadron gentlemen and ask that you enjoy the entertainment a buzz of talk began as the doors swung wide and dishes of food were brought in kydd was about to help himself to the potted shrimps when the stout officer next to him half stood over the biggest salver as its cover was removed aha the roast cod this is worth any mans hungering shall you try it sir the fish was splendidbuttery collops of tender white and kydd forgot his duty until the officer introduced himself robertson second of the acorn damn fine cook our admiral has dont y know kydd fifth o tenacious he hesitated but robertson was more concerned with his fish which was vanishing fast acorn the ninepounder lying alongside is her robertson agreed i suggest only the chicken pie afore the main by the way ol georgie always serves caribou an i mean to show my appreciation in spades may i kydd had noticed the disappearing fish and was pleased to have remembered his manners so far as to help him to a handsomesized slice of cold chicken pie the rheingau was perfectly attuned to the cold food and his reserve melted a little ninepounder frigatehard livin indeed aye robertson said his mouth full but bettern a shipoftheline and how so prize money o course ol georgies no foolsends us out all the days god gives after anything that floats french spanish scowegianeven american if we can prove she has a cargo bound for the enemy if its condemned in court cargo n all then shares all round the rumours of caribou were correct and to the accompaniment of a good margaux the dark flesh was tender with an extraordinary sweet wild meat flavour kydd sat back satiated renzi was toying with a breast of spruce partridge while deep in serious talk with an older leanfaced officer kydd stole a look at the admiral he was genially in conversation with a hardlooking officer to his left kydd wondered at the simple fact that he himself was sharing a meal with such august company wine with you sir it was the officer opposite who had not said much before kydd held his glass forward prize money b the bucketful he toasted the other seemed restless that would be fine sir but while were topping it the sybarite others are fighting and by that i mean winning the glory theres no promotion to be gained by lying comfortably at two anchors in some quiet harbour only in a right bloody battle he held up his wine to the light and studied it gloomily to think itweve been thrown out of the med since last year thereve been descents on ireland and at home i hear pitt has admitted the collapse and destruction of the coalition and none else in sight we stand quite alone can things be much worse i doubt it kydd said stoutly im come frm the caribbee and i can tell you weve been takin the french islands one b one and now the spanish main is ours and who cn doubt the mongseers have reached their limits baled up in europe tight as a drum to the royal navy gaolkeeper and may she lose the keys but the officer remained grave and quiet kydd frowned do ye doubt it sir the wine was bringing a flush but he didnt care he seemed to be holding his own in this particular conversation with a weary smile the officer put down his glass i cannot conceive where you have been this last halfyear that you have not in the least understood the motions of the french directory intrigues at the highest or at the point of a bayonet they have now secured the subjugation or acquiescence of the whole of the civilised world they are arrogant they care not who they antagonise for in every battle they triumph whole nations kneel at their bidding and for what purpose while these lie beaten they have a mighty general buonaparte who is ready to venture forth on the world mark my words before this years end there will be such a bursting forth by the french as will make the world stare he leaned back in his chair and resumed his wine looking reprovingly at kydd deliberately kydd turned back to robertson who was now engrossed with the task of picking at a pretty corner dish sweetbreads he mumbled and offered the dish kydd took one and tried to think of an intelligent remark to make the americansll be amused at our troubles wi the french he said hopefully robertson raised his eyebrows ah not really i think he looked at kydd curiously you must know theyve done handsomely out o this warbeing neutral an all i mean can trade with any and all if they can get away with it o course kydds blank look made him pause how longve you been made up then he asked directly just this january kydd answered warily then id clap on more sail an get as much o this business hoisted aboard as you can youre boarding officer an take in a fat merchantman that the court decides is innocent expect to explain yourself to the judge in damages he grinned broadly and turned to a pyramid of syllabubs the warm glow of the wine fell away these men were of a different origin brought up from the cradle with discernment education the talk of politics continually around them how could he conceivably claim to be one of them kydd stole a look at renzi holding forth elegantly on some exemplary greek then at the admiral listening with his head politely inclined to a fine story from a young lieutenant and finally at the officer opposite who was now yarning with his neighbour kydd closed the door of his cabin there was nobody in the wardroom but the way he felt he did not want to see another face his experience of the previous night had left him heartsick unable to deny any longer that trying his hardest was not enough he just did not belong in this society he was a deepsea sailor true but as an officer he was a fish out of water talk of fox hunting and the season was beyond him the implications for his acceptance by them only too clear he knew well what was in store others who had come aft by the hawse had found their placeas a tarpaulin officer known in the navy as characters they were bluff hard on the men they knew so well and had no pretensions to gentility or learning utterly reliable at sea they were outcasts in polite social situations and usually took refuge in hearty drinking as for promotion and ambition improbable was this his fate he had tasted the sweets of a higher life with renzitheir leisurely talking of philosophers and logic under a tropic moon the dreamlike times in venice the dinner with renzis brother in jamaica had been a taste of what should be but now thought of his friend brought with it a wave of desolation renzi was in his element now clearly headed for the highest levels and thoroughly enjoying his change of fortune he had aided kydd as much as he could teaching him the forms and appearances but there was no help for it this was not a matter of learning the ropes it was breeding his depression deepened logic would sayand renzi was a servant to logicthat in truth his friend no longer needed a sea companion to lighten his intellectual existence and ease his selfimposed exile now renzi had the chaplain to dispute with whenever he felt inclined kydd thought bitterly all told perhaps it would have been more merciful if kydd had never known another existencehad never encountered renzi even he felt despair and flung open the door for tysoe when his servant did not immediately appear he roared his name tysoe arrived his hands showing evidence that he had been at work boning kydds best shoes he wore a perfectly composed expression sir fetch me one o my clarets tysoes eyes flickered will that be two glasses sir kydd coloured no damn yr eyesjust th one when it came he snatched bottle and glass slammed his door then splashed the wine into the glass hands shaking with emotion he drank hard and it steadied him he stared morosely at the ships side in his tiny cabin forcing himself to be calm tysoe another bottle an you can turn in fr the night he shouted it was obvious now there was only one cause for his despondency loneliness an outsider in the wardroom he was cut off from the rough warm camaraderie before the mast that he knew so well now he had no one and renzi would be moving on soon probably taken up as a flaglieutenant the second bottle was halfempty already but kydds pain was easing he allowed the warm memory of kitty to return she had stood by him during the terrible days of the nore mutinyshe had a strength hed rarely seen in a woman with her he might have there was a lump in his throat and he gulped another glass if only she were here if only he stared at the glass in his hand already he was turning into what he dreaded to bea tarpaulin officer through selfpity he was sliding down the same slope as they all must have to find acceptance they had turned themselves into a patronised caricature then found a steady friend in the bottle god rot me but ill not be one his harsh croak in the confined space startled him he seized the bottle and pushed it away so shameful was the thought that he lurched to his feet and threw open the door clutching the bottle by its neck the wardroom was still deserted all others no doubt gone ashore together tysoe he called the man came quickly and silently and kydd knew why he had conceived it his duty to stand by his master while he got helplessly drunk then tumble him into his cot the realisation hurt kydd it bore on his spirit that others would now be making allowances for him and he stiffened if yed like the res o the wine he awkwardly held out the bottle i shant need any more renzi was not at breakfast but kydd found him later in the day in his cabin the admiral plans to visit his realm in newfoundland he said and for some unaccountable reason he wishes me to accompany him a vexationif you remember i planned to join the shiptons for whist he seemed preoccupied there will be no sea exercises with the admiral in newfoundland counting his cod dear fellow if you can bear to leave your signal books why do you not see more of the country you really should get away more kydd murmured something watching his friend rummaging in his chest renzi looked up shamefaced id be obliged should you lend me a shirt or two tomthere will be a quantity of social occasions in newfoundland ive heard a surge of feeling surprised kydd with its intensity as he fetched them but he said nothing a stubborn pride still remained which would not allow him to burden renzi with the problem renzi left with a hasty wave pringle emerged from his cabin the picture of military splendour a pair of pigskin gloves in one hand a swagger stick in the other he noticed kydd gave a noncommittal grunt then he too strode away servants came to clear the afternoon clutter looking at kydd warily there was nothing for it but to retire to his cabin pride would not let him inveigle himself into anothers invitationbesides he might find himself in a situation that would end in his making a spectacle of himself again he burned with embarrassment at the recollection of his conversation at table what could they think of an officer as crassly ignorant as any foremast hand the wardroom was clear again he paced about morose a book lay on the rudderhead he wandered over idly and pulled it out observations on the current war by an officer of rank it was full of maps and diagrams painstakingly hatched with tiny lines and minuscule lettering it covered in great detail every military campaign of the war so far he had never had an interest in the interminable toing and froing that seemed to be the lot of the army but this book had an introductory treatment for each theatre of war which sounded robust and useful his spirits rose a little this at least was something constructive he could dolearn some facts to ward off assumptions of ignorance it was a workmanlike book and the treatment was clear and direct but even so talk of why the duke of york had considered the austrian netherlands worth a hopeless campaign was baffling mainly because it assumed a degree of familiarity with the political background that he did not have he persevered going to each introduction in turn and stitching together a basic understanding on which he could hang his facts yet as he did so he found his attention held by the implications of what he was reading armies and tradeexpressions of a nations economic strength but vulnerable to the quixotic twists of fate and mans plotting it was a new experience for kydd he read on until a fundamental realisation stole over him he set down the book and stared into space until now he had unconsciously thought of his ship as a boundary to his world he could step ashore in foreign parts and see sights impossible for most but he could always return to his snug little world and sail away there the dangers of the sea and the malice of the enemy were reality now it was all changed events in one part of the world could reach out and touch an officer have grave military and legal consequences if a wrong decision was made they might conceivably damn his career or even cause an international incident in essence an officer dealt with the wider world the common seaman did not mr kydd bryants bellow reached effortlessly from the quarterdeck to the focsle where kydd had taken refuge from the marines drilling loudly on the poopdeck under an enthusiastic lieutenant best hastily kydd made his way aft ive been called away damn it an just when were due a parcel o new men should be coming aboard this hour bring em aboard if y please and take all the ablebodied but mark this send all the rubbish backwe dont want em right aye aye sir are they pressed men not all weve got a press warrant out but most o these are merchant jacks tired of winterin and odd sods off the streets we can be satisfied with a dozen ill rate em when i get back this afternoon bryant jammed on his hat and stalked off kydd warned off a duty midshipman to desire the surgeon to hold himself in readiness the purser to his slops and the boatswain to provide a holding crew it was a wellworn routine the need for men in any manowar was crucial even if the ship was in firstclass shape battleready and stored it was all a waste without men to work her kydd had no misgivings about what had to be done to achieve this a kings yard boat sir rawson reported the dockyard launch made its way out to them and as it neared kydd leaned over the side to see what was being brought looking up at him were a scatter of winterpale faces some listless others alert some sunk in dejection a stock collectionthe seamen among them would show immediately they would have no trouble with the sidesteps and bulwark the mateofthewatch took charge it would not be seemly for kydd to appear until the men were inboard and assembled he disappeared into the lobby it seemed so long ago but into his mind as clear as the day it had happened came his own going aboard the old battleship duke william as a pressed man the misery homesickness utter strangeness now these men would face the same new men mustered sir kydd tugged on his hat and emerged on to the quarterdeck aware of all eyes on him they were bunched together in a forlorn group near the mainmast get them in a line mr lawes he ordered a more odd assortment of dress was difficult to imagine bearskin hats and wellworn animalhide jackets greasygrey oily woollens and ragged trousers even two with moccasins more than one was stooped by illnourishment or age some the ones standing alert and wary with blank faces carried welllashed seamans bags ill speak t them now mr lawes the shuffling and murmuring stopped he stepped across to stand easily in front of them waiting until he had their eyes my names ltenant kydd this is hms tenacious were a shipoftheline an were part of the north american squadron admiral vandeput stony stares met him the men were clearly resigned to a fate known to some unknown to others cn i see the hands o the volunteers a scatter of men signified you men get th bounty in coin today an liberty later t spend it the rest kydd continued when this war started i was a pressed man same as you he paused for effect it startled some others remained wary rated landman in a second rate an since then ive been t the south seas in a frigate the caribbean in a cutter and the mediterranean in a xebec ive got a handsome amount o prize money and now im a kings officer so whos going t say to me the navy cant be th place to be for a thoroughgoing seaman who wants t better himself now think on it should y decide to serve king george and yr country you could end up th same give your names t the first lieutenant as a volunteer this afternoon and tell him y want to do well in the sea service o the king and hell give ye a good chance kydd turned to lawes carry on these men stand fast that one an the two at the pinrailwell send em back rest go below to see the doctor the men still had their eyes on kydd one in particular a thickset seaman who lingered after the others good haul i think it was bryant watching them leave surlylooking brute the last shouldnt wonder if hes shipped for some very good reason the sun at last became visible through a pale cloud cover a perceptible warmth on the skin and kydds spirits rose ashore he could make out a different green from the sombre greenblack of the boreal forest and he thought that the country might seem quite another in summer the captain left with the first lieutenant to call on the officers of york redoubt and a young lady whom adams had taken up with demanded his constant presence for now kydd decided he would continue his acquaintance with wars wider canvas this time he prepared to take notes sitting at the wardroom table his back to the stern windows he picked up his book and resumed reading he discovered that the thousandyear republic of venice had been sacrificed in a cynical exchange between france and austria and that the corsican napoleon buonaparte must now be considered englands chief opponent it was truly astonishing how much of momentous significance to the world had happened since he had gone to seaand to think that he had been unknowingly at the heart of these events the evening drew in the light faded but he had found another book more dogeared and hardergoing which purported to be a treatment of the economic consequences of a world at war and he set to he felt a small but growing satisfaction this was one positive course he could take and it was shaping into a workable aspiration in life if he could not be a naturalborn officer at least he would be an informed one he became aware of a figure standing and looked up it was tysoe cupping a small peg lamp that glowed softly with a clear bright flame thank ee tysoebut does mr hambly know i have his lamp it was charged with spermaceti oil and used only for painstaking work at the charts sir he will be informed of his generous assistance to you when he returns aboard kydd inclined his head to hear better er what seems t be afoot on the upper deck there had been odd thumpings and occasional cries but nothing the mateofthewatch could not be relied on to deal with tysoe bent to trim the lamp the hands sir they wish to dance and skylark kydd nodded there were men aboard visiting from other ships the weather was clear and it would be odd if there was not some kind of glee going in the focsle he laid down his book perhaps he should cast an eye over the proceedings darkness had fallen but it was easy to make out activity on the foredeck by the light of lanthorns hung in the rigging a hornpipe was being performed beside the jeer bitts of the foremast kydd wandered forward unnoticed the seaman was skilled his feet flashing forward to slap back rhythmically the rigid body twirling in perfect time while his upper body arms folded remained perfectly rigid and his face expressionless the fiddler finished with a deft upward note and with a laugh took a pull at his beer ben backstay the call was taken up around the deck and eventually a finelooking seaman from another ship stepped into the golden light and struck a pose when we sail with a freshning breeze and landmen all grow sick sir the sailor lolls with his mind at ease and the song and can go quick sir laughing here quaffing there steadily readily cheerily merrily still from care and thinking free is a sailors life for me the violin gaily extemporised as cheers and roars delayed the next verse there was no problem here these were the core seamen of tenacious deepsea sailors whose profession was the sea they were the heart and soul of the ship not pressed men or the refuse of gaols with a further burst of hilarity the singer withdrew to receive his due in a dripping oak tankard and kydd turned to go then a plaintive chord floated out it hungand a womans voice sounded above the lessening chatter sweet sally an how her true love billy bowling was torn frm her arms an pressed a blonde woman standing tall and proud continued sallys hearts near broken she cant bear t be partedso she disguises as a foremast jack n goes aboard that very night kydd moved closer the woman resembled his lost kitty aboard my true loves ship ill go and brave each blowing gale ill splice ill tack ill reef ill row and haul with him the sail in jacket blue and trousers too with him ill cruise afar there shall not be a smarter hand aboard a manowar her voice was warm and passionate talk died away as she sang on kydds mind took him back to other ships other ports and evenings such as this with his shipmateswhen hed had not a care in his heart she finished but the memories she had aroused came on him in full flood stinging his eyes he became aware that faces were turned towards him conversations dying away a woman moved protectively towards her man and the expressions became dark resentful poulden came across sir he demanded suspiciously these men had every right to their territory little enough in a ship of war and he had no righthe did not belong er just came t hear the songs he said weakly rattlin good singing lads he added but it fell into a silence please carry on he said louder the men looked at each other then the seaman who had sung ben backstay got to his feet and stood purposefully under the lanthorns he muttered an aside to the violinist and clutching a tankard launched loudly into to our noble commander his honour and wealth may he drown and be damnd singer and violinist stopped precisely in midnote and looked at kydd their point made the duo continued that refuses the health heres to thee billy honest an true thanks to the men who calls them his crew an while one is drinking the other shall fill a girl sprang into the pool of light a sarabande she called but kydd had left chapter well i wish you joy of your voyage gentlemenunhappily i have a courtmartial to attend and therefore shall not be with you there was no mistaking the smug satisfaction in bamptons tone in the normal run of events the inbound convoy would have been met by one or two of the hardworking frigates but this one was transporting the lieutenantgovernor of new brunswick and his family to take up his post and tenacious had been deemed more suitable it seemed to kydd that he was the only one looking forward to the seatime the weather had been miserable these past few days cold and blustery and although they would only be out a day or so at most the general consensus was that it was an ideal time to snug down in harbour until better conditions returned kydd had long ago realised that he was a foulweather jackone of those who revelled in the exhilaration and spectacle of stormy seas racing clouds and the lifeintensifying charge of danger in this short voyage he knew they would probably not face a fullblown tempest but the thought of a lively experience at sea lifted his spirits tenacious and ceres a gun frigate belonging to the newfoundland squadron proceeded to sea together with the cliffs of chebucto head abeam they braced up for the hard easterly beat to rendezvous with the convoy the weather was freshening their bows met foamstreaked waves at an angle dipping before them then rearing up to smash them apart in explosions of white standing aft kydd felt the sheeting spray in his teeth with canvas taut as a drum weather rigging harping to the winds bluster and far on their beam ceres swooping and seething along under small sail he was happier than he had been for some time there would be no problems with the enemyany rational privateer would have long since scuttled southwards until the weather improved no prize could be boarded in this by afternoon they had not sighted the convoy almost certainly it had been delayed by the poor weather houghton on the quarterdeck in oilskins slick with spray obviously had no plans to return to port and at the end of the day they shortened sail and kept enough way on the ship to head the easterly it showed signs of veering which had the master muttering anxiously to houghton at midnight they wore to the south and at the end of the middle watch took the third leg of a triangle to approximate their dusk position again a cold dawn brought no improvement in the weather just the same streaming fresh gale and lively decks aswill with water there was no sign of the convoy but ceres had stayed with them and by midmorning there was a flutter of colour at her peak halliards the convoy had been sighted widely scattered the ships were struggling to stay together it was a miracle that they were even within sight of each other after so many thousands of miles of ocean without a convoy plan kydd had no idea how many there should be but a quick count enabled him to report what must be a sizeable proportion to the captain when he appeared on deck were looking for lord woolmer shes carrying the new lieutenantgovernor houghton said brusquely an exindiaman be so good as to apprise the lookouts and report to me when shes in sight ships of all kinds laboured past converging on the rendezvous position some showed obvious signs of storm damage towards the rear a battered sloop appeared oddly out of shape with a truncated foretopmast but bent on coming up with tenacious heave to please houghton ordered as he took the officerofthewatchs speaking trumpet and waited the sloop barrelled up to leeward and backed her headsails close by the little vessels appalling motion was only too apparentshe was bucking in deep jerky movements bursts of spray sheeting over the small huddle at the wheel whereislordwoolmer houghton called a figure in the sloop made his way to the shiny wet shrouds and aimed a speaking trumpet kydd could hear thin sounds from it but not make out what was said the sloop showed canvas enough for it to ease in its exaggerated bucketing so much the more pitiable as it lurched closer alongside woolmer sprung mainmastleft her at fiftyfive twenty westrunning down fortythree north at that longitude she was considerably to eastward of her course somewhere in the stormy grey of the atlantic she had encountered a squall that had nearly taken her mainmast by the board she would have fished the mast with capstan bars and anything to hand then been grateful for the easterly which at least would have her heading slowly but surely for halifax looking down from the deck of tenacious kydd felt for the sloop commander without a soul to ease the decision out there in the lonely ocean he had needed to weigh the consequences of standing by the injured vessel with her important cargo or resume his watch over the convoy his presence was proof of the hard resolution he had made to him the value to england of the merchant ships had outweighed that of one big ship and her passenger the sloop sheeted home and thrashed away after her convoy houghton turned to the master mr hambly all sail conformable to weather i believe we shall lay on the larbd tack initially with a view to returning to starbd and intersecting our fortythree north line of latitude somewhere about fiftyseven west longitude much depended on the weather lord woolmer was heading westwards as close as she could stay to a known line of latitude if tenacious sailed along the same line in the opposite direction they should meet the problem was that the wind was dead foul from the eastin difficult conditions tenacious would need to tack twice to intersect the line at the probable furthest on of the other ship and woolmer herself would be finding it hard to be sure of her latitude without sight of the sun for days at a time kydd went below to find a dry shirt he was watchondeck for the last dogwatch and wanted to be as comfortable as possible there would be no going below later as he came back up the companionway he saw the master face set grimly entering his tiny sea cabin do ye think th easterly will hold kydd asked wedging himself against the door for balance the hanging lanthorn cast moving shadows in the gloom see this hambly tapped the barometer its vertical case on gimbals also aswing his face seemed old and more lined in the dim light twentynine n three fourths these waters as soon as we gets a drop moren a tenth of an inch below our mean fr the season stand by an weve had a drop o two tenths since this morning he checked the chart again and straightened north atlantic even at this time o year its folly to trust it wouldnt surprise me t see it veer more southerly an if thats with a further drop were in for a hammering kydd turned to go then asked youll be about tonight mr hambly i will sir said the master with a tired smile in the last of the light the foretop lookout sighted strange sail it was lord woolmer with no fore and aft canvas from the main or anything above her course she put up her helm to run down on tenacious and kydd could imagine the relief and joy aboard with luck they would be safe in halifax harbour in two or three days and the story of their crossing would be told in the warmth and safety of their homes for months to come by the time the ship had come up with tenacious it was too dark for manoeuvres so they waited until the big somewhat ungainly merchantman pulled ahead then fell in astern three lanthorns at her foreyard to comfort the other ship whose stern lanthorns were plainly visible the morning brought the southeasterly that the master had feared the wind had strengthened and the barometer dropped it was time for even a wellfound ship like tenacious to take the weather seriously houghton did not waste time mr pearce mr renzi well have the tgallant masts on deck the jibboom was brought in forward aloft all rigging that could possibly carry away to disaster was doubled up preventer braces rolling tackles put on the yards slings trussesnothing could be trusted to hold in the great forces unleashed in a storm anchors were stowed outboardthey would be of crucial importance should land be seen to leewardand were secured against the smash of seas on the bows with tough double ring painters and lashing along the length of the stock the rudder too was vital to safeguard a relieving tackle was rigged in the wardroom and a spare tiller brought out it would need fast work to ship a new onerawson could be trusted in this or to rouse out a portable compass and align its lubberline to the ships head for use if the tiller ropes from the wheel on deck broke the relieving tackle would then be used to steer on each deck a hatchway forward and aft ventilated the space through gratings these now were covered with strong canvas and fastened securely with battens nailed around the coaming seas breaking aboard might otherwise send tons of water into the ships bowels the most feared event in a storm was a gun breaking loose a big cannon might smash through the ships side the gunner and his party worked from forward and secured them each muzzle seized like an ox to the ringbolt above the closed gunport with double breechings and side frappings finally on deck lifelines were rigged fore and aft on each side of the masts and on the weather mizzen shrouds a canvas cloth was spread to break the blast for the helm crew tenacious was now snugged for a blow kydd hoped that the same was true for the merchantman what would probably be of most concern to her captain was the state of his noble passengers however splendid their appointments their cabins would now be a hell on earth the motion would be such that the only movement possible would be hand to hand their only rest taken tied into a wildly moving cot their world confined to a box shaken into a malodorous seasick chaos the ships plunged on into the angry seas aboard muscles wearying of the continual bracing and staggering along the deck eyes saltsore in the raw cold and the streaming wet kydd made a circuit of the deck looking for anything that could conceivably fret itself into a rapidly spiralling danger he checked little things that the drainholes of the boats were kept open their deckgripes bartaut spare spars under them lashed into immobility when he stripped off in the damp fug of the wardroom he could see his own concern reflected in others eyes and renzi wore a taut expression he pulled on wool long undergarments loose pullovers anything to keep out the sapping cold of the streaming wind this was no longer an exhilarating contest with neptune but something sinister the first feelings of anxiety stole over kydd there was a point in every storm when the elements turned from hard boisterousness to malevolence a sign that mankind was an interloper in something bigger than himself where lives counted for nothing back on deck kydd had no need to check the compass to see that the wind had veered further the angle of the treblereefed topsails was now much sharper if it continued much past south they stood to be headed prevented from making for nova scotia to the west no more than two days away kydd could just make out a few words as he approached houghton who was talking to the master under the halfdeck near the wheel or lie to sir hambly pointed out over the foamstreaked seas beneath the windscoured waves a swell long and massive was surging up and it came from the southwest a portent of the great storm that had sent it kydd glanced at the merchantman they were but two days from port so near yethoughton had no authority over her and indeed if he had it was difficult to see how any meaningful signal could be made the monster crosses our way sir and im not sanguine of th chances of a wounded ship in a real north atlantic storm continued the master we stay with lord woolmer that must be our duty houghton said abruptly within the hour woolmer began to turnaway from the wind shes scudding said houghton no sir i do believe she wears the ship continued round slowly and uncomfortably until she had come up on the opposite starboard tack where she held atry about four points from the wind i thought so hambly said against the bluster of the wind at the edges of the halfdeck hes seen enough of the western ocean t know that if theres a turn fr the worse the shift will come out of somewheres close to th north and wants to get his staying about over with now it also meant that woolmer had given up hope of making it through to halifax and now lay to under storm canvas going very slowly ahead waiting out the storm kydds heart went out to the passengers who must be near to despair storms could last weeks tenacious was set to edging round to conform and together the two vessels endured by midday the seas had worsened and the winds sullen moan had keened to a higher pitch a dismal drone with whistling overtones the swell had increased and the depth between each crest became a dismaying plunge and rise kydd had experienced caribbean hurricanes but this was of a different quality the cold at its heart gave it a unique dark malice like the other officers kydd stayed on deck at noon they took stale bread and cold tongue biscuit and anchovies then resumed their vigil suddenly a mass of panicstricken men burst up from the after hatchway spilling on to the deck falling over themselves to be out a chill stabbed at kydd a seaman shouted hoarsely gotta loose gun bryant dropped his food and raced for the hatchway shouting to kydd a dozen micksnow because of the weather the hammocks had all been stowed below in the lowest deck kydd stood in the hatchway snatching a dozen men to a halt down t the orlopwell go under he plunged recklessly down the hatchway praying they would follow as he passed the level of the gundeck he had a brief glimpse of a squat black creature crouching for the kill he hurried on finally in the orlop he paused to allow his eyes to adjust then he set the men to work in the wildly heaving gloom hammocks were passed up while kydd cautiously entered the deserted gundeck the gun stood out brazenly from the ships side the muzzle lashing had pulled its ringbolt from rotten wood and some weighty motion of the ship had subsequently caused the iron forging of the breeching tackle on one side to give way the big cannon had swung out and held by a few stranded ropes was all but free bryant stood to one side with a crew of seamen armed with handspikes kydd signalled to the first men to come up stand your ground the first lieutenant roared at the men hesitating at his back the whites of their eyes showed as they fearfully hefted their handspikes and waited for the order when kydds men had temporarily stopped the beast with hammocks thrown in its path bryants would hurl themselves on it with the handspikes in an attempt to overturn it tenacious rose to a wave and fell to starboard it was all that was needed the remaining ropes parted with a dull twang and the twentyfourpounder trundled across the deck accelerating as it went the men threw themselves back at the sight of the unrestrained rampage while the cannon hurtled at the opposite side then the deck heaved the other way the gun slowed and stopped trickling back and forth in a grotesque parody of a bullfight as the ship hesitated at the top of a roll the next headlong charge might be the last er can we help lieutenant best accompanied by half a dozen marines stood uncomprehending and hesitating at the hatchway no get em away kydd appreciated his courage but a crowd was not neededonly a handful of daring active seamen he glanced behind him chamberlain the midshipman with the agility of youth lamb a spry topman thorn steady and quick he had enough each a mick an follow merest wait until we has it cornered then move in fast he seized a trussed hammock for himself and moved forward feeling the eyes of bryants crew on him tenaciouss bows rose to a comber the deck canted up and the cannon suddenly rolledtowards him kydd threw the hammock before it and flung himself to one side it thrust by skidding on the hammock and fetched up against the mainmast with a splintering crash chamberlainhere lamb n thorn get in behind it he spotted best still hovering get out of it he snarled and pushed the crestfallen officer away they must close in at whatever risk bryants crew could do nothing until the beast was stopped and then they had seconds only the next few minutes would see heroes or death warily he approached the cannon trying to gauge the seas outside the bows began to rise again and he tensed but the downward motion of the cannon abruptly changed course as the wave angled under her keel and it rumbled headlong towards the ships side and where best stood paralysed with horror it happened very quickly a fatal wavering and the twoton monster caught him snatched him along and slammed against anothera choking squeal and a brief image of spurting blood limbs and white bone bests body was flung to the deck yet his sacrifice was the saving of the ship caught in the guns small wheels his body caused the cannon to slew and stop kydd hurled his hammock in its path others threw themselves at it bryants crew with handspikes levering furiously frantically they had won shaken kydd needed the open decks lord woolmer lay to a mile or so away taking seas on her bows in explosions of white pitching and rolling under her scraps of sail hambly was standing by the main shrouds looking up at the racing dark clouds and the torn seascape on seeing kydd he shouted were takin it more from the west i fear the rest of his words were snatched away by the winds blast and this means kydd had not heard houghton approach behind them hambly wheeled round then respectfully accompanied them to the shelter of the halfdeck sir it means the centre o the storm is placin itself right in our path well be down t bare poles at this ratewe should really bear away an scud instead of lyin to theres no hope this storm is goin to blow itself out sir kydd wondered whether the real reason woolmer was hanging on was the reluctance of her captain to deny his passengers hope of a harbour and surcease to scud was to abandon all attempts even to hold a position and simply fly before the violence but this was to turn about and be blown back over the miles they had won at such cost i understand mr hambly but we stay with them conditions were deteriorating and it was hard to keep them in sight the air was filled with stinging spray the motion of the ship becoming a shuddering heave as the seas grew more confused the hours wore on kydd imagined what it must be like for the people of woolmer an indescribable nightmare endlessly protracted after midday woolmer finally submitted to fate and made the decision to scud it would be touch and go the swells issuing from the storm centre were now more than forty feet high higher even than the lower yards and clawed into white streaks by the pitiless wind they had left it perilously late to fall off the wind then run before it they must first pass through the most dangerous time of allbroadside to the powerful seas tenacious stood by while woolmer began to turn all aboard holding their breath her captain had clearly planned his turn away from the wind for the small sail left on main and mizzen vanished at exactly the same time as her headsails mounted the leverage told and the ship plunging and rocking like a fractious horse began putting her bow downwind faster and faster a rampaging comber burst on her side checking her movement but with the appearance of square sail on her foreloosed by some heroic topmen aloftwoolmer completed her turn rolling drunkenly at first she settled to her new track a princely piece of seamanship as ever ive seen and with an injured mast exclaimed houghton kydd quietly agreed it had been well done indeed at least they has no worry o being pooped said hambly eyeing the stately east indiamans high stern with a following sea there was always the danger of a giant wave overtaking and crowding on to her deck to sweep everything before it thats not m worry kydd saidseared on his memory was fighting the helm of a similarsized vessel in the great southern ocean the frigate artemis on her way round cape horn hambly looked at him troubled whats that sir no matter kydd could not voice the fears that had been triggered by the memory houghton broke in decisively im going to scud under foretopmast staysl and a closereefed fore topsl mr hambly aye sir hands went to their stations kydd on the poop at the mizzen the reefed driver was brought in and all sail aft disappeared released seamen sent to the main deck tenacious began her turn experiencing the same vertiginous rolls before she too was round with the hard wind at her stern barely set on her course tenaciouss fore topsail split and was instantly transformed to streaming ribbons ill have a quicksaver on that houghton shouted at the hurrying boatswain ordering the replacement topsail and a pair of ropes to be crossed over the sail to prevent it ballooning forward then there were cries of horror no more than half a mile away kydd saw woolmer her silhouette dark against the white of the spindrift strangely misshapen her weakened mainmast had given way under the wind pressure it had splintered and fallen in ruin over the side while tenacious watched agonised the inevitable happened the crew were unable to cut away the substantial wreckage in time and it acted as a drag to one side woolmer yawed pulled to one side she was at the mercy of the onrushing water which pushed her further broadside kydds fears had come to pass with no ability to come back on course she was forced right over on her beam ends and the giant seas fell on the helpless vessel lord woolmer capsized in a smother of wreckage her long hull a glistening whalelike rock for a time before she disappeared altogether lords ladies and common seamen gone for ever mr hambly said houghton in an unnatural voice the best course for us hambly tore his eyes away from the scene and pulled himself together er to the suthard would keep us frm the centre we scuds afore the westerly thats undoubted until we can show canvas and come abouttheres nothing more we cn do sir alone tenacious fought the sea men moving silently in a pall of disbelief senses battered by the hammering wind for all of twenty hours the ship ran before the tempest until in the early hours of the next day the master judged it possible to set square sail on the main and thereby edge closer to the wind by evening the winds had moderated to the extent that at last tenacious could ease round more westward towards the now distant halifax but the storm had one last trial for the old ship by degrees the wind shifted north and the temperature fell the first whirling snowflakes came then snow squalls that marched across the seas with dark brassy interiors bringing intense cold it got worse ice covered shrouds sails decks freezing exposed faces it stiffened wet ropes to bars that seamen with frozen fingers in wet gloves and feet in agony with the cold had to wrestle with to coil even breathing was painful kydd bound a cloth round his face but it soon clogged with ice as moisture froze below the wardroom stank of damp wool beargrease and the hides used in foulweather gear no one spoke it was too much effort renzi sat with his head in his hands on kydds watch the wind moan increased the pitiless blast buffeting him with its fearsome chill he hugged himself grateful for his moosehide jacket and thought of the hapless men in the focsle in the scrappiest clothing against the numbing chill they had to muster on watch day and night working enduring hambly came over shall have t take in the main topsl he said looking significantly at kydd they had been fortunate until now that they carried the same square sail close reefed fore and main topsails but the wind had increased again kydd stared up at the straining sail there was no question the ship was overpressed in these conditions and must be relievedhe could feel it in her laboured response to the helm he was officerofthewatch and the responsibility was his not the masters but there was the deadly glitter of ice on the shrouds in the tops and along the yards how could he send men aloft in the almost certain knowledge that for some there would be a cry a fall and death his eyes met hamblys there was understanding but no compassion without a word kydd turned and made his way down to the main deck where the watch on deck shivered hunkered down in the lee of the weather bulwarks they looked up as he descended their faces dull fatigued and pinched with cold he paused how could he order them to go aloft into a howling icy hell perhaps some rousing speech to the effect that the ship they themselves even depended on them taking their lives into their hands and going aloft no kydd had been in their place and knew what was needed his face hardened off yr rumps y lazy swabs i want th main topsl handed now they pulled themselves slowly to their feet their weary stooped figures and bloodshot eyes wrung his heart lay aloft he roared every man obeyed kydd allowed a grim smile to surface an therell be a stiff tot fr every man jack waiting for ye when you get back get moving for two hours ninety feet above kydds head the men fisted the stiff sail in a violently moving lethal world fingernails split and canvas was stained with blood tired muscles slipped on icy wood and scrabbled for a hold minds retreating into a state of numbed endurance and for two hours kydd stood beneath his fists balled in his pockets willing them on feeling for them agonising that day he discovered that there was only one thing of more heroism than going aloft in such a hell the moral courage to order others to do it for two more days tenacious fought her way clear of the storm which eventually headed north increasing in malevolence as it went on the third day the sambro light was raisedand after a night of standing off and on hms tenacious entered harbour chapter damn that cursed tailor will hound me to my grave groaned pringle the mailboat had arrived back from the dockyard and the wardroom sat about the table opening letters and savouring news from home adams clutching six retired to his cabin but bampton slipped his into a pocket and sipped his brandy balefully watching the animation of the others kydd was trying to make sense of his borrowed essays on politesse among nations despairing of the turgid phraseology his restraint in matters social and sudden access of interest in literature was generally held to be owing to some obscure improving impulse and he was mostly left to it you dont care for letters mr kydd pybus said with acerbity he had received none himself but was still scratching away lazily with his quill kydd looked up and saw that there was indeed one letter left on the table for me he picked it up from m sister doctor he said she wrote closely and as usual had turned the page and written again at rightangles through the first to be frugal in the postage well demanded pybus but kydd was not listening dear thomasor should say nicholas as wed do hopeyou are keeping well my dears and wrapping up warm the willows are budding eary along the wey here in guilrdand the words rushed on and kydd smiled to picture cecilia at her task her evident concern for them both warmed him but her admiration for him as an officer in the kings navy sparked melancholy a hurried paragraph concluded the letter and fathersays that it would befservice tohimsshouhdyou enquire after his brother matthew you remember they came to some sort of a misunderstanding an age ago and his brother sailed to phdadephia papa says that was in since then we have heard nothing of him except that in the warfor independence he was a loyalist and went north with the others to hahfam in about thomas it would soplease papa to know that he is alive and welldo seejfyou canfind him of course his uncle an adventurer in this wilderness land carving a future for himselfor perhaps he was a successful trader even a shipowner in the profitable atlantic trade routes news pybus said drily oh aye seems it could be m uncle is here doctor in halifax who would credit it a kydd ashore possibly one who had achieved eminence in society and was highly thought of in the community for the first time in a long while he felt a rush of excitement i do believe im t visit him today kyddmr matthew kydd it was strange uttering the words there were not so many kydds in the world that it felt anything other than his own name the man he had stopped considered for a moment cant say as ive heard of the gentleman sir he said finally you may wish to try linnards the tailors youll understand they know all the gentry hereabouts but kydd was tiring of the chase it was becoming clear that his uncle was far from being a notable in halifax it had been foolish of him to imagine that one of modest origins could have pretences at high officebut this did not mean that he had not secured a lesser wellrespected place in society he toiled up the street a curious mix of fine stone edifices and shoddy clapboard buildings but it was not practical to think of entering and asking at random there had to be a more efficient way an idea came to him he would contact mr greaves the commissioner for lands if his uncle was in any form a landowner he would know him kydd brightened as he savoured the effect on his uncle of receiving a card out of the blue from a lieutenant kydd shortly about to call the land registry was a stiff walk well to the south and kydd set out along barrington street past the elegance of st pauls church a line of soldiers was marching up and down on the large open area to his right and when kydd approached the young officer in command halted his men and brought them to attention then wheeled about and saluted kydd lifted his hat to him which seemed to satisfy with a further flourish of orders the soldiers resumed their marching then an unwelcome thought struck supposing his uncle had fallen on hard times or was still a humble tradesman it would make no difference to himbut if greaves thought he was of lowly origins it might prove embarrassing he would move cautiously and find out first to be sure a kydd murmured the clerk at the desk of the weathered timber structure near the old burying ground there was one such resident of sackville street i seem to recall but that was some years ago let me see he polished his spectacles and opened a register ahwe have here one matthew kydd bachelor established as trader and landowner in the year property on sackville street hmmmhere we have a contribution to the sambro light er the usual taxation receipts it was certainly his uncle at last how would he greet him he had never met the man he had sailed from england well before kydd had been born should it be uncle matthew or perhaps a more formal salutation which means sir we have nothing later than the year kydds face dropped so we find no evidence at all for his continued existence after then im sorry none no sir you may wish to consult the parish books of st pauls for record of his deceasethere was fever here at the time you understand thank ye sir kydd made to leave but another clerk was hovering nearby sir you may be interested in this they moved to the other end of the office my wife admired mr kydds work he said which is why she bought this for me it was a handsomely carved horn of plenty taking bold advantage of the twisted grain of the wood and supported at the base by a pair of birds you will understand that time is on our hands in the winter mr kydd used to occupy his in carving which i think you will agree is in the highest possible taste kydd stroked the polished wood something his own near relative had created it felt alive yes those birds the clerk mused i confess i have no knowledge of them at alltheyre not to be seen in this part of canada but mr kydd always includes them in his work its a custom here a species of signature for claiming fine work as your own but i recognise it well enough kydd said this is yr cornish chough sir and its the bird you find in the coatofarms of our own earl onslow of clandon and guildford the man looked back at him with a bemused kindliness but there was nothing more to learn here kydd emerged into the day he was not yet due back aboard so his hunt would continue but at st pauls there was no entry for matthew kydd in births deaths or marriages a whole hour of searching in the gloom of the old church sacristy yielded only two entries in the tithebook and a smudged but tantalising reference to banns being called a mystery at one time he had existed now he did not it was time to face the most unsatisfactory result of all his uncle was not in halifax but somewhere else in canadaor for that matter he could be anywhere and it explained why no one seemed to know of a kydd in halifax he would regretfully conclude his search and write to his father accordingly if youd be so good tom adams seemed anxious but it did not take much imagination to grasp why he would want to absent himself from church that sunday morning i trust shes so charming you hold it of no account that you put your immortal soul to hazard kydd said the captain had made it plain that he wanted an officer from tenacious at the morning service on sundays and it was adamss turn kydd had no strong feelings about religion although he enjoyed the hearty singing of the grand old hymns with his methodist upbringing he was inured to sitting inactive for long periods army officers with ladies on their arms swept into the church other ranks waited respectfully outside and would crowd in later kydd took off his hat and made his way inside settling for an outside seat in a pew towards the front nodding to the one or two other naval officers scattered about a pleasantfaced woman sat down next to him and flashed him an impish smile there my dear said the stern stiffly dressed man by her settling a rug about her knees thank you she said and as soon as it was seemly to do so turned to kydd and whispered i dont think ive seen you here sir lieutenant kydd of the tenacious he whispered back unsure of the etiquette of the occasion mrs cox your first visit to halifax lieutenant the church was filling fast but the front pew was still decorously empty yes mrs cox er a fine place fr trade indeed but when i was a little girl it was a horrid place believe me lieutenant she smiled again there was a damp penetrating cold in the cavernous interior of the church barely relieved by two fatbellied stoves smoking in corners kydd shivered and wished he had brought a watchcoat mrs cox fumbled in her muff here you are lieutenant she said proffering a silver flask get some inside and you wont feel the cold it was prime west indian rum at his illconcealed astonishment she pressed it on him go onwe all have to aghast at the thought of drinking in church kydd hesitated then redfaced took a pull but as he lowered the flask he saw an august personage and his lady sweeping up the aisle crimson with embarrassment kydd froze with a gracious inclination of her head the woman smiled and continued kydd handed back the flask and settled for the service trying not to notice the distracting stream of servants bringing hot bricks for the feet of the quality in the front row outside after the service when they passed pleasantries kydd remembered that mrs cox had been born in halifax impulsively he asked i wonder mrs cox can you remember lessn ten years ago a gentleman by the name of kydd matthew kydd she considered at length i cant say that i do lieutenant a relation my uncleim tryin to find him mr cox pulled his ear as if trying to recall something er there was a gentleman by that name i thinkrecollect he was in corn and flour on sackville street finelooking fellow thats him said kydd a look of embarrassment flashed over coxs face ah he gave a warning glance to his wife whose hand flew to her mouth then im truly sorry to tell you he is no more cox said quietly kydd swallowed yes in about the year ninetyor was it ninetyonehe went to chignecto with his partner looking out prospects but unhappily was mortally injured by a bear i remember it was in the newspapersuch a dreadful thing mrs cox added it never does to disturb them in their sleep the brutes cox drew himself up im grieved that your search has led you to this sir i do hope that the remainder of your time in halifax will be more felicitous good day to you lieutenant as was usual for officers in harbour kydds duties were light and he felt he owed it to his father to gather the circumstances of his brothers demise possibly he had family a widow he would get the details from the newspaper and pass them on the halifax journal office was on barrington street not far from grand parade and the man inside was most obliging yes indeed i remember the story well a fine man come to such a fate uncle you say ill find the issue presently if you would be so good on a table near the compositing desk kydd learned the sad details of his uncles death he had gone to chignecto on the other side of nova scotia exploring prospects in muskrat and beaver his business partner an edward gilman had accompanied him but of the two who had set out only one returned gilman he had buried his friend and partner at the edge of the wilderness by the sea then brought back the news judging by the upset expressed in the newspaper matthew kydd had been a man of some substance and standing and was sorely missed kydd leafed idly through the rest of the paper out in the street he determined that before he wrote to his father he would find gilman ask what kind of man his uncle was find out something about his end sackville street was just round the corner steep and colourful with timber dwellings and shops some were worn and weathered others painted brown and yellow or red and white he found a corn factor with a faded sign telling him that this was gilmans establishment there was no mention of kydd he went into the dusty office where he was met by a suspiciouslooking clerk may i speak with mr gilman kydd asked concernin what thats my business kydd said the man hesitated clearly baffled by kydds naval uniform mr gilman he called gennelman wants t see you kydd had the feeling of eyes on him eventually a hardlooking man appeared his face showing distrust im gilman yes i think y knew matthew kydd gilman tensed but said nothing you were with him when he was killed by a bear youre english gilman said slowly he was m uncle came t canada in seventyeight gilmans expression altered slightly i werent with him that was my pap the man must have lost his youth early in this hard country kydd reflected id be much obliged if he could talk with me a little about m uncle he said he cant at kydds sharp look he added hes bin buried in the ol burying ground do you remember matthew kydd no it was flat and final pybus was unsympathetic chasing after longlost relatives is seldom a profitable exercise now you have the task before you of communicating grief and loss where before there was harmless wondering well done my boy kydd sharpened his pen and addressed himself to the task how to inform his father that his brother was no more and had met his end in such a hideous way the plain factssimply a notification or should he spare his father by implying that his death was from natural causes kydd had never been one for letters and found the task heavygoing he decided to wait for renzis return there was no urgency and renzi could readily find words for him fine elegant words that would meet the occasion he put aside his paper and went up on deck the master had a telescope trained down the harbour dye see that schooner sir countrybuilt an every bit as good as our own devon craft kydd took the telescope aye not as full in th bow an has sweet lines on her he kept the glass on the vessel as hambly added an thats because of the ice up the st lawrence o course theyll ship a bowgrace in two or three weeks when the ice really breaks up nasty t take one o them floes on the bow full tilt like the approaching vessel stayed prettily and shortened sail preparatory to anchoring kydd watching her she was a new vessel judging by the colour of her sails and running rigging he shifted the view to her trim forefoot pausing to admire her figureheada scottish lass holding what appeared to be a fistful of heather a striking figure in a streaming cloak with a pair of birds at her feet birds he steadied the telescope and holding his breath peered hard he kept his glass on the schooner as she glided past there was no mistake they were cornish choughs ill be damned kydd said softly then he swung on hambly tell me he said urgently do y know which yard it was built thisn cant say as i does hambly seemed surprised at kydds sudden energy theres scores o shipyards up n down the coast most quite able t build seagoin craft o this size it might be a coincidencebut kydd felt in his heart it was not the yawl ahoy he hailed over the side to tenaciouss boats crew then turned back to hambly im going t see that schooner mr hambly the master of the flora macdonald did not want to pass the time of day with a lieutenant royal navy his cargo was to be landed as soon as convenient and although an impress warrant was not current who could trust the navy however he did allow that the schooner was new and from st johns island in the great gulf of st lawrence specifically the yard of arthur owen in new london was it conceivable that his uncle had survived and was now working as a shipcarver on an island somewhere on the other side of nova scotia it made no sense to kydd why hadnt his uncle returned to take up his business it was coincidence it had to be but he knew he would regret it if he did not follow up this tantalising sign a quick glance at a chart showed st johns island no more than a couple of days sail with a fair wind and if canso strait was free of ice although tenacious was required in port by the absence of the admiral and his flagship activity aboard was light and there was no difficulty with his request for a weeks leave it was probably only someone continuing his uncles particular carving signature but the expedition would be a welcome change and would give him a chance to see something of canada he asked adams if he wished to come and was not surprised at his regretshis diary was full for weeks ahead kydd was going to adventure alone vessels were making the run to the newly icefree st johns island with supplies after the winter and kydd quickly found a berth in a coastal schooner the ethel may wearing comfortable plain clothes he swung in his small seabag the beat up the coast was chill and wet but the schooners fore and aft rig allowed her to lie close to the northeasterly and she made good time cape breton island the hilly passage of canso strait then the calmer waters in the gulf and early in the morning of the second day they closed with st johns island it was a flat barely undulating coastline with red cliffs and contrasting pale beaches the dark carpet of forest was blotched in places with clearings and even before they gybed and passed the long narrow sandspit into new london bay kydd had seen signs of shipbuildinggaunt ribs on slipways timber stands distant smoke from pitch fires in the sheltered waters the schooner glided towards a landing stage with a scatter of tidy weatherboard buildings beyond where y bound owens yard kydd answered the skipper pointed along the foreshore around th point one o the oldest on st johns he pronounced it sinjuns thank ye kydd said feeling for coins to put into the mans outstretched hand it had been a quick trip and sleeping in a borrowed hammock in the tiny saloon was no imposition kydd pushed past the crowd and the buckboard carts that had materialised on the schooners arrival hefted his seabag and set out the road was slush and red mud that the passing inhabitants seemed to ignore women wore oldfashioned bonnets and carried large bundles their skirts long enough for modesty but revealing sturdy boots beneath men passed in every kind of dress utility and warmth took first place over fashion all looked at kydd with curiosityfew strangers came to this outoftheway place the buildings were all of a style mainly timbered with high steeply sloping roofs the fields were woodenfenced not a stone wall in sight english hamlets had lanes that meandered over the countryside here there were bold straight lines in everything from settlements to roads the shipyard was not big two slipways and a jetty a blacksmiths shop and buildings presumably housing the workforce kydd tried to keep his hopes in check but he felt a thrill of anticipation as he approached one of the halfbuilt hulls is this mr owens yard he hailed shipwrights at work high up on staging it is one called th one that built the flora macdonald the very same could y tell me if youve heard of a mr kyddmatthew kydd blurted kydd cant say as we heard any o that name on th island friend id like t meet the shipcarver who worked on her figurehead if y please kydd said we dont do carvin in this yard yell want josh ellis ellis ran a small business in town kydd found the shop and a wellbuilt man of about thirty came to the counter id like t speak with mr ellis kydd said thats me he was obviously not old enough to be his uncle kydd tried to hide his disappointment did you work the figurehead o the flora macdonald mr ellis flora macdonald he reflected thats right i remember now pretty little schooner from arthur owen do ye wish one for yself fine work kydd answered carefully did ye carve the birds an all i did what sort o birds are they then well i guess any ol bird nothin special nobody told you how t carve them what is it y wants not a carving i figure ellis said defensive im sorry if i offendedy see those birds are special cornish choughs you only find em in england an theyre rare ellis said nothing watching kydd an they remind me of m uncle you find em on the coatofarms of our earl in guildford there was still no response i came here because i thought id find out somethin of him kydd matthew kydd no one b that name on the island i cn tell y now he folded his arms across his chest kydd saw there was no point in continuing the whole thing looked like coincidence and if there was anything more he could not think why well it was only a fancy ill wish ye good day sir he decided to head back to his ship the landingstage was close but there were no vessels alongside and it was deserted he hesitated then made for the small general store in the main street to enquire about a passage back to halifax none i knows of tday the shopkeeper stroked his jaw could be ones goin tmorrow or the nextwe dont have a reglargoin packet only traders kydd lumped his bag on the counter seems im stranded ye have an inn b chance no sir he said with amusement but y might try mrs beckwith her husband were a seagoin gentleman yes indeed said mrs beckwith i have a room fit fer a admral bless ye stow yer dunnage an tonight ill bring alongside as fine a line o vittles asll stick t yer ribs kydd decided to walk off his expectations the letter was waiting to be written when he returned to tenacious and he was in no rush to begin it besides the tranquillity of this strange land was appealing tiny shoots of green were now appearing at the sunny edges of fields even flowers peeping up through winterbleached grass the silence stretched away into the distance it could not have been more remote from war and the striving of nations so far frm the old country mrs beckwith said as the dinner was brought in by a wellbuilt young man ohthis is mr cunnable he boards wi me too er yes that is its a long way t england mr kydd help yself this is our salt cod an we got a pile more o them potatoes now would ye mind tellin me how do th ladies in london town have their hair this year heard tell high style well powdered n greased over yr pads is quite past thank you mrs beckwith salt cod will be fine with me er the ladies o quality i think now are windin it up and fixin it to the top of their heads this is damn fine fish even if i do say so but these leaves i cant recollect we have any of them in england sour dock an sheep sorrel gives winter vittles a mort more flavour so youre a navy officer then y mustve been to some o them great balls an banquets with our prince edward they do say theyre goin to change the name o this island after him weve only been here a short while an our admiral is away in newfoundland but im sure well be invited soon kydd lifted his glass in it was a golden brown liquid which he tasted gingerly it was a species of ale with an elusive tang of malt and spice seedwheat winemade it mself tell me mr kydd in england do they she paused frowning at a knock on the door scuse me kydd nibbled at what appeared to be a pepperyflavoured dried seaweed and listened to mrs beckwiths shrill voice rising scolding and another quieter she returned eventually flushed and irritable its very wrong t disturb ye mr kydd but theres a woman here wants t see you an wont go away kydd got up shes irish warned mrs beckwith if y like shall i ask mr cunnable t set the dog on her no no ill come a woman in a shawl hung back in the darkness and spoke quietly good evenin to yez sorran youre the gennelman just come ter the island an asking after his uncle yes thats right then im t tell ye if tomorrow at noon y comes with me youll meet someone as knows what happened t him the next day dressed economically she was waiting motionless down the road kydd saw that despite her lined face she held herself proudly without a word she turned and walked away from the town where the river shoreline came close she turned down a path it led to the river and a birchbark canoe with an indian standing silently by it the woman muttered some words and the indian turned his black eyes on kydd and grunted the canoe was much bigger than he had imagined twenty feet long at least and made of birchbark strips there were cedar ribs as a crude framework and seams sewn with a black root it had half a dozen narrow thwarts and kydd was surprised to see it quite dry in the middle part a good five feet across there was a mound of baggage if yed kindly get in like this sorr the woman said she leaned across the canoe until she held both sides then transferring her weight stepped in neatly and sat be sure t stand in th very middle she added kydd did as he was told sitting behind her in the front part the indian shoved off swung in and began to ply his paddle in a powerful rhythm that quickly had them out in the river and gliding along rapidly he worked silently his face set like stone and the woman did not offer any conversation they left cleared land behind dark green anonymous forest stretching away endlessly on both sides eventually the indian ceased paddling then spun the canoe round and grounded it at the forests edge nearly there the woman said they left the indian to follow with the baggage and took a footpath into the trees kydd felt as if the forest was closing in with its hard green conifers uniformly shaped to shed snow unknown cries and sudden snapping in the undergrowth it was utterly different from the soft deciduous woodland of england kydd thought of his uncle killed by a bear that had burst from the trees and was afraid why had he agreed to this madness suddenly he glimpsed the dark blue of water and a grey spiral of smoke here the woman said happily as they came upon a cluster of log cabins in a patch of land leading down to the sea she called and a man appeared he stood on the porch of one of the largest cabins a big man longhaired and with a deep chest he wore moosehide worked with porcupine quills my husband joseph bourne sorr the man shook hands with kydd looking at him keenly kydd felt the strength and hardness in his clasp i hear you knew my uncle matthew kydd mr bourne kydd said very close t me he were bourne said at length in a deep canadian burr come inside sit yself down the cabin was snug and warm with a steeply sloping cedarshingle roof the logs chinked smoothly on the inside skins and two bear hams hung from the high beams woven indian matting decorated the walls and a pair of long guns was crossed above the fire it smelt pungently of smoke and human living two rocking chairs faced the fire and the men sat together m wife got t hear of you in town he said in a voice both soft and slow thought i could help kydd murmured something conscious of the mans look youre frm the old country bourne said frm what part do ye hail guildford which is in surrey very pretty i heard mr bourne ye said youd tell me of m uncle matthew said kydd all in gods good time friend bourne said and leaned round his chair colleen cn you fetch us a jug o beer darlin and some moose jerky our guests come a long way t be here now yr uncle matthew he collected a long pipe and tobacco pouch from the chimneypiece above the fire need t think he said as he stuffed the bowl and got a light from the fire when he had it going to satisfaction he started he came t nova scotia frm the colonies in seventyeightwanted no truck wi revolutions an that set himself up in business an did well for hisself then got destroyed by a bear in chignecto country kydd tried to hide his irritationthat much he already knew and if the man simply wanted company sir it would oblige me greatly should you his wife died in halifax o the fever had three bairns all taken that was in eightyfour he drew long on his pipe staring into the fire after that well i guess he took a diffrent slant on life got inta business corn tradin an such did well laid out silver in the right place an got him a govment contract fr the army set up in sackville street noticed by th governor but never remarried what kind o man dye think he was bourne poured from a stone jug into colourful pottery tankards and offered one from the woodsy taste kydd recognised it as spruce beerit had a compelling bitterness and he decided it was an acquired taste a straight arrow i reckon hard worker but mr bourne but im thinkin he werent so happy really he lapsed again into an introspective silence kydd coughed meaningfully and asked i have t ask if you know anything about his bein taken by the bear was it quick his father would want details bourne puffed once more then said quietly who wants t know why he had an elder brother whos my papa they parted years afore i was born some sort o misunderstanding m fathers gettin frail an hoped t be reconciled now i have to write t him you understand bourne got to his feet crossed to the fire and knocked out his pipe on a log he turned but did not resume his chair looking at kydd with an unsettling intensity then his gaze shifted his wife was standing rigid behind kydd staring at her husband his eyes returned to kydd youre a smart lad what d they call ye im thomastom kydd he looked steadily at the older man an do i call ye uncle he added softly in the stillness the hardwood fire snapped and spat sending up fountains of red sparks for a long time bourne held his silence until kydd thought he had not heard then he spoke i guess you do that he said come lass sit by we kydds uncle said after composure had been regained and whiskey had been downed she moved over and sat on the floor close im goin t tell ye the whole nine yards thomastom its a long ways frm here to guildford so dont go makin judgements before youve heard me out i told ye no lie about seven eight year ago i werent happy ye might say i was miserable i got t thinkin about life n all and knew i was awastin the years god gave me so i did somethin about it simple really i did a deal with m partnerned gilman right true sort he were i spelled out t him that if he said i was took by a bear an let me start a new life id let him have the business we shook on it an i guess thats ithere i am justgave him th business i did but he suffered for it his face wrinkled in amusement folk said th bear tale was all a storythat really hed murthered me an left me t rot while he came back alone n claimed th business kydd remembered the hostility his enquiries had met and now understood will ye leave yr bones here dye think it was a far far place england where ancient churches and the old ways comforted with graveyards ceremony and mourning at lifes end what was there of that in this raw land tom you dont know this land y never lived here its hard breakyrheart bad at times but its beautifulbecause its so hard he stood up suddenly come wi me he strode to the door and out into the gathering dusk the sun was going down in a display of soft lilac and grey a mist hung over the still waters and the peace was only broken by the secret sounds of nature see there its a land so big we dont know how far it is t the other side its new an raw open to allthe west an the north is all waiting mile on mile o country without its seen a man but thats what i want t be at peace m heart is here tom where i cn live like god means me to kydd saw his face light up as he spoke how d ye live yr carving turning to him the older man spoke quietly but firmly t you im a poor man i ask ye to think of what i have hereall m time is my own all of it this place is mine i built it mself as i want it and yes i carvein winter y has a lot o time an what better than t create with yr own hands he chuckled y saw the choughs i didnt think t see anyone frm old guildford here but it keeps me in coin enough t meet m needs he threw open a door to a side cabin in the gloom kydd could see huge figures griffins mermaids solemn aldermen and long decorative side panels the odour of freshcarved timber chips was resinous and powerful the yardsre startin for th year theyll be wantin the winters work now they trudged back to the main cabin a trainoil lamp was burning inside intensifying the shadows while the smell of beef pie and potatoes eddied about now m lad hows about you tell me about guildford an yr folks kydd talked of the old country of the stirring changes that had resulted from this final great war with the french the school they had bravely started the appearance of various little ones in the family at one point kydd stopped letting the stillness hang then asked carefully we were told there was a misunderstanding with my papa uncle was it s bad you remember it t this day his uncle guffawed loudly was at first but then i hears after she married someone else anyhow didnt seem right t start up writin again so the evening was a great success colleen brought out a hoarded jar of blueberry wine and in its glow stories of old times and old places were exchanged long into the dark night so youve never regretted it never his hand crept out to take hers in halifax theyd never let an irish woman in t their society id always be tryin here we live content the same as man n wife an here we stay the fire flared and crackled the hours passed and the fire settled to embers eventually kydd yawned have t return to m ship tomorrow he said with real regret his uncle said nothing staring into the fire then he took a deep breath seems y have a teaser on yr hands m boy a problem yes sir now consideryouve seen me alive n well you have t decide now what ye say to yr father the world knows i was killed by a bear are you goin to preserve m secret an let it stand or will ye ease his human feelings n say im here ii have t think on it was all kydd could find to say his uncle gave a slow smile im sure yell know what t do his gaze on kydd was longand fond wait here he said and went outside while he was gone kydds thoughts turned to his father where was the mercy in telling him that according to the world his brother was no more or on the other hand that his brother was alive and well but had turned his back on society preferring a pariah woman and a vast wilderness there was just one course he could take that would be both merciful and truthful he would say that according to the records his uncle matthew had lived in halifax doing well until but had then moved somewhere else in the immense country of canada in this way at least his father would remain in hope the door creaked open and his uncle returned with an object wrapped in old sacking youre goin to be the last kydd i ever sees he said thickly an im glad it were you see here he passed across the sacking it contained something heavy a single undistinguished black rock but breaking through it in several places kydd saw a dull metallic gleam gold astonished kydd took it feeling its weight fell down a ravine years ago goin after a animal an there it was but its no use t mei bring that t town an in a brace o shakes itll be crawlin with folks grubbin up th land an fightin never bin back leave th rest in the good earth where it belongs but you take itan use it to get somethin special something thatll always remind ye of yr uncle matthew in canada chapter seamen were hoisting in heavy stone bottles of sprucebeer essence admiral vandeput considered the drink essential to the health of his squadron ill sweat the salt frm your rascally bonessink me if i dont the squeaky voice of a midshipman was unconvincing he had a lot to learn about the handling of men kydd thought and turned away irritably he put his head inside the lobby adams had promised to relieve him but was nowhere to be found kydd returned impatiently to the quarterdeck the seamen had finished their work and all of the wickercovered jars were below at last the last man of the work party was still on deck slowly coiling down the yardarm tackle fall there was something disquieting about this thickset seaman kydd had seen him come aboard with the new men and several times hed noticed the man looking his way with a significant cast kydd paced forward the man glanced over his shoulder at him and turned his back busying himself with his task when kydd drew near he straightened and turned touching his forelock mr kydd sir he said his voice not much more than a low rasp surprised kydd stopped sir ye remembers me there was an edge of slyness to his manner that kydd did not like was he a sealawyer perhaps but the man was only a little shorter than kydd himself powerfully built with hard muscular arms and a deep tattooed chest he had no need of cozening ways on the messdeck the man gave a cold smile dobbie petty officer o the afterguard he added still in a low tone kydd could not recall anyone by that name the midshipman popped up out of the mainhatchway but saw them together and disappeared below again no cant say as i do kydd replied unless the seaman had something of value to say to an officer he was sailing closer to the wind than a common sailor should i dont remember you dobbienow be about yr duties he turned to go but dobbie said quietly in sandwich kydd stopped and turned dobbie stared back his gaze holding kydds with a hard intensity ayewhen you was there i remembers ye well sir it had been less than a year ago but the sandwich was a name kydd had hoped never to hear again she had been the mutineers flagship and at the centre of the whirlwind of insurrection and violence at the nore it had climaxed in failure for the mutiny and an end to the highminded attempt to complete the work begun at spithead many sailors had paid with their lives kydd had joined the mutiny in good faith but had been carried along by events that had overwhelmed them all but for mysterious appeals at the highest level he should have shared their fate dick parker now there was a prime hand don ye think saw what was goin on but concerns hisself with the men not th gentry sorely missed is he kydd drew back was dobbie simply trying to ingratiate himself or was this a direct attempt at drawing kydd into some crazy plot anxiety and foreboding flooded in either way this had to be stopped enough o this nonsense where i came from before i went t the quarterdeck is no concern o yours dobbie pay yr respects to an officer an carry on even in his own ears it rang false lacking in authority dobbie looked relaxed a lazy smile spreading across his face kydd glanced uneasily about no one was within earshot did ye not hear i said me mates said t me an whos this officer then newrigged an has the cut o the jib of the focsle about im what cn i say dobbie was confident and as watchful as a snake i keeps m silence cos i knows you has t keep discipline an if they catches on that you is th tom kydd as was alongside dick parker all the time what is it ye want kydd snapped dobbie picked up the end of the fall and inspected its whipping then squinted up at kydd ah well i was wonderinyou was in deep not a delegate but twas your scratch what was clapped on all them vittlin papers i saw yez now dont y think it a mort strange that so many good men went t the yardarm but mr tom kydd gets a pardon rest gets the rope you gets th kings full pardon n later the quarterdeck the lazy smile turned cruel we gets t sea the gennelmen in the focsle hear about you why could go hard fr a poxy spy kydd flushed dobbie tossed aside the rope and folded his arms your choice mr tom kydd you makes m life sweet aboardim agoin t be in your divisionor the focsle hands are goin to be getting some interestin news damn you t hell i didnt but dobbie turned and padded off forward kydd burned with emotion it was utterly beyond him to have spied treacherously on his shipmates as they had fought together for their rights he was incapable of such an act but the men of the focsle would not know that dobbie was one of them and he was claiming to have been with kydd at the mutiny and to have the full story unable to defend himself in person kydd knew there was little doubt whom they would believe the consequences could not be more serious he would not be able to command these men that much was certain the captain would quickly recognise this and he would be finished as an officer but it might be worse a dark night quiet watch and a belaying pin to the head then quickly overside and the wardroomif they believed he owed his advancement to spying and betrayal what future had he among them it was incredible how matters had reached such a stand so quickly he would have to move fast whatever his course the obvious action was to submit it had definite advantages nothing further would happen because it was in dobbies interest to keep his leverage intact and it would be simple kydd as an officer could easily ensure dobbies comfortable existence the other tack would be to brazen it out but kydd knew this was hopeless he would be left only with his pride at not yielding to blackmail and that was no choice at all he yearned for renzis cool appraisal and logical options he would find the answers but he was in newfoundland kydd was not close to adams and the others he would have to face it alone his solitary haunted pacing about the upper deck did not seem to attract attention and two hours had passed before he found his course of action kydd knew the lower deck its strengths and loyalties as well as its ignorance its rough justice and depth of sentiment could move mens souls to achieve great thingsor stir them to passionate vindictiveness he would now put his trust in them an unshakeable faith that he even as an officer could rely on their sense of honour fairness and loyalty the afternoon ebbed to a pallid dusk and the hands secured then went below for grog and supper kydd waited until they were in full flow then he went down the after hatchway to the gundeck and paused at the foot of the ladder the messtables were rigged and the usual warm conviviality of a mealtime enlivened by rum rose noisily from the tables between the rows of guns a few curious looks came his way but in the main seamen were more interested in the gossip of the day and he was ignored methodically he removed his cocked hat then he took off his lieutenants uniform coat and laid it carefully over his arm by this time he had the attention of the nearest who looked at him in astonishment he paced forward slowly and with terrible deliberation one by one the tables lapsed into an amazed silence which grew and spread until the whole gundeck fell into an unnatural quiet and men craned forward for a better view kydd continued his walk his face set and grim eyes fixed forward in an unblinking stare he was either right to trust or he had lost everything he passed the great jeer capstan the mighty trunk of the mainmast the main hatch gratings his measured tread now sounding clear and solemn he halted abreast the fore capstan his eyes still fixed forward slowly his gaze turned to one side dobbie sat transfixed at the mess by numberfive gun kydd marched over not a man moved he held dobbie with his eyes dropping his words into the silence ill be waiting for yethe mizzen tavern at two tomorrow then he wheeled about and began the long walk back down the silent gundeck in the privacy of his cabin kydd buried his face in his hands as an officer there was no question of how to deal with a slur on ones honour a duel was the inevitable result dobbie was not a gentleman therefore kydd could not demean himself in calling him out but this was a matter for the lower deck different rules applied by now the news would be already around the ship it was too late for him to back awayand also for dobbie dobbie was big and a bruiser well used to a mill kydd could take care of himself but this was another matter of a surety he would be the loser in all probability suffering a battering and disfiguring injury but the result would be worth it never more would any man question his honour or integrity dobbies word would be hollow against that of a man who had set aside the power and privileges that were his by right to defend his honour in the traditional way kydd had no fear of it coming to the ear of the captain or any other officer for that matter it would be common currency on the messdecks and every seaman and petty officer would know of it but it was their business and as with so many other things the quarterdeck never would hear of it he slept well there was little to be gained in brooding on hypothetical events of the next day and in any case there was nothing he could do about it now that events had been set in train as he moved about the ship there were surreptitious looks curious stares and a few morbid chuckles he went below to find his servant er tysoe there is something of a service i want you t do for me sir dont do it sir please i beg tysoe said with a low troubled voice youre a gentleman sir you dont have to go mixing with those villains i have to an thats an end to it tysoe hesitated then asked unhappily the service sir ahi want you to find a focsle hand who cn lend me a seamans rig fr this afternoon er itll be cleaned up after sir but tysoe did not leave disconsolately shuffling his feet sir im coming with you no kydd feared he would be instantly discovered and probably roughed up he could not allow it no but i thank ye for your concern there was a fitful cold drizzle when kydd stepped into the boat which gave him an excuse to wear a concealing oilskin poulden was stroke he had gruffly volunteered to see kydd through to the mizzen tavern but made determined efforts not to catch his eye as he pulled strongly at his oar they landed at kings slip without a word kydd and poulden stepped out and the boat shoved off the waterfront was seething with activity and they pushed through firmly to water street it was lined with crude shanties and pothouses raw weathered timbers abuzz with noise sailors and women coming and going the stink of old liquor and humanity in the air a larger hostelry sported a miniature mast complete with upper yards jutting out from a balcony the fore sir said poulden selfconsciously we has three inns the fore the main n the mizzen which beggin yer pardon we understands t be respectively the wildest gayest an lowest in halifax hoisted on the fores mast was the sign of a red cockerel a broad hint to the illiterate of the pleasures within kydds heart thudded but he was angry with dobbienot so much for trying such a scheme but for the slur on kydds character his anger focused whatever the outcome of the next few hours he would see to it that he left marks on dobbie they swung down a sidestreet to see a crowd of jostling men outside an entrance with a small mizzen mast sir gotta leave ye now poulden returned the way he came leaving kydd on his own his mouth dried screeches of female laughter and roars of appreciation at some unseen drunken feat filled the air as a young seaman hed been in places like this but he had forgotten how wild and lawless they were there he is told yer so heads turned and kydd was engulfed with a human tide that jollied him inside all red faces and happy anticipation a blackleather can was shoved at him its contents spilling down his front no thank ye he said quickly thrusting it away women on the stairs looked at him with frank curiosity some with quickening interest at his strong good looks a hardfeatured seaman and two others tried to push through gangway y scrovy bastards an let a man see who it is then he grumbled akins master o the ring i have t ask are ye lootenant kydd an no other the taphouse broke into excited expectancy at kydds reply he recognised both of the others dean boatswains mate of tenacious standing with brutal anticipation and laffin petty officer of the afterguard wearing a pitying expression there were others from tenacious their images barely registering on kydds preternaturally concentrated senses are ye willing t stand agin bill dobbie ltenant the fight t be fair n square accordin t the rules there was a breathy silence bareknuckle fighting was brutal and hard but there were rulesthe marquess of queensberry had brought some kind of order to the bloody business aye im willing the pothouse erupted fights on be gob an me bungs on dobbie this was going to be a legendary match to be talked of for years the crush was stifling but laffin cleared the way with his fists and they passed through the damp sawdust and sweaty shoving humanity to the sudden cool of the outside air it was a small inner courtyard with rickety weathered buildings on all four sides in the centre sitting on a standard seamans chest was dobbie kydd stopped as the significance of the chest crowded in on him this was not going to be a fight according to queensberrys rules this was a traditional way of the lower deck to settle the worst of grudgesacross a seachest they would sit facing each other over its length lashed in place to batter at each other until one yielded or dropped senseless to back away now was impossible he had to go through with it he took in dobbies deep chest and corded arms his fists were massive and strapped up with darkened wellused leather there was no doubt that kydd was in for heavy punishment the men and women in the courtyard were shouting obscene encouragement to dobbie urging him to take it out on an officer while he had the chance a hoot of laughter started up at the back of the crowd and kydds servant was propelled to the front tysoe sir sir he had a bundle clutched to his chest and his frightened eyes caught kydds i came sir ii came hes come t drag tom cutlass home after like chortled dean it was the first kydd had heard of any lowerdeck nicknamefrom the desperate time fighting in the boat when his sword had broken and he had taken up a familiar cutlass strangely it strengthened his resolve dont worry tysoe ill see ye right kydd said forcefully above the crowd the laughter died as the men sensed the time had come kydd looked directly at dobbie who returned the look with a glitteringeyed malignity get on wi it yer sluggards screamed one woman her cries taken up by the baying circle of men scowling akins turned to kydd get yr gear off then mate kydd pulled off his shirt feeling the icy cold wind playing on his bare torso there was a stir of amazed comment as the stretched and distorted scars crisscrossing his back were recognised for what they were a relic of the longago agony of lashes from a catofninetails at a grating the womans screeches diminished and the crowd subsided laffin produced cords and kydd took his place at the other end of the chest feeling the feral impact of dobbies presence his heart racing at the carnage about to be wrought the ropes cut into his legs but his eyes rose to lock on dobbies are ye ready gemmun akins had no watch no tools of a refereethis was going to be a smashing match a thin cold rain began chilling kydds skin and running into his eyes mixing with salt sweat stinging and distracting he raised his fists slowly his heart hammering dobbie responded holding his low for a first murderous punch his pale unblinking eyes locked on kydds akins raised his arm looking at each in turn his eyes flickered once and the arm sliced down fight he yelled and leaped aside for one split second dobbie held kydds eyes then cut loose with a bellow no he roared dropping his arms be buggered ill not do it the crowd fell into an astonished silence staring at dobbie he thrust his head forward his fists by his side take a swing matecome on make it a settler kydd shaken but suddenly understanding obliged with a meaty smack to the jaw which rocked dobbie laffin came forward with his knife and severed the ropes dobbie got to his feet he shook his head and turned to the rowdy crush shipmates y came t see a grudge fight an im sorry i cant give yez one see this ere is tom kydd as i remember frm the norei saw im stand alongside dick parker n them in the mutiny when others were runnin like rats but i thought as ow e got is pardon by sellin out his mates an i told him so mates if y wants a lesson in honour mr kydds yer man wont stand fer anyone takin im fer a villain without e stands up fer isself an thats why e sees me erea duel like an i ave ter say i didnt reckon ed ave the sand t see it through sling is mauley like a good un im bein an officer an all he turned back to kydd and touched his forehead id take it kindly in ye should y shake m hand sir a roar of wild applause burst out going on and on until dobbie held up his arms m ladsi want yer t unnerstand this ere kydd is one of us but es done good fer imself an thats no crime an i fr one is going ter foller lootenant kydd all bets r off gennelmen bawled akins the press of spectators broke into riotous commotion kydds comprehension of events rapidly disintegratedhe was being slapped on the back and idolised by dozens of drunken seamen an unwilling tysoe was plied with beer womens gleeful painted faces danced before him and dobbie now the centre of a throng of seamen was telling the story of the great mutiny of the nore admiral vandeput and his squadron returned three days later joining tenacious at her anchorage kydd was in the boat returning from the flagship and could see renzi waiting on the quarterdeck of tenacious and dared a brief wave it was good to see his friend and the clouds lifted from his spirit clutching the precious pouch of despatches and confidential signal information kydd hauled himself up the side and took renzis hand id thought to see you flaglieutenant b now he said flaglieutenant not if the present incumbent can help it renzi chuckled drily and while youve been in this arcadia resting ive been privy to secrets concerning the cod fishery that would stand you amazed dear fellow youll tell me of yr secrets this very afternoon you get yr gear inboard while i get these t captain houghton i have it from on high that the admral will want t have his squadron to sea fr exercises as soon as hes storedthats tmorrow ill wager if it were at all possible a light walk ashore among the spring blooms would be pleasant tom our admiral does not spare his minions you may believe the dartmouth side of the harbour was speckled with green shoots and the ground was firming they paced it out in the hesitant sunshine feeling the country awake out of its winter retreat a singular place newfoundland renzi said at length at times i believed that the island should be entirely covered by curing fish were it not that room has to be made for the vats of that monstrously malodorous fish oil your secrets kydd wanted to know nothing really its a turbulent place that requires the admiral to show firm on occasionthe fisher gentry from devon have it that newfoundland is their personal fief and deliver rough justice to those who say otherwise youd smile to hear the talk in an assembly at st johnsyoud swear it was exeter or bideford on market day they walked on companionably so all has been uneventful in the meantime renzi enquired kydd hesitated renzi was the soul of discretion but that was not the point at issuehis uncle had left the resolution of his problem to him alone should he involve his friend in a matter of family there was no question he had been on his own for too long nicholas the strangest thingi met m uncle fr the first time not long since his tone made renzi look at him sharply yesm fathers brother here in canada kydd went on to tell of his discovery and his quandaryand his decision neither to conform to the story of the bear nor to reveal his uncles current whereabouts to his family an admirable even logical decision tom and i honour you for it renzi said sincerely they strolled on in the quietness at the edge of the forest thats not all of the matter is it brother renzi said stopping and facing kydd directly id be honoured to share whatever it is that lays its hands on my friend kydd looked away staring at the jackpines carpeting the landscape all seeming the same but when looked at separately every one an individual uncountable thousands into the bluegrey distance nicholas it doesnt answer i have t face it im not t be one of yr deepdyed gentleman officers who knows their foxhunting an seasons i know seamanship an navigation not dancin and talking to ladies dear fellow this when i got my step t the quarterdeck it was hard t believe then it seemed to me that there was no end t itcaptain of my own ship even but i know better than that now the kings service needs ltenants for sure but only the gentlemen will find emselves promotedan im no gentleman an now i know it no gentleman what nonsense spare me yr comfortin words nicholas kydd said bitterly for my own good i have t hoist this aboard an stop pining fr what cant be and thats that but it only requires you learn the marks of civility the is that all it is to be a gentleman jus know all the tricks i dont think so kydd fell silent morosely kicking a pine cone do you despise gentlemen renzi asked quietly kydd flashed him a suspicious look not as who should say they were born to it thats their good luck and yours he added with a sardonic smile they walked on for a space then kydd stopped again t be honest it sticks in m gullet that im t leave promotion to others and im of a mind t do something about it what well in a merchant ship they have no care fr gentle waysa berth as mate in an indiaman would suit me right handsomely one voyage a year out east an my own freight leave the navy and why not kydd obstinately avoided renzis gaze as his friend stared at him in a brisk southeasterly early next morning the north american squadron put to sea for one weeks exercising in the waters between nova scotia and the united states the gun hms resolution as flagship in the van the seven ships a picture of grace and might in tenacious at the rear the picture was more apparent than real the file of ships that stretched ahead to the flagship in perfect line also obscured her signals and the little fleet could not stretch to the luxury of a repeating frigate despairing kydd hung out from the rigging to weather trying to steady his big telescope against the thrumming in the shrouds and bracing himself to catch the meaning of resolutions signal flags endon they were clawing their way out closehauled if they were to end on an easterly course passing south of the thrumcap they would have to pass through the winds eye it was the admirals choice to tack about or wear round and with the neverfail shoal waiting ahead and the same unforgiving rocks under their lee that had claimed tribune so recently tack or wearput the helm down or upit all depended on the signal that would be thrown out to the fleet in the next few minutes captain houghton stumped up and down the quarterdeck nervous midshipmen scuttling along behind him the master keeping a respectful distance to his lee it was impossible to send the men to their stations until it was known the action to be taken and they stood about the decks in uneasy groups devils island the most seaward part of halifax lay abeam now there was no reason why they could not bear upand then there was a tiny flutter of bunting on resolutions poop kydd concentrated with his glass a quick refresh from his pocket book had shown him that there was only one flag in the two hoists that differentiated tack and weara yellow diagonal on a blue backgroundand this was number three tack if he just glimpsed that flag he could ignore the rest and they would gain a vital edge houghton stopped pacing and faced kydd around the ship men followed suit every face turning towards him there a cluster of flags mounted swiftly in resolutions rigging their fluttering edges making the hoist nearly impossible to readbut kydds straining eyes had spotted the distinctive number three as the flagships signal crew bent it on as part of the hoist before the flags had reached the peak he roared triumphantly its tack men raced to their stations running gear was thumped on the deck and faked for running afteryards manned by the starboard watch and headyards the larboard double manning for the greatest speed the signal jerked down aboard the flagship execute the wheel spun as the quartermaster at the wheel and his mate threw themselves at the task and tenaciouss bluff bow began to move at the waist ropes ends were out as the petty officers ensured the foresheet was let go smartly and the lee brace checked away in growing excitement kydd saw that of the file of ships only tenacious herself at the rear and the flagship at the head had begun a swing round into the wind his pride swelled at the evidence of his enterprisethey were well into their tacking about while in front andromeda was still in line ahead helms alee big driving sails began shaking the yards bracing round while the foreyards took the wind aback to lever her round mainsail haul the ship passed slowly through the eye of the wind and all hands heaved and hauled with all their might to make the sails belly out comfortably on to the new tack it was neatly done sir it was rawson tugging on his sleeve urgently kydd turned irritably the midshipman pointed mutely at the line of ships resolution had tacked about as fast as they but all the rest were still thrashing along on the old tack not one even attempting to go about a feeling of growing apprehension crept over kydd something was wrong resolution was now in plain view to weather her entire beam to tenacious instead of her sternand as they watched a flutter of bunting mounted at her main the original signal but ominously there for the whole fleet to see was tenaciouss pennant climbing brazenly aloft a gun thudded out peremptorily for attention what in the name of god houghton roared at kydd the admiral was telling the world that hms tenacious had blundered and should conform to his signal its tack but in succession sir rawson whispered urgently pointing to an entry in the signal book it was the order to tack sure enough but the maddening additional flag at the end indicated that instead of turning into line like a file of soldiers the admiral wanted the column of ships to reach a fixed point then wheel round to follow him thereby preserving their line ahead formation sir the signal is tack in succession iim sorry sir kydds voice seemed thin and weak houghtons chest swelled and his face reddened but before the explosion another gun sounded impatiently from the flagship there was nothing for it but public ignominy haaands to stations for staying tenacious must obey the last order and come back to her original tack her ships company feeling the shame and the entire fleets eyes on them took up their ropes again while kydd stood mortified face burning tenacious came ponderously about and tried to assume her old place at the end of the linebut by now the line itself was all but gone preceding ships now having reached the fixed point and tacked round on to the new course cursing weary men picked up their ropes and prepared to haul round for the third time in a row but when the due point was reached tenacious had not picked up enough speed and when the helm went down she headed up languidly into the windand stayed there held in the winds eye in irons the master lunged over and took the helm bawling at the men forward as the ship drifted astern the hapless officerofthewatch nervously clutching his telescope and watching the captain appalled kydd with nothing to do could only stand and suffer as the ship tried to regain her dignity finally in her place at the rear of the line stretching away to the east tenacious settled down and kydd turned to his captain prepared for the worstbut yet another signal streamed out from resolution fleet will heave to kydd reported carefully main topsails were backed and way fell off there had to be a reason why the whole squadron was coming to a stop flagship sirour pennant and er send a lieutenant the admiral wanted an official explanation from tenacious for the recent displayand there would be no bets taken on who would go as the sacrifice admiral vandeput did not spare his squadron between cape sable and cape cod seven ships sailed resolutely in formation assuming tactical divisions by signal running down invisible foes shortening sail for battle curious fishingboats were diverted by strings of flags run up the flagships rigging followed by instant animation aboard every vessel of the squadronand the occasional gun for attention kydd doggedly improved his acquaintance with the fighting instructions and attached signals and when the squadron was ready to return to port several days later he was fully prepared sir vessels in the squadron to retire in order of sailing it was the return to halifax signal to wear sir kydd added as the flags broke at the masthead this would see the ships turning on their heel and facing where they had beenbut this time with tenacious leading the squadron back to port now was the time to show her breeding in the manoeuvre of going about completely stern to wind brace in the afteryards up helm the mizzen topsail began shaking the main just full and the fore up sharp tenacious started her swing the line of ships ahead commenced their wheel about lay yr headyards square shift headsheets her rotation brought the wind right aft and the weather sheets were eased to become the lee brace up headyardshaul aboard men laboured to get the tack hard in forward and the sheets aft as she came on to her new heading tenacious responded with a willing surge draw jib it was the last order before she settled on her new course the sheets hauled aft to bring the headsails to a full tautness the focslemen responded heartily the thought of safe haven in halifax just hours away lending weight to their hauling a crack as loud as a threepounder gun came from far forward the crew on the jibsheets fell to the deck others crouched down and looked about fearfully it was impossible to see what was happening from aft as the clews of the big courses effectively shut out the scene cant old er sir bawled the helmsman as tenacious immediately fell off the wind and inevitably out of line an incomprehensible hail came from forward amplified by a breathless messenger lost our jibboom sir he yelled his voice cracking houghton lifted his speaking trumpet douse the fore tgallant instantly dye hear he wheeled round his face set a volley of orders brought sail in and way off the vessel you know what to do get forrard and bear a handnow he snapped at kydd rawson could be relied on to hoist the necessary notundercommand general signal that indicated tenacious was no longer in a position to obey her captain kydd hurried forward this was renzis partofship kydd would take orders from him without question he arrived at the scene to see a tangle of rigging from aloftand a truncated bowsprit a thumping from the lee bow and men staring down showed where the failed spar was now poulden do you clap on the tgallant bowline as well it was strange to hear the crack of authority in renzis voice to see the gleam of hard purpose in his friends eyes sir kydd reported to the fourth lieutenant renzi flashed a brief smile martingale stay parted the jibboom carried away he said flicking his eyes up to watch the progress of the jib downhaul which was clearly being readied to hoist the spar back aboard im sanguine well have it clear soonits to looard and ive taken the liberty to set the foretopmast staysl to make a lee while we see to the jib the boatswain quickly had the experienced focslemen at work reeving a heel rope the fifty feet of danzig fir surging below was a formidable spar to recover aboard renzi gazed intently at the descending downhaul mr kydd id be obliged if youd inform the captain of our situation that ive furled the fore tgallant but desire the fore tgallant mast be struck kydd touched his hat then hastened back to the quarterdeck houghton listened sourly his eyes straying to the line of ships passing by beginning the evolution to heave to request flag to pass within hail he said the signals soared up rapidly but even as they did resolution had put down her helm and closed briefly houghton passed details by speaking trumpet to the admiral there was little to discuss lynx a gun shipsloop was detached to stand by them while they repaired the remainder sailed on to halifax it was not an easy repair even with a spare spar fortunately to hand the stump of the jibboom had to be extracted from the bowsprit cap and seahardened heel ropes cut away it was sheer bad luck that the beeblock seating the new jibboom to the bowsprit needed reshaping and now with jibstay and fittings to apply there was no chance they would complete by dusk the hours passed uncomfortably without steadying sail on the open sea tenacious wallowed glumly all night cape cod forty miles under her lee kydd had the morning watch redeyed and tired he observed a grey dawn approach with lynx far out to the southward but stoutly clapping on all sail thick mist patches persisted to the north in the calm seas wisps reaching out occasionally to tenacious with their clammy embrace as soon as there was light enough work began on the jibboom and well before the wan sun had cleared the foreyard it was all but complete what in hells name houghton said stopping his restless pacing it was gunfireto the north and not too distant a distinct thud at least twentyfours maybe thirtytwos growled bryant puzzled another flurry of thumps in the mist were heard houghton looked nonplussed this can only be the squadrontheres not another sailotheline at sea unless he paused then looked significantly at bryant send lynx to investigate with all despatch it was a disturbing mystery guns of such weight of metal were only carried by lineofbattle ships lynx disappeared into the light mist while tenacious had her topsails set and drawing within minutes of her headsails being once more complete as she began to gather way her mainsail was loosed and she picked up speed the royals of a ship showed above the mist and lynx burst into view a signal at her main enemy in sight shouted kydd from the poop but the signal had been recognised at once clear for action for the first time on the american side of the atlantic tenacious made ready for battle the mist cleared slightlygiving a tantalising view of two dark shapes before it closed round them once more the urgent rhythm of hearts of oak ceased as bryant reported the ship cleared fore and aft it was replaced by a long solemn drumroll quarters kydds sword banged against his legs as he raced up the poopdeck ladderif this were a rogue enemy and frigate escort they were in dire trouble make to lynx take position one mile to windward if you please said houghton small fry had no business in the line when big ships met in combat tenacious glided into the trailing mist the wind now only a dying breeze the masthead lookout hailed the deck deck hoooo two ships two points t larboard near ter five mile off at houghtons command kydd exchanged the heavy signal telescope for the more handy glass of the officerofthewatch and swung up into the shrouds he was clear of the mist by the maintop there was no need to go furtherand over there to larboard protruding through the rumpled white upper surface of the fog were the upper masts and tops of two vesselsship rigged as the lookout had said kydd held the telescope against an upper shroud and gazed intently both were under sail but were hove to at an angle to each other he steadied the glass and found the tricolour of france hanging limply on one he couldnt tell for the other certainly they were not shipsoftheline he swept once around the horizon noting that the mist was clearing to patches around the enemy and bawled down his report then clambered back to the deck what the devil you saw no other vessels at all houghton barked they had unmistakably heard the gunfire of a ship of force sir is it the master began then the obscuring mist lifted and some four miles away almost dead to leeward they saw the enemy damn my eyes if that aint a frigate bryant said in wonder an that looks like one o our merchant ships sir interposed hambly lay us to windd of the frigate mr hambly said houghton shortly well look for that damned shipotheline later adams came up to stand beside kydd can you just conceive he said with a boyish grin what discussions must be afoot on her quarterdeck just about to take a fat prize and a shipotheline no less sails out of the fog houghton said over his shoulder mr kydd recall lynx to take station astern aboard the frenchman there would be something approaching panic an additional ship in the equation however small meant double the worry for the unknown commander of the frigate now making hasty sail stunsls sir the southeasterly breeze was playful and light and they were bearing down slowly no mr hambly well wait and see what hes going to try first if the frigate bore away downwind there would be every reason for stunsls but if she moved off on the wind tenacious could not follow until the awkward sails and their booms had been taken in with the rapt attention of the entire quarterdeck the frenchmans length foreshortened as her yards came round shes running large said bryant it would be strange indeed if a frigate did not have the legs over a cumbersome shipoftheline in a stern chase and in a matter of hours she would be clean away the merchant ship a large vessel with clean lines ran up her colours as they approached american bryant took off his hat and scratched his head glancing up at their own ensign as if for reassurance cousin jonathan is a neutralwhat is the frenchy up to adams murmured as they passed the cheering merchant ship under full sail if y please sir began the master mr hambly if im not wrong sir thats not a national shipshes a heavy privateer slight in the build maybe oversparred an the size of her crew i think hes right sir agreed bryant borrowing a telescope the sea ahead was now free of mist and the chase no more than a mile ahead loosed all plain sailbut no stunsl houghton pursed his lips to stand any chance of staying with the chase he must soon spread stunsls abroada canny captain of the frigate would wait for the manoeuvre to complete then put his own wheel over and go closehauled knowing that it would take some time for his pursuer to strike his stunsls and follow but on the other hand if they did nothing the chase would draw ahead and disappear mr hambly be so good as to see how the chase goes the sailing master found his sextant and measured the angle from masthead to waterline of their prey a few minutes later he repeated the action were dropping astern by as much as two knots i fear sir not worth our trouble adams said gloomily to kydd we spread more sail so does shean ive yet to find any twodecker can stay with a frigate shell be hull down by sunset the frenchman was now visibly drawing away disdaining even to set her own stunsls houghton took a telescope and trained it for a long time on the chase suddenly he snapped shut the glass pass the word to mr bampton and mr renziwe will yaw and on command they will pepper the rogue with a full broadside the midshipman messenger touched his hat expressionless even he knew that this was a last gesture after which the frenchman could sail away over the horizon in peace houghtons action would hopelessly slow their advance in the light winds the lad ran off smartly and from the rumbling kydd could picture the long twentyfours being run out handspikes plied to make them bear as far forward as they couldand the talk around the guns as men peered out of open gunports to catch a sight of their target houghton paced impatiently waiting for the youngster to report back his gaze fixed on the ship ahead reported ready it needed only the captains order to complete their final aggressive act houghton gave a brief smile to the group on the quarterdeck and said quietly to hambly larboard if you please tenacious sheered off slowly giving the guncaptains time to lay their weapons so when the order to open fire was given the guns crashed out almost together smoke rolled down lazily on their target and seconds later the sudden eruption of a forest of white splashes along the line of sight brought warlike roars from the gundecks the wheel spun and sluggishly tenacious traced her bowsprit back on target and past she steadied for a moment and her opposite broadside thundered out across the calm seas again the gunsmoke the close scatter of splashesthen the enemys mizzen topmast fell in a graceful curve please god breathed adams it was by no means a decisive hit but the complete absence of square sail on the mizzen might be enough to hamper the vessel allowing them to close and engage activity died down as every man stared forward willing the chase to falter but it was not to be sacrificing his wounded topmast trailing in the water alongside the french ship ruthlessly cut it loose and continued on as before o course she wont grieve over the topmast kydd said glumly going large she cn balance by tricing up the clew o the mainsl one side she knows all she has t do is carry on and shell lose us that may be so adams said but what happens when she wants to go by the wind closehauled shed be a cripple and why would she do that bamptons acid comment from behind was nearly lost in a general growl of dismay at the sudden crump of gunfire and smoke issuing out from their quarry she has sternchasers adams remarked soberly these guns which could fire straight aft into a pursuer when there was no opportunity to return fire would be a sore trial at the next salvo kydd heard the crack of the guns and moments later felt the slam of the passage of one ball over their heads several officers ducked automatically then rose shamefacedly marines go below stand the men down into the waist mr bryant houghton ordered although these were only light sixpounders banging away a hit would kill they kept up the chase for another twenty minutes falling astern the whole while until the first lieutenant approached the captain theres no profit in this sirwe shall have to give him best i fear houghton glared at him damned if i will observehe cannot run to leeward for ever on this course he stands to meet the nantucket shoals off cape cod before long he must choose then between hauling his wind and going east about the cape to slip into the gulf o maine or an easier passage west but directly into united states waters i want to box him into the coast therefore i shall desire lynx to lie to his starbd and persuade him that this is his better course the little sloop would thus stand between the enemy and a refuge in the wider reaches of the gulf of mainebut it would be a foolhardy move for the french captain to take on the little ship knowing that just one lucky hit from any of the sloops sixteen sixpounders could deliver her straight into the clutches of the waiting bigger ship aye sir houghton smiled for the first time and when he has to bear away hes under our lee and then well have him in the early afternoon the enemy was far ahead but with lynx faithfully to her starboard the master was satisfied that they were irrevocably within the hook of the shoals cutting off her escape to the east tides o five knots or more around em steep too so sounding wont answer and if fog comes its all up with the ship he added with feeling the wind dropped further until it was a ghosting calm favouring the smaller vessel which glided a little further and out of range before ceasing movement the three ships lay becalmed in the grey dusk kydd came on watch the position of the chase the same in the night hours there was a choice for their quarryto attempt a repair by the light of bunched lanthorns or not show any betraying light and hope to steal away in the night she chose the latter were it not for the quickwitted commander of lynx she might have succeeded as darkness closed in the little sloop rigged a makeshift beacon for tenacious of a cluster of lanthorns in a box beaming their light secretly in one direction only through the night lynx stayed faithfully with the enemy her beacon trained tenacious lay back in the blackness when the wind came up some time after midnight and the privateer captain made his move houghton knew all about it coming round to the west the frenchman clearly wanted to put distance between him and his tormentor before he struck for the open sea but dawns grey light showed her the flat nondescript coast of an outlying island of new england to the northeast and two menowar of the royal navy to seaward houghton was on deck to greet the dawn sniffing the winds direction we have him he said with relish he cant show much sail forrard with this wind abeam and no square sail aft we can try for a conclusion before noon i believe he looked at the group on the quarterdeck with satisfaction it will be a good days work for all today tenacious bore down guns run out with land to leeward and two english ships to weather the frenchmans only course was west the wind veering more southerly to maintain a reasonable westerly course it was necessary to balance fore and aft sail with no mizzen topsail the logical thing was to reduce sail forward to compensate and accept a loss of speed however from her crojack yard canvas appeared it was not a sailbearing spar but the french had lashed a sail along its length loosed it and secured its clews they had a drawing square sail aft kydd shook his head in admiration admittedly the sail blanketed the poop silencing the chase guns but she could keep ahead of her pursuers im not concerned said houghton in tones that suggested he was theres long island sound aheadhe has to go about or hell be trapped so its there well have lynx waiting kydds first sight of the united states therefore was the nondescript sandy scrubland of block island ahead then the low forested new england coast to the north sir i must point out that these are american waters there was no response to adamss concern houghton keeping his gaze on the fleeing ship ahead theyre well known to be jealous of their sovereignty sir i know that damn your blood houghton said but the frenchman showed no signs whatsoever of putting down her helm and proceeded to pass block island entering the closed length of long island sound theyre mad theyve no way outwhat do they mr hambly quickly whats the distance across the widest entrance to the sound er to norardthats betwixt matunuck and sandy point on th islandand its seven miles we can do it north about it is mr hambly have a care you stay exactly midchannelthe americans claim one league from the lowwater mark which by my reckoning leaves just a mile breadth for our peaceful passage aye aye sir said hambly eyeing the frenchman who seemed to have no notion of such niceties leaving block island to larboard tenacious entered the capacious arm of the sea there could be no escape nowwith both english ships to windward and able to close with the frenchman if he turned back it was only a matter of waiting hes wasting time snorted houghton impatient sir recollect the french have been friends to the americans since their support for them in the late war renzi had come up from the gundeck in curiosity bryant sneered pah nonsense theyve seen how the french conduct revolutions and want no part of such roguery then what is the meaning of his motions now renzi answered quietly the privateer had run up a huge tricolour which streamed out to leeward and barely two miles ahead and boldly put up his helm to pass through the milewide entrance to an inner expanse of water one league sir yes yes i had not forgotten houghton bit his lip as he eyed the scene take a cast of the lead i believe we will anchor one league off shore precisely after one last look at the french privateer just six miles away and with calm impunity preparing to berth in a tiny port kydd joined the others in the captains cabin houghton was irascible ideas cut em out bryants growl was instant and be damned to any consequences theres nought hereabouts but fisherfolk an farmersand the americans have no navy at all that ive heard about true said houghton thoughtfully but ill remind you that in law this must be construed as a combatant seeking refuge in a neutral port and it would go ill with any who can be shown to violate it and whos to know cloth over our name on the stern boats crews at night and you cant make em out i honour the ardency of your spirit mr bryant but i fear this would provoke extremely swimmers under cover o dark they go in with borers sink the bugger where he lies mr bryant i will not suffer such language and besides theyll never pierce a coppersheathed hull without fuss and noise the cabin fell quiet until renzi spoke under the assumption that the sympathies of the americans must lie with the french i rather feel they would not be overnice in the laws applicable in cases of neutrality we may find ourselves lying at anchor waiting for some considerable time therefore it would seem logical to sail awaywith deep regrets of course bryant snorted but could find no riposte and while we dally the admiral is deprived of a major unit of his fleet which is nominally under his orders houghton grunted possibly but considerthis privateer is big should we leave her to her foul plundering she can take her pick of the largest prizes we would certainly be held to account if we did not a thing but if you are unable to effect a solution by reasons of force majeure your course is chosen for you we must give up there was a lengthy pause then the captain said we have stores only for days an extended voyage was not contemplated i have no choice bryant let out his breath like a punctured balloon to sail yes the captains voice was final but then he added there is however one small chance sir i will send an officer ashore to parley with the americans they cant object to that try to get em to see where their interests best lie bit of law that sort of thing its possible then that theyll throw the frenchy out to where well be waiting for him a long shot if i may say so sir pringles languid voice came from the rear of the group of disconsolate officers did you have anyone in mind that is a matter that exercises me if i send my first lieutenant there will undoubtedly be a confrontation which is devoutly to be avoided bryants splutter was ignored any officer of eminence will confer too much consequence on the affair with the local authorities whoever they may be in these backwoods i rather feel that the name of lieutenant kydd suggests itself chapter mr president the minister plenipotentiary of great britain sir the president of the united states the aide ushered liston into the broad room then departed robert so kind in you said john adams he was standing by the tall marble mantelpiece and advanced with outstretched hand sit down man thank you mr president liston took an armchair before the fire with a gracious inclination of his head may i know if abigail is happy in trenton its a wise precaution to depart philadelphia before the sick season she is indeed god bless her said adams in the absence of any others at this meeting he poured the sherry himself your health robert liston waited watching the president over the rim of his glass adams a short chubby man who looked like a country squire was not to be underestimated the two of them had seen much together of this new countrys spirited political struggles and personally he wished it well but this was not a social call he had come in response to a diplomatic summons adams set down his glass and steepled his fingers this cannot be allowed to continue this stopping and searching on the high seas congress and the people will not tolerate it your navy provokes by its highhanded actions whatever its rights in the matter impressing men from the very decks of united states merchant vesselsits insufferable you must understand and now the british courts in the caribbean are condemning united states merchant ships seized by the royal navy as prizes liston murmured an acknowledgement it was an old problem and there were wellrehearsed rejoinders but he chose another tack mr president this i can appreciate is your immediate concernbut you will understand that here we have a clash of belief and therefore law you will have your countrys position set in lawbut we sir have had ours since the rule of war and it is accepted by the world why then should we change it so adams picked up his glass and smiled that is well known robert because it favours the crown so disproportionate and the french continued liston evenly with their demands of equipage and new decrees we will firmly abide by our treaty obligations of sir the point i wish to make is that unless these three systems of law are brought to an expression of harmony your countrys trade is in continued jeopardy it would seem therefore but natural that if only to restore a balance in world affairs a measure of amity be enacted between our two nations prohibiting these excesseshere i do not exclude the possibility of an alliance against france i think not the country would never countenance it sir consider the french have been all but swept from the seas what more practical way to safeguard your ships than have them watched over by the most powerful nation at sea under flags in amity minister we shall look after our own we have no need of a foreign powers intervention without a navy said liston gently sir this discussion is concluded the president stood up have you any other matter you wish to lay before me thank you mr president while we are in an understanding may i be so bold as to refer you to the intolerable actions of french agents in arming bands of indians on the canadian border that night the minister made his excuses to his wife and retired to the little room where he was accustomed to gathering his thoughts and rendering them lucidly for his master another hand would cipher the despatches he tested the nib of his quill his mind ordering events into neat aggregations then analysis to their natural heads it was the least that was expected by lord grenville king georges noble and demanding minister for foreign affairs liston considered carefully he had been ambassador to the united states for britain in all but name during many of those turbulent years following the revolution and had acquired a respect for the colonials that bordered on liking they had followed up their revolution with a constructive wellconsidered constitution which had humanity at its core the french even with the american example had resorted to blood and chaos in an ageold lust for world domination there would be no elaborate salutations lord grenville wanted meat in his despatches personal observations and opinions unfettered by the delicacies of diplomatic language the first subject the likelihood of intervention by america in the titanic world struggle that was reaching its peak in europe there was not a single nation of significance save england that still stood against france america remained outside the fight and as a neutral she could afford to she was profiting immensely by trading across the interests of the belligerentsthere would be little to gain in taking sides yet the french were growing confident arrogant even in their dealings new decrees had been issued by a victorious directory in paris that required all merchant ships to carry papers covering their cargo signed by a french consul if they were to escape being taken as a prize of war there was even talk of an outofhand condemnation if british goods of any kind were found aboard if the french had the means to enforce this at sea it would have a devastating impact on the americans without a navy they would have no choice but to bow to french demands in the end though paris would find it never paid to bully the united states but would the americans see this as cause for war some were still sentimentally attached to the british and others saw french power as a threat that needed balancing but there were those who remembered france as an ally closely involved in the birth of their nation and would never sanction an aggressive act against her liston sighed in the end as always it came back to politics and personalities in this most democratic of nations he respected the bluff president standing foursquare for his country plainspoken and direct even with his resolute opposition to british influences but making no secret of his loathing of the french regime but he was increasingly isolated his party the federalists were the patricians old landowners staunchly in favour of central governmentand generally took the british view his opponents were the republicans under thomas jefferson who had no love for england and were mainly new money naturalised immigrants and strongly profrench the two parties were locked in bitter political strife which liston could perceive adams was badly placed to handle in this odd system his own vice president jefferson was leader of the opposing party and privy to who knew what murky political secrets and he was gravely handicapped by the extremist hamilton at his elbow splitting his party and draining confidence from his administration it was a fevered time mobs were marching at night shattering windows newspapers were full of wild rumour and acid attack he wondered briefly what adams would say if he told him that such was his concern the great george washington himself was in secret communication with london from pennsylvania a deputation had even demanded clarity on the matter of mr adams son of the president who was said to be betrothed to a daughter of the king of great britain and thereby for the same general washington to hold the united states in trust for the king there was an even chance of an alliancebut as the french depredations increased so must the americans grudging tolerance of british measures at sea if the royal navy could be induced to grasp the delicacy of their position there was a chance with a large white flag streaming from a halliard tenaciouss pinnace sailed towards the shore lieutenant kydd in the sternsheets midshipman rawson at the tiller it was unfair kydd knew next to nothing about the united states and even less about the international law with which he had been told to threaten the local authorities if they did not drive the french back to sea he was dressed in civilian clothes and unarmed in accordance with convention when visiting a neutral country in fact he had been obliged to don his best rig the dark green waistcoat and rustcoloured coat that cecilia had taken such pains to find in guildford he held his light grey hat with its silver buckle safely on his knees as the low wooded coast drew closer kydd saw the masts and yards of the french privateer beyond the point it was clear that she was securing from sea further in he made out a timber landing area and around it a scatter of people the spritsail was brailed up and lowered the oars shipped head fr the jetty he growled only one of the figures seemed to wear any semblance of a uniform but a number carried what appeared to be muskets kydd braced himself he was going as a representative of his country and he would not be found wanting in the article of military bearing a couple of hundred yards from shore rawson put the tiller over to make the final run in suddenly there was the unmistakable report of a flintlock and a gout of water kicked up sharply dead in line with the bow wha god rot em theyre firing on a white flag kydd spluttered keep yr course damn you he flung at the midshipman the people ashore gesticulated and shouted one levelled his gun in kydds direction ssir should we hissed rawson take charge o yr boats crew kydd replied savagely ashore the weapon still tracked kydd and then it spoke the bullet spouted water by the stroke oar followed by a wooden thump as it struck the boat below where kydd sat sir keep on damn yr blood snapped kydd even these ignorant backwoodsmen would know theyd be in deep trouble with their government if they caused loss of life by firing on a flag of truce more long guns came on target there was a flurry of shouting then the weapons were lowered slowly grimfaced kydd saw the waiting figures resolve to individuals garn back y english pigs yelled one brandishing a rifle others took up the cry kydd told rawson to hold steady and lay alongside the shouting died down but a dozen or more people crowded on to the jetty oarstoss oars kydd told the midshipman the crowd grew more menacing one man threatening them with a pitchfork the boat drifted to a stop bowman take a turn o the painter kydd ordered the boat nudged the timbers of the landingstage hostile figures shuffled to the edge kydd stood up in the boat i ask ye to let me landif y please nobody moved then am i t take it youre going to prevent by force the landing on the soil of the united states of america of a citizen of a nation er that youre not at war with it sounded legal all but the last bit we don want yore kind here git back to yer ship or ill give yez a charge o lead up yer backside as will serve as yr keepsake of ameriky get his rope jeb well give em a ducking hands grabbed at the painter rocking the boat hold the crowd fell back to where a welldressed man waited on horseback he dismounted and walked to the jetty edge malice hung about him can you not see youre unwelcome sir he called evenly to kydd am i so fearsome the whole town turns out t oppose me youre an englishmanthats enough for these good folk and navy too theres many here who have suffered their ships taken as prize youngsters snatched away by the press they have reasons aplenty sir there were cries of agreement therefore id advise you to return whence you came he folded his arms kydd lowered his head as though in resignation but his eyes were busy measuring gauging he placed a foot on the gunwale leaped across the gap of water heaved himself over the edge of the jetty and ended up next to the man i thank ye for your advice sir but as you can see here i am landed he dusted himself off ltenant kydd at your service sir the mans reply was cold schroeder christopher he did not hold out his hand kydd bowed and looked around at the crowd i thank ye most kindly for my welcome and hope m stay will be as pleasant when it was clear there would be no interchange he leaned over and ordered his crew to throw him up his single piece of baggage proceed in accordance with yr previous orders mr rawson he added and the boat stroked away to sea he was now in the united states and very much alone kydd set off down the path into the village which he knew by the chart was the tiny seaport of exbury in the state of connecticut it was a pretty township barely more than a village with square nononsense wooden houses and neatly trimmed gardensand to kydds english eyes unnaturally straight roads with their raised wooden sidewalks it also had a distinct sea flavour the resinous smell of a sparmaker the muffled clang of a shipsmithy and what looked like a wellstocked chandlery further down the street women carrying baskets stopped to stare at him the men muttered together in sullen groups can you let me know where i cn get lodgings he asked one who turned his back when he located the general store to ask its keeper snapped wem closed and slammed the door kydd sat down heavily on a bench beneath a maple tree it was a near to hopeless mission but he was not about to give up he had no idea what had turned the town against him but he needed lodgings a gang of rowdy youngsters started chanting and there theyd fife away like fun and play on cornstalk fiddles and some had ribbons red as blood all bound around their middles ohyankee doodle keep it up yankee doodle dandy kydd missed the significance of the revolutionary song and nettled by his politeness the youths threw stones at him kydd shied one back which brought out a woman in pinafore and bonnet she glared at him but shooed away the urchins he picked up his bag and set off towards the other end of town as he passed the houses each with their doors and windows all closed a man stepped out on to his porch stranger he called sternly kydd stopped aye youre the englishman i am sirlieutenant thomas kydd of his majestys ship tenacious the man was thin and rangy in working clothes but had dignity in his bearing jacob hay sir kydd shook his hand it was workhardened and calloused your presence here aint welcome lootenant but i will not see a stranger used so if its quarters yere after im offerin why thank you mr hay said kydd aware of several people muttering behind him hay glanced at them then led the way into his house set there mr kydd while we makes up a room for ye kydd lowered himself into a rockingchair by the fire judith find something for mr kydd he called through the doorway a young woman entered with a jug and a china pot she did not lift her eyes and left quickly to kydd hay said theres no strong drink enters this house but youll find th local cider acceptable kydd expressed his appreciation and proffering some coins added apologetically i have t tell you now sir i dont have any american money for my room put it away sir that wont be necessary hay pursed his lips and said i dont mean t be nosy but can i ask what business is it y have in exbury somethin to do with the frenchy i guess ihave to er enquire of the authorities what they mean t do in the matter kydd said cautiously to do nothin i guess frenchy is here t fit a noo mizzen and be on her way and thats allwe let him be its the law mr hay law no law says we has to send him out fer you to take in that twodecker o yourn he said coldly i have t hear the authorities first y understands kydd said who would that be do ye think hays coolness remained at length he said thatll be mr dwight or mr chadwick selectmen fer exbury seeing the blank look on kydds face he added magistrates like call th meetings run th constables id like to call on em if y please kydd said politely time fer that after supper the aroma of freshbaked bread filled the air hay sniffed appreciatively an if im not wrong were havin steamed clams and may the lord make us truly thankful amen while mrs hay set about the dishes kydd tried to make conversation m first time in the united states i have t say its a goodlookin country hay regarded him without comment kydd smiled across at judith who hastily dropped her eyes he turned once more to hay id be obliged if ye could find your way clear t tellin me why im not welcome mr hay hays face hardened thats easy enough we live frm the sea by fishing n trade were a small town as ye can see and when a ship is built an vittled for tradin theres a piece of everyone in her when she puts t sea life aint easy an when a family puts in their savins its cruel hard t see that ship taken fr prize by a kings ship an carried into a canadian port t be condemned but this is because youve been caught trading with the frenchthe enemy whose enemy hay snorted none of our business this war and if the french beat us then you dont think theyre going to come and claim back their american empire they have most o the rest of the world hay grunted eat yr clams mr kydd the atmosphere thawed as the meal progressed eventually after apple pie and cheddar hay sat back if youre goin t see a magistrate make it dwight he wouldnt be drawn any further and kydd set off alone at the substantial gambrelroofed house which hay had previously pointed out he was greeted by a short tubby man wearing a napkin tucked round his neck er i need t see mr dwight himself the man said in a peculiar rapid delivery i guess youre the english officer am i right aye lieutenant kydd sir pardon me if i seem unfamiliar with yr ways but i need t find the authority here in exbury the public leader as it were in your town dwight raised his eyebrows but motioned kydd inside and closed the door ill shake hands with you in private if you dont mind ltenant now sit ye down and heres a little rye whiskey for your chilblains kydd accepted it sir if youre lookin for our leader i guess im your man selectman o exbury its about as high as it goes short o the governor in hartford now how can i help you sir i come on a mission o some delicacy no doubt youre aware that a french privateer lies in your port i am which we surprised in the fog in th process of takin a merchant ship of the united states goin about its lawful business dont surprise me to hear it sir oh said kydd prepared only for disbelief and scorn sir let me make my position clear im known as a plainspeakin man and ill tell it straight im a federalist same as the president same as general washington himself i wont try your patience in explaining our politics just be assured we stand for the old ways and decent conduct and we dont hold with this damn french arrogance and ambition were opposed by a bunch o rascals who think t sympathise with them on account of their help in the late warsaving yr presence sir kydd began to speak but was interrupted i said ill speak plain and i will weve been taking insults to our flag and loss to our trade and well not have it theres going t be an accounting and that soon but sir ill have you understand because we take the same view this does not mean were friends kydd gathered his thoughts and began again what we seek sir is an indication how you mean to act as smoothly as he could he continued you have here a belligerent vessel seeking a neutral haven fr repairs according to international law he must sail within two days do ye mean to enforce the law dwight sighed philadelphia is a long ways offthe law is as may be here its what the citizens say that counts does this mean if i tried t arrest the frenchman with my two constables id start a riotand be thrown out of office this town has just lost a ship t the british and two lads to your pressgang and id run smack dab against kit schroeder i believe ive met the gentleman kydd murmured owns three ships and the store knows how t lift a cargo with all the right papers to see it past the british an then on to a french port theres most folks here do business with him and dont want to see him interfered with y see so youre saying that theres nothing you cn do you mean th frenchy to lie alongside as long as he wants for the sake of local politics the privateer was to be left untouched tenacious would be forced to sail in a few days releasing the vessel to continue her career of destruction resentment boiled up in kydd dwight held up a pacifying hand now i didnt say there was nothing i could do im a selectman an you have come to me with a case ill be letting the governor in hartford knowbut thatll take some time with the roads as they is however im empowered to and i will issue a warrant for a town meeting to consider um whether the committee of public safety should take action to prevent there being a hostile action on our soil requiring the frenchman t take himself elsewhere say no promises mr kydd but youll get to say your piece and he broke off and cocked his head indistinct shouts sounded in the night rhythmic thuds like a drum dwight crossed to the window and pulled the shutter ajar trouble he said in a low voice republicans dont like you being here i guess kydd peered out flickering torches were being borne along towards them and in their light he saw marching figures gesticulating shouting had em here before the wicked dogs here lend me a hand sir they moved over to each window and secured the folding shutters the smell of guttering candles in the gloom of the closed room now oppressive a maid came from the rear hands to her mouth well be quite safe mary dwight said and pulled open a drawer kydd caught the glint of a pistol theyre only here cos theyve had a skinful of schroeders liquortheyll be away after theyve had their fun he eased open the shutter a crack see that theyre wearing a tricolour cockade in their hats republicans do that so theres no mistake who it is they support the noise grew close a drum thudded in an uneven rhythm while harsh shouts and laughter came clearly through the closed shutters suddenly there was a sharp thud and tinkling glass then another dwight stiffened and swore breaking windows ill have schroeders hideno need fr this but as he had prophesied the influence of drink faded and the small crowd dispersed im truly sorry youve been inconvenienced mr kydd dwight said with dignity but in my country we value free speech above all things good night to ye kydd did not sleep well and was up at cockcrow pacing along the single crossstreet to get the stiffness from his limbs it did not take long for the gang of youngsters to find him and begin chanting again but kydd grinned broadly and gave them a cheery wave they soon tired of the sport and darted away after a few minutes one returned and took station next to him kydd guessed he was about ten are you english the boy blurted out aye i come frm guildford which is in surrey kydd said whats your ships name oh shes his britannic majestys sixtyfourgun ship tenacious an im her fifth ltenant kydd so you have t call me sir yes sir the boy said smartly im peter miller they walked on together how do ye keelhaul a man sir what no lad we dont keelhaul sailors we flog em never keelhaul kydd chuckled have you ever bin flogged sir peter asked wideeyed kydd hesitated it was not an admission he would make in polite company yes a long time ago before i was an officer peter nodded seriously i want t join the navy like you but my pap says we aint got a navy he added defensively we have americans in the royal navy lad ye could no sir peter said with spirit ill not serve king george er thats any king atall not just your king sir kydd laughed and the boy scampered off he reached the end of the street turned the corner and found himself heading towards the french privateer alongside the commercial wharf at the thought of seeing the ship at such close quarters he quickened his pace there were idle onlookers standing about on the quay taking their fill of the novel sight kydd could see no reason why he should not be one of them a shout came from behind him there he isthe english bastard come t spy on our friends he recognised the voice of a hothead who had been at the boat several men hurried towards him one hefting a length of paling wood an authoritativelooking figure watched from the foredeck of the privateer kydd stiffened there would be no help from the spectators by the vessel they were too busy gawping and the few looking in his direction seemed disinclined to intervene kydd stood his ground with folded arms he knew he could probably make a good account of himself but he would not be the first to make a move spyin dog y knows what happens t spies are ye as chuckleheaded as y look im no spy skulkin around ive got just as much right t take the air here asas yr frenchy there one of the bystanders came up hes right y knows both furriners stands t reason y cant pick one over the other hold yr noise darby schroeder strode across you sir he called at kydd standing aggressively between him and the ship will you account for your presence as an officer of a belligerent power at the lawful mooringplace of a ship of the opposing nation or shall it be spying kydd held his temper no schroeder started youre saying i said no which is to say i do not have t account to you or any man for what im about on m lawful business on a public highway schroeders jaw hardened but kydd looked past him to the privateer scores of men were pouring on to the wharf scattering the onlookers kydd waited surely they would not dare anything in broad daylight before witnesses but then they spread out in a line and moved towards him kydd tensed the features of individual seamen resolving alien chatter quietening to a purposeful advance kydd stood firm they came closer and stopped in front of him undeniably seafarers but with their sashes floppy liberty caps and mediterranean swarthiness there was something distorted and menacing about them they shuffled together to form a barrier and when kydd moved to go round it they blocked his way again kydd spotted the figure on the foredeck and bellowed let me pass y villains the officer shrugged and called out an unintelligible stream of french it was stalemate there was nothing for it but as dignified a retreat as possible kydd stalked off seething at being outwitted by the french at the very least he had hoped to report back on the ship her state for sea guns anything he could see now he would have to admit he hadnt been able to get close he forced his mind to focus on the situation and by the time hed reached the crossstreet he had a plan he would see the other side instead that implied a boat the tide was on the make which would allow him to drift past and take his fill of the scene kydd found the young lads playing in the same place and he called across to peter a silver sixpence wi king georges head on it should you tell me where i cn hire a fishinboat the dory was doubleended and handy in borrowed oilskins kydd set the little boat drifting along an unbaited line over the side the privateer the minotaure de morlaix was big work was going ahead on the mizzen a new spar chocked up ready on the wharf but there appeared to be no hurry kydd scanned the vessel her clean lines meant speed but also implied limited seaendurance given the large crew his attention was caught by a peculiar break in the line of bulwarks with their small gunports a whole section amidships had been lowered on hingesinside kydd glimpsed the astonishing sight of the black bulk of a long gun mounted on some sort of pivot another barely visible trained to the other side of the ship but this was no ordinary gun it was a twentyfourpounder at least the armament of a shipoftheline on a near frigatesized vessel this must have been the origin of the sound of heavy guns that had mystified tenacious at sea earlier and although there appeared to be only one on each side it would be enough to terrorise any victim and certainly give pause to a similar sized manowar a grave threat let loose on the trade routes of the continent it was sheer chance that had placed the only other shipoftheline in north america across the frenchmans path after returning the boat and gear he walked back along the treelined road deep in thought but the only conclusion he could come to was the impossibility of his situation a man in an oldfashioned black tricorne hat stopped him are you lootenant kydd i am im a constable o exbury township he said importantly an im instructed by the selectmen to advise ye that a warrant fer a town meetin has been issued concernin you ahdoes that mean they wish me t attend the constable looked aghast no sir only citizens o this town cn attend a town meeting mr dwight jus wants ye to know that yr matter is being looked into is all kydd turned to go but the constable pulled at his sleeve yon frenchy is goinmake sure an be there as well ltenant th meeting house is round the corner people from all parts of the town were making their way to a small building whose lines reminded kydd of the methodist chapels of his youth several greeted him openly others glared schroeder arrived in a carriage and was handed down by a black man he ignored kydd and waited a little later a french officer arrived and the two fell into discussion kydd found his eyes straying to the tall elegant figure he recognised from the mornings events by the inscrutable logic of war he was being granted sight of the man who as his kings enemy was his duty to kill the discussion stopped the two turned in his direction and kydd felt the intensity of the frenchmans glare across the distance he hesitated then withdrew his gaze when he dared another look they were walking away all attendin please enter bawled the constable the latecomers and schroeder entered leaving kydd and the frenchman alone should he follow the dictates of politeness that required he notice the man and introduce himself or was there some form of defiance required that he had not the breeding to recognise the frenchman was tall mature and had a languid elegance in his mannerisms that made kydd aware of his own origins his feelings of inadequacy returned and he stared back at the man with dislike there were badtempered shouts from inside then a headtohead crescendo the frenchman looked across at kydd and raised his eyebrows in a gesture of refined amusement but kydd was unsure of himself wanting no part in any kind of engagement and turned sharply away unexpectedly the door to the meeting house opened and dwight appeared gentlemen he called looking carefully between them the meeting recognises that this is an er irregular situation and wishes you each t state your case now there was a hush in the audience and heads turned as kydd followed the frenchman up the aisle at the simple table at the front there was no provision for extra persons we have t ask ye to stand if y will dwight said apologetically the rows of faces that looked back at kydd seemed either impassive or hostile and anxiety rose in him at the thought of a public humiliation from the worldly frenchman citizens o exbury its my duty to present capitaine hercule junon of the french ship minotaure the french officer inclined his head graciously an this is ltenant kydd of the english ship tenacious kydd inclined his head also but feared the gesture had turned out as a nod in view of captain junon bein french as he is and just to be fair is there any man present can translate for him schroeder immediately stepped forward i can then lets begin we have here a request from our english guest that it might be better to hear frm him direct ltenant kydds palms moistened he took a deep breath and turned to address the meeting you have a french privateer alongside here in exbury he has every right t be here to repair an refit as he needs but the law says he must leave in fortyeight hours i request that th united states do then enforce the law an make sure he does er thats all there was a disturbance at the back of the hall and a distant voice shouted y mean send em out to just where yr waiting for em another voice cut in yelling at the first and dwight rapped sharply with his gavel ill have order in the meeting now captain junon there was an exchange in low voices then schroeder faced kydd captain junon understands ltenant kydds duty in this matter and approves his spirit but begs to be informed what is this law of which he speaks he has no knowledge of such a one kydd tried to remember houghtons hurried words before he left ah captain junon needs remindin of the rule of war of this specifies clearly there was an urgent mutter from junon and schroeder nodded impatiently the rule of war of is of course an english law and has had no jurisdiction in the united states after and since the lieutenant apparently requires educating deals with the opening of trade to neutrals and really has no bearing whatsoever on this affair scattered titters came from the audience kydd stared back stubbornly but could think of no rejoinder and while we are discussing rules by what laws do the british press men out of american vessels and take their ships prize on the high seas junon allowed an expression of injured pride to appear while schroeder pressed home his words are the british so careless of the sanctity of a nations flag that they dare attempt to demand from the citizens of a neutral country kydd glared at junon i saw yr ship firing on an american flag vessel not two days ago a rustle of interest was interspersed with occasional shouts junon allowed it to die away before he made his reply to schroeder regrettably there are occasions when captain junons government requires him to confirm that a vessel is not conveying contrabandthere are some whose conscience is not clear in this regard and attempt to flee it is sometimes a necessity to deter and is this the action of a friend to america i ask the captain kydd said hotly incensed at junons facile delivery a burst of clapping provoked angry shouts from another quarter and dwight called for order again kydds face burned we also have our treaty he lashed out and in it sir schroeder called in mock outrage you must recall that yours was not a treaty of friendshipnot at all this was dare i say it the vanquished accepting terms from the victor a storm of mixed protest and cheers broke out obliging the constable to intervene dwight stood and waited for the uproar to diminish then spoke firmly will the strangers now withdraw outside kydd paced rigidly avoiding junons amused glances as they waited for the meeting to come to a decision it was not long before the hoots and shouts died away after an interval the constable summoned them back ltenant we have voted on the matter of your request dwight said importantly the township of exbury has considered it and as selectman i have to tell you your request is denied kydds expression tightened but he tried to put the best face on it remembering to turn and bow to the people of the town the business of this meeting is now concluded the gathering broke up noisily and people streamed to the door dwight fiddled with his papers and in a low voice said to kydd im sendin a rider to hartford this should be govment business jacob hay came forward with his hat in his hands jus like t say sorry it came out agin you mr kydd but as ye can see the people spoke he put out his hand and kydd could see that it was genuinely meant outside people were still in groups some in animated discussion kydd could not remember when he had felt so isolated a roar of laughter drew his attention it was darby one of the hotheads of the mornings events at the french ship kydds blood rose as the man approached him y lost yer vote then he said loudly kydd could not trust himself to reply but then darby clapped him on the shoulder and said no hard feelins id take it kindly if youd sink a muzzler with us friend kydd could not think what to say but a surging need for the release of a drink and the rough companionship of a tavern overcame his wonder at american generosity of spirit aye i would he said and allowed himself to be taken to the blue anchor the weatherboard tavern was already alive with humanity and kydd began to feel better there were odd glances at his clothing but darby loudly announced his presence whatll ye have he asked genially er a beer beer thats spruce birch sassafras a nearby toper closed his eyes and chanted oh we can make liquor t sweeten our lips of pumpkins o parsnips or walnuttree chips aye well its the sassafras then it was the strangesttasting brew er what do ye mix with thisn kydd inquired carefully we dont mix anythin mr englishman thats straight beer it is bit o yr beet tops apple skin roots all boiled in gives it taste o course kydd downed it manfully then called for something different darby slipped a china mug across to him flipnow theres a drink fr a man kydd lifted the creaming brew doubtfully and was not disappointed at the strength of the rum that lay within to th american flag kydd called there was a surprised roar and kydd found faces turning his way the reddest called across to him well i cant drink t your king friend but i can t your good health the drink was doing its work and kydd beamed at his new friends in the corner a pitchpipe was brought out and after a few tentative whistles two young men launched into song come join hand in hand brave americans all and rouse your bold hearts at fair libertys call no tyrannous acts shall suppress your just claim or stain with dishonour americas name lets hear an english song then darby demanded grinning at kydd and shoving another flip across im no sort o hand at singin protested kydd but was overborne he thought for a moment recalling what had most stirred him in times past well this is a sea song shipmates an we sing it around the forebitts forrardan i warn ye again im no singer come all ye jolly sailors bold whose hearts are cast in honours mould while english glory i unfold on board o the arethusa he found his voice and rolled out the fine old words heartily and as he sang his mind roamed over the times and places where he had enjoyed the company of true deepsea mariners in this way beside him his shipmates through the gales blast and the cannons roar and in all the seas over the globe as he never would experience again tears pricked and his voice grew hoarse but in defiance he roared out the final stanza and now weve driven the foe ashore never to fight with britons more let each fill a glass to his favourite lass a health to the captain and officers true and all that belongs to the jovial crew on board o the arethusa something of his feeling communicated itself to the tavern not a soul moved and when he finished there was a storm of acclamation even the potboy stood entranced and the tapster abandoned his post to stand agog ah mr kyddhell have a whiskey o your best sort ned one man said and when kydd had taken it he raised his own glass and called t mr kydd an his royal navy the morning was a trial with a throbbing head he had to endure an icy disapproving silence at breakfast guess youll be on yr way now hay said meaningfully he left after breakfast for a walk in the cool morning to consider his situation it was obvious that he must admit defeat he would display the noon signal that would have the boat return to take him off at the end of the crossstreet he went to turn down the road but catching sight of the french privateer he decided to go the other way as he did so he caught a fleeting glimpse of a figure slipping out of sight he frowned and continued but stopped sharply and turned to see the figure behind duck away again this might be a french agent on his trail or a crazed citizen seeking revenge on an englishmanand kydd was unarmed he remembered the trees where he had met peter he walked on rapidly and at the end of the road turned the corner then sprinted towards them he heaved himself up among the leaves and on to a branch overlooking the path by the road his shadower swung round the corner and stopped looking baffled he moved forward cautiously but did not appear armed kydd waited the man increased his pace and came nearer treading carefully kydd tensed and when the man passed beneath dropped on his shoulders the two fell in a heap but kydd was faster and wrenched the man over gripping his throat onehanded in restraint the man ceased struggling and stared up at kydd who slowly released his hold er if youd kindly let me up ill try to explain the voice was american polite and apologetic do if y please kydd had never heard a footpad so wellspoken but did not drop his guard the man dusted himself off and smiled ruefully my names edward gindlerlootenant gindlerand this kind of work is not t my liking ill have you know lieutenantarmy navy dont try t gull methe united states doesnt have a navy the visitors had left liston climbed the stairs painfully to his private room ruing the onset of age with its aches and pains but he knew his duty he sat down and reached for paper then selected a pen abstractedly a womans hand placed a glass of brandy by him and her lips softly touched his hair he twisted round reached for her hand and kissed it tenderly my dear he said softly his wife said nothing just looked down at him for a long moment then she left closing the door behind her liston sighed and collected his thoughts in respect of the biggest question of the momentwould the united states enter the war against francethere was no answer yet liston smiled grimly as he penned his appreciation of the difficulties faced by the beleaguered president following the commercial success of the contentious jay treaty of two years before the french had retaliated by insisting on the letter of the law in their own treaty which granted free passage to any vessel carrying a french role de lequipage now a vessel without it would be subject to seizure the consequences to the expanding trade of the young country had been nothing short of catastrophic liston picked up pinckneys congressional report on european spoliation of american trade to refresh his mind on the figures it was staggeringworse even than the dire predictions of the firebreathing hamilton in the caribbean worst hit no less than three hundred ships had been taken and counting the dangerous waters on the approaches to warravaged europe since the jay treaty nearly a thousand american flag vessels had hauled down their colours and been carried into french ports ship cargo and crew liston could barely credit that the proud americans would submit to such intolerable and cynical actions by a socalled allybut they had president adams had stoutly resisted all attempts by liston and even his own party to be embroiled in a european war whatever the provocation but there had to be limits even so liston could see his difficulty the opposition republicans were led by the astute and learned jefferson talked about as the next president who would never allow him to declare war on an ally in any case he did not have the means he had only a few frigates that had been left part built after a brief alarm over algerine pirates nearly half a dozen years ago yet something had to give in the last few months insurance rates in the caribbean had soared to an impossible per cent of ship and cargo value the french were defeating whole nations coalitions against them had crumbled and they were clearly about to break out of europe to the wider world it had made them arrogant and confident but liston felt that the latest act was beyond sufferance envoys of the united states in paris attempting to negotiate an amelioration of french attitudes had been met with a demand for two hundred thousand dollars as a precondition for any kind of talks this incitement to naked bribery had appalled the americans and when it had leaked out there had been outrage for the first time it appeared president adams would have to moveto declare war and with what liston dipped his pen and began to write chapter may i correct you sir we do have a navy gindler said with an ironic smile as of a week ago might i explain it seemed that there had been congressional authorisation for a naval armament since the algerines trouble but this had been a war department matter of the time now congress wanted the reality and had therefore recently established a department of the navy to act like the british admiralty and was to appoint a full secretary of the navy so our navy is born gindler had an engaging smile but kydd detected a harder layer beneath his cheery manner kydds head was still muzzy after his visit to the blue anchor and he tried to concentrate y dont just say youll have a navy you now have t find ships officers how are y going t do that and dockyards victualling slops he looked at gindlerand felt that this vigorous new country might just find some way wish ye well of it mr gindler he said sincerely then he added but id be obliged now sir if youd explain what you were doing certainly i was spying on you mr kydd wha we need to know what a british officer is doing on our soil youll agree then why th skulking about its no secret why im here ah this is not to do with your own good self i do assure you it has rather more to do with our democratic way mr kydd if the citizens of this town living as they do in connecticut find out that i as an agent of the federal government am poking around in a matter they conclude is theirs then ill soon need a fast horse out of exbury oh have you got what you came for then kydd thought the whole thing sounded more than a little farfetched shall we say sir that id rather like to be shaking hands with an english officer as he steps into his boat to return to his ship aye well thanks t your citizens the frenchman lies here untouched an my ship must sail away have no fear youll have yr wish mr gindler at noon i throw out my signal and the boat will come to take me and my english carcass off he smiled wryly then added but do walk with me until then an tell me more of yr plans for a navy kydd retrieved his baggage from jacob hay and stood with gindler on the small jetty tenacious was approaching and would heave to on the threemile line for a space while telescopes spied the shore for kydds signal if there was none she would fill stand out to sea and return on the following day if its any consolation my friend it grieves me as much as it does you gindler said in a voice low enough not to be overheard by the ragged crowd that had come to see the defeated englishman leave oh said kydd bitterly he was in no mood to be consoled gindler was spared having to answer by the thud of hoofs the constable hove into view and pulled up his horse mr dwight sends is compliments an hopes you can pay him a call before y leaves kydd bit his lip it was within half an hour of midday and if he missed the time to display his signal flag tenacious would stand offshore for another day the constable leaned down noos he said hoarsely and winked broadly dwight was businesslike its none of your business o course mr kydd but youll find out anywayive had word from the governor in hartford an he takes his advice from philadelphia seems theyve had enough o the frenchies and im to serve an order on their captain that theyve just twentyfour hours to quit united states territory he stuffed papers into a desk i guess this means youll be about yr business then mr kydd he added holding the door open kydd had minutesif he could make his signal a wily captain like junon could play it well he would use all his twentyfour hours to fettle his ship for any circumstance then no doubt he would sail slowly and directly to the edge of territorial waters luring tenacious towards him when the english ship was committed to his approach he would throw over his helm to one side or the other and hoisting every possible sail break out with his superior speed into the open sea gindler was waiting curiously at the jetty minotaureshes t sail within twentyfour hours kydd said quietly catching his breath watching the main topsail of tenacious brace sturdily around as she made to heave to well now you leave like a hero perhaps noti have t think kydd said distracted true the minotaure was forced to sea but what was the use of this if the privateer could slip away past her pursuer it was damned bad luck that their sloop lynx would not yet have returned from alerting the admiral of tenaciouss dispositions for the two together had a chance of hounding minotaure to her doom could anything be done desperate times meant desperate measures kydd had heard of a dragsail being used to reduce speed a disguised ship would pretend dull sailing to lure a prey perhaps he could stay ashore and tie a sail secretly to minotaure slow her enough to catch he soon realised that before the privateer had gone any distance her captain would want to know why she was slowing and discover the trick mr kydd gindler pointed out to sea where tenacious was bringing round her main topsail yard kydd pulled the red numberone flag from his pocket and hurried to the front of the gaggle of spectators spread it wide and let it hang his news would surely set the ship abuzz there appeared to be little activity on her quarterdeck the daily run inshore had lost its novelty no doubt then topmen began mounting the shrouds and in a smart display the main topsail came around and filling at the same time as the main course was loosedand tenacious gracefully got under way for the open sea kydd held the signal high in the forlorn hope that someone was looking back on the little township but her sails sheeted home tenacious made off to the horizon amid the sniggering and laughter of the onlookers kydd stood mortified not only was he left stranded but he had failed to pass on his vital news even if he could find a boat quickly no small craft could catch a big squarerigger in full sail the only certainty was that tenacious would return the next day and where could he lay his head that night he knew he could not go back to hay er mr gindler if yre familiar with this town do you know of any lodgin house no sir i do not that is i dont know of one fit for a gentleman he smiled come now i cant have an english guest take back a poor notion of my country you shall stay with me mr kydd why mr gindler thats very kind in you gindler patted him on the shoulder and it keeps you safely under my eye i always try to make new england for the summer a prime place to rest the spiritand it is here that i stay it was a retired fishermans cottage by the edge of the water complete with its own boathouse do you fish mr kydd the halibut and cod here fresh caught will by any estimate grace the highest table in the land we shall try some tonight kydd tried to take an interest but his mind was full of the consequences of his inattention at the jetty the only glimmer of hope was that if minotaure made use of her full twentyfour hours tenacious would have returned in time to try to catch her prey we shall have to make shift for ourselves sir gindler said apologetically the hire of this cottage does not include servants oh er yes of course mr gindler this is american territory mr kydd be so kind as to address me by my first name edwardthat is ned thank you siri mean ned and pray call me tom kydd went out on to the little porch and stared out to sea gindler joined him with pewter tankards of cider and they sat in cane chairs if you can believe it you have my earnest sympathy tom he said damnation to the french he added but arent they yr friends said kydd startled out of his dejection theyve caused us more grief and loss than ever you english did curse em and i have that from secretary of state timothy pickering himself kydds spirits returned so it wouldnt cause you heartbreak to see this corsair destroyed no sir it would give me the greatest satisfaction kydd grinned savagely then lets get our heads together an work out some way we cn bring about that very thing gindler shook his head we recollect tom that this is the territory of the united states should i act against a ship of a neutral flag while shes lying in our waters id be hoist by both sides so im on my own again and im dutybound to oppose any action against a neutralespecially in one of our ports youll understand kydd slumped in his chair tell me tom are we friends gindler asked surprised kydd agreed then my scruples tells me it is no crime to help a friend what do you think an immediate council of war concentrated on one overriding thing unless minotaure could be slowed there was little chance that tenacious could catch her then were th only possible chance kydd said morosely it seems that way how about a dragsail it would easily be discovered soon as they put t sea and felt its effect perhaps i could cut half through a brace or somethin that will carry away at the right time kydd said more in despair than hope with the barky alert and swarming with men i dont think so it seemed ludicrous to contemplate two men against a frigatesized ship but kydd persevered there is another way he pondered to slow the frenchys one thing t bring him to us but theres his steering as well steering helm and tiller ropes his rudder you do anything with that and hes sure to know just as quick not so if m idea is sound it was years ago but the image was as clear as yesterday an english frigate careening at a remote island in the south pacific oceanand in the balmy oceanic winds the crew scraping and cleaning the vast rearing bulk of the hull he had been at work around the stern overawed by the hulking presence of the thirtyfoothigh rudder at close quarters and had gone to inspect its working ned kydd said cautiously may i quiz you on yr understanding of how rudders are hung by all means a pinthe pintle on the rudder going through the eye of a gudgeon on the hull now i ask ye to agree this at the last extremity o the hull is the sternpost yes this must be so the underwater run of the hull coming together in a fine upright sternpost and the rudder fits to th sternpost with your gudgeons and pintles now i particularly desire ye to remark the gap between the forward edge of the rudder and the after edge o the sternpost the thickness of the rudder in a frigate would amaze you its every bit of a foot or more as must be th sternpost and i mean t thrust a wedge between them a magnificent scheme but pray how will you apply this wedge er well discuss that part later fr now we have to settle some details first th gap is only an inch or two wide no wedge this thick cn stand the sea forces of a rudder butand this needs yr verifyingthere is a very suitable place at th point where the pintle meets the gudgeon the shipwrights cut out a space in th rudder below it or else we cannot unship the rudder this they call th score and how big is your gap there above six inchesso now we have two flat surfaces a foot long an six inches apart a wedge that size has a chance kydd grinned boyishly just think ned the frenchy goes t sea sees tenacious coming for him an throws over his helm t slip by one side but his helm is jammed before he has time t work out the trouble hes kind enough to deliver himself straight to us congratulationsbut of course well yes there is th question of how t get the wedge in there ill grant ye and what sort of ship goes to sea with jammed steering ah ive thought of that im gratified to hear it kydd gave a dry smile this is callin for something special and here it is we screw an eye into one end of th wedge and secure a line to it which is passed through our gap if you tug on the line it brings the wedge whistling up an smack into the gap but it wont be us thats tugging i stand amazed who will ah your old friend a dragsail its only a small piece o canvas rolled up and secured to the opposite end of the line and when it opens it does the tugging how well we need the helm t jam only at the right momentso we must find a trigger to stream our dragsail just at that time and here it iswe bundle the canvas up with twine and when we want it to open an start pulling the wedge we break the twine which is yes well this is a long piece of twine and if you look fr a discreet little pickup buoy astern o the frenchy then thats the end o the twine gindler didnt say anything well asked kydd anxiously i can only i have two objections oh who is going to affix the device and who is going to find our wee buoymaybe under gunfire ill do both said kydd solemnly but he had no idea how the boathouse provided all they needed a woodworking bench tryplane sawsit would be a straightforward enough task kydd blessed the time he had spent in a caribbean dockyard working for a master shipwright ned i want some good wood for m wedge gindler fossicked about and from a dark corner dragged out what looked like a small salvaged ship frame dark with age this should suit its live oak and very hard capital for hacking out a wedge aye well and it damn near doesnt float done the tryplane hissed as kydd applied himself to the work watched by an admiring gindler indeed the wood was extremely dense and kydd sweated at the task gindler had already found the twine and was snipping round a piece of dirty canvas then he rummaged for a screw eye kydd realised he needed to see the french ship again in the light the big privateer still lay alongside the commercial wharf but with a renewed purposeful air loading sea stores and working at her rigging as he looked across the little bay at her it became clear that there was no easy way to get close there were sentries on deck and quay and the ship was alert kydd scanned the shoreline the wharf was set on timber pilings if he could get among them and there at the end he saw a spur of light grey rocks extending into the sea back in the boathouse a lanthorn glowed i believe i have a chance kydd told gindler yes tom when will you go gindler was indistinct in the evening shadows but his voice had an edge to it it has t be before midnight the tide is on the ebb and her gunportsll fall below the level of th wharf before then he picked up the neat piece of canvas gindler had prepared it was rolled tightly together with sailmakers twine to which a stronger line was securely fixed how long will you have this the coil of light line seemed a lot but was probably only fifty feet or so i think all o that kydd said the longer it was the safer the task of picking up the buoy and yanking the line and th last thingour buoy he cast about for an object that would serve and found some duck decoys one of the ducklings would suit admirably he secured it to the light lineand all was complete in the blackness of night they stood at the edge of the woods where they were closest to the privateer and had a frontrow view of the ship lanthorns in her rigging cast bright pools of light on to the wharf figures paced slowly along the dockside work had ceased this would not be the case if an earlydawn departure was planned well here we are gindler whispered and its here that we part my friend i cannot in all conscience go further but id like to shake the hand of a brave man lets be started kydd muttered he tucked the precious bundle of canvas and rope tightly under his arm and slipped down to the waters edge careful to stay in the shadows of the spur of rock there he paused safe for the moment and listened to the quiet chuckle and ripple of the calm evening sea the ship was over a hundred yards awayand when he stepped round the spur there was a dozen yards of open beach before the shelter of the wharf piling for that distance he would be in plain view of the ship the single thing in his favour was surprise they might expect a rush by an armed party but never by a lone unarmed man it was small comfort but it also seemed the height of absurdity to be going into battle against a heavily gunned privateer armed only with a lump of wood and a piece of dirty canvas in the shadow of the rocks he stripped down to his long underwear and stockings awkward and vulnerable he laid down his clothes carefully and stumbled over to the inky black sea he could not risk the forty feet of open beach the only alternative was to wade off into the outer blackness the water was fearfully cold and his heart nearly failed him he forced himself to continue his feet feeling the sharp stones and shells on the rocky bottom deeper he wentthe cold biting into his legs then his waist leaving him gasping for breath out past the end of the spur the ship was now in plain view and as he turned to round the end he lowered himself into the numbing water to his neck past the rock the bottom turned mercifully to the softness of mud and he leaned forward shuddering with cold pushing on parallel to the beach and praying he could not be seen minotaure was bows to sea her carved stern towards him there was a light in the captains cabin a dim gold point through the mullioned windows a couple of figures stood together on her after deck and kydd could see the occasional red of a drawn pipe but the rest was in shadow there was the odd scurry of unknown sea creatures at his feet the stubbing of a toe against an invisible barnacled rock and what seemed an eternity of knifing cold at last he saw the edge of the wharf piling resolve out of the darkness gratefully he entered the safety of the overhang with its concentrated sea odours and stood upright a mistake the tiny evening breeze was now a searching icy blast that stopped his breath he lowered himself back into the water which was almost warm by contrast stumbling along in the darkness he passed between the heavily barnacled and slimy piles clutching his bundle until he came abreast of the looming black vastness of the privateer turning towards it he moved forward and felt the slope of the seabed suddenly drop away he pulled back in alarm he was an awkward swimmer and encumbered with his device he could not possibly do other than move upright with a sinking heart he realised it was logical to build the wharf for larger ships where the water was deep enough for them to come close inminotaure would draw fifteen or twenty feet far out of his depth his frozen mind struggled and he looked around wildly past the stern of the ship tucked in just under the wharf edge he saw a low elongated shape a ships side punt used by sailors to stand in as they worked their way down the hull caulking and painting he pulled the little raft towards him hoisted his bundle in and hanging off one end he thrust out the punt glided towards the black bulk of the ships hull and finally bumped woodenly against it kydds feet dangled in the freezing depths a mix of terror and elation washed over him at the physical touch of the enemy he worked his way along the hull sensing noise and movement within until he reached the curved overhang of the stern here he would be out of sight from above while he set his trap but any boat coming down the other side of the hull would burst into view just feet from him without warning he took the bundle his hands shaking as he prepared it the motionless rudder was lost in the shadows but kydd could hang on to the rudder chains and be guided down to it he would have to work by feel near the waterline would be the lower hance a projecting piece at the trailing edge of the rudder with its hoisting ring plate he could not fail to find it he felt the barnaclestudded fitting and pulled himself to it the final act to thread the line through the score the inner gap he let his hands slide inwards the pintle strap led to the pintle itself going through the gudgeon eyeand there was the score a gap just below the waterline and big enough to put his whole fist through excitement surged through him all he had to do now was put the line through with the wedge one side and the rest the other he pushed the line through easily enough then had to bend it on the wedge his hands were numb but he fumbled it through the screw eye but when he tried to tie a simple onehanded bowline his stiff fingers could not obey he scrabbled at the line helplessly aware that if he lost his hold on the wedge it would sink down for ever into the black depths he couldnt feel anything nearly weeping with frustration he tried again and failed then with one last effort he rested his elbows on the edge of the punt leaving both hands free clumsily he managed to manipulate the sodden line letting the wedge hang free by its line he tested it then let it sink slowly toward the seabed moving to the other side of the rudder he freed the bundle of canvas and let the pickup buoy float away the little bundle weighted with a fishing lead sank also and all that was left of his nights work was a shabby little duckling floating nearby gindler was waiting behind the rocky spur and when kydd staggered up from the dark waters he threw a blanket round his frozen body and rubbed furiously mr kydd youre the maddest sonofagun ive ever heard of he whispered now lets get something hot into you it was kings calibogus spruce beer stiffened with new england rum a drink to which greaves had introduced him taken hot in front of the log fire it was medicine indeed while kydd recounted his tale gindler threw clams and chunks of cod into a pot with onion and bacon and crushed biscuit for thickening then let the mixture simmer and fill the snug cottage with an irresistible aroma er do pardon me the liberty said gindler after the chowder pot had been satisfyingly scraped empty i cant help but observe that your character is so different from your usual kings officer tom you never hang back when theres a need to soil the hands to bear a fist directlyand you speak plainer if you understand me aye well that could be because i come frm a different land i came aft through th hawse as we say but now im a gentleman he added doubtfully you are indeed gindler said sincerely how about your folk ned kydd asked cradling another calibogus my mothers family came over with the mayflower gindler said proudly settled in the north near boston pa runs a business a grey day broke and kydds sleepless night was over at last today would end in a flurry of gunfire and a captured privateer or failure any one of those barbarous small rocks that had left his feet so sore could snag the line and part it and they would be left with a useless end so much could go wrong even as they breakfasted a crew member might look over the side of minotaure and raise the alarm and then it would be over before it started or the ship might sail at dawn when tenacious was not in the offing kydd sat on the porch brooding what do ye say we take a walk through th town perhaps we you must stay here my friend your presence near the vessel at this time could be unfortunate gindler got to his feet i will undertake a reconnaissance he returned quickly theyre ready for sea near enough but theres a little duck taken up residence under her stern the morning dragged by kydd tried to learn a card game but it quickly palled in the end they sat on the porch and talked eyes straying out to sea i believe we must take position now gindler said lightly we have our smack ready at hand the craft was not big but had a single mast stepped to a forward thwart and with a light spritsail took the morning breeze with a will in nondescript fishermens gear kydd and gindler saw they were one of a handful of boats chancing the day for seabass the entrance to the inner sound was no more than a couple of miles across and the one league boundary a halfmile beyond gindler eased sheets and steered for the northern point there she is cried kydd exultantly hms tenacious under topsails was calmly approaching from the north all the players were now converging and it was only a matter of time before the final act minotaure had to sail by noon her captain was waiting for the last possible moment and as a consequence would have to face tenacious but he would have been told about the midday signal arrangementwhy did he wait and risk the confrontation then it dawned on kydd junon was both confident and cool he wanted the english ship to present herself he knew he could outmanoeuvre the big ship and in this way could establish where she was and therefore be free of the threat of an unpleasant surprise later the privateers fore topsail rose she was about to proceed kydds heart beat faster her headsails fluttered into life and as he watched her bow detached from the wharf the french tricolour was lowered from her ensign staff but reappeared at her mizzen peak other canvas made its appearance and minotaure stood out into the sound her actions were not lost on tenacious whose battleensign soared up to the mainmasthead in answer kydd pictured the frenzied rush to quarters and was torn between the desire to be back aboard his ship in action and the knowledge of what he had to do tenacious stood squarely across the entrance at the edge of the boundary heaving to in the slight winds while the privateer advanced cautiously towards her under just topsails not giving the slightest indication of which side she was going to pass kydds admiration for the coolness of the french captain increased as he noticed that the winds direction had tenacious hove to with broadside towards normally a battlewinning raking position but the bigger ship could not in any circumstances open fire into united states waters and certainly not risk shot ricocheting into the town therefore minotaure could move forward in perfect safety we need t get under her stern kydd growled gindler sheered the boat round and edged more into the sound keeping safely to one side the privateer drew nearer and kydd visualised the wedge and the little bundle bumping over the mud of the seabed hopefully then to stream out behind or they might already have been torn off kydd spoke more to himself than to gindler when she makes her move shell loose sail t crack on speed and only then choose her side an put over her helm sharp therefore our signal will be when she looses more sail tenacious would have little chance of reacting in time being stationary in the water with only the chance of a fleeting shot as the faster vessel surged past the privateer came on seeming immense from the little smack her upper decks appeared full of men and her gunports were open gindler eased away the sail and let the big ship come down on them jockeying to be as near as possible wave at em kydd said urgently answering waves appeared up at the deckline they were very close now every raw detail of her timbers and gun muzzles plain gindler put over his tiller and the boat spun about to face the same direction jibbing and rolling in the side wake of the privateer tenacious was precisely dead aheadstill no indication kydd waved again anxiety flooding him at the thought of what hung on the next few minutes gindler jockeyed the boat about slipping back until the stern windows of the ship came into view then sidling up behind the duckling find th duck kydd gasped they searched frantically astern of the shipbut there was no sign of a buoy no kydd cried harshly gindler kept on behind the rearing stern then pointed ththere he whooped kydd leaned over and saw in the roiling bubbling wake a jaunty duckling bobbing vigorously much closer to the stern than he had planned get us in there fr gods sake he yelled hoarsely careless of anything but the final task hardening in the sheets gindler brought the smack closer but startled faces appeared over the stern high above snag the bastard quick he hissed the boat was bouncing around in the uneven wake and the wind around the looming stern was fitful and chancy clear and positive over the noise of the tumbling water came the sound of a boatswains callsto man yards and set sail kydd leaned far over the bow reaching scrabbling for the duckling there would be no second chance now and shouts were coming from above he touched the painted wood but it bounced out of reach then skittered back he grabbed at it with the furthest extremity of his reachhe had it pulled but it jerked from his grasp kydd cried out in frustration the shouts above turned angry demanding dangerous in despair he glanced back at gindler whose pale set face took on a look of determination he yanked on the sheets and the little boat responded going right under the stern of the big ship kydd fell over the thwarts trying to keep with the buoy but at last he seized it in both hands gindler instantly let out sheets and the smack fell back kydd was ready for it and crushed the little duck to him as the soaked line tautened unbearablythen fell slack it was over near sobbing with relief kydd fell back into the boat still with the duckling clasped to his chest he looked up minotaure was receding from them and indeed was loosing sail from every bare yard she was still heading for tenacious and waiting until the sails drew gathering speed for the vital turn kydd held his breath until it hurtthere was no sign no hint that he had achieved anything minotaure was poised for her turn all ready and still no turn he had done it incredibly unbelievably it had worked the privateers steering had locked to the bewilderment of her crew and now as he watched confusion and chaos overtook as orders for setting sail were reversed panic and fear flooding in as the ship delivered herself into the arms of a shipoftheline it was over in moments a disbelieving tenacious had seen minotaure come straight at her and sent a challenging ball under her bow there was nothing any sane captain could do when brought to helpless under the threat of the broadside of a twodeckerher colours came down slowly and hms tenacious took possession of her prize chapter the president lifted another rose in his cupped hands and sniffed it perfect he sighed raising his eyes to meet those of his new secretary of the navy benjamin stoddert then he straightened and said softly im right glad you accepted ben there was a moment of shared feeling this was not the redblooded hewing of a vision from the chaos of the revolution twenty years before it was a time for hardheaded recognition of power and reality in a world at war i fear we may be too late stoddert said it came all of a moil so quick john the lines in adamss face deepened i dont want war with the frenchunderstand that of all things i loathe their system and their arrogance but ill be doing anything i can think of to prevent an alignment of the united states with one party or the other stoddert followed adams to the next rosebush agreed but we must stand up for ourselves no one in this world will stand up for us adams straightened ben ive abrogated the treaty weve had since with the french ive swallowed insults from jefferson about my reasons and finally pulled congress into line you have your navy leave it to me to take care of the rest of the world yes sir stoddert saw no reason to dilute a response to french actions but knew better than to debate adamss moderate tactics besides which adams had a personal interest in the formation of this new navy he had been the one to create the continental navy the motley fleet of the revolution that had taken on the royal navy at sea it had then been disbanded this federal navy was going to be different professional and stoddert had the honour of leading it into existence you have your captains now it had been a fraught business the few experienced men available vying for positions of seniority and honour i have truxtun nicholson barry of course and the lieutenants it had taken the personal intervention of the ageing george washington to settle the question of seniority and the ships converted merchantmen to begin with six frigateclass vessels racing to completion constitution constellation and others and your budget adams said finally congress had voted it through complaining bitterly at the cost of the new vessels and the republicans had fought against it as irrelevant to a continental power with no enemies but now it was going to happen ben be careful my friend adams said quietly both understood the political risks that were being taken well i wont keep you he plucked his rose with a sigh then turned back to stoddert one thing interests me how will you forge aa way of doing things a spirit of the sea if you will stoddert pondered it seems to me we acquire it in the same way as we have our common law we take what we want from the english and cast away the rest he pursed his lips after all its the royal navy the first navy of the age the main sticking point was gindler he had begged kydd not to mention his part arguing that for him to have taken an active part in operations against a neutral might cause an international incident but without gindlers corroboration his account would not be believedespecially the latter stages which would have been impossible without an accomplice he could imagine the polite contempt with which his claim would be met at the wardroom table seen as a shabby attempt to embellish his experiences nohe could not risk that there was nothing for it but a bald statement of his treatment ashore his urging of a town meeting and the final instructions from hartford he had reported as much verbally to the captain who had generally approved his conduct understanding his encounter with the odd notions of democracy obtaining ashore it would take a lot to put the captain out of humour with such a prize meekly astern and no doubt this report would be passed on to the admiral with suitably warm words kydd was proud of what he had done and chagrined at having to keep it quietrenzi had agreed to go over the report for him before he handed it in but afterwards kydd had promised him such a tale as would keep him tolerably entertained halifax had seen ships come and go in wartime and this occasion was not noticeably different tenacious anchored in the bosom of the fleet salutes were exchanged and captain houghton in sword and decorations went aboard the flagship to make explanation of his prizeand the consequent accession to the admirals own purse by return new fleet instructions were sent to her signal lieutenant the effective date three days hence kydd groaned with vexation signals and their meanings were a prerogative of the admiral commanding the station and were buried in the fighting instructions detailed prescripts from the admiral for the precise manner in which he wished his ships to engage the enemy admiral black dick howe who had brought the fleet mutiny at spithead to an end the previous year had done much to standardise operation of flag signals and kydd saw that these from admiral vandeput were similar there were ten signal flags then the preparative and the substitutepennants and wefts differences of meaning depending on where hoisted night signals recognition procedures signals for individual ships divisions fleets this was the system that had resulted from so much practice over years of sea warfare it had gone into battle with howe on the glorious first of june only the previous year jervis had signalled nelson at st vincent and duncan had used it with such effect at camperdown now lieutenant kydd had inherited this accrued wisdom and must prove himself worthy of it he took the signal pocket book which had been owned by his dead predecessor as a model and with scissors and patience set about constructing the vade mecum that would stay with him while he was a signal lieutenant the flaglieutenant himself brought the summons lieutenant kydd to wait on the admiral immediately kydd flinched when he recalled his previous summoning what could be the reason now it was astonishing he was a mere lieutenantand so many commanders would slay to be noticed by a commanderinchiefand there was no apparent reason for it kydd bawled at tysoe in a fever of anxiety only new stockings and faultless linen would answer decorations he had none sword the plain hanger he had bought in halifax would have to do he pulled on his breeches watched by half the wardroom a gig was brought alongside and kydd descended the ships side and sat bolt upright in the sternsheets the bowman cast off with an excess of flourishes and the midshipman in charge set the men to pulling smartly the flaglieutenant led the way wordlessly to the great cabin lieutenant kydd sir enter admiral vandeput advanced to meet him well now is this the officer the fuss is all about he regarded kydd keenly sir the whitehaired admiral spoke in an easy manner this could not be a carpeting please sit mr kydd he went round his desk and found a paper while kydd perched on the edge of an elegant windsor chair this is a most particular request not to say direction and it comes from mr liston our minister to the united states that iswhat you might call an ambassador he laid the paper on the table and kydd glimpsed the cipher of the court of st james at the top in it he desires me to release an officer for a particular service to a foreign poweras you probably know we have had officers seconded to the swedish crown st petersburg other countries this is not unusual it is a little odd though that you have been named and that you are so damn junior his quiet chuckle took the sting from his words it seems the united states is conjuring up their own navy and they have asked mr liston for an observer from the royal navy if possible a lieutenant kydd he feels that it would be right at this time to be seen cooperating with a neutral nation there what do you think of that mr kydd youre noticed diplomatically his genial smile grew wider and he stabbed a finger at kydd in emphasis and id wager more went on ashore in that backwoods village than ever found its way into your report heyhey er sir i never mind whatever it was you did right now lets talk about what youll be doing theyve got together two or three frigatesbuilt em themselves damn itand ive seen the gunboats their revenue runs calls em their treasury navy now youll probably be shipping in one of their frigatestheyre fitting out now your status will be supernumerary for the voyagea passenger any christian would call itand you wont be called upon to serve a gun if it comes to fighting er who will be their enemy sir well thats a little difficult to say but he tapped his nose ive been hearing that the french have overstepped their position making hay with american trade and they dont like it in any event theyll probably tell you about it themselves now i know youll comport yourself as a gentleman should marks o respect to all the proper persons flags and so on but i think what theyre probably after is a correct steer on how things are done in our service i dont see any reason why you cant tell em anything reasonable they want to know must be hard to start from nothing he reflected sombrely you go in plain clothes will be victualled by the er united states navy and i dont suppose youll be away from us for long theres a brig leaving for philadelphia shortlyits their capital where our mr liston is expecting you good fortune lieutenant kydd took in the sights as the brig rounded cape may for the long trip up the broad delaware this was quite a different land from rugged grey rockbound nova scotia or even pretty forested connecticut here there was wellsettled land on either bank farming and orchards settlements and roads the sails of coastal shipping thronged the river as it narrowed towards the capital kydd was impressed no mean colonial sprawl philadelphia was a fine city that stretched for miles along the river as busy as any he had seen in england kydd followed his baggage ashore and looked to see if someone was there to meet him a ferry loaded noisily and a market stretched away into the distance improbably occupying the middle of a wide road mr kydd he wheeled round aye he said cautiously a welldressed young man inclined his head thornton secretary of legation how please believe its not so hard a task to spy out a sailor mr kydd he raised a beckoning finger and a coachman came for kydds baggage so good in you to leave your wooden world at such short notice his excellency is returning from mount vernon and hopes to make your acquaintance tomorrow i trust youll find our accommodation congenial with a growing sense of unreality kydd boarded a highwheeled carriage and the debonair thornton pointed out the sights as they made walnut street at a fast clip minister liston keeps unfashionable hours i fear can you find it in you dear fellow to appear at nine tomorrow morning it seems hes anxious to see you of course should you like theatre i have tickets for this evening thank you kydd murmured his head spinning with the pace of events mr liston thornton said softly ushering kydd into a small drawing room and closing the door noiselessly as he left ah mr kydd said liston finishing a letter pray be seated i wont be long while liston sanded and sealed the missive kydd had the feeling that he was under discreet observation very well to business you will be aware by now that this country has seen fit to begin the creation of a navy arising from the grievous nature of the depredations of the french on their trade for details of that you will no doubt have your professional sources he paused significantly there are many elements of delicacy in this situation and in a way i would wish that you were of a more elevated senior character but in this i am constrained by their very firm petition for your own good self to undertake this service therefore i will be plain the united states has done us the signal honour of embarking on a characterisation of their navy that is in the greatest measure our own this is gratifying to us of course as it presupposes an alignment of purpose consequent upon a convergence of practices this naturally has put the french out of countenance for the americans have turned their back on their traditional ally in this liston paused considering kydd and in this as in all things you will consult your honour as to how on foreign soil you will best conduct yourself in furtherance of your countrys interests something in the smooth flow of words alerted kydd and he listened warily i will sir be assured then if this is your prime motivation i can rely on your loyalty to the crown sir then let me lay out the issues before you you are in a unique position to allay the fears of your government on certain matters concerning the effectiveness of this armament sir kydd said tightly youre askin me to spy on th americans the warmth of a flush spread but he did not care spies and betrayal this was not how he saw his duty listons face tightened have a care lieutenant recollect you hold the commission of king george and in it you have sworn certain loyalties that cannot so easily be cast aside what i am asking is no more than any officer of honour is bound to do when on foreign territory whether on parole or any other basis simply to keep his eyes open the crack of aristocratic authority in his voice remained as he went on and if i might remark it you appear surprisingly deficient thereby in your understanding of the bounds of gentlemanly conduct kydd stiffened then dropped his eyes listons tone softened were not asking you to report back on the number of ships and guns and so forth if that is your scruple it is something of far more significance i desire that you will return to me with an opinion as to whether you believe the united states is determined in this matter has resolved to establish an armed force of credibility or is merely embarked on a ploy to deter the french he fixed his gaze on kydd and if you conceive that they are in earnest your professional opinion as to their effectiveness at sea in short whether they can fight should the world take notice kydd returned the gaze steadily i will do that sir it was not an act of spying it was an opinion liston relaxed a little then as we seem to have come to an understanding would you care to join me for coffee the american bean is generally accounted superior and we have the remainder of this hour before your hosts make their appearance twenty minutes later there was a firm knock on the door thornton appeared with an indistinct figure behind him sir a gentleman for mr kydd it was gindler outside they shook hands gleefully well this must be the strangest coincidence of the age laughed gindler but his knowing look gave the game away so what has the american navy in store for poor lieutenant kydd ah the united states navy is what we call ityou english will have reason to remember the continental navy of the revolution this is now the federal navy but some take exception to the term noted and you are now talking to ltenant gindler third of the united states frigate constellation captain truxtun now fitting out in baltimore he smiled wickedly and i am talking to the mysterious supernumerary on our first voyage kydd laughed but his interest swelled fast this was not to be a pettifogging political appointment but a real seagoing situation when not so fast good sir im instructed that our new secretary of the navy wishes to make your acquaintance before we hazard the briny deep do excuse this mares nest of a roommy wife has not yet arrived in philadelphia to take charge of my household stoddert made ineffectual attempts to clear a space at one end of a plain table where a stout chair stood his manner was distracted but his gaze direct as he greeted kydd secretary stoddert has only recently arrived in the capital gindler murmured standing clear of the welter of papers and furniture thank you lieutenant pray call on me before you leave philadelphia i may have something for captain truxtun gindler bowed and left now you are lieutenant kydd of the royal navy sir and you must be wondering why you are here not to say concerned aye sir kydd said uneasy at yet more attention from on high stoddert lowered himself into his chair then first the wider issue we are in the process of creating our own navy we have chosen to follow the example and traditions of the royal navy as a starting point for our own it would be of the utmost value to us were an officer of that illustrious service to signify to us our success in this endeavour as to why your own good self mr gindler was good enough to render me a full and satisfying account of what transpired in exburyin confidence of course there can be no question that the united states is implicated in any way i understand sir but more to our liking are mr gindlers remarks upon your character let me be candid sir the royal navy is a proud and ancient service but there are many of its officers whose superior attitude is both lamentable and abhorrent to us as a nation it is a trait that regrettably seems to appear more prominent with seniority and this is why we have chosen to request a less senior officer mr gindler tells us that your conduct ashore was circumspect and respectful to the feelings of the people even to the point of joining the merriment in a tavernin short sir you have the common touch which we as a people do prize so much stoddert rose gripping the edge of the table and wincing as he did so at kydds concern he gave a low chuckle ah this a souvenir given me by the english at brandywine creek he drew the chair to a more confiding proximity let me be frank mr kydd your position as a kings officer in a warship of the united states navy is anomalous not to say irregular and there are those who would put the worst construction on your presence therefore you are entered as a supernumerary on board specifically a friend of the captain you havent yet the pleasure of an introduction to captain truxtun but he will be advised of you and will be encouraged to take full advantage of your knowledge and experience of the royal navy im sure he will appreciate your assistance he leaned forward further before you go i should like to make it very plain that on your return i would deeply appreciate your sincere appraisal of our efforts do you think this will be possible sir kydd felt resentment building at the way so many seemed to be treating him like a pawn in a higher game then sir it only remains for me to wish you god speed on your voyage you will find lieutenant gindler waiting in the drawing room below was all that necessary a figure moved out from behind a covered escritoire stoddert closed the door i think so the military of any race should not be overburdened with considerations of politics at times murray his political agent could be insensitive to the perceptions of others be that as it may mr stoddert you didnt warn him of the republicanshe should have been told that we have an opposition in congress so lost to honour they would stop at nothing to ruin our navy for crass political gain jefferson has done his worst to try to prevent america reaching for a sure shield against the worldhow can i explain that to a man whose country continues to exist only because of her own power at sea i cannot in any case this talk of subverting crews and so on is probably from unreliable sources and should be discounted what most concerns me are my captains a prickly difficult bunch murray especially truxtun a fighting captain murray interposed strongly oh indeed but as a privateer and pray bring to mind the fluttering in congress there was during the english war on hearing how he set john paul jones himself to defiance over some notion of which ship was to fly some pennant not one to be led easilyand too damn clever by half did you know he was once pressed by the royal navy indeed but thats by the by here is my main hope for ltenant kydd he has no interest in politics hes a tarpaulin mariner and cares only for his ropes and sails he must be intelligent he wouldnt hold a commission else so hell be able to tell me exactly what i want to know nothing could convey better to kydd the continental vastness of the country than the overland coach journey with gindler to baltimore from as fine a fourhorse conveyance as any in england they admired the springtouched verdancy of the deciduous woodland that had replaced the northern conifers the glittering lakes rivers and bluewashed mountains far into the interior at stops to change horses gindler added to kydds impressions he pointed out that beyond the mountains to the west the land was wild stretching for more than sixty degrees of longitude an unimaginable distance more than the atlantic was wide and no one knew what was within it unsettled by the effect of this enormity kydd was glad when they met the cobblestones of baltimore shell be lying in the patuxent river gindler said were nearly ready for sea there was no delaying a fast packet on its way down the chesapeake to norfolk had promised to call at patuxent and their ship the sight of naked masts and yards towering above the low bushy point made kydds pulse quicken the packet rounded the point into the broad opening of a river and there at anchor was the biggest frigate he had ever seen a thing of beauty breathed gindler dont you agree kydd concentrated as they neared the vessel she was distinctive and individual her lines and finish owed nothing to the conservative traditions of oldworld shipwrights and there was an alert purposefulness about her there was much in her that a sailor could love nearly half as big again as the lovely artemis she seemed well armed twentyfours he asked indeed id like to see any frigate that swims try to come up against the old connie gindler said proudly old kydd said wryly observing seamen applying a tar mixture to the last remaining raw timber of the bulwarks well i grant you shes newborn but i have the feeling youll be hearing from us in the future my friend his glance flicked up to the flag with its stars and stripes and he added softly i promise you that kydd had seen far too many ships fitting for sea to be concerned at the turmoil on deck he followed gindler aft to the captains cabin gindler knocked and an irritable bellow bade them enter mr kydd sir said gindler and when the captain looked up in incomprehension he added our supernumerary the captains gaze swivelled to kydd intelligent but hard eyes met his then the man grunted mr kydd yr service and turned back to his papers berth him in the fourth lootenants cabin he wont be sailing he ordered without looking up aye sir said gindler and withdrew with kydd picking their way through men at blocks and ropework some seaming canvas others scaling shotthey headed for the after hatchway i fear i must desert you now tom duty calls ill take you to the wardroom and im sure captain truxtun will want to see you when less pressed welcome back lootenant a freshfaced seaman called with a grin to gindler and waved a serving mallet thanks doyle gindler threw back at kydds raised eyebrows he added a mort of difference from a kings ship i think remember aboard here every man jack is a volunteer on wages and as americans theyre not accustomed to bending the knee kydd did not rise to the bait and privately wondered at their reliability in action when instant obedience was vital the wardroom was almost deserted a black messman glanced at him curiously and left kydd looked about him the raw newness had not yet been overcome to bring individuality at the same time there was an alien air the unfamiliar wood graining the slant of the munnions even the smell striking timber odours the usual comfortable galley smells subtly different no waft of bilge he crossed to the transom seat reassuringly it was still the repository of the ephemera of wardroom life and he picked up a philadelphia newspaper the mercantile advertiser while he awaited truxtuns summons he settled by the midships lanthorn and opened it there was no ochre tax stamp and the paper was of good quality he scanned the front page which was given over to a verbatim setting out of a newly enacted statute the next page however was vigorous and to the point a growing feeling against the french gave colour to the local news and trade intelligence further inside there were advertisements and notices mr kydd capn wants ye he folded the paper tugged his waistcoat into position and followed the messenger apprehensive at meeting those hard eyes again truxtun was standing his back to kydd staring broodily out of the windows of his cabin he turned and gestured to a chair sit yself down mr kydd he himself remained standing ill be plain with you sir mr secretary stoddert thinks to provide me with an aide wholl tell me how they do it in king georges navy i can tell you frankly i dont give a solitary hoot how you do thingsthis is the united states navy and im captain o the constellation and ill do things the way i want his face had the implacability of a slab of oak therefore your presence aboard is a waste for ben stodderts sake ill carry you these few days but ill have you know sir that ill be giving orders that no united states officer or crewman shall hold converse with youi dont want em getting strange ideas agin mine about how a ship o war should be run id be obliged if youd keep your views to yourself in return youre welcome to sit at vittles in the wardroom and the fourths stateroom is yours youll know to keep out from under while the ships being worked and should we meet an enemy youll stay below have i made myself clear sir it was going to be a hard time for kydd he was not introduced when the wardroom sat for dinner he was passed the condiments when he asked but none caught his eye desultory talk went on about progress in the final runup to sea trials in the morning a few lame attempts at humourthis was a wardroom that had not been long together but would coalesce around individuals as the commission went on in the morning he caught gindler now a tautrigged lieutenant about to go on deck im sorry it has to be this way tom he said softly he touched his hat and left for the nervous bustle above kydd hesitated he could see down the length of the deck to the cable party readying the messenger the tierers were moving down the hatchway for their thankless task at bringing in the cable he decided against making an appearance and returned to the wardroom although it was galling to be left in ignorance below decks this was a first voyage with a new ship and a new company and he felt it was not altogether fair to witness the inevitable mistakes and dramas he found a dogeared copy of the north american review and tried to concentrate but the long tiller up against the deckhead began to creak and move as the man at the wheel exercised the helm then piercing calls from the boatswain and his mates told of the hoisting of boats all suffused with the ageold excitement of the outward bound rhythmic singing came from the men forward and he felt a continual low shuddering in the deck that was without doubt the capstan at work a sudden clatter and flurry of shouting would be a fall running away with the men while heavy thumps against the ships side were the boats being brought in and stowed the noises lessened until there was silence they were ready to proceed constellations deck lifted and moved in a deliberate sway it inclined to starboard a heel that paused then returned and steadied to a definite angle which had only one meaning they were under sail and moving through the water kydd threw down the newspapersit was too much he had to catch a glimpse of the sea there were no stern windows in the wardroom so the nearest place to see the ships position was from the captains cabin above he hurried up the companion and through the lobby to the sentry loosely at attention outside the great cabin he muttered have t see out if he craned his neck he could just glimpse the coastline of the patuxent slowly rotating a discernible wake was disturbing the water astern and the frenzied squeal of blocks could be heard even below decks he nodded to the marine and returned to the wardroom he knew vaguely that they should shape course south down chesapeake bay to the sea but without sight of a chart he was in the dark the angle of the deck lessened then he heard another volley of faintly heard shouts and there was a brief hesitation they must be staying about at the right moment the tiller groaned with effort as the wheel went over but after some minutes there was no corresponding sway over to larboard they had missed stays kydd cringed for the officerofthedeck as the unmistakable bull roar of truxtun erupted he was grateful to be out of sight he picked up the review again and flicked the pages after an hour or so the motions were repeated but this time in a smooth sequence the frigate taking up on the opposite tack again the manoeuvre and again an easy transition dare he emerge on deck he waited for a space the angle of heel increased gradually and he guessed that more sail was being loosed kydd could stand it no longer he made his way to the aft companion and mounted the steps to the quarterdeck in the tense scene not a soul looked his way groups of men were at the bitts the base of the masts the forecastle all looking aft to where truxtun stood with folded arms staring up at taut canvas stream he snapped to the men at the taffrail one held the reel of the log high while the logship a triangular drag piece was cast into the sea astern to uncoil the line from the drum it hurtled out at speed and when the sandglass had run its course a lanky midshipman called nip and then eleven knots an a hair over truxtuns expression did not change not good enough ill have the lee stunsls abroad immediately the spring breeze whipped the tops from the waves as kydd edged his way behind truxtun towards the wheel and binnacle under the unblinking eye of the quartermaster he got what he wanteda sight of the compass southsoutheast wind from the west with a touch of north in it ideal bluewater sailing for a frigate no wonder truxtun was letting her have her head they were passing a broad river mouth to starboard with small vessels of all kinds converging at the confluence potomac hissed the midshipman behind him i beg yr pardon kydd said taken offbalance the riverpotomac he busied himself preparing the log for another cast thank ye kydd said quietly with stunsls drawing and royals atop each mast constellation foamed ahead it was remarkable for a new vessel to have achieved such speed so soon the log went out and the excited midshipman yelled a whisker less fourteen it was nothing short of extraordinaryand exhilarating if kydd was not to be an active participant at least he could enjoy the sensation truxtuns eyes darting aloft then aft caught kydds eye kydd smiled broadly in open admiration she goes like a racehorse ayelike a yankee racehorse but there was no rancour in his voice and his grim expression had eased it would be a gratifying thing thought kydd to be in command of a frigate that with her twentyfour pounders could outfight any other and at the same time run or chase as she chose in the darkness of late evening they came to single anchor in the shelter of hampton roads within sight of the broad atlantic the wardroom was abuzz at the splendid showing of their ship and it seemed only right to invite their captain to a hearty dinner kydd sat at the furthest remove from truxtuns place of honour at the head but he was grateful to be present hearing the happy talk about him seeing friendships being forged and strengthened that would stand by them all in the ocean voyages ahead the talk roamed over the chance of war with france seeing the glory of columbia at the chestnut street theatre the right way to treat a halibutit was just the same as his own wardroom but different the dishes came and went and the cloth was drawn blue smoke spiralled to the deckhead glasses were raised and confidences exchanged the chatter rose and fell into a chance silence gindlers voice was raised ah mr kydd you must have seen some sea service in your time pray tell us of it glances were shot at truxtun but he gave no sign that he objected aye well i had th good fortune to take a cruise around th world kydd said thinking quickly a frigate nearly as fine as this he saw this was received well setting a parcel o philosophers on a rock an keeping the cannibals in their canoes at bay he told them of the adventure and when he concluded with the sad wreck of artemis on the azores there was a general stirring of sympathy midshipman porter leaned forward and exclaimed have you b chance seen action a littlecamperdown which was where i got m step kydd wouldnt be drawn on the experience and tried to move on to venice but truxtun himself interrupted your fleet were in bloody mutiny before then a ripple of muttering showed that the dreadful events had been shocking news here as well how did that affect you the warmth of the evening fell away as he forced his mind to deal with the sudden release of memories itmy ship mutinied but i was not hurt would you say the sailors had just cause at spithead they had their reasons and the admiralty granted most and gave a pardon but at the nore he felt his face redden yes at the nore where i was their cause was understandable but they went about it the wrong way truxtun growled theres no treating with mutineers ever the next day a small convoy had yet to assemble so the darkfeatured first lieutenant rodgers was sent ashore to the settlement of norfolk to open a recruiting rendezvous to bring in more volunteers kydd saw truxtun hand him silver at the gangway saying get some music going and grog for all handsindulge their humour in a farewell frolic rodgers grinned and went over the side from forward came the dull blang of scaling charges as they cleared the cannon of rust and debris men squatted on the foredeck as they made up paper cartridges for the small arms while others had the hatches off for the last of the sea stores still coming aboard by the early afternoon activity had died away but truxtun was not satisfied he beat to quarters and for two hours had the great guns exercised big twentyfourpounders given resplendent names by their gun crews thunderer volcano murderer and all plied with ferocity and resolution that night kydd did not sit down with the wardroom captain truxtun had requested the pleasure of his company and he entered the great cabin with some apprehension for they were alone through the stern windows kydd could see dim specks of light on shore a tawny gold issued from the windows of a vessel anchored nearby prettily dappling the water they passed pleasantries while they took a simple meal and the steward swiftly removed the dishes kydds wariness grew with truxtuns politeness do take a chair truxtun said gesturing to a comfortable one near the stern windows he found a cedar box in his writing desk and drew out a cigar do you indulge mr kydd at kydds declining he put it away again youll pardon me mr kydd but youre the darnedest royal navy officer i ever clapped eyes on his frank gaze was unsettling i can tell a smart man when i see one dont have the airs of a kings man but ill guess thats because you come from the people he pondered for a moment so do you hold it right to press men from under their own flag sir if these men are british they have a duty to they are american sir they say they are they hold protections to prove itand these are spat on by english officers yes th rate for an american protection by your consul in liverpool is one guinea and no questions asked truxtun smiled we each have our views the smile disappeared its insulting to our flag for our merchant ships to be stopped and submit to search on the high seas what do ye think of that sir britain is a small island he said carefully trade is all we have to survive we have to protect it and youre rightand damn wrong do you know that most of the trade out of nova scotia is your cargo in our bottoms on its way to ports of the world only a neutral can reach you stop an american and you sink your own trade kydd flushed you asked for viewsi dont know yr details but this i do know if youre doin the same for the french youre makin a hill o money out of it truxtuns expression hardened then a glimmer of a smile showed well as to that it was the first that kydd had heard of the true extent of the french attacks on american shipping and truxtuns tone left no doubt of his feelings if we dont stand on our hind legs and fight em we deserve to be beat he looked directly at kydd youre wondering why we dont declare war so am i he glowered suddenly he got to his feet crossed to his desk and abstracted a folded paper ill show you this he said in an odd voice it came in today it was a single page and bore the seal of the president of the united states kydd looked up in surprise dont worry the whole worlds going to know about this tomorrow truxtun said heavily it began instructions to commanders of armed vessels belonging to the united states given at philadelphia in the twentysecond year of the independence of the said states truxtun leaned over and stabbed a finger at the second paragraph there whereas it is declared by an act of congress that armed vessels sailing under authority or pretence of authority from the french republic have committed depredations on the commerce of the united states in violation of the law of nations and treaties between the united states and the french nation truxtun snorted and what must we do he tapped the last paragraph therefore and in pursuance of the said act you are instructed and directed to seize take and bring into any port of the united states you see its on a shootin war against the french kydd stared in astonishmenteverything had changed but truxtun interrupted him but its not we havent declared war the french havent what kind of peace is it that requires me to fire into a frenchman on sight some sort ofof quasiwar kydd was in no doubt any kind o war is fine this is thumpin good newsand cn i say sir if we both have the same enemy then we must be friends no noi didnt say that i didnt say that at all we just has the same enemy is the truth of it ill be doing my duty at sea and youll be doing yours as you see it he took back the paper if its any clearer he said gruffly i mean to say i hope we meet at sea one dayas equals mr kydd the convoy was finally ready to sail showers blustered in from the north in curtains of white vivid against the sullen grey of the sky and lines of foamcrested waves advanced seaward a sullen thump came from forwardthe signal gun for departure two cutters moved about the dozen merchantmen cajoling threatening shepherding it was so similar to kydds sailing from falmouth yet there was a difference the lift of a head the ringing shouts of the petty officers the brazen size of the flag at the mizzen peak the length of the pennant at the mainmasthead this was a unique experience to be aboard the first frigate commissioned in the united states navy and the first to put to sea on a war cruise kydd stood out of the way to the side buffeted by the wind and with rain dripping from his hat brim he was in no mood to go below although he was a spectator he knew that no one would forget the day a navy brought in just months from nothing to one that could execute the will of the nation from helpless acquiescence to a sea force that would now go against the countrys enemyand conceivably within hours he looked forward gindler strode ahead proudly disdaining oilskins over his lieutenants uniform to starboard the square lofty lighthouse of cape henry lay abeam with constellation in the lead the convoy left the haven of chesapeake bay and sailed for the open ocean to the east and all that lay beyond standing out to sea the frigate lifted to the swell new men staggered to the businesslike roll while others sniffed the wind as if eager to be out to seaor was it in anticipation of bloody action the merchant ships bunched together close to the american frigate there had been talk ashore of a pair of big privateers lying in wait and selfpreservation was a strong motive for keeping station the weather moderated as they made their offing although constellation needed only doublereefed topsails to stay with her labouring convoy kydd walked forward keenly appreciative of the motion of a frigate once more and interested indeed in the weatherliness of the american after the sociability of the dinner he was now greeted with cautious nods and the occasional smileeven the intense lieutenant rodgers touched his hat to him at one point when the land had been sunk and a tossing wilderness of empty ocean had been reached the convoy dispersed some to the barbadoes others to dublin and london thousands of miles of hard sailing with small crews with the constant fear of sighting the sails of a predator but constellation was free now to soar mr kydd truxtun snapped as though struck by a sudden thought we shall be cruising south tomorrow the rest of the quarterdeck was listening intently therefore i believe it would be most expedient for you then to take your leave from this vessel i shall stop a philadelphia packet for your convenience sir kydd had taken to standing beside the lee helmsman willing the ship on feeling her motion through the water and turned in surprise erwhy of course captain it was a disappointment not to see the frigate at her best and despite the circumstances of his passage there was something about this ship and her crew in the dogwatches as the ship shortened sail for the night kydd lingered on deck then went below for his last dinner aboard the constellation he went to his accustomed place at the end of the table but found a black steward there if y please sah he said and pointed to the head of the table where all the american officers stood with glasses grinning at him come n set tom one called kydd did as he was asked and took the chair normally occupied by the first lieutenant bemused just wanted t wish you god speed mr kydd rodgers said proffering a glass kydd took it and lifted it to them your very good health gentlemen he called touched beyond measure the group broke into warm conversation and as dinner was brought he found himself talking as amiably as any more wine more dishes kydd felt a rush of feeling that came out as hot words of admiration for their fine ship their spirit their future he sat with flushed face and beamed at them all no cool talk of the london season not a word about foxhunting or estates in the country this was good sturdy conversation about horses prospects of prize money scandalous theatre gossiphere he could safely say his piece without fear of being thought a boor frm kentucky friend youll hanker after this bourbon whiskey was added to the list of kydds american experiences did i ever tell ye of gibraltar now theres a rare place one thunderin great rock happy and muzzy he did not notice that truxtun was in the wardroom until he suddenly saw him sitting at the other end of the table he frozebut truxtun raised his glass ye share the same forename as me tom and id like to say that should you find it in your heart to become an american there could be a berth aboard constellation if you choose kydd turned in to his tiny cot unable to control his whirling thoughts an american thomas paine kydd citizen of the united states gentleman of the land and lieutenant of the united states navy it was not impossiblehe had no ties no wife and family back in england excitement seized him and his eyes opened wide in the darkness why not start a new life in a country where there did not seem to be any difference between gentleman and commoner a nation that seemed to have so much land and so few people opportunity unlimited but he held the kings commission would he be betraying his country in her time of need what about other officers in foreign navies well they had been allowed to resign their commissions to take service and was there not one in the russian navy who was now a grand duke and above all if he were in the american navy he would be fighting the kings enemies even if it was under another flag and there were so many english seamen already servinghe had heard aboard constellation the accents of devon the north london he could always be among his countrymen if he felt lonely they had made the choice even if many had chosen desertion could he he tossed and turned until finally sleep came mercifully to claim him it seemed only minutes later when he jerked awake he knew that he had heard a cannon shot and sat up almost immediately the urgent rattle of a drum beating to quarters set his heart hammering kydd dropped clumsily out of his cot and reached for his clothing nearby thumping feet sounded urgently he struggled into breeches and shirt flung on his coat and raced barefoot up the companion to the upper deck in the cold of daybreak out of the thin drifting rain ahead the dark shape of a ship lay across their path constellations helm was put up to bear away even in the bleak grey halflight it was plain that they had come upon a manowar a frigate who had instantly challenged them get out of it damn you truxtun bawled catching sight of kydd get below there was something about this enemy frigatekydd knew he had seen her before now sir truxtun bellowed it was the characteristic oddcoloured staysail the abrupt curve of her beakhead but where her colours flew directly away and were impossible to make out the two signal flags of her challenge flickered briefly into life as they were jerked down and her challenge unanswered her broadside thundered out in the seconds that the balls took to reach them kydd remembered but before he could speak truxtun roared get that english bastard below this instant shot slammed past hideously gouting the sea and sending solid masses of water aboard one slapped through a sail kydd urged truxtun sir hold yr fire for gods sakeshes a british ship incredulous truxtun stared at him she fired on the american flag shes got to be a frenchman damn you thats ceres thirtytwo id stake m life on it but how fast would ceres take to reload and send another betteraimed broadside an english ship truxtuns roar carried down the deck and pale faces turned then darkened in anger menacing growls rising to shouts ill make em regret this mr rodgers do ye want war with england as well kydd shouted livid truxtun hesitated hoist yr white flag surrender are you insane noflag o parley all it needed was for one overhasty gunner on either side and the day would end in bloody ruin for a frozen moment everything hung then truxtun acted white flag to the main mr rodgers he growled hed better be coming with an explanation truxtun snapped to kydd as a boat under a white flag advanced a lieutenant clearly visible in the sternsheets sir be s good as to see it from his point o view his private signals have not been answered and as far as he knows there is no united states navy with a ship o this force you have t be a frenchy tryin a deception truxtun gave an illnatured grunt and waited for the boat when it drew near kydd saw the lieutenant stand and look keenly about him as the bowman hooked on as he mounted the side angry shouts were hurled at him by seamen which truxtun made no attempt to stop now before i blow you out of the water explain why you fired into me sir truxtun said hotly as the lieutenant climbed over the bulwark he had intelligent eyes and answered warily sir the reason is apparent you did not answer my ships legitimate challenge and er we have no information about an american frigate at sea our conclusion must be obvious before truxtun could answer he added and remembering we are under a flag of truce sir i believe i might respectfully demand that you offer me some form of proof of your national statusif you please be damned to your arrogance sir truxtun punched a fist towards the huge american flag above them there is all the proof anyone needs shouts of agreement rang out and seamen advanced on the quarterdeck the lieutenant held his ground but his hand fell to his sword kydd held up a hand and stepped forward ltenant a word if y please the lieutenant looked in astonishment at kydds bare legs his civilian coat and breeches soaked and clinging to him er yes drawing him aside kydd spoke urgently im ltenant kydd of hms tenacious supernumerary aboard i have t tell ye now this is a united states frigate true enough and no damn frenchy the lieutenants disdain turned to cold suspicion youll pardon my reservations sir he said giving a short bow but can you offer me any confirmation of your identity kydd pulled his wet coat about him a great deal hung on his next words very well i can do that he said softly off devils island not a month ago ceres was there when resolution hangs out a signal to tackin succession tenacious makes a fool of herself i was that signal lieutenant the lieutenant stared then smiled i really believe you must be he turned to truxtun and removed his hat sir you have my condolences that this unhappy incident took place but cannot concede any responsibility this will be a matter for our governments to resolve good day sir the furious truxtun did not reply glowering at the man as he solemnly replaced his hat and went down the side to his boat followed by yells of defiance what if it had been tenacious instead kydds thoughts raceda shipoftheline thundering out her broadside how could two proud navies cruise the seas without it happening again they were at war with the same enemythat was the main point all else was pride sir truxtun drew a deep breath and kydd went on quickly be so kind as t honour me with a minute of yr timein private truxtun turned to rodgers stand down the men he stalked over to kydd and stared at him very welland then for your own safety sir im confining you to your cabin until youre off this ship thank you sir kydd felt he was being carried forward in a rush of destiny that could not be stopped yet his mind was protecting him from the enormity of what he was contemplating by an odd detachment from reality if i might go t my cabin for a moment he was back quickly and went with truxtun into his great cabin closing the door behind him one minute sir captainthis is a madness we must fight tgether not each other so im now going t trust you with my honour an i know its not going t be misplaced he could read nothing in truxtuns stony face sir he gulped as he felt in his coat and withdrew a small pocket book sir this is a copy of our secret signals if you are challenged by a british ship you may safely reply with the correct private signal of the day here and at night challenge and response here take it sir an i know youll protect its confidentiality with your own honour if the enemy ever got hold of its secrets the ships of the royal navy would be at their mercy truxtun stared at the book and then at kydd god rot me but youre a brave man mr kydd he said softly he took the book and slipped it into his own coat itll be safe with me he held out his hand i hope you do not suffer for this but what youve done he clapped his hand on kydds shoulder an honour to know you sir chapter kydd had been able to reassure stoddert with what he had seen and liston had listened to his account of a new player on the world maritime stage with grave attention accepting his considered opinion of the new navy as an effective force but now kydd must face his day of reckoning and his return to halifax was charged with dread at how he would be received he knew why he had acted as he did but the admiralty might regard it as no less than treason leaving the deadly sambro ledges well to leeward the packet hed caught back finally rounded the grey rocks of chebucto head for the run in to halifax harbour he had been away only days but it seemed like months soon kydd was standing on water street pier he knew exactly what he had to do he left his baggage at the shipping office and hurried down to the watermens steps to hire a wherry to take him to the flagship at anchor the officeroftheday quickly got rid of kydd to the flaglieutenant i have to wait upon the admiral immediately kydd said tightly you have an appointment of course im just this hour returned from th united states the officer snorted in contempt good god mr kydd you know better than to come aboard hoping the admiral is at leisure to see you leave your reasons with me and ltenant unless you take me t admiral vandeput this instant youll rue it an that is my solemn promise very well be it on your own head what ship you say the officer knocked softly on the door to the admirals day cabin lieutenant kydd sir hms tenacious no appointment but he seems monstrous anxious to see you kydd entered the admiral was at his desk frowning his secretary standing nearby with papers yes sir i have a matter of th greatest importance kydds voice came out thickly vandeput looked at him steadily then glanced at his secretary go he snapped then turned back to kydd youre back from america what is it it took but small minutes to convey the gist of his experiences ending with the final shocking clash therefore sir i saw that if it happens again theres chance fr a mortal fight or vandeputs expression hardened and then kydd took hold of all his courage i gave captain truxtun m own signal book which has all th private signals for your fleet there was an appalled silence then the admiral said softly youre saying this american captain now has possession of all our secret signals aye sir said kydd trying to keep the tremor from his voice well done ssir a good officerlike solution ltenant always worried me americans at sea in a ship o force sharing the same ocean without we have a form o cooperation the politicos wont go at it out o pride but now weve forced their hands i can see how this can go further mr kydd as i say well done sir weak with reaction kydd swayed oh i see its been a fatiguing journey for ye mr kydd the admiral said solicitously do sit and ill ring for a brandy kydd stared moodily at the town from the decks of tenacious he had been welcomed back by a newly respectful wardroom but after a while conversations turned once again to the social scene the whole town was mesmerised by the impending visit of the duke of schweigerei elder son of the archduke of austria which would climax in a grand reception and banquet given by his royal highness prince edward in the dukes honour in view of the importance attached to the country for its role in pitts coalitions every officer would be expected to attend the glittering occasion renzi had tried to be interested in kydds adventure but he was clearly preoccupied with some personal matter and kydd found himself once more at a loose end the seductive thought on his mind was of what might be service in the new navy of a vigorous young land no more would he hear of lords and estates foxhunting and the season kydd stirred uncomfortably and noticed the master with a large notebook and folded chart checking something over the side nothing amiss mr hambly it was unusual to see the master at work on deck in harbour nay sir nothing t worry you on he said then seeing kydds interest he explained further it seemed that the new admiralty hydrographic department had issued instructions to all sailing masters that anchorages they might from time to time visit should be surveyed by hand leadline from a ships boat with a view to verifying the accuracy of charts now in the course of preparation in england a fine and proper thing said kydd every mariner was at the mercy of his charts whether dependable or false and any endeavour that could lessen the fearful risks of navigation was a service to mankind where are you going t start why mr kydd its kind in ye to enquire i thought t try the bedford basinthere through the narrows an youll find a fine body o water twice the size of halifax harbour there a nearly perfect landlocked haven a fleet could safely ride out a storm there this was really worthwhilean exercise of professional sea skills with a purpose kydd brightened mr hambly id like t do some of this work mself would you be s kind as to show me on the chart kydd had chosen to begin his first line of soundings across the widest point of the basin to establish some sort of bottom profile it was satisfying work and congenial to the spirit real skill was needed to hold the octant laterally to establish the bearings ashore and provide the exact position of the pinnace poulden in the bows would send the handlead plummeting down singing out in cadence the exact depth of water told by the marks kydd noted the time carefully later there would be work with tide tables to establish the true depth corrected for the state of tide then referenced to the chart datum kydd was so engrossed in the work that for a space he had forgotten his concern about the banquet it had been heavily hinted at by captain houghton that every officer would not only attend but with a suitable lady to those who had attained a degree of intimacy with the gentle reaches of haligonian society it would be a matter of choice for kydd who had not only been away but felt awkward and illatease in wellborn company it was a trial he realised he would probably end up with the insipid daughter of the vicar with whom he was on nodding terms to the amusement of the more senior in the wardroom he forced his mind back to the task at hand surprisingly their first traverse reached the twentyfathom limit of a handlead less than a third the way across such deep water perhaps he should stay with the shoreline and first establish a fortyfoot line of depth along it this being of most interest to a bigship navigator it was not difficult to pick up the mark again and astute reading of the characteristics at the edge of the shoreline soon had a useful number of fortyfoot soundings carefully pencilled in but for the unfortunate narrows at the entrance restricting access to squarerigged vessels whenever the winds were in the north it was spacious and deep enough to take the entire channel fleet at single anchor an impressive body of water something ashore caught kydds eye a figure in white standing watching he ignored it and continued with his work they drew abreast the figure was still there as he watched he realised it was a woman waving a handkerchief she waved again an exaggerated movement someone wants t speak sir poulden volunteered aye well perhaps we should see what she wants oars give way together the boat headed inshore the wooded slopes leading down to the water looked immaculately cared for and they saw the edge of a building peeping out from blossomladen trees closer in kydd noticed a discreet landingstage and headed for it the woman made no move to descend to it still standing and watching from her vantagepoint cursing under his breath kydd threw a rope ashore and pulled himself up to the little jetty he was hardly dressed for meeting ladies in his worn sea uniform but he clambered up to where she was waiting yes madam oh i was watching you you see she said her voice soft and prettily accented with french kydd remembered himself and snatched off his hat dressed for the garden she was in a white gown and beribboned straw hat she was also strikingly beautiful her large dark eyes adding an appealing wistfulness and i thought ave you lost somethingyou look for it so long she seemed a touch older than him and had a disconcertingly worldlywise air not at all madam we conduct a hydrographical survey o the coastline she was probably one of the sad band of royalist refugees who had settled in nova scotia he conjectured although apparently from a wealthy family oh er might i present mself ltenant kydd royal navy enchantee lieutenant her bob coincided with kydds sturdy bow then you do not know me no madam er you have th advantage of me she contemplated him then said i am therese bernardinemongenet and zis is where i live she gestured gracefully up the slopes at a loss kydd bowed again i was taking refreshment in ze garden perhaps you would care to take some lemonade wiz me and tell me about your hydrogcally lieutenant kydd accepted graciously the boats crew would be reliable with poulden and would not object to an hours leisure they walked together up a winding path past little summerhouses with gilded latticework and bells tinkling on their pagodalike roofs it was the most enchanting and sumptuous garden kydd had ever seen atop a bluff overlooking the water cunningly nestled among trees there was a twostorey wooden mansion vaguely italian in style and on the grass lawn below a clothcovered table with jug and glass a moment she summoned a maid and spoke rapidly in french to her then turned back to kydd so tell me what is it you are doing kydd was uncomfortable in his old uniform but he thawed at her warmth and by the time the maid returned with another glass and a cake stand he was chuckling at her misapprehensions of the sea service rousin good cakes he said having sampled one of the tiny lemonflavoured shells ah ze madeleines she said sadly the old king louis is favourite it did not seem right to dwell on past griefs so kydd said brightly have you heard the duke o shwygery is t be honoured with a banquet an were all invited to attend your husband will have an invitation o course i am not married she said quietly oh im sorry madam he said ahthats not t mean im sorry youre not married at all i er please forgive forgiven msieur she said gently will i see you there he asked hopefully she looked at him steadily i have not been invited kydds heart went out to her so elegant beautiful and serene no man had begged her hand for the occasion unwilling to risk the mortification of being declinedindeed in the normal way he would never be noticed by a lady of such quality it was so close to the event it was more than probable there would be no more offers forthcoming and she would be obliged to stay at home any gentleman madam i am not engaged for the occasion it would be my particular honour t escort you should ye be inclined there was a fraction of hesitation then she smiled i would be delighted to accept lieutenant she murmured and the smile moved to her eyes what do ye think nicholas said kydd rotating in his new fulldress uniform coat the white facings with gold buttons against the deep blue were truly magnificent and he looked forward to making his appearance in it dare i enquire dear fellow if you have a lady of suitable distinction marked out for the occasion renzi asked doubtfully i have kydd was going to give nothing away before the night all he had to do was take a ships boat to the landingstage then make his way to the house therese had said she would find a carriage it is at government house renzi stressed and although we shall not be prominently seated you do understand we will be under eye possibly of the prince himself thank you nicholas i will try not to disappoint and yrself i have my hopes dear fellow the day of the banquet arrived captain houghton addressed his officers in the wardroom as to the seriousness of the occasion the honour of the ship the correct forms of address to the prince and to an austrian duke and duchess and the probable fate of any officer who brought shame to his ship later in the day tysoe jostled with others to begin the long process of bringing his officer to a state of splendour a stiff white shirt topped with a black stock at the neck under the high standup collar of the coat gleaming buckled shoes over white stockings and immaculate tight white breeches it had been shockingly expensive and kydd had borrowed heavily against his future prize money from minotaure but he was determined to make a showing one by one the other officers departed some to share carriages others to walk up the hill renzi left with a troubled glance at his friend kydd trod the same path as before the earlysummer evening tinting the garden with a delicious enchantment a footman waited and escorted kydd to an open carriage madame will attend you presently he intoned therese emerged and kydd was left struggling for words there must be few in halifax who could possibly reach her heights of fashionable elegance he took refuge in a deep bow as she came towards him in a fulllength highwaisted ivory gown perilously lowcut and trimmed fetchingly in blue her elaborate coiffure woven with pearls and a single ostrich feather sweeping up imperiously bonsoir mon lieutenant an such a clement evening nestce pas with the footman holding open the door of the carriage kydd helped her up her long gloved hand in his it seemed so unreal and all he could think of was that he must not let down cecilia after all her patient tutoring on gentility the chaise lurched into motion keeping to a sedate pace kydd sat bolt upright next to his lady thankfully the grinding of the wheels made conversation an effort and he concentrated on the journey imagining the effect on his shipmates when he and his lady were announced as they approached the town he was given a measure of what to expect by the reaction of passersby some gaped others pointed kydd swelled with pridethey must make a striking couple indeed the carriage clattered along the streets and headed for a large building between two churches illuminated in every window and with the sound of fine music coming from within they drew up outside among the crowd of sightseers and kydd was gratified once again by the impression he and his lady made he bowed graciously this way and that then hastened to assist therese down he offered his arm and they swept into government house through a lane of gaping onlookers his confidence soared inside he glimpsed the levee room packed with glittering personages in animated talk jewellery sparkling in candlelight and a military concert band in full flow in the corner a bewigged majordomo at the door hesitated er madame therese bernardinemongenet kydd said importantlyit had taken hours to learn and ltenant thomas kydd the man looked petrified possibly this was his first important occasion kydd thought nevertheless he coughed and bawled resolutely lieutenant thomas kydd andand madame therese bernardinemongenet with her hand on his arm kydd stepped into the room if only cecilia could see him now every face in the room turned towards them conversations died the bands efforts faded uncertainly kydds head was spinning this was what it was to be in high society you will introduce me therese whispered overflowing with happiness and with the broadest smile kydd turned to his left and approached the nearest group who started with apprehension he bowed deeply to the elderly gentleman and made a grand introduction the mans wife curtsied staring wideeyed at therese kydd moved on graciously trying to think of suitable smalltalk he knew he would never forget the nightor the effect of a truly beautiful woman on society around them conversations stopped then picked up again as they progressed down the room to the side he saw houghton staring at them as if at a ghost next to him stood bampton clearly in shock my captain kydd said happily to therese as they approached houghton seemed overcome at the introduction gobbling something indistinct but therese clearly delighted bestowed on him special attention and offered her hand to be kissed as he watched his captain grovel before a grand lady kydd believed the evening could promise nothing more satisfying prince edward stood in the centre of the room surrounded by aidesdecamp courtiers and military men in gleaming regimentals kydd summoned every ounce of courage and led therese over to him yr royal highness may i be allowed t introduce madame therese bernardinemongenet thereses graceful curtsy was long held an myself ltenant thomas kydd o hms tenacious he bowed as low as he could lieutenant tell me true have you been in halifax long the prince had an aristocratically hard face kydd had heard stories of his unbending attitude to military discipline his earlymorning parades and merciless justice not long yr royal highness an much o that in the united states oh i see well i wish you a pleasant evening mr kydd thank you sir kydd mumbled remembering to back away he had survived and he turned to grin at therese a fanfare of trumpets sounded from the other room announcing the banquet an immediate move was made towards the connecting door but kydd remembered to keep clear as a junior officer he would certainly be bringing up the rear he stayed to one side nodding pleasantly to those whose eyes strayed towards him and therese until eventually he judged it time to enter the room was huge in the distance a long table was raised on a dais the centre occupied by the prince and honoured guests behind them two servants gently fanned the principal guests with enormous ostrich feathers tastefully coloured in red white and blue lesser mortals occupied the long tables in rows from the front and as he had suspected he was shown to one near the rear to his delight he saw renzi seated there next to him was a voluble woman with pasty skin and a profusion of cheap jewellery who tugged incessantly at his sleeve renzi looked up at kydd and stared stricken at him as if the world had been turned upsidedown gleefully kydd made his introduction indicating to therese that this was his particular friend but when he made to seat his lady he was interrupted by a courtier sir his royal highness commands you and madame to join him he murmured discreetly indicating the prince who was beckoning heart thudding kydd turned to renzi and muttered his excuses he wended his way with therese through the tightly packed tables feeling all eyes upon him hearing animated murmuring following in their wake they mounted the dais and approached prince edward who leaned back to speak ah so kind of you to join us his eyes did not move from therese as he continued i dont think youve met hoheit herzog schweigerei his wife the herzogin adelheid sir lieutenant kydd and madame therese bernardinemongenet the evening proceeded over the wild duck kydd found himself explaining sea service to the prince the saddle of mutton saw him recounting his american sojourn to the sharpfeatured duke while he was helping therese to another pompadour cream he looked out over the massed tables below them somewhere in the hazy distance renzi captain houghton and the rest were looking enviously to the dais at prince edward therese bernardinemongenetand thomas kydd at last the banquet drew to a close the prince rose conversation stilled and there was a sudden scraping of chairs as everyone stood up one by one the members of the high table descended following the prince as he processed out affably nodding to the bobs and curtsies as he passed looks of admiration and envy shot at kydd who smiled back lazily in the foyer the prince turned to kydd lieutenant you will no doubt be returning to your ship pray do not stand on ceremony for madamei will personally see she returns home safely with a wry smile kydd bowed and lieutenant i will not forget your service to me this night therese looked at kydd she crossed to him and kissed him firmly on both cheeks i will not forget this evening bonne chance mon ami they left kydd watched the princes carriage depart thereses last glance back and fond wave the rest of the guests issued out noisily and it seemed the whole of halifax wanted to meet him make his acquaintance be seen with him captain houghton appeared staring wordlessly at kydd and shaking his head slowly before he moved on adams came up and insisted on taking his hand damme if that wasnt the finest stroke of the age he said sincerely finally renzi emerged full of the deepest delight kydd said casually then was she not a suitable lady brother we must walk for a spell renzi did not bother to introduce the lady with him who pouted at the slight into your coach mdear he said firmly i shall follow when they were alone on the street renzi turned to him my dear fellow he began then stopped my dear chap where can i begin he paced about in frustration ignoring the admiring glances passersby were throwing at kydd in polite societyin the highest societydamn it all what you did was either inspired deviltry or the purest ignorance and all halifax believes it the first nicholas you talk in riddles if youre just envious tomif you must know this is what you did you invited the princes mistress to a banquet hosted by the prince himself theresejulie kydd fell back in dismay the flush drained from his face at the very least it was the ruin of his career a spectacular end to his promising beginnings after the exaltation of earlier it was agonising not at all renzi struggled for the words the world believes you knew that julie appears at lesser occasions the prince having a particular taking for her but at affairs of stateforeign potentatesshe must not be seen to the princes great pleasure you produced her for him at this occasion under the unimpeachable courtly pretence of not knowing her situation he gave a low laugh there must be many haughty matrons of halifax who have been put sadly out of countenance tonightbut many more gentlemen whose admiration for you is unbounded just consideryou now have the ear and attention of a prince of the blood royal you are made in society you you have but to claim the fruits of your cunning wheres renzi it was late morning in the wardroom and he had still not appeared kydd had put it down to overindulgence but his friends cabin was empty renzi i do believe he must still be at mannings tavernhe was well away when i saw him pringle drawled a tavern kydd threw on his coat and clapped on his hat in all the time he had known renzi he had never once seen him in liquor surely he was not a spurned lover the woman whom he had seen at the banquet impossible mannings was often frequented by officers but kydd could not find renzi in the highbacked chairs of the taphouse or in any of the more secluded public rooms discreet enquiry yielded that he was still in his room and furthermore had sent for two bottles since midnight and was unaccountably alone disturbed kydd went up the stairs knocking at the door several times did not produce a result nicholas he called softly i know youre there let me in brother about to knock again he heard renzis muffled voice thank you for your visit but im indisposed i shall return aboard later if bein tosticated is what ails ye then its a poor shab as wont see his friend there was a silence then a rattling and the door opened kydd nearly laughed at the frowsy bleariness of his friend but kept a grave expression and entered he sat in a chair next to the bed can i be of service to ye he asked neutrally renzi glared balefully at him then he groaned and lolled back in the other chair im all undone i see you shall have the truth of itbut first a drink kydd sat up alarmed but renzi reached for the water pitcher on the dresser and upended it gulping the water noisily he wiped his mouth and tried to grin ah let us say i have been the unwitting sport of venus the plaything of cupid in fine i have to admit to being gulled in full measure aye said kydd trying not to show his considerable interest a charming nymph a young sprig of society whose name will be known in the highest reaches of haligonian gentility she it was whowho has refused me thatthat woman at the banquet kydd said appalled not her said renzi testily a mere quicumque vult a cyprian taken up for the occasion noi speak of a young woman of grace and talents a perfect specimen of spirited maidenhood i met her at the admirals rout and since then have been seen in her company at many a polite occasion a sparkling companion then the sap unwonted rising high i pressed my attentions on her would not be denied he trailed off staring disconsolately at the wall and then it grieves me to say it but sheshe yes it seems that the young lady ishow shall we phrase it of the sapphic persuasion at kydds blank look he added wearily this is to mean that she prefers the company of women to that of men in all its forms then quite so for her i have been but a toy a necessary social ornament it has been asalutary experience nicholas i and is now most firmly a thing of the past renzi concluded bleakly kydd subsided it explained renzis distraction his absences and it was certain he would appreciate neither sympathy nor pity renzi drew a deep breath and leaning forward said therefore we shall speak of your transmogrification my said kydd carefully youre clearly not fully aware of what has happened and by that i do not mean simply your appearance with madame therese he held his head and closed his eyes for a space consider this your action in bringing julie to the banquet is seen as a very clever piece of theatre to bring yourself to the attention not only of society but of prince edward himself a coup that has all halifax abuzz now what that is telling the world is that you must be accounted a superior player in the arts of society and it would go well with any who can boast your acquaintance this is my wager with youyoull have more invitations in the next week than you can possibly accept in a year but i dont let me continue this is a triviality a vaporous nonsense compared to its true significance he took another pull at the water pitcher and looking directly at kydd continued tom dear chap what is signified is that the forms of politeness so well expressed by john locke however requisite in the salons and courts must always yield to that of true character in polite company in vino veritas then i was wrong i freely admit it you are your own man now with a character and reputation that will only grow you dont need airs and my clever wordsand neither do you need to bandy empty talk about foxhunting or the season for youve established a manly character of your own which dare i say it is above such nonsense my dear fellowgo forth and conquer know that you can match any gentleman for wit and reputation and at last take your place in society renzi closed his eyes and leave me to die in peace kydd rose noiselessly and tiptoed away renzi was right invitations arrived by the dozen for lieutenant kydd in the days that followed at one point captain houghton came to him personally with a mumbled request that he grace an evening with him at the attorney general uniackes known like cunard for his four daughters and a power in the land fortunately kydd found his diary free for that night and renzi was right about the other thing the wardroom continued to talk country estates and vauxhall gardens but when kydd came in with an appreciation of the new united states navy or a light observation on signals he was listened to respectfully getting laughs in all the right places it was a heady discovery that he was free at last free of the demons of inferiority the fear of being seen as socially gauche the oakenheaded tarpaulin an embarrassment now he could hold his own in any society nicholas are you at liberty tonight it would give me th greatest pleasure to sup with youat pontacs at seven kydd was determined to do his friend proud do have more o the roast lark theyre so particular in the cooking here he said and i hope the lafite is up to your expectations he added anxiously he piled renzis plate high and insisted on pouring the wine renzi was unusually silent which kydd put down to his recent experience it needed all of an hour before he finally spoke his mind there is an observation i feel obliged to make thomas bearing as it does on our long friendship he weighed his words carefully an unkind observer might remark that in our lowerdeck existence we had a peculiar need one for the other ithat in my term of exile there was one of intelligence uncommon good sense and enquiring nature to lighten my durance youmy trifles of philosophy and intellectual penetrations could enable you to rise above the limitations of your surroundings that same observer could then say in perfect truth that those needs are now concluded you have succeeded in all the accomplishments of gentility and the sea profession so i am no longer needed kydd slammed down his glass stuff n nonsense nicholas he saw renzis eyes glitterit seemed it was costing him much to speak as he had and i renzi continued with some difficulty i have had my choice of wranglers in reason the company of my peers in breeding the sweets of society but in cleaving to these it grieves me to recall how i have so shamelessly neglected our friendshipall for the sake of the evanescent is this then an end to our association logic is a stern mistress and pronounces that with the extinction of need we must necessarily part go our own ways a pox on yr damned logic kydd said angrily as a philosopher youre nothin but a doublebarrelled copperbottomed fool do ye think i dont still want you as a friend share the laughs n pains o life enjoy while we can raise up yr glass nicholas an lets drink to friendship renzi lifted his head a reluctant halfsmile spread and he replied i willbut this time its a friendship of equals glasses clinked when they had regained composure kydd fumbled in his coat er nicholas id value yr opinion which o these invitations do ye think we should accept authors note a question i am often asked is how long does the research for each book take that is a difficult thing to quantify because in some ways i suppose i have been unconsciously doing it all my life during my time at sea absorbing the universals all mariners hold dear and ingesting material from countless maritime books both fiction and nonfiction that ive been drawn to since a very early age the proportion of my time now devoted to research must come close to fifty per cent but i have to say its an aspect of being a writer that i particularly enjoy research for the kydd series has provided an opportunity to go down many fascinating paths in search of some arcane fact or otherand this book has proved no exception i found myself corresponding with dr david green at the usda forest service about the specific gravity of swamp oaks this enabled me to send kydd on his nighttime sabotage mission against the french frigate a chance discovery of an old pilot book of kydds time in a falmouth museum had me enquiring of the august royal institute of navigation one of their members dr mark breach confirmed the antique ruleofthumb about the moons meridian that saved kydd and his boat crew in the fog and while on the subject of chance what were the odds of my coming across a signal book actually belonging to a lieutenant on the north american station at exactly the time when kydd learns his craft as a signal lieutenant retired paymaster commander william evershed generously extended a loan of the precious family relic for me to study research has enriched my life in another way too it has made me many new friends who also are irresistibly drawn to the sea two in particular have a special connection with quarterdeck i first met ship modeller robert squarebriggs when i visited canadas maritime provinces in he shared his love of the boreal wilderness and i hope in this book that i have done justice to his infectious enthusiasm for his native land tyrone martin is an erudite scholar of the dawn of us navy history and a former captain of old ironsides his many insights into this fascinating period will again be invaluable when kydd returns to north america which he assuredly will i feel some degree of guilt in not being able to acknowledge everyone i consulted in the process of writing this book but they all have my deep thanks however i could not omit mentioning the three wonderfully professional women in my lifemy wife and creative partner kathy my literary agent carole blake and my editor jackie swift between them they contrive to keep the hassles of the modern world at bay allowing me to give full rein to my creative juices ready for the next adventure julian stockwin was sent at the age of fourteen to ts indefatigable a tough seatraining school he joined the british navy at fifteen transferred to
