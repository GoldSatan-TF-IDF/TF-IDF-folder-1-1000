marion lennox adopted twins the third book in the parents wanted series chapter one the marital order in bay beach was thoroughly satisfactory for all concerned matt was marrying charlotte erin with her five unwanted children was happily single then the twins bomb exploded matt mckay was one of australias best known cattle breeders he was also running late but he wasnt so late that charlotte would be annoyed hed been paying a visit to a friend in hospital now he was headed to charlottes for dinner he was also headed for commitment well why not charlotte was beautiful immaculately groomed and extremely pleasant company she understood his farming needs acclaimed as the best hostess in the district shed been loyal to matt for almost twenty years back in bay beach hospital matts friend nick daniels was recovering nicely from his appendix operation matt had left him comfortably settled nicks wife and children pandering to his every whim the visit had made matt think life should include pandering hed decided hed avoided it so far but it was hard not to feel jealous of nicks domestic bliss despite his lost appendix nick couldnt be more content which was why matt had detoured via the jewellers something schmaltzy came onto the radiosomething about love and snowwhite hair and faithfulness forever matt glanced down at the velvet box tucked into his map compartment and he pushed away the last of his qualms marriage to charlotte it had always seemed logical and maybe thats why hed taken so long to get around to asking hed had a few flings in his youth but charlotte was always calmly waiting for him to return from what she teasingly called his nonsense ten years ago her possessiveness had driven him nuts but now maybe she was right maybe they were suited and he wouldnt mind a kid or two nick was managing fatherhood beautifully matt decided thinking of the family group hed left at the hospital with two gorgeous kids and another on the way nick and shanni were blissfully happy could he and charlotte be the same would charlotte even want children charlotte wasnt a baby sort of person but if she could produce little charlottes children who were neat and practical and knew what was right that might be a problem he wouldnt mind a bit of spirit in any child he had he grinned to himself acknowledging that he hadnt been a childhood angel in fact hed driven his mother to distraction but kids were a fiftyfifty gene split hed spent most of his childhood with his father and if charlotte thought she could breed children whod wipe their feet and read their story books quietly then maybe he could persuade her to give parenthood a try they could be hers indoors and his outdoorswhich would be a childhood just like his had been so so tonight hed finally ask her to marry him he decided as he drove charlottewards after all it was an excellent night apart from a bomb waiting in the wings and at home number three of bay beach orphanage things were also excellent erin douglas home mother had all her charges in bed by eight which was no mean feat the baby marigold had gone out like a light bless her she was showing every sign that shed make her adoptive parents blissfully happy five year old tess and eight year old michael a brother and sister whod been placed in the home while their mother was ill had gone to sleep on cue no problems there andamazinglythe twins had gone meekly to bed when told when shed checked ten minutes ago they had their eyes closed and seemed out for the count this was truly amazing it was worth a glass of wine to celebrate erin decided there werent too many nights in a house mothers life when all her charges went to sleep this early and it never happened when she had the twins her hand stilled on the refrigerator door survival instincts surfacing it was almost too good to be true she thought and her wellhoned nose smelled a rat she tiptoed to the twins bedroom yet again and opened the door a crack but her instincts seemed wrong they looked beautifully asleep how could she doubt them she wondered as she gazed down at their intently sleeping countenances how could anyone doubt them at seven years old henry and william were gorgeous they had bright curly carrotred hair smatterings of freckles on their cute snub noses and a look on their faces that said they were the work of angels that look erin knew to her cost was entirely misleading there was a solid reason they were in care their mother couldnt control them and by the time they were four with no husband and seven other children to look after shed abused them unmercifully and then simply abandoned them to foster care that hadnt worked either up until now no foster parents could cope with their troublemaking and after each effort to find them a home back theyd come to the orphanage every time if it could be organised they were placed with erin erin could usually control them but even erin found it tough she sighed what would she do with them they were holy terrors but as she looked down at their sleeping faces her heart twisted with pain for the two little boys she was starting to love they shouldnt be in the orphanage they were sharp as tacksmaybe clever enough to be categorised as intellectually gifted erin thought remembering a few of the truly amazing spots of trouble theyd landed themselves into as well as that they were engaging and lovable and they desperately needed a mother and a father to love them if only they werent intent on destroying the world still for now they were asleep and she was feeling as if a miracle had occurred she took herself back to the kitchen kicked off her shoes and put her feet up in bliss heres to a miracle she told herself raising her wine glass in a toast to the evening heres to an excellent night back in their bedroom henry and williams plan was working like a dream theyd strung thread from the kitchen door to the top of their bedroom door then theyd tied their stuffed toy tigger tiger to the thread and theyd frayed it so itd break at the first movement of the kitchen door the plan was perfect if erin left the kitchen the thread snapped and tigger fell to the floor unless the thread tangled in erins feetwhich would have been really really unluckyshed never notice as tigger landed there was just enough time for the boys to shove what they were doing under the bed grab tigger scramble under the bedcovers and flick off the light before erin appeared to check so to erin all was beautifully unnaturally normal and they concentrated fiercely on looking asleep as she tiptoed over to them goodnight you rascals shed whispered and theyd both had to concentrate even harder not to giggle then with erin gone they picked up the end of the thread and retied tigger in his warning position and then they retrieved what was under the bed brilliant absolutely excellent but the bomb wasnt meant to go off when it did the plan was for henry to carry it outside in the toe of his slipper it was scary to carry it in his bare fingers and a slipper should hold it safe their bomb was a handtaped ball stuffed with matches and firecrackers designed to go off when thumped on the ground they knew how volatile it was but they werent stupid after carrying it carefully outside the plan was to lob it over the nextdoor fence it was eight at night at eight every night just as the news ended on the telly their next door neighbours helmut and valda cole let their pet poodle out for her evening run pansy poodle never went more than two feet into the garden so there was no fear of hitting her but she might just about turn inside out with the bang and mr and mrs cole would go berserk which would be very interesting indeed henry and william disliked the coles and they knew exactly what the coles thought about themand orphans in general the coles were raising a petition to have all the orphanage houses put together to put all the troublemakers in the one spot they were even nasty to erin which was unthinkable henry and william mightnt always do as erin wanted but she gave the best cuddles of anyone they knew and even when they were in serious trouble she just sighed ruffled their hair and said what am i going to do with you you twerps and pansy poodle yapped so much she woke the baby and when henry poked his finger through the fencejust to say helloshed bitten him it had taken fifteen minutes of erins cuddles before henry had stopped shaking the coles therefore had to be got rid of before they upset erin further or before pansy bit someone else and the only thing that might make them move was if they thought their poodle was in danger hence the bomb the construction of which had been learned from spying on the bigger kids at school only then well henry was pushing the bomb into the slipper and william was holding the slipper up so itd slide in and it wouldnt quite fitand then henry got nervous and the slipper sort of fell sideways the tapewound ball stacked really really tightly with matches and firecrackers fell heavily onto the floor and rolled under the curtains by the bed henry and william stared at it for one horrified momentand then dived for cover under the opposite bed the explosion reverberated through the house and into the night beyond instantly the lights went off as the electricity safety switch cut in and there was the sound of crashing glass from along the veranda the smell of smoke swept into the kitchen and then the fire alarm in the corridor ceiling started to scream bay beach orphanage home number three was on fire matt heard the fire alarm before he rounded the corner that was no big deal he thought his smoke detector at home went off every time he burned his toast which he had to admit was often but matt was driving with his truck window down and the alarm was loud enough to make him glance sideways he was now right out front of one of the bay beach homesand what he saw made him slam his foot on the brake and pull to dead halt he left his truck sitting where it was engine still on and he started to run take the baby matt knew erin douglas of course he did everyone in bay beach knew everyone else and these two had gone to school together not that theyd got on erin was three years younger than matt and maybe he still thought of her as the bossy forthright kid shed been way back in third grade over the years hed danced with her a few times at local functions but she definitely wasnt his type it didnt stop him appreciating her with a lovely figure with a clear almost luminescent complexion and huge blue eyes shed always had her share of boyfriends she was definitely attractive hed decided in a blonde curvy sort of way but she was a bitwell sassy and inclined to laugh at the worldand at him in particular matt was wealthy and his family were descended from the landed gentry normally that stood him in good stead with women but with erin it was almost as if she was mocking him because of it and she always looked frazzled he thought she didnt fuss if her shoulderlength curls were tangled and her makeup was always scant and looked like it had been applied in haste yeah he knew all the home mothers looked like thatthey had such little time to themselvesbut it wouldnt hurt her to take a bit more effort she wore brightly coloured dresses nipped in to a neat waistline and then blousing out in soft folds to midcalf they looked homemade charlotte had told him and he could see that they were the last time hed seen her had been at the local school fête one of her kids had painted her face as a butterfly and her blue eyes were orbs under enormous colourful wings the paint reaching right out to her ears good grief hed thought as he and charlotte had paused for a second stunned look no she definitely wasnt his type she wasnt groomed and elegant as he liked his women she wasnt like his mother or like charlotte and now well she certainly wasnt concentrating on appearances but she was looking more frazzled than hed ever seen her as he reached the veranda she burst through the screen door and she was carrying a baby the little one couldnt have been more than four or five months old erin didnt say anything more than take the baby before thrusting the child into his arms and disappearing again into the house what was he supposed to do with it he stared down at the baby in indecision he couldnt just dump it but there were things that were more urgent here than babyholding a face appeared over the side fence well it would the explosion must have been heard for blocks and valda cole was into everyone elses business before it happened usually matt avoided valda like the plague but now burdened with the baby he was even grateful to see her take the baby and phone the fire brigade he snapped and thrust the infant over the fence into her startled arms before she had a chance to protest and contact the police and ambulance fast and then he dived into the house after erin shed found tess and michael the children had woken and stumbled to their doors in the increasingly smokefilled dark calling and feeling her way she found them and grabbed their hands five years old and badly frightened tess stumbled in the gloom still holding eightyearold michaels hand erin lifted tess and fumbled her way out toward the door the smoke was so thick she couldnt see anything her eyes were streaming as she called to the twins henry william there was no answer ventilation slits were built in above the bedroom doors and the smoke seemed to be coming from the twins room but she couldnt investigate her first priority must be to get tess and michael out and then she barrelled right into matt in the hall this time she acknowledged his presence she needed helpany helpand she knew enough of matthew mckay to know he was capable matt theres these two but the twins are still inside she propelled her children forward and choked on a lungful of smoke take them out he took them all out grasping her arm without a word he pulled her back out of the door before she could argue there standing on the porch she fought to regain her breath so she could speak again her panic was threatening to overwhelm her the smoke seemed almost impenetrable and she could see flames shooting from the side window it was definitely coming from the twins room dear god the twins it was hard to make her voice work the smoke had seared her lungs so every breath hurt how many more are inside matts voice was harsh with authority how many and tell me where they are now somehow she hauled herself under control and made herself heard she couldnt have asked for a better assistant than matt mckay sure he was wealthy and too goodlooking for his own good and he moved in circles she didnt belong too but his competence was never in question just the twins she told him two sevenyearold boys theyre in there together she choked on another lungful of smoke but she had enough sense to thrust the children off the porch as she motioned toward the twins window the curtains were billowing out through the smashed glass flaming outward in the night air please look after the kids ill go stay where you are matts brain was in overdrive as he sorted priorities helmut cole was running across the lawn with a garden hose while valda watched horrified from a distance she was holding the baby like she was holding something unclean it couldnt matter at least the baby could come to no harm where she was and helmut was doing the right thing have you called emergency services he yelled and as valda nodded he turned back to her husband helmut point the hose in that window and keep it there then he turned and headed back insideback in the direction of those shooting flames please be careful erin was close to collapse the smoke we cant get in through the window he told her lets just hope the whole bedroom isnt ablaze the house was in pitch darkness but even if it had been daylight he couldnt have seen anything the smoke was so dense it was threatening to choke him matt dropped to his knees and crawled but the smoke was too thick then his brain kicked in finally damn he should have thought of this outside he paused hauled off his sweater and tied it round his face it wasnt much protection but it was better than nothing the twins bedroom was the second window from the front he needed to turn right through the kitchen and head for the second door along the passage to the closed door he had to work fast whatever was behind that door if he was met with a wall of flame he didnt have a chancebut then neither did the twins with a silent prayer he felt the knob but it wasnt hot to touch that was his first good sign there was therefore only smoke hard against the door there was nothing to do now but he took a deep smokefilled breath opened the door and forced his eyes to see the curtains across the window were blazing and the bed against the far wall was well alight outside helmut raised his hose and he was hit in the face by a jet of water thank god for helmut the water wouldnt put the fire out but it helped keep him alive the soggy sweater across his face made breathing possiblejustand he kept his face in that direction until the sweater was completely soaked then he took another breath and somehow managed to make his voice work kids where are you hhere the muffled gasp came from the side of the room away from the windowlow down a piece of burning curtain landed in his hair he thrust it away unconscious of the pain and groped under the second bed grab hold he managed and small hands reached out and gripped his arms as he counted contact handsfourhe could have sobbed in relief there was no time for sobbing now what somehow he had to get them back through the house and the smoke was building every minute ttigger one of the children was saying and the kid was pulling away what tigger matt found his hands full of sodden fur as the thing was thrust at him a toy good grief he shoved it down his shirt and grabbed a blanket wait his voice came out as a hoarse croak more of helmuts water hit the blanket but not enough he held it up and let it soak and then threw the cloth over the boys heads were crawling out of the room he croaked he had them cradled against him but he pushed them towards the door you crawl first if i stop then you keep going thats an order now and he shoved them forward out of that burning room along the passage into the kitchen and the hall beyond henry william erin met them in the hall like matt shed wrapped her sweater over her head shed come in as far as she dared and was waiting crouched at the kitchen door as they crawled from the passage she hauled them into her arms and tugged them outside matt followed he crawled four feet from the front door and collapsed unconscious onto the porch the most beautiful pair of blue eyes was gazing down into his do you think hell live there was something over his mouth and nosesomething plastic and hard and he tried to push it away keep it there matt he recognised the voicerob mcdonald the local police sergeant youve got a lungful of smoke and were giving you oxygen yes erin if hes capable of fighting off a mask then i reckon hell live matt thought that through and it seemed to make sense the gorgeous eyes were still looking at him it was funny how hed never noticed them before erin was grimy and smokestained and still looking frazzled but suddenly he thought she looked the most beautiful woman hed ever seen just like that butterfly at the fête he thought dazedly gorgeous life was gorgeous if she hadnt come in to find them he never would have got the boys out he acknowledged it had taken all his strength just to crawl those last few yards and he couldnt have propelled the twins any further the twins it was a muffled whisper under the mask but erin knew what he was saying theyre scared out of their wits but theyre fine i need to go back to them if youre sure youre okay hes tough rob growled the ambulance boys are just bringing the stretcher across that roused him hell no he didnt need a stretcher he pushed the mask away coughed and coughed again and finally managed to sit up rob stayed by his side uneasy they told me to hold the mask over your face do you mind not getting me into trouble i dont need it matt coughed again grabbed the mask and took two deep breaths to prove it the improvement was immediate then he took a look around and was astounded by what he saw people were everywhere the fire engine was parked almost beside him there were men running hoses uncoiling the police car was there with its blue light flashing half of bay beach was here he thought dazedly and then he turned to the house helmuts hose hadnt been enough the house was well alight and theyd be lucky to save anything the bedroom where the twins had come from was now a charred shell and the rest of the house was roofless and smouldering there was little for the firefighters to do but to play their hoses over the ruin to stop sparks causing trouble elsewhere matt looked at the charred remains of the twins bedroom and a shudder ran though his entire body hed been in there the twins had been in there the man beside him saw what he was seeing and guessed his thoughts you got the kids out rob said in a voice that was none too steady his big policemans hand came down and grasped matts shoulder i dont know how you did it mate but you did youre a bloody hero i dont know how i did it either matt said he gulped in two more takes of oxygen and focussed some more there was something heavy and soggy in his shirt and he suddenly remembered the kids toy or whatever it was he peered down his shirt in the combined firelight and floodlights and was relieved to see a pair of grimy glass eyes staring up at him it was just a toy then great for a minute there hed thought maybe it was an unconscious pet and mouthtomouth resuscitation on a dog or cat didnt really appeal back to important stuff the kidsthey really are okay they really are okay thanks to you rob looked up as the ambulance officers approached and he gave them an apologetic grin hes giving me trouble he would the ambulance officers were locals and they were mates of both rob and matt their smiles were wide as houses in truth as theyd rounded the bend and seen the fire their stomachs had tightened in horror fire casualties were awful and kids were the worst now they were having trouble containing their delight that their only patient was a stroppy matea mate who looked like he had every intention of making it to old age lets get you loaded up and off to hospital they said cheerfully hey we hear nick daniels is in there without his appendix you can keep him company im not going to hospital too right you are even if we have to tie you down then they glanced up as a young woman came hurrying across the lawn toward them her doctors bag at her side doc hes saying he wont come to hospital lie down matthew mckay she said firmly but shut up and let me examine you or ill put you out for the count dr emily mainwaring knew her stuff and she knew her patient hurry up matt they say youre the one worst affected but i have five kids and erin to examine so lets get this over fast he was fine excellent almost youll live she told him tucking away her stethoscope and casting a brief yet horrified glance at the stillsmouldering house just dont push your luck any further you need antiseptic and a dressing on that burn on your head but its superficial then she peered closer under his shirt and saw what hed stuffed there what on earth is that its a toy of some kind matt managed a grin its not a patientthank heaven he put a hand down to haul it out but she stopped him no if it really is a toy leave it there and see if you can clean it up when you get home if you leave it here itll get lost in this mess and it just may be important these kids have lost everything and i suspect im not looking at longterm physical problems here but psychological ones he thought that through and it made sense okay the toy could stay soggy or not can you dress that burn yourself its not too bad she was flustered worrying about erin and the kids and wanting to move on good okay you dont need hospital but i do want you supervised tonight no going home to that farm alone what about going to charlottes shall i have someone ring her no for some reason that was the last thing he wanted im fine you hear what im saying she said fiercely home with someone with youor hospital choose i i dont have time to waste she said firmly think about it while i check the rest though thanks to you i gather i hardly have a patient to contend with she turned to the ambulance officers hold him down boys and dont let him go until he can give me a plan for this evening that doesnt involve going home by himself forgetting the antiseptic having three stiff whiskies and passing out without anyone there to watch she meant it matt knew emily well enough to accept that she was quite capable of trussing him to a stretcher and he had enough witand he was feeling bad enoughto acknowledge that she was talking sense so what were his alternatives shed suggested charlottes but the idea was distinctly unappealing sure shed put him up for the night but shed fuss all he wanted was his own bed he thought and suddenly he wanted it very very much shock was starting to hit home and he had to clench his hands into fists to stop rob seeing the sudden tremor that ran through him but rob wasnt noticing his mind had moved on what can we do with the kids the police sergeant was still beside matt but he was speaking to erin the doctor and the ambulance officers were attending the children with immediate health fears eased it was time to concentrate on the next problem which seemed matt gathered to be accommodation for erin and the children erin was tightening her lips thinking it through or she was trying to think it through she looked like her mind felt full of smoke i dont know she managed and then she looked up as someone else darted through the jumble of firehoses and firefighters her strained face slackened in relief wendy wendy was an exhouse mother now happily married and immersed in domesticity she was followed by her husband luke luke strolled languidly through the chaos lifted a trembling michael into his arms almost as an asidemarriage to wendy meant that luke and the orphanage kids had met each other heaps of times beforeand he hugged the little boy close hey michael been having some excitement then wow its great that youre all okay and this is a great fire engine then he looked down at matt in admiring amusement and heres our matthew out for the count been playing heroes have we kids shut up luke but matt grinned it suddenly did feel good heroic even the feel of those four little hands clutching his arms from under the bed came sweeping back and he knew where theyd be now without him his grin faded and the tremors swept back hed been lucky to get themand himselfout alive the other homes are all full wendy was saying she was right back in house mother mode as though shed never left she was hugging michaels little sister tess to her breast as if she was her own erin shanni was at the hospital with nick when the call came through the nurse in charge told her what was going on so she rang us first thing i rang lori on lukes cell phone on the way here loris on her way but we need to sort the kids out yes that made it through erins fog lori was house mother at home number five and the only one without tiny tots to care for theyd need her but erin was in no state to concentrate wendy recognised it she came forward and gave her friend a hug like her husband was giving michael then she kept right on holding her tess somehow squashed in the middle which tess didnt seem to mind at all hey kid you and matt got them all out she told her friend everyones safe you did good the twinsthey must have been making something erin was trembling in her friends arms and from where he was lying on the ground matt had an almost unbearable urge to rise and take over he wanted to hug her as well which was crazy he grabbed the oxygen mask and took two more deep breaths he wasnt himself here ive been thinking wendy said into her friends hair tess and michael are only with you until their mother gets out of hospital at the weekend luke and i talked about it as we drove here and we can take them until then they know us tess and michaels mother was on her own and she was a severe asthmatic she was in and out of hospital often and tess and michael were frequent visitors to the homes theyd be happy with wendy erin knew but that still leaves marigold and the twins tess and michael will be shocked wendy said gently gathering tess closer as she spoke the doctor was checking the twins and the little girl was starting to tremble theyll need lots of care so i dont think luke and i can do much more than take them i talked to lori and she said the same shes thinking about the baby and the twins now and speaking of lori lori arrived then thirtyish and competentas all the house mothers wereshe might be shocked but she took right over where wendy left off its fine for michael and tess to go with wendy she said directly it makes sense but the other homes are packed maybe we can use the hotel as an interim measure erin cant look after marigold tonight wendy told her look at her shes shocked to the core the last thing she needs is two oclock feeds she needs to sleep and the twins no one but erin can control the twins lori said bluntly yeah look at how i controlled them erin retorted thats control she gestured to where the flames were dying and leaving a charred and smoking ruin and she shuddered and the publicans heard of the twins lori added i guess we might have trouble persuading him to take you you bet well have trouble but the babys up for adoption and her placements due on monday lori said brightening i guess i could squeeze marigold in with me until then shes such a great baby she glanced around to where valda was holding her at arms length a look of complete disgust on her face the baby it seemed had started to smell they all knew it didnt matter lori had decreed marigold was a great baby and so had her prospective parents shed survive a few more minutes of valdas disgust that just leaves erin and the twins i dont know about the hotel erin said doubtfully maybe we could stay with shanni shanni has two kids is pregnant and has a sick husband wendy was suddenly in charge again and i cant take any more than michael and tess then she looked down at matt and her brow grew thoughtful hmm hmm matt gazed upward and he didnt like the way wendy was looking at him wendy erin shanni lori even doc emily they were all the same they were organising bossy women in a sensible noncharlotte type of way that you couldnt just ignore by going outside and heaving a few hay bales until it was time for dinner frankly they scared him to death he took two more breaths of oxygen from his mask and tried to look pathetic it didnt come off in fact it seemed to make things worse doc says youre not to go home alone and i know you live in that great rambling place all by yourself wendy was onto her good idea like a hound on a scent and she wasnt to be distracted what could be more appropriate than erin and the twins coming home with you to keep you company the twins hed seen enough of the twins you saved their lives wendy said her voice softening as she crouched beside him her eyes met his they were inches apart and he couldnt argue if he wanted to and maybe you saved erins too as i know shed have tried to get them out herself if it wasnt for you so you cant just turf them out on the street now can you i it was too much no he said weakly i suppose i cant so you can have them he forced himself to think he wouldnt make much of a host i need to be away occasionally for cattle shows and things but they can look after themselves with ease so thats that wendy said triumphantly and she rose and hugged erin harder its all sorted my love so you can stop shaking this very minute all of you drama over all we have is one burned house to rebuild and well be back to normal now as soon as the doctors cleared the lot of you then you can go out to matts i can see the welfare shop lady over by the fire chief good old edna shes always armed with a stockpile of emergency clothes ill see how she can help and then well send you all home together chapter two for how long all we have is one burned house to rebuild and well be back to normal it occurred to matt as they started out to the farm that this might be no short undertaking the bay beach home lay in ruins and finding accommodation in this town was next to impossible rented houses were taken by tourists at big dollars and everything else everything else would have to wait worry about tomorrow tomorrow he told himself glancing back at the cavalcade behind him rob was driving him home in matts truckbecause theres no way youre driving tonight the doctor had decreed and matt could only agree he didnt even feel like driving behind them was the police car driven by a police constable and containing erin and the twins behind that another helper was driving erins home car that car held enough welfare donations to clothe a small republic heck he glanced back again and erin was sitting in the passenger seat of the car behind they were just turning out of town and as they passed under a street lamp she looked right back at him raised her eyebrows and gave him a quizzical look that said she knew exactly what he was thinking that this was a disaster this was just great he had a mindreading bossy tenant with twins and trouble attached his nice bachelor existence looked like it was being threatened in a much more dire way than when hed thought earlier that he mightjust might mind you definitely not wouldask charlotte to marry him charlotte was one thing married to charlotte he knew hed be free to carry on with life as normal and his emotional involvement would be minimal but life with erin and twins life could just be chaos then he twisted back to face the road ahead as rob applied the brakes behind them the cavalcade slowed as well i think this might be someone wanting to speak to you rob said and he gave him the same quizzical look that hed just received from erin if im not mistaken its your charlotte his charlotte once more he had that sensation of entrapmentthe sensation hed had since he was about thirteen and charlotte had told the district he was the man she intended marrying of course it was charlotte driving her smart little red bmw and pulling to a halt as rob steered matts truck to a halt on the grass verge then she was out of the car and darting across the road toward them charlotte was looking immaculate of course when had she not she was wearing her signature beautifully cut white slacks and white silk blouse her long blonde hair was carefully braided into a chignon and she looked all ready for their intimate dinner except she was no longer expecting her special dinner bay beach had a very effective communication system and it hadnt let charlotte down shed heard of the fire hauling the truck door open before matt could do it himself she practically threw herself into his arms in relief matthew oh love you could have been killed but emotion or not her eyes were taking everything in including roband including the red velvet box lying forgotten in the map compartment sensibly she ignored it almost sally rang and she said you dived into that burning building and pulled out the orphans all by yourself she said you were burned she stepped back and saw the nasty red blister on his forehead and the grime of smoke all over himand then instinctively she looked down at herself whoops her pure white ensemble was now smudged grey house fires however required courage matt had been brave and she could be too itll wash off she told her beloved not to worry but matt sally said the doctor said youre not to stay alone she turned to rob bring him to my place it was time matt put a word in but it was tricky to do however rob was made of sterner stuff we cant rob said and thumbed back to the cavalcade matts got all the company he needs charlotte looked backand then stared in horror as she saw who was in the police car not the orphans she gasped youre not taking the orphans home with you matt youre burned i can cope you cant charlotte theres only two kids needing a place to stay and erin will take care of them matt was growing uneasy now erin had emerged from the police car and was walking over to see what was happening from where she was now she could hear every word charlotte said erins been through a lot charlotte im sure she has charlotte shook her head in disbelief that this could be happening but darling so have you she turned her head and raised her voice erin matts coming back to my house he needs to be looked after your organisation can look after you whoa erin took a deep breath count to ten she told herself this is important charlotte was not one of erins favorite people lovely and gracious and generous to people she considered the right sort her graciousness had never extended to erin erin was three years younger and about a million miles below her on the social ladder as shed grown older charlotte had grown more adept at hiding her distaste for those she considered beneath her but somehow erin always knew exactly where she stood right on the bottom rung but like charlotte erin could be ruthless when she needed to be and she needed to be ruthless now charlotte matts offered us accommodation i dont care if he has up until now charlotte had had a wonderful feeling about this evening the sight of that tiny crimson box confirmed shed been right and now all it had come to was this anyone can see hes unwell and so was erin shed been through enough without charlottes arguments back in the police car were two subdued little boys who needed a bed fast she knew well enough that at matts house she would find oneand one for herself too there wasnt an alternative matts offered to take us in and ive accepted she said and there was a certain amount of grit in her voice im sorry charlotte but weve been through too much tonight to stand on the road and argue if you could just let us go matts hurt then follow him home and fix him up erin replied wearily im sure i cant do it with your style a sticking plaster and a push in the direction of bed is all im capable of believe me charlotte glared she didnt like this one bit but what was the alternative charlotte was thinking on her feet and she was thinking fast firstlynaturallyshe was thinking that erin was attractive and unmarried and she didnt like the thought of such a woman staying with matt but then matt had known erin for agessince childhood in factand he hadnt seemed attracted in the past so maybe that was okay her eyes moved imperceptibly sideways hed already purchased the contents of the box so she needed to concentrate on priorities which were secondly that erin was saddled with the twins they might be subdued now but the whole town knew their reputation matt would be driven crazy before he could get used to them in the house the only alternative open to her now was to invite them all back to her place and that didnt bear thinking of she had a perfect little horse stud in the hills the house was immaculate and children would destroy it what else then create a scene no she knew matt would hate it shed worked so hard to make him see her as the perfect wife that shed be a fool to mess it up now the velvet box was there like a tantalising promise she could concede a little okay sweetheart she said softly ignoring erin totally and turning back to her intended you go ahead ill bring your dinner over my dinner matt was still too befuddled to think you were coming to my place for dinner quails with the most gorgeous sauce ive kept it hot for you she gave him her most loving look and he responded with gratitude but he didnt want her quails eggs on toast is all im capable of tonight he said wearily im sorry charlotte freeze my dinner itll have to wait for some other time this wasnt going to work erin had never been inside matts house but she walked through the front door and she darn near walked out again this and the twins no and no and no youd best take off your shoes matt said through force of habit the carpet shows every mark id guess it would erin stared at the floor in doubt but obligingly removed her shoes and then turned to the boys and slipped theirs off too the twins let her do what she wanted and they hardly moved as she did the welfare lady had dressed themsort ofbut they were so subdued they hadnt said a word now erin badly wanted to get them alone she wanted them bathed and tucked up somewhere warm and safe and alone where she could cuddle the shock and fear out of them matt was stooping to help with their shoes and she was grateful for that at least diddid you choose this carpetor did charlotte she managed it was a stupid conversation starter but it was something my mother chose it he said stiffly and that made her blink in surprise memories flooding back shed known matts mothernot that theyd ever spoken of course matts family owned one of the wealthiest farms in the district not so erins as one of eight kids in a big loving and decidedly impoverished family erin was considered by mrs mckay to be a nobody which suited her nicely she acknowledged erin had no wish to move in matt and charlottes exclusive world she and her friendsand their respective parentsused to check out louise mckays perfectly tailored white suits and think how impractical they were only louise thought they were perfect didnt your mother die five years ago erin managed thrusting away memories of the perfect louise this carpet looks unused i usually use the back door he told her then he managed a grin i guess mum trained me wellor i got sick of taking off my boots i can see that she stared at the white carpet and then through to the white leather lounge suite in the sitting room beyond the boys and i had better get used to the back door as well i guess itd be best hmm the situation here was decidedly strained erin was standing in the front hall of the great mckay family home aloneapart from the twinswith matt mckay the feeling wasweird but she didnt have the time to examine her personal feelings the boys needs were too great show me the bathroom and where the boys can sleep she said wearily they need to be in bed so did matt he gave himself a mental shake trying to sort priorities there were two bathrooms he could clean up in one while she coped with the twins in the other maybe he could help her but first he had to clear his head it still felt fogged with smoke and the aftermath of terror this way he led them minus their shoes to the back of the house here were two bedrooms side by side with a bathroom between to erins delight the beds were freshly made as if hed been expecting guests any day its another legacy from my mother he told her seeing her look of surprise the bedrooms stay immaculate at all times in case of unexpected visitors thats you unexpected visitors he managed another of his smiles and even though it was crooked and weary it was a smile that made a girl want to take a backward step or a forward step but he was talking in a dragging voice that had erin suddenly looking sharply up at him she needed to focus here the burn on his forehead was blistering badly and his eyes were redrimmed from the smoke he might be hero material but he was badly shocked and hed inhaled a lot more smoke than she had im afraid they wont stay immaculate if my twins are sleeping in them she said apologetically and then propelling her charges into the bathroom she turned back to him with decision written all over her house mother personified you go and take a shower yourself she said and then go straight to bed well see i do need to eat ill meet you in the kitchen when the twins are settled he managed a rueful smile that is if you dare leave them alone theyll be good tonight erin told him and she smiled as she ruffled the twins sootblackened hair the children were so tired they were sagging on their feet wont you boys i think any mischief has been blasted right out of you were sorry erin it was the first whisper shed had out of either of them shed run a bath washed them to within a whisker of their lives rubbed them dry on matts mothers sumptuous white towelsand still managed to leave a streak or two of grey on the gorgeous linenand then cradled them into bed they shared the one bed despite there being twin beds in the room in times of trouble these two stuck together and they were sticking together now and all the time theyd stayed silent now dressed in some very strange and illfitting pyjamas they looked up at her from their shared pillow and their eyes were still glazed with shock and fear and remorse we only made the bomb to scare pansy william said trembling and if he hadnt sounded so pathetic erin might have been tempted to laugh oh heck pansy poodle why on earth would you want to scare pansy so mr and mrs cole would move away and stop being nasty to you that was all she needed she was overtired and overemotional and now she had to blink back tears they were such terrors but there was always a motive they had such good little hearts somehow she schooled her features into sternness and hugged them both well we were very very lucky that mr mckay came to save us youll promise me youll never ever play with fireworks or matches again not even to scare pansy we promise henry told her and she looked down and knew that she had their word it wouldnt be a bomb next time something else for sure but not a bomb she tucked them in hugged them again for good measure and wondered where tigger was now they loved tigger and when they realised hed been burned it didnt bear thinking of then she looked up at the sound of footsteps in the hall matt was standing in the doorway he was clean now big and bronzed and capable dressed in clean jeans and an open necked shirt and with only the burn on his forehead to show any damage had been done he was back to the farmer she knew charlotte was one lucky lady erin thought suddenly a class above the likes of her or not matthew mckay was not bad as husband material not only was he extremely good looking with his thatch of sunbleached brown curls his weathered skin and his strongly muscled frame but his deep brown eyes were twinkling with kindness in his hands he held two mugs and he carried them carefully over to the bedside table for the boys my grandma always used to say a glass of warm milk is the best cure in a crisis he told the twins so i brought you boys one each theres another for erin when shes had her shower and then he smiled at erina smile that somehow had the capacity to knock her senses reeling off you go and ill meet you in the kitchen when youre clean darn she must be more exhausted than she thought erin decided she really was very close to tears and his kindness was almost her undoing ive also brought my very favourite story book from when i was seven he told her motioning to a book tucked under his arm its all about fire engines so i propose that you go and clean up while i read to the boys your throat hurts he finished for her well guessed id imagine yours does too luckily my books mostly pictures so the boys and i just have to look so scoot he smiled down at the two nervous little boys in their shared bed and his smile was encompassing and kind is that okay with you guys he asked them it seems a bit unfair that were clean and erins not the boys considered in silenceand then slowly nodded in unison great matts smile widened and he sank down onto the bed beside erin it was sort of crowded down therefour on the bedbut it was familiar and very very comforting after the fear of the last hours i dont know about you he told erin softly but im pooped and the sooner we get this lot asleep the sooner we can get to bed ourselves absolutely he was perfectly right so why did his words bring a blush to her face as she rose and headed gratefully to the bathroom and those tears were definitely still threatening by the time shed showered the twins were solidly absolutely asleep wrapped in one of louises vast towels erin checked them from all angles and decided itd take another bomb to wake them and even then it wasnt a sure thing she didnt blame them she was exhausted herself but matt was nowhere to be seen hed meet her in the kitchen hed said but she couldnt go and find him wrapped only in a towel her own clothes were disgusting so she hauled on an enormous dressing gown she found in the donations pile and made her way through the house to find him the house was huge vast it must have six or seven bedrooms she thought as she padded barefoot down the passage and when matt emerged from a door in front of her she practically squeaked in fright hey im no ghost still those eyes twinkled as he put his hands on her shoulders to steady her uh oh youre done in you must be too she looked up at him and saw that his eyes were still reddened slightly from the smoke and the burn on his forehead had blistered further you look a darn sight worse than me id have to agree there the laughter lines deepened as he took in her total appearance but only just what youre doing in a bathrobe that looks like it was designed for mother hubbard that brought a chuckle the robe was enormous she swam in it and it trailed out behind her like a flannelette bridal train his voice softened as he realised why she was wearing it hell i guess youll have all lost your own clothes she had shed barely had time to take it in yet but it was something shed have to face most of her belongings were back in the blackened smouldering ruin however they were just things she said resolutely trying not to think of her mothers seed pearl necklace that shed loved so much things can be replaced youre one brave lady no she shook her head ive never been so frightened in my life as i was this evening i thought id lost them the boys yes he was leading her into the kitchen as they spoke and at last she relaxed unlike the rest of the house this felt like a proper home the kitchen had ancient polished floorboards big comfy furniture a huge wooden table and cushioned chairs and a settee than made you want to bounce and sink out of sight a gleaming aga was sending out its gentle warmth across the kitchen and an ancient collie dog looked quizzically up at her as she entered he thumped his tail gently against the floor and then went straight back to sleep this was home she thought this was a real home damn she had to blink back tears again the waterworks were surely ready to pounce tonight the fear had driven every ounce of strength from her bed she should go to bed but hot chocolate and a brandy matt was saying i know i told the kids warm milk but you and i need something stronger ive eaten toast do you want something to eat no then just a drink and then bed he turned away to fetch mugs and glasses and while he was faced away his voice changed you love them dont you who she leaned against a chair to steady herselfher legs seemed to have lost all their strengthbut she knew instinctively who he was talking about his next words confirmed it the twins the hot chocolate made he turned back to her and gestured for her to sit there was nothing for it in her ridiculous night wear she sat sinking into his squishy chair like she was drowning she took the chocolate and cradled it drawing strength from the warmth of the mug she thought of the twins and her mouth twisted im pretty fond of them youre a house mother he said thinking it through i thought youre not supposed to get attached to your charges you mean im not supposed to care if they go up in flames i didnt mean that he was watching her face the boys are different though arent they to you she shrugged i guess why that was harder to answer she thought about it and gave him the easy answer its probably because theyve been with me more than most kids dont tend to stay in orphanages any more they get adopted or fostered out as soon as we can find someone wholl take them fifty years ago we used to have scores of orphans now we have kids like tess and michael who are in for shortterm crisis care or the baby loris taken for me shes been with us while her mother made the decision to allow her to be adopted and the twins thats the problem we cant find anyone for the twins there it was saidthe stark reality that hurt just to think of it why not matt said watching her face i dont know liar she shrugged and then gave him a weary smile no im not a liar and i do find it hard to understand theyre adorable but the twins push people away you see i dont see you may well see it soon she sighed look they were the product of a onenight stand their mother doesnt remember who their father is and she has seven other kids to look after to be honest the twins reached their mothers iq level when they were about three id reckon whoever fathered them wasnt lacking in the intelligence quotient and theyre smart as paint anyway she cant cope with them she rejected them absolutely and she threw them at us for adoption unfortunately they were old enough to understand what was happening and theyre taking it out on the world only on whoever is deemed to threaten them and now they expect to be rejected they wont let anyone close because they know itll end erin sighed she was boneweary and the comfort of the hot chocolate and the sympathy in this mans eyes was more than enough to push her over the edge hed poured her a brandy but she wasnt game enough to drink it her eyes wanted to close so badly sleep he said and leaned over and took the mug from her hands before she dropped it youll find toothbrushes and everything you need in the bathroom i already have her tired eyes smiled your mother must have been the best hostess in the districtand you havent let her standards slip one bit im not allowed to he smiled back at her and his weary smile touched something in her insides which hadnt been touched in a very long time if ever charlottes trained the redoubtable mrs gregory for me and she sees to it that everythings pristine uh oh dont worry before she knew what he intended he reached forward and took both her hands in his he pulled her to her feet and then stood for a moment looking down into her troubled eyes im sure you and me and the twins and mrs gregory will get along just famously and charlotte erin added under her breath but she didnt say it instead she looked up at matt a crease of worry still behind her eyes doc emily said i should keep an eye on you tonight you did lose consciousness i did he agreed gravely but i dont want checking every hour thank you very much if i promise not to die in the night will you promise to go and put your head down on the pillow and let tomorrows worries wait until tomorrow those dratted tears damn they threatened to be her undoing she blinked and sniffed and then blinked again fine then umyou have put something on that burn she was under no illusions that charlotte would kill her if it got infected i have at that he told her its cleaned and its nicely antiseptic so we can both go to bed with a clear conscience goodnight erin goodnight matt andthank you and then because she looked so rumpled and lost and forlorn he couldnt help himself he leaned forward and let his lips brush her forehead it was all my pleasure he said softly now stop thinking about twins and burns and belongings and worries think only about yourself for a change sleep and she did there was simply no choice chapter three where are we erin planned to wake the minute they woke but she must have been too exhausted for her normal house mother instincts to work shed propped open both bathroom doors so the twins could see her as soon as they opened their eyes and now they landed on her bed in a tangle of legs and arms and astonishment did the house really burn down did we really ride in a police car that was easy it did and you did and youre now at mr mckays farm she said hugging them to her and hauling them in to lie under the covers she was wearing an oversized tshirt and in their oddly assorted pyjamas they looked just as disreputable as she did they were like something out of a charity bazaar she thought and grinned to herself and hugged harder she didnt mind they were safe the policeman wont arrest us it was henry ever the anxious one now why would he arrest you because we made a bomb but youve promised faithfully never to make another one she said mmm she fixed henry with a look you did promise yeah he gave her a feeble smile okay we did then i think we might persuade him not to arrest youthis time apparently this was satisfactory they snuggled down beside her and then snuggled some more but then william asked what was apparently super important in both their minds erin wheres tigger oh dear erin thought back to the last shed seen of the house there seemed not one snowballs chance in a bushfire that anything could have been saved there was nothing to do but tell them the truth guys im afraid tigger was burned that silenced them completely they lay taking in the enormity of it and then henry sniffed one sniff was all he allowed himself but erins heart wrenched tigger had been given to the boys by one of their first foster familiesa sort of soptoconscienceattakingthembacktotheorphanage giftand theyd been so young theyd mixed him up with leaving their mother and their bothers and sisters tigger had become their only constant a toy never fought over never discussed but simply there apart from each other he was all they hadand now theyd lost him erin knew enough to acknowledge he was irreplaceable she thought of the impossibility of saying theyd find another tigger and she simply didnt know what else to say she was saved by a knock there was a light rap on the door and it opened to reveal matt unlike erin and the boys matt was fully dressed in his farmers moleskins and khaki shirt a sticking plaster lay across the burn on his forehead but otherwise he looked completely unscathed he was bronzed strong capable and ready for the days work good morning he said gravely enough but his deep brown eyes twinkled at the sight of the three in the bed thats a single bed and you guys look squashed didnt you find the other two is something the matter we just came into erins bed nowto keep her company william said with dignity casting a doubtful look at his twin henry was looking dangerously close to tears and the twins code of conduct decreed it didnt do to show emotion in front of strange adults theyd learned early to keep themselves to themselves but after one knowing look at henry matt mercifully changed the subject seeming not to notice the one errant tear sliding down henrys cheek he chose the one subject that might make them think of something other than loss ive made pancakes and i thought you might like them in bed how about it pancakes william said resolutely putting aside the vision of a burning tigger ii guess they were very upset about something matt realised but he could only go on from here ill bring in a tray shall i yes please erin was so grateful she could have hugged him how had he guessed that the last thing they needed was a formal breakfast thatd be lovely coming right up he left them to it and erin never knew what an effort it had been for him not to sit down and hug the lot of them it had cost to get them breakfast matt had come in from the paddocks to find his weekly housekeeper mrs gregory hard at work he had a cow in calf in the home paddock and after a sleepless night hed decided hed be happier checking on her than staring at the ceiling his cow now safely delivered hed come in to find mrs gregory already sniffing lugubriously over the marks on the carpet charlotte rang me she said before he could say a word i knew how itd be so i decided it was my christian duty to get here early those dratted children you saved them didnt you why you had to offer to take them in i guess it was my christian duty he told her and she didnt even smile hmmph those twins and that mother of theirs oh you dont need to tell me a thing about that woman the whole of bay beach knew her before she disappeared with the last of her string of men if ever there was a nogood twotiming hey you cant place the sins of the mother onto the children matt interceded she threw the twins out which is saying a lot about the children mrs gregory said soundly that womans a slut and if even she couldnt put up with them hmm mrs gregory how would you like a holiday he said thoughtfully this wasnt boding well for the future at all erins here and with two adults she and i can surely do the housework she wont she wont even notice if the house is a mess i know her kind she will his lips tightened heck his mother and charlotte and their set had truly branded erin just because of her father he finally wrung pancakes out of mrs gregoryby throwing in a few more christian duties and an agreement to take an extended break for as long as they could manage without herand now he carried the tray toward the bedroom with the air of one whod achieved a major triumph when he saw the grateful smile in erins eyes the feeling grew so his chest felt a whole six inches broader there was still something wrong though something majorly wrong the twins were politesort ofabout the pancakes but they sat up in bed with the pancake tray on the table between them and they poked at matts offering as if the end of the world was nigh you didnt yell at them because of the fire he asked erin frowning as she crossed to the window with her pancake plate shed done it as a deliberate ruse to talk to him without the twins hearing and it worked hed figured it out and followed her now they stood with their backs to the twins as if the cattle grazing in the paddocks was taking all their attention she took umbrage at his suggestion yell at the twins of course i didnt she told him they feel dreadful enough without me yelling at them what do you think i am far too kind he told her promptly and she smiled but in an absent sort of way as she munched her pancakewhich told him her thoughts were still on the twins im not she glanced back at the twins sometimes i feel im not kind enough they need so much why the sad faces are they still scared no she shrugged after all this man had done for them it seemed stupid to let him see how upset they were about one small tigger but there was something in his eyes that said he really wanted to know he cared its just that they had a stuffed toy that they loved theyve now realised its been burned he stared then wait right here he told them soundly and without another word he strode from the room and left them gaping after him and then he was back and in his handsat arms length because it was so disgustinghe carried the blackest filthiest soggiest tigger theyd ever seen but it was tigger erin barely got the word out before the boys were out of their beds upending milk as they went and heading straight for matt they clung to what he held out to themone to tiggers snout one to tiggers tail and all the grime in the world wouldnt have made one ounce of difference to the love that shone from their eyes their tigger erin was looking at him as if hed produced a miracle and the feeling was just great his expanding chest almost popped the buttons on his shirt how on earth did you rescue tigger i never meant to he told her and managed a shamefaced grin they thrust it at me in the fire and to be honest i thought it was a dead cat i just shoved it down my shirt and kept going a dead cat her lips twitched and do you always go around shoving dead cats down your shirt during house fires before anything else theyre excellent for curing warts he told her all you need is a graveyard and a full moon everyone tries to find them but this time i got there first he was ridiculous she chuckled and suddenly things were just fine the twins were inspecting their disgusting toy with relish it appeared that the grime and general dishevelment made not the least difference to their affection how could it matt grinned trying to ignore the warm feeling erins pleasure was giving him doc emily deserves some credit too he admitted she saw it when she was listening to my breathing and told me to hang on to it then i forgot ituntil i took a shower opened my shirt and it fell out the damned thing nearly gave me a heart attack i imagine it might erins smile was a mile wide were so lucky you didnt toss it away i could have matts eyes were resting on the twins theyd sat on their shared bed again one end of tigger on each of their knees but by last night both doc emily and i had an inkling that whatever could be saved might be important you have no idea how important she said warmly oh matt her eyes were glowing whew her eyes were doing something to his insides which was truly spectacular he needed to be grounded here he was the admiration session was interrupted before his chest buttons could finally pop from the strain just as matt was starting to feel very peculiar indeed another knock sounded through the room visitors were coming thick and fast this morning erin thought but what the heck they had tigger with tigger they could save the world they could cope with anything but it was charlotte and suddenly erin wasnt so sure if anything included charlotte she was amazingly early erin thought and then she glanced down at her wristwatch and stared in disbelief it was after nine oclock help and she looked like this charlotte matt said warily and the tone of his voice summed up all of their feelings charlotte gave him her most sympathetic smileheroine racing to save heroand then she moved straight to practicalities mrs gregory told me you were feeding the children their breakfast in the bedroom she said briskly why on earth dont you do it in the kitchen at least you can wash the floor there and then she looked againand saw tigger she physically flinched whatwhat on earth is that its tigger erin said and beamed her joy with the world even charlotte couldnt burst her bubble this morning hes a bit firestained as we all are hi charlotte isnt it the most wonderful morning erins greeting startled charlotte out of her composure i suppose it is she looked erin up and downaristocrat to a low life form somewhere under the level of porriwiggle what on earth are you wearing at a guess im modelling old mr harbisets handmedown dressing gown erin told her refusing absolutely to be ruffled hes the only local i can think of whos fat enough to own a dressing gown this size and mrs harbisets always giving things to charity she gave a fast twirl ballerinalike and the flannelette dressing gown swung out almost full circle around her bare legs isnt it great you think the style will take off charlotte somehow managed a smile then she turned to face matt excluding erin and the twins nicely from her ordered world matt darling ive talked to my parents she told him sweetly in a tone that said shed solved all his troubles and theyve been terrific they say the orphanage can have the use of the stables until the home is rebuilt the stables matt blinked and erin raised her eyebrows politely stables i dont mean the stables proper silly charlotte said giving him the benefit of her delicious tinkling laugh she threw the twins a look that said she wasnt so sure that stables wouldnt be the best place for them but then went bravely on no theres living quarters directly above the horse boxes we used them for the men when i housed all my horses there but now ive moved out theyre empty theyre still quite liveable thats very generous of your parents matt said thinking it through but the living quarters were built for use by the stable lads werent they yes then theyre pretty basic yes but its almost summer charlotte beamed theres a little kitchenette and a dormitory and a bathroom everything they need one dormitory yes so erin would be sharing the dormitory with the children thats what she does sweetheart charlotte gave erin her very nicest smile her beam widened all her problems solved and she reached out to take matts hand she wont mind darling caring for children is her job isnt it erin hmm erin might have continued to twirl but she had also been listening and thinkingfast it is erin said thankfully and im very grateful but im afraid i cant accept any offers before our director comes down here and sorts things out meanwhile if matts offer still stands whens your director coming this morning i imagine erin said dryly she glanced at her watch tom burrows had been in sydney this week but shed imagine news of the fire would have him down here by lunch time ill pass on your offer to him and hell come out and see your parentsand the stables hey hang on a minute matt wasnt having a bar of this the kids are staying here you must see thats impossible charlotte was still at her sweetest why she lowered her voice just enough to make the twins aware that they were being discussed without them hearing because theyre juvenile delinquents thats why they burned down the last place they stayed in heaven knows what theyd do here but that was enough for erin her hackles had well and truly risen juvenile delinquents at seven years old if she didnt get rid of this woman soon shed lose her temperwhich maybe wasnt such a good idea she thought as shed really really like to stay here for a while this setup was perfect for the twins they had a farm where they could be relatively isolated from the rest of the community if tom agreedand he surely wouldthen she could stay here too the farm was beautiful nestled right on the river mouth and overlooking the sea itd be like a beach holiday thered be no other children for her to look afterthe homes couldnt ask matt to look after any moreand theyd have her sole attention which was just fine by her these were badly traumatised children and most of the trauma had been inflicted well before last night matt would you mind if you continued this conversation with charlotte outside she managed juvenile delinquents indeed ii need to get dressed i noticed your donated clothes pile is still out in the hall charlotte said pointedly youll have to go and forage unless youre planning on wearing what you had on last night she smiled charlotte whoops shed gone too far charlottes selfpreservation instincts surfaced then as a look on matts face told her that he wasnt seeing things as she was and this crazy woman wasnt any real competition matt was only being charitable after all and it behoved charlotte to appear the same ill fetch you something shall i she asked she looked at erin assessing youre a couple of sizes larger than me or id lend you something of mine im quite happy with our charity pile erin said through gritted teeth anonymous charity that was not charlotte charity ill fetch something myself she pulled open the door and stopped short last night when theyd come here their toes had sunk into the lush white carpet it had still been here and squishable when shed come to bed it still was nowbut there was plastic over the top lines of plastic erin recognised it shed seen it last at the home of a superfussy aunt purchased by the yard the stuff was transparent and it had tiny pointy teeth on the back to hold it to the carpet people used it to keep homes immaculate against any who might sully their precious flooring and it felt just horrid urk what was the point of having carpet if one had to look at it under plastic and walk on the coldness of the stuff she took a deep breath and counted to ten under her breath she had to take this in her stride okay it was insulting but if matt wanted to protect his home then who could blame him but it wasnt matt whod laid the plastic where the hell did that come from he demanded staring he stalked out into the passage and stared some more the plastic tracked off in both directions a path for anything unclean i had heaps stored at home charlotte said not hearing the low growl of displeasure in his voice i bought it when i went overseas last year and my grandparents borrowed my house grandpa is such a grubhe just refuses to take his boots off and grandma doesnt insist it was just the thing i thought and it worked beautifully but now grandpas gone and i dont need it so i brought it over she sounded immensely pleased with herselfbut matt had had enough well you can just roll it all up and take it back where it came from he managed embarrassed to his back teeth hell of all the insensitive unwelcoming acts what would erin think of this charlotte might be gorgeous and a great hostess and cook but sometimes she was impossible she really was just like his mother but umno it was erin no they both turned to stare at her leave it the kids and i will hardly notice the kids certainly wouldnt a floor was a floor as far as the twins were concerned and charlotte was right this way erin wouldnt sully matts precious carpet and she wouldnt have to worry about the twins doing it either which was one less worryand she had enough worries as it was but matt was implacable the plastic goes matt told her now matt its fine erin its not his temper was rising now and there were memories flooding back that were making everything worse his mother standing at the kitchen door yelling at his father in the voice of a fishwife get those boots off right now or ill walk out and never come back it was her ultimate threat made over and over again it had scared the young version of matt stupid and only later had he wondered whether maybe he and his father would have been a whole lot happier without her which might be why he was still a bachelor so no the plastic went and the image of marriage that hed had last night faded a little as well maybe he was meant to be a bachelor hed bought the ring but he hadnt done the asking but this was hardly the time for dredging up old memories and future plans now was the time to take the wellmeaning but misguided charlotte by the shoulders and steer her out of the room well leave you in peace he told erin charlotte erins right we need to continue this discussion outside he gave erin and her crazy wonderful dressing gown one last glance and then he propelled charlotte outside im going into town he told erin over his shoulder as he left then he turned back to the lady he was propelling charlotte i could use some help do you have time to come with me charlotte was surprised but instantly gratified of course i do sweetheart when do you want to go now he told her erin just make yourself and the twins at home mrs gregory will be here until lunch time so anything you need just ask charlotte and i will probably eat in town so ill see you midafternoon charlotte visibly sighed with relief this was much better a lunch date with matt with erin nicely excluded she turned and gave erin her sweetest smile because she could afford to be charitable to one who was so clearly a charity caseand then she allowed herself to be propelled from the room by the man she intended to marry there was no threat here she decided there was no threat at all chapter four matt arrived home at about three and he couldnt find them there were no kids in sight and there was no erin he walked from living rooms to bedrooms no one he went outside and checked the outbuildings he checked that erins car was where it had been parked the night before and still he couldnt find them finally he checked the house once more and this time his old collie sadie decided to join him as they passed the laundry sadie whined and put up a paw he pushed the door openand there were the three of them sitting on the floor with three noses pressed hard against the glass of the tumble dryer they were watching the tumble dryer isnt the television working he asked dryly and they swivelled to face him they really were the most illassorted trio the charity bin hadnt been good to them he thought nothing fitted anywhere yet erin looked amazing he hauled his eyes from her with an almost herculean effort concentrate on the twins he told himself the twins were wearing jogging suit pants that were way too big and tshirts that were far too small their seagreen eyes were over big and over bright in their anxious faces and as they looked up at him he felt his heart give a thump of sympathy they looked such waifs but erin he failed try as he might he couldnt turn his eyes from her she didnt look much less waiflike herself she was wearing someones castoff crimplene dresspale blue with pink spots buttoned to the waist and belted with a cheap and nasty plastic belt the dress looked as if it was meant for a woman of sixty the bust size was about five sizes too big for her and it looked ridiculous how she managed to still look beautiful was beyond him if you so much as smile youre dead meat she said reading at least some of his thoughts and he wiped the tentative smile from his face hoped she hadnt read the rest and tried for a look of innocence now why would i smile because this isor wasbeverly borridges secondbest country womens association dress and its the only thing i can fit into her breasts must be she faltered as his eyes fell immediately to the points in question she blushed bright pink she folded her arms defiantly across her chest and she turned back to the dryer huge she finished but she was no longer looking at him he couldnt help it he grinnedwhich was exactly the wrong thing to do because she sensed it she turned back and caught the grin full on and retaliated just like erin had retaliated as a kid at school no one teased erin douglas without copping it right back a sodden towel was lying by her side how convenient her lips twitched into a smile she lifted it and she threw with deadly accuracy it whacked him with a soggy thwump slap across his face she was some shot she was some lady but soggy or not he still didnt know what they were doing matt removed the towel from around his shoulders laid it aside wiped the grin from his face and crossed to the dryer once more they all had their backs to him and they were staring at the dryer there was nothing for it but to see for himself he crouched down beside them and stared at the glass whats the program here he asked something good days of our livesor general hospital the twins simply ignored him after that one brief glance theyd gone straight back to watching the glass window their anxiety was palpable and they were watching the glass as if their lives depended on it so matt watched too and he saw a pair of eyes flash past the glass and also a tail all was suddenly clear thats tigger he said in amazement of course its tigger erin nodded and went right back to tiggerwatching i rang the manufacturer i hope you dont mind me using your phone but it was important to get his washing instructions right they said hed never dry naturally even if we hung him out in the sunhed go mouldy inside their advice was to wash him in soap and waterand you cant imagine how much soap and water we had to use to get him clean then squeeze him dry in a towel we hung him outside in the sun long enough so the fur fabric was dry enough not to shrink and then we put him in the dryer but but but the boys are still a bit anxious she told him we sat outside with him while he hung on the clothes line and now we thought wed just stay here and watch i see the whole process was crazy he repressed the grin though one look at the little boys faces was enough to make that easy then he looked at the dial it had twenty minutes to go how long have you been here he asked sitting watching tumble dryers going around ad infinitum was hardly his idea of a great afternoons entertainment an hour and a half he should be almost done erin had a twin on either side of her and she hugged them hard she was acting like she had all the time in the world and this was the worlds most pressing problem and hes doing just fine it might just as well be televisions general hospital they were watching matt thought drama had nothing on this here we have the patient on the operating table and anxious relatives fearful of the worst he doesnt like it in there henry whispered and tiggers eyes flashed past the glass again matt almost had to pinch himself back to reality good grief this was a stuffed animal yet the tremor in henrys voice had him imagining agony within twenty minutes to go i brought back icecreams matt said helpfully but no one moved ill fetch them shall i thatd be great erin told him but all eyes were on the glass they had no time for him at all if anyone told matt hed spend twenty minutes watching a stuffed animal go round and round in a tumble dryerand almost enjoy ithe would have said they were crazy but that was just what happened next he placed a chocolate icecream in the twins hands gave one to erin and settled back with his he should have brought popcorn he thought he hadnt realised they were into moviewatching they certainly were there was hardly a word spoken every ounce of the boys concentration was directed at tiggeras though by watching him they could get him through this ordeal they were amazing kids matt thought and began to see what erin was fighting for once you had the loyalty of these two youd have it for life they licked their icecreams but they licked them absently and one flicker of doubt that things werent well in the tigger department and the icecreams would have been abandoned there was no doubt of that at all the icecreams demolished tigger spun on and on and then the timer clicked off tigger thumped three more times around the drum and erin opened the door he might be hot erin warned but hot or not theyd waited long enough the twins had him out of there and were checking him from snout to tail hes perfect william breathed he wasnt actually matt thought looking at the battered toy that had seen years of loving service patches of tiggers fur were completely worn off his eyes were decidedly crooked there was a piece missing from one ear and a bit of stuffing was coming out of his rump absolutely perfect erin agreed grinning from ear to ear and ive never seen him so clean she poked the stuffing back into his rump wasnt it clever of mr mckay to save him ill sew his bottom up tonight but meanwhile meanwhile now hes fixed can we see the farm henry said bounding up and turning pleading eyes from one adult to another with tigger restored to glory things were obviously okay in his world and he was ready to move on yes please breathed william and matt looked into their combined eyes and could no sooner deny them than fly plus erin was watching havent you been outside yet he asked apart from sitting under the clothes line no we had to fix tigger first erin told him as if he was a little bit thick for not realising it but now tiggers better so maybe we can explore if its okay with you mr mckay okay of course it was okay and suddenly matt was very very pleased that they hadnt explored without him he very much wanted to show off his farm to this woman and these boys he told himself hastily not just erin of course not just erin what have you done with charlotte they were walking across the yard toward the machinery shed the boys were whooping ahead the traumas of the night before forgotten completely as tigger circled victoriously above henrys head shes gone home to make dinner for me i see erin didnt see she was feeling acutely uncomfortable in her ghastly crimplene but there was nothing else for her to wear at least she had her own sandals she thought gratefully the twins hadnt even got those and were now wearing wellingtons two sizes too big i was supposed to be going there for dinner last night matt said and he also was feeling uncomfortable after all hed asked charlotte to do in town and the effort shed put into doing it hed felt obliged to accept her dinner invitation there was also the issue of the little velvet box whatever he decided about that damned box he was putting erin and the boys up only because they had no place else to go that was the only reason therefore as charlotte had carefully explained he surely couldnt be expected to play host and erin wouldnt be lonely tom burrows is coming out to see you he told erin and if his voice was a bit too gruff she appeared not to notice tom tom was the director of the homes and erin could only be grateful she needed his advice you saw him in town i went to find him matt said he has heaps to do you understand but he said hed bring pizza out from town at about six he says he needs time to talk to you and that seemed the best way hes caught up with insurance assessors until then but he wants to then he caught his breath uh oh the machinery shed door was open the twins had darted in and they were up on the tractor before erin and matt reached the door matt could only feel the keys in his pocket and think gratefully that nothing worked without those keys unless they werent old enough to have learned hotwiring he thought uneasily and erin looked up at his face and grinned she really was a mind reader no they dont know how to hotwire machinery you know theyre not as bad as theyre painted its just that theyre two active enquiring little boys they havent had the supervision theyve needed in the past and they need to be kept busy so my tractor is safe i didnt say that exactly she admittedand grinned keep your keys locked up yes maam he smiled down at her and something stirred within she looked ridiculous he thought as the weird feeling kept right on stirring within his chest crazy in her oversized crimplene and curls that he suspected would tangle two minutes after brushing but she also looked sort of vulnerable and underneath the crazy crimplene and riot of fair curls she looked very very lovely you were saying about tom burrows what it was a big effort to make his mind work on that one when it was thinking about crimplene tom burrows who was tom burrows his mind was wandering all over the placeor maybe it was just wandering to one place tom oh right orphanage director tom burrows the guy who was coming here tonight with pizza while he was having dinner with charlotte why on earth had he ever agreed to have dinner with charlotte business plans future get your head screwed back on mckay he told himself sternly he had things he had to tell this lady rather than stand here like a dummy and try to remember why hed agreed to have dinner with the best cook in the districtand the lady hed bought a velvet box i told tom youre welcome to stay here longterm he told her gruffly until the home is rebuilt she paused at that and turned to face him good grief had he any idea of what he was offering here matt thats really nice of you but have you thought it through rebuilding might take six months thats no problem theres heaps of room the house is underused you need a roof over your heads and im not putting you out on the street the twins can always go into one of our sydney homes but she sounded doubtful at that you dont want them to though do you there was only one answer to that no she told him she sighed and looked up at the twins on the tractor which was unusual in itself matt thought he was looking at her and really seeing her crimplene and all but she was totally focused on her responsibilities this was a bit of a new thing as far as matt was concerned good looking and eligibleextremely eligiblematt wasnt accustomed to young women looking straight through him but there was no doubt about it she was only seeing the twins they havent had much security she was saying bay beach is mostly it really its the only place they know a big city would scare them and youd miss them still he was focused on her she took a deep breath i only have them between trials of new foster parents she told him i cant i shouldnt get too attached maybe tom will have organised another couple to give them a try maybe he would the thought should have pleased mattbut then there was a tiny part of him saying that just maybe having this woman and these kids around for a while would be fun and suddenly the thought hit home that life wasnt much fun any more sure he had a great existence he told himself surprised by the drab thought that had just entered his head he had one of the best farms in the district his stud cattle were internationally renowned and he had more money than he knew what to do with and he had charlotte but but what he really couldnt say he could only react to what was going on right now william was in the drivers seat of the tractor and henry was standing beside him tigger was propped up on the windscreen theyd pushed every button in sight without result and now henry was hauling the gear stick just aching to make something go their aching was irresistible and so was the need to give them what he wanted himself fun i need to check the cattle in the bottom paddock he called up to them im taking the tractor do you want to come for the ride would they ever they stared down at him their eyes as round as saucers is it okay with you matt asked erin maybe he ought to have asked her first but her eyes were glowing and he knew straight away that hed done the right thing sure its okay she said smiling her approval and then she added a rider but only if i can come too you its a very big tractor and we can squash she said theres no need i really will look after them im sure you will well then well then what she put her hands on her hips what mr mckay why cant i come you mean you want to come of course i want to come it looks great it looks great he tried to think of his motheror charlotte for that matterever wanting to ride on his tractor and the thought just wasnt there to conjure they never would in a million years i guess you can he said at last i just didnt think youd want to she gave him a look of blank amazement why on earth would i want to be left behind it looks really really fun she swung herself up into the tractor cab and beamed down at him a twin at each side a conspiratorial trio ripe for adventure he thought and he felt stunned there were four if you counted tigger can i have a go at steering erin asked please they all had a go at steering matt had to take the long way down to the bottom paddock because a couple of minutes steering wasnt enough for any of them the tractor was huge matt usually used it for hauling heavy harvesting equipment not for ferrying passengers but these passengers were entranced and he couldnt figure out who was the most excited to be in the drivers seatthe twins or erin the twins went first of course with matt standing behind them carefully controlling their attempts at driving then erin took the seat and his arms had to lean over her shoulders just as they had with the twins but it feltdifferent it was the crimplene he told himself sternly feeling just a trifle dazed hed never been so close to a woman wearing crimplene but the crimplene wasnt exactly sexy so why did it feel that it was concentrate on cattle the cattle in the bottom paddock were fine the tractor circled them three times just to make sure they circled the cow with her new calf twice and then reluctantly erin turned the wheel to return to the house she was enjoying herself so much the ride had been wonderful it really was the most gorgeous day and theyd been stuck inside with tiggerwashing for most of it the twins faces were glowing and she didnt want to usher them back to the white carpets quite yet maybe you could drive the tractor back to the house and we could walk she told matt but he shook his head nope not unless you want to walk the long way round the paddock between here and the house is due for first hay cutting next week and i dont want you walking in it theres too many joe blakes joe blakes the twins were fascinated as theyd been fascinated by everything matt said in their eyes matt had achieved almost cult statusnot by saving them last night but by saving tigger they thought simply that he was the greatest and they hung onto his every word now they waited with bated breath to hear what he had to say about joe blakes and he didnt let them down snakes he said deliciously and they shivered we breed great big slimy ones hereabouts and theyll be all through that paddock instinctively the boys moved closer to erin and looked nervously down at the ground around the tractor but their small boy need for ghoul meant that it was fineas long as they didnt have to get off the tractor its safe enough to walk through when its cut matt told them but not when its two feet high no they breathed the word as one and matt grinned and suddenly he too was reluctant to end the day so soon there was still an hour and a half before tom was due and he was expected to leave for charlottes he did have things to do this was a working farm but tell you what he said expansively lets take this baby down to the river and have a swim henry its your turn to steer eringive up steering its henrys turn she was like a big kid he thought and grinned she gave a comical grimace and pouted as she relinquished her seat to henry aw rats but a swim she said and looked a question at him now i know we havent brought our costumes and were all wearing our very best clothes that brought a chuckle from all of them but the river here is the safest swimming hole for miles you want to do it once again he thought of his mother and charlotteand then didnt think of them at all as erins face lit up with laughter and delight i cant think of anything wed like more she said definitely thank you mr mckay that would be very nice indeed it was you mean we really can swim in our clothes the twins asked as the tractor slowed at the river bank here the paddock dropped to a sandy curvea gorgeous golden beach leading down to the waters edge the river flowed gently here having almost reached the sea itd be tidal this close to the coast erin thought the water was turquoise and glittering sandybottomed and clear as crystal and the need to swim was now irresistible to all of them i really mean you can swim in your clothes matt said though you might be more comfortable in your knickers are you swimming in your knickers the boys demanded of matt and matt remembered enough about being a small boy to know they intended to do exactly what he did matt eyed the lady she eyed him back and hell he could see what she was thinking she knew exactly what he normally wore when he swam here and the thought was enough to bring a blush to a grown mans cheeks hell um i think ill leave my jeans on he told them and that decided it as far as the boys were concerned then well leave our pants on too fine by me which left erin erin was looking doubtfully down at her crimplene thered been no bra to fit her in the donations pile the bra shed been wearing the night before was still hanging on the washing line so she had no cover underneath her dress at all heaven knew what crimplene would do when it was wet but there was no way in the wide world she was not going to swim in this magic place what are we waiting for she said laughing and shrugging her shoulders okay she was taking a risk with her modesty but what the heck come on twins last one in gets to wash up after pizza to matts surprise the twins could swim like little fish and erin was like a dolphin circling around them its my one life skill she told him surfacing but only up to her neck very carefully up to her neck her fears about the crimplene were justified the moment she hit the water you cant be brought up in bay beach and not swim and i take a personal pride in teaching every one of my charges to survive in water they could do more than survive the twins were doing handstands under water their toes just breaking the surface as they competed to see who could stay under longest it was a game that looked like it could go on for hours matt stayed until he saw that they were safe and then he swum away from them stroking his usual two hundred yards up river and then down again in a way it was a reliefto get away from the lady with the responsibilities and the transparent swimwear as for erin she would have liked to join him he knew guessing instinctively that shed long to stretch out for a good long swim but she didnt she stayed and supervised her boys taking her duties very seriously he watched from a distance liking more and more of what he saw there was a boat an old wooden rowboat moored on a roughly made jetty a hundred yards from where they were swimming it fascinated the twins and matt watched as erin laid down the rules she could see their fascination and she knew trouble when she saw it the boat is out of bounds when matt or i arent with you she told them as their gaze swung instinctively and longingly toward it ill take you out prawning in it one night matt called thats what its for when the twins were nothing if not direct and matt had to smile hed been like this at seven himself when the moons right you cant prawn with a full moon so meanwhile its out of bounds erin fixed the two children with a look promise me youll leave it be why they glared back at her and matts grin broadened yep these two were trouble but you had to admire their spirit and erin was their match because its dangerous to be in without adult supervision the tide could take you out to sea but we wouldnt you might and while youre living with me you obey my rules she finished and she glared at them right back they tried meeting her look head on but finally they conceded how had he known that they would okay we promise william whispered reluctantly one down one to go erins gaze shifted henry i promise too and matt knew that the promise would be kept trouble he thought yep they were trouble but they werent bad kids at heart it was just a matter of guessing what the risks were before they took them and erin was some guesser she was some lady finally he swam back to her as the twins whooped and dived away the boat forgottenor at least put on the backburner as he reached her shed just surfaced from a dive herself they were nose to nose a yard apart and suddenly the whole setup was intensely what he didnt know what he had no experience to describe the way she made him feel she looked amazing he thought completely free of makeup her blonde curls hanging in wet tendrils over her face and to her shoulders and her eyes bright with sunshine and with happiness and this was a lady whod lost everything only the night before maybe her belongings had been in another place he thought he asked her and her face momentarily clouded the pleasure of swimming dissipating nope the home has been my home for years i guess everything i had in the world was burned but then her face was deliberately cleared blocking pain but they were just things i told you before they can be replaced we have the kids and we have tigger who can ask for anything more than that she wouldnt mourn if her white carpet was stained the thought crept in subtly at the edges and held his house was full of beautiful things how would he feel if they were destroyed probably gutwrenchingly dreadful he decided thinking of the paintings his mother had so carefully collected over her lifetime to not care about things was an entirely new conceptas was the way he was looking at erin now hey she was laughing her lovely blue eyes twinkling at him over the water youre looking at me like i just landed from mars im not that bad she surely wasnt different yes a world apart from the world he lived in that too but not bad the boys had dived through the water to shore and were up on the bank instinctively erin turned toward them shed learned early never to take her eyes from them not for a moment true to form theyd headed straight to the only threat as far as the eyes could see there were two long pieces of wood on the shore driftwood brought in by the tide the sticks were worn by the sea to smooth white poles hey thesed make great swords henry yelled and lifted one up william was almost as fast and erin dived away from matt and was at the rivers edge almost before the poles had touched no she said sternly but they tuned out as if they hadnt heard her the poles clashed in salute and clashed again and then the fight was on in earnest robin hood and sheriff of nottinghamwithout the finesse and without the hollywood blunted swords these sticks were big enough to hurt i said no erin was out of the water now stalking toward them she couldnt get closethe sticks were flailing wildly enough for her to be injured if she got in the way william henry you put those sticks down this minute or you will walk home the long way or through the joe blake paddock take your pick there was one more clash but theyd heard her the sticks slowed and their eyes grew thoughtful you know i mean it erin said as if she didnt particularly care what they decided you choose they turned and stared at her and matt whod swum to the shore watched the battle of wills with some surprise this was a side of the twins he hadnt seen they were being crossed and they didnt like it he could have intervened but he didnt this was erins territory after all he thought she was the child expert and she was facing them down with a sternness that told him she had every intention of following through with her threat we want to fight henry said his voice mulishly stubborn and one of you will win and one of you will be hurt those sticks are heavy enough to hurt badly erin said you heard me henry put them down henry turned to william their eyes locked and matt knew they were asking a question of themselves and finally erin won but not happily as if of one accord the boys glowered then turned and threw the sticks as hard as they could across the beach toward the paddock beyond it was just unfortunate that sadie chose that moment to appear from behind the tractor the old dog hadnt been with them during their tourthered simply been no room for her in the tractor cabbut she must have watched the tractors progress from the house when it stopped shed plodded on down to the river to find them just at the wrong time williams stick caught her right across the foreleg she gave one stunned yelp and collapsed she tried to rise yelped again and lay still no matt launched himself up the beach like hed been shot his dog his sadie with one incredulous look at the twins erin followed him her heart sinking to her toes dear heaven just when everything was going beautifully it was always like this with the twins she thought her heart sick with dread it was why no foster family would have them disaster followed them like sunshine followed rain is she hurt erin couldnt see matt was crouched over his dog his whole body tense and all erin could see was one black and white tail it lay ominously still she took those last few steps around him and then sagged in relief as she saw the collie lift her head and look pathetically up at her owner it had been her foreleg then for one awful moment erin thought maybe shed been mistaken in what shed seen and the stick had caught her head her leg was bad enough though it was bleeding sluggishly at the point of impact and matts face was grim as death theyd be out of here tonight erin thought bleakly as she looked down at the lovely old dog and they deserved it oh no matt im so sorry so am i but its not you who should be apologising matts voice matched the grimness of his face one hand was cradling the old dogs head the other was carefully examining the injured leg maybe its not so bad i cant feel a break and shes holding it up she was too when matt released the legjust half an inch from the ground so it couldnt be further hurt if it fellsadie kept it up as much as to say look at this it hurts she really is a bit of a hypochondriac matt told erin in an undervoice so the twins couldnt hear but it was a fair whack shell have to be checked ill pay the vets bill heaven knew her wages werent sufficient to cover all shed have to buy in the next few weeks but this it was her fault she thought bleakly she should have seen the sticks she should have moved faster shed let herself be distracted by matt erin dont i told you before its not you who should be apologising matt cradled his dog and looked up at her she looked so distressed that he couldnt bear it damn shed been through enough because of these kids she was so lovely standing there in her crazy crimplene that had turned totally translucent with the water she looked actually she looked naked maybe hed better concentrate on his dogand on the twins he told himself firmly as erin was so distressed then it was time for him to take a hand in the twincontrol stakes what these kids needed to learn was consequences but what the twins were standing side by side ashenfaced and flinching he looked up at them and he knew instinctively that these kids had been beaten in the past beaten beyond reason they werent in an orphanage for nothing nobody loved this pair and they knew it so now their faces were stoic expecting pain they were expecting the world to come crashing down around their ears as it had so obviously done in the past what had erin said of them they expect to be rejected they expected it now they were waiting for a good thrashing and to be sent away and a glance at erins face said she thought the same oh not the thrashingbecause she was herebut she was surely expecting him to toss them out come here he told them and then when they didnt move he lowered his voice a notch henry william i said come here now with an uncertain look at each other they came slowly their shoulders touching they came waiting for what was to come but waiting together erins whole body tensed she was like a mother hen matt thought if he laid a finger on these boys no matter how justified he was hed have her to contend with and he just knew that taking her on would be some task he was doing no such thing but the boys had to face up to what theyd done youve hurt sadie he said and waited for what most kids would say william did itor we didnt mean to or it wasnt our fault they said none of those instead their faces fell to sadie and the knowledge that had hit home when hed watched them with tigger in the dryer was reinforced yet again these kids werent bad they cared their loyalty once won was won forever so no he wouldnt thrash them and he wouldnt throw them out wewere sorry henry whispered and one glistening tear slid down his cheek only one these kids had schooled themselves not to show emotion and it didnt show now being sorry wont help sadie matt growled immeasurably moved despite his anger you need to do something that will like it was henry again william was trembling and the urge to lift the child and give him a hug was almost overwhelming erin though was managing to hold her hug instincts in check she was leaving this to him like what henry whispered and matt made a snap decision we need to take sadie to the vet to make sure the legs not broken ill call first but before that we need to get her back to the house that means we all have to squeeze on the tractor because im not leaving erin behind you two climb up behind the drivers seat sit down and make your knees as flat as you can then ill hand her up to you youll carry her on your knees youll be uncomfortable but i cant help that erin can you ride on the step sure of course anything right lets move chapter five it didnt stop there back at the house matt carried his dog inside to her basket he telephoned the vet and then he turned to the boys okay you have two minutes to get changed because youre coming with me but it was erin and he turned to face her his face was still implacable but then she saw the tiniest glint of laughter behind his eyes and her own widened with astonishment im pretty sure the legs just bruised he told her as the boys disappeared toward their bedroom and dry clothes but ive prewarned ted our local vet hell play it upas i suspect sadies playing it for all shes worth she was hit by a car when she was a pup i pandered to her dreadfully while she recuperated and now every time shed like a little snacksay when im eating a nice juicy steakshell look pathetic and limp oh sadie erin stooped down and hugged the big dog lying pathetically in her basket her leg just slightly raised as if to say what a thing to suggestim fatally wounded here you wouldnt do that would you she would matt knelt too which was sort of nice he decided erin was still gorgeously transparentliterallyand kneeling beside her was quite an experience thats not to say the whack by the stick didnt hurt though i bet it did and now he patted his old dogs head she likes the vet well buy her some rump steak on the way home and the boys just might have a lesson in consequences erin took a deep breath thank you for not yelling at them she said softly and he smiled at her mistake she smiled back and something strange happened something indefinable but real incredibly real its its my pleasure he told her in a voice that was suddenly none too steady now if youll excuse me ill go put some dry clothes on as well thatd be good erin thought inconsequentially hed been swimming barechested he was still barechested and crouched beside her he was suddenly far too large and far toofar too male and far too something she couldnt define in the least do you want me to come too she asked she should they were her charges no he told her breaking the moment finally by rising and backing a step or two this business is between me and the boys you stay here and wait for tom theres enough on your plate without worrying about my dog he was right only i should stay with the twins delegate responsibility he told her and just for a fleeting moment he touched her damp curls that was a mistake as it happened because the something that was between them intensified a hundredfold he caught his breath and tried for a dignified exit just for an hour or so he told her just for a while i want you to think of yourself and let me worry about the twins he left her but he didnt leave her thinking about the twinsor herself for that matter all she could think of was matt there was no harm at all in letting them go with him it was tom the head of the home service had arrived at matts farm before matt sadie and the twins returned from the vet and erin was feeling dreadful when shed finally got her muddled thoughts back into order shed gone straight back to concentrating on the twins and now she was imagining the worst what sort of chaos could they cause in a veterinary surgery however when she told tom what was happening his eyes grew thoughtful and he nodded his approval dont worry matts a sound man erin he told her i spent some time with him this afternoon and by the end of it i decided hes the sort of person who if he applied as a foster parent id be approving in a flash theres not much chance of that erin gave her boss a half hearted smile you take one look at this house and you can see that and when you meet the lady he intends to marry was that the woman he was with this afternoon toms craggy eyebrows raised in surprise charlotte i didnt know he was engaged i dont think he is yet erin told him but i gather marriage to matt has been charlottes intention for years shes knocked back perfectly good offers while matt went out with other women faithfulness personified is our charlotte and i cant see him letting her down now in fact she took a deep breath and wondered why there was a strange constricting feeling around her heart i have a feeling theres an engagement ring in the truck right now i saw something that definitely looked like a ring box maybe he was planning on popping the question last night i cant see it happening tom shook his head i took to matt right away but i didnt take to her shes a cold piece of work then he smiled relegating charlotte to his list of the least of his worries nevertheless shes useful for some things he motioned to the back of his car shes great at shopping she did all this all what erin followed his gaze clothes shopping none of the rest of us could do it loris flat out taking care of the baby all the other house parents have their hands full with problem kids and wendys taken in michael and tess we knew youd be desperate for a change of clothes and you cant go shopping in welfare handouts matt remembered you were wendys bridesmaid so he rang her to find your size and we had the boys on file we bullied an emergency contingency cheque from the insurers then matt sent charlotte shoppingand there you go erin stared there i go more clothes than you can poke a stick at he told her he lifted the pizzas from the passenger seat clothes courtesy of your matts organisation and his charlottes happiness to shop and dinner courtesy of me i hope this place runs to a microwave so we can reheat these when the twins return it runs to everything she said staring at the parcels and itching to undo them matt had organised this was this why hed had to take charlotte into town the thought warmed her to her toes and made it difficult to concentrate on anything else somehow she had to manage it what were they talking about oh yeah matts house honestly tom its a display home she said at last i dont see how we can stay here i dont see how you can do anything else he told her its an answer to a prayer theres nowhere else i can put you the only alternative is me laying you off for six months leaving you unemployed and me sending the boys to sydney that was some choice it sure took her mind off parcels but even so youre prepared to keep paying me as a house mother if i stay on here erin was incredulous i am i had an emergency briefing with the board before leaving sydney this morning he told her the problems the twins and i told them that theyre getting too old to place no one wants to take on two sevenyearolds with a history of trouble and i wont separate them no the very idea was dreadful everyone wants babies tom said sadly i could place a hundred marigolds littlies are easy but once theyre over six people believe that the damage has already been done the twins are stillsalvageable erin said softly theyre still capable of attachment thats why i put your case so strongly to the board tom told her if we take them to sydney theyll have to go into one of the bigger homeseven if its only for a short whileand i hate the idea it could do so much damage we may have these kids on our hands for the long term erin house mothers are supposed to be shortterm parents while we find foster homes or adoptive parents but its not happening here he shook his head but he was watching her face and seeing acceptance of what he was asking even more commitment to the twins its asking a lot and separation at the end will be more difficult but the alternatives worse he told her gently if you can care for them here for a while longer id appreciate it ill do my damnedest to find them some other couple as soon as i can but its looking bleak i dont have a choice then do i erin asked and tom shook his head again no matts offer is far too good to knock back hes said hell take you for the full six months he fixed her then with his all seeing look tom had been around and he knew his staff as he watched the trouble washing over her face a sudden thought occurred to him its not putting you into an awkward position is it he demanded then he brightened i guess it cant be if the mans engaged to be married therell be no hassles no but she sounded doubtful he picked up on her doubt straight away and he pounced you dont trust him i trust him all right erin said as she turned away with the pizza boxes and then she added a rider that was meant for her ears only im just not sure i can trust myself her legs just badly bruised we didnt break it they burst in like miniature time bombs exploding into the kitchen with their news momentarily they paused as they saw tom but theyd been dealing with tom all their lives and apart from lowering their voices a notch it didnt stop them telling erin what was important the vet says its just grazed and bruised but hes wrapped it up in a great big white bandage and he says shes not to walk on it for a week which is just what is going to happen following the twins was matt carrying sadie in his arms he lay the big dog down in her basket she looked pathetically up at himand then she wagged her tail the wag destroyed the pathetic image completely and erin had to grin not mortally injured huh not the boys had spotted the pizza which demanded their immediate and undivided attentionwhich left matt free to speak to erin and tom im glad to see you again he told tom its my pleasure to be here tom beamed at what was happening around him a man a woman two kids and a dog this was a great family situation perfect if hed tried to engineer a better placement for the twins he couldnt have done it a sudden idea flashed into his head his eyes grew thoughtful and his smile widened as erin shooed the boys out to wash their hands before eating hmm double hmm i brought enough pizza for the lot of us he said expansively he was suddenly feeling expansive he was a man who liked a good happy ending if he could possibly arrange it there are four different types help yourself then he watched matts face with interestand he liked what he saw what he saw was confusion the pizzas smelled great matt had decided but that alone was really really strange matt was a bachelor and pizza was his staple foodexcept hed become fed up to the back teeth with pizza normally hed run a mile to avoid it and something gastronomically wonderful was waiting for him at charlottes but suddenly all he wanted to do was haul up a chair sit down beside erin and eat pizza umno he gave a half hearted grin i have a date with charlotte erin told tom and tom nodded politely but his eyes were still thoughtful his idea once planted refused to be dissipated by a small obstacle like a fiancée his idea was wonderful well off you go boy he told him i daresay erin wont wait up for you she certainly wont erins eyes creased into laughter im pooped already too much excitement last night and then a swim on top of it i wonder how you can face a night out but hes going to see the woman he loves tom said watching matts face and getting answers to unspoken questions that were most satisfactory i expect he wont find that tiring in the least the woman he planned to marry was waiting for him shed been ready for hours and the cooking smells hit him before he opened the door of the truck wow they were great smells and then charlotte was running lightly down the front steps of her house greeting him with a hug as he pushed open the door and he had to acknowledge that she looked just beautiful matt darling i thought youd never come no more house fires tonight no more fires tonight he put her away from him and smiled down at her she really was incredibly lovelyand those smells but it wasnt quail i thought you were reheating last nights dinner he said suddenly uneasy thats why i agreed to comeso it wouldnt be wasted well yes she blushed and fluttered her eyelashes at him but her eyes slid sideways i sort of thoughtwell i saw the box when i was in the truck this afternoon you see and i thought lobster thermidor was the very least i could produceand dom pérignon champagne to go with it the box hell the box it was still sitting where hed left it last night two thousand bucks worth of diamond and it had completely slipped his mind hed had it sitting in the truck all day and he hadnt even locked the truck or thought that whoever sat in the passenger side would see it and now charlotte was looking at him with eyes that glowed then looking past him to where the damned velvet box was still sitting in the map compartment she was expecting him to ask her to marry him well why not he demanded of himself and wondered why he felt so reluctant to move further this was what hed planned to do all along he told himself hed thought about it long and hard it was the sensible decision butthe twins charlotte ive offered to take the twins for six months he told her hastily thats fine apparently it wasnt an impediment it wasnt charlotte had heard matt make his offer to tom this afternoon and her mind had been working in overdrive since then there was no way she wanted that woman living with mattbut maybe she could cope with the twins just for a few months if she must all they needed was a little discipline tom didnt like our idea of the stables she said in a voice that hinted at her opinion of orphanage directors who werent grateful for any charity they could get but ive been thinking about it if erin stays with you theres a home mother completely taken up with only two children so what if we get married quite soon and look after them ourselves for charlotte this was a definite possibility unknown to her beloved shed had her wedding gown and her wedding plans ready for years this would not be a rush we could go away for a lovely honeymoon she told him taking his hands in hers and smiling her most beautiful smile im sure my manager here would take over your farm while were away and wed be combining the properties anyway then we can come back and erin could leave he was stunned you have it all figured out mmm she beamed and then looked into the truck again the box was irresistible its so sensible she leaned in lifted the box from where it lay opened it and stared down at the solitary diamond and gasped oh matt its just beautiful but he was still uneasy charlotte i dont know look lets not worry about the twins and erin tonight she said sliding the ring onto her finger with a triumphant flourish and tucking her arm in his with proprietorial ease in truth i dont know when i can organise the wedding but ill try to do it as soon as possible for now lets just concentrate on being engagedand tackling our lobster and champagne its cost me a fortune and i refuse to let it spoil for now were celebrating our engagement the rest can all be sorted out over the next few days hell how had he managed that he thought as he drove home three hours later he was engaged to be married well hed made the decision when hed bought the ring he might have known charlotte probably had spies in the jewellers this town was too small for secrets and even if he hadnt left the damned ring in the truck she would have known hed bought it it was impossible to back out now and why would he want to he thought that through forcing his confused mind to be sensible this was a sensible well thoughtout decision he told himself firmly charlotte was a lovely woman and shed been faithful to him for years shed make a loving wife and a wonderful homemaker shed never appear naked in wet crimplene and hed never want her to he told himself but he knew deep down that he was a liar or maybe he wasnt he wouldnt want charlotte in wet crimplenebut erin was a different matter hell hed expected them all to be in bed erin wasnt she was sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by opened parcels she was sorting clothes into piles and as he walked in her eyes lifted to his and glowed with pleasure matt these are excellent charlottes been so good theyre great sensible clothes the sort that we can really work in around the farm theyre just what we need he walked forward and fingered the clothes yep they were sensible jeans tshirts windcheaters sneakersgreat for the boys sensible for erin but he sort of liked the crimplene yeah and he knew why he grinned at himself and thrust the memory of erin in wet crimplene onto the backburner thered be no more of that now charlotte had outdone herself these were quality clothes carefully chosen erin would look practical in these clothes like a sensible hardworking home mother a woman who knew her place in the world they wouldnt turn transparent when wet they were built to cover everything charlotte wouldnt be seen dead in these clothes that was an uncharitable thought he decided hastily pushing it away with a definite shrug charlotte wore quality linen blouses and tailored skirts or slacks he knew instinctively that erin wouldnt like charlottes style of clothes and these were much morewell sensible so shed done the right thing to criticise charlottes choice of clothes was to be unfair to the woman hed just promised to marry orshe was the lady hed just seen put his ring on her finger he thought suddenly hed never actually said the words will you marry me hed never actually promised anything it didnt matter he told himself harshly she was wearing his ring and shed wear it now for ever tomorrow shed tell the world and he should too starting now charlotte and i are engaged he told erin her eyes flew to his there was the merest fraction of hesitationand then she rose her pile of denim fell back onto the table erins face creased into a smile of delight for himshe really did seem delightedand she walked forward took both his hands in hers and kissed him lightly on the forehead matt thats wonderful im very very happy for you the whole towns been expecting it for ever then she stood back a little her eyes twinkling with understanding it was supposed to happen last night though wasnt it this lady had the knack of knowing things hed rather she didnt but there was no point in denying what was obvious it just disconcerted him yes he thought for a moment of telling her the rest of charlottes plans and then thought better of it weddings took ages to organise please let it be six months erins thoughts were still on charlotte unaware of the threat the marriage posed to her boys a charlotte mother poor charlotte she was saying no wonder she looked so downcast yesterday matt im so sorry we messed with your plans he wasnt and he wouldnt let erin be sorry either hey it got me lobster instead of quail he told her and she chuckled erin had the most delicious chuckle and to think you missed out on pizza poor old you lobster and a new fiancée tch and our pizza was bay beachs best he grinned at her erins laughter was infectious yep its a real shame mmm still she was smiling and he suddenly could think of nothing else to say all he could think of was how blindingly attractive her smile was funny hed never seen it before maybe it was because he was engaged he thought erin was now forbidden fruit he was engaged to be married he was happily engaged to be married forbidden fruit indeed so he should leave he should go to bed instead he stood stupidly fingering the pile of new clothes charlottes bought you everything you need yes she should have brought you something pretty he said inconsequentially you cant just wear jeans and windcheaters theres not a lot of call for me to wear anything else she told him bluntly these are just fine but you go to dances and things only when im off duty i dont expect ill be off duty for a while i can look after the twins sometimes he told her if you want to go out he took a deep breath like tomorrow go to town tomorrow theres still plenty left from toms insurance cheque go and buy yourself something nice i hardly need pretty things tomorrow you never know he stared down at the jeans with distaste and noticed a pile of flannelette pyjamas he looked more closely and discovered they were all the same charlotte had bought three sets of red flannelette pyjamas two small pairs and one larger set his mouth tightened in distaste as he lifted them for inspection and these he said shortly theyre wrong i dont know what charlotte was thinking of buying matching sleepwear theyll make you and the boys look like something out of an institution erin agreed but she was forced to defend charlotte she had to be grateful matt theyre new and clean and the boys wont notice theyll be fine theyre not fine and ill notice he growled and her gorgeous chuckle rang out again oh no you wont these are pyjamas mr mckay worn in bed you need never see them i dont want to theyre dreadful theyre sensible theyll be hot as be damned its almost summer youre not wearing them tonight ill wear them her eyes were defiantbut still twinkling its them or nothingand im definitely not wearing nothing erin in nothing where had that thought come from erin not in her crimplene erin in less hell he had to get out of here he was a sensibly engaged man just as well or anything could have happened well talk about it in the morning he told her but he grabbed the package there was no way he was letting her wear those pyjamas meanwhile wear a tshirt or something these are going back to the shop yes sir her tone was half mocking and he grimaced did she know what hed been thinkingand what he was feeling right now somehow he knew that she did he glowered and glowered some more good im glad you agree it doesnt mean im not grateful for charlottes thoughtfulness she wasnt but she wouldnt admit it for worlds she turned to gather her clothing together and he stood watching her for a couple of moments erin was wearing the dress shed been wearing the night before when the home burned downone of her charlottedecreed homemade jobs it was pale blue with lemon swirls with a couple of fire stains she hadnt been able to remove by scrubbing stained or not it made her look it made her look as if the jeans and windcheaters charlotte had chosen were totally unsuitable suddenly he had a thought this was one thing that was suitable at least erin yes she paused from her clothes gathering and looked up in enquiry she was expecting him to go to bed and leave her he thought she was expecting nothing from him at all he felt his midriff clench in sudden pain hell he wanted to do something for her so badly and all he had was this he shoved his hand into his back pocket and found what hed been searching for tom showed me the layout of your house and which was your bedroom he told her his suddenly gruff voice failing to hide his inexplicable emotion yes there were a few things we were able to salvage her face stilled it wasnt all completely burned the roof burned and the ceiling caved in he told her seeing her sudden look of hope and wanting to dispel it before it started the weight of the ceiling and the soot and smoke and water effectively destroyed most of your stuff but the base of your bedroom didnt actually catch fire the roof caved in while it was still smouldering but it was doused fast so the lads from the fire brigade and i made a really good search and we found these and he lifted up what he was holdinga string of seed pearls as pearls went they were what hed been brought up to believe were inadequate both his mother and charlotte would have scorned these as trumpery he knew but to erin to erin they werent trumpery she stared at the string dangling from his fingers then took a tentative step forward as if she couldnt believe what she was seeing my mothers necklace she whispered the words it was as if she wasnt able to believe what she was seeing and any minute theyd be snatched back from her its the only trinket we found that was recognisable he told her did you have much jewellery thats all i had she lifted it from his fingers and stared down at it still disbelieving oh matt im sorry we couldnt retrieve more stuff he said awkwardly but she lifted her face to his and her eyes were bright with unshed tears then before he knew what she was aboutbefore he could take one step to defend himselfshe threw her arms around his neck raised herself on her tiptoes and kissed him soundly on the lips it was a kiss of thanksnothing more it was a kiss of gratitude so how it had the capacity to knock him sidewaysto have him catch her waist in his hands and pull her in to him and kiss her backto feel like his world was shifting on its axis and shifting foreverwho could say matt couldnt he could only feel but feel he did he felt the way her body felt delicious under his hands the way her mouth yielded to his and the touch of her hair against his the moulding of her breasts to his chestthe fragrance of her he didnt understand this in the least he could only feel and feel some more and when she finally pulled away he could only regret her parting and regret it with every inch of his being oh matt thank you she whispered and the tears in her eyes were real now threatening to slide down her cheeks she blinked them back fast and furious and then made a grab for her pile of clothes carefully sorted heaps were ignored they were crumpled into one vast mound of clothes gathered against her breast almost as a defence goodnight matt and then she fled taking her clothes and her necklace twinwards before her tears finally were allowed to run free she left matt staring after her wondering what the hell hed just done hed just restored a necklace to its owner and now something else needed restoring but it was nothing tangible in fact he didnt have a clue what it was but it was a long time before he slept that night and when he slept he didnt dream of the lady he was about to marry he dreamed of seed pearl necklaces and he dreamed of erin chapter six despite the emotions of the day erin slept soundly in fact she slept more soundly than she remembered sleeping for years it was because matt was here she thought as she drifted toward unconsciousness as house mother she always slept on the brink of waking there was always a child in need and before that her mother had died when erin was just fourteen erin had been the oldest of the kids her father had crumpled with her mothers death so shed reared her siblings with love and also she had to admit with pleasure when the last child left home she moved on to being an orphanage house mother but her choice of career meant that from the time she was fourteen thered always been a child dependent on her there was no one else to share her load but here at the other end of the house slept matt she wasnt totally in charge the feeling was novel and she shouldnt indulge it but in truth it was also wonderful she indulged it the twins slept soundly and erin totally relaxed she slept on dreamlessly and she couldnt guess that at the other end of the house matt stirred and tossed and fretted because he couldnt get her out of his head erin woke at dawn when matt crept silently into the room next door she might have been sleeping soundly but she was still a house mother some things were instinctive and protection was one of them the moment the twins bedroom door opened her eyes were wide and she was pushing herself up in bed wondering what was wrong shed propped the bathroom doors open between the two rooms so she could see and she could see clearly straight through matt was in his working clothes and he was tiptoeing towards the twins whats wrong it came out as a whispered croak of surprise he cast her a look of annoyanceannoyance with himself for waking her hell erin im sorry you go back to sleep im after the twins she found her right voice what on earth for the twins hurt my dog he explained so i told them last night that they need to accept responsibility for what theyd done sadie needs to rest for a week and therefore the twins need to take over sadies workload he reached the bed the boys were still sharing and touched two small shoulders okay guys wake up its six am you know what we need to do and amazingly they did they opened their eyes they smiled shyly up at matt as if this had been expected and to erins astonishment they moved straight into dress mode what on earth are you doing tell her boys matt smiled at herand then he carefully diverted his attention elsewhere hell what was happening here following orders erin was wearing one of the welfare shirts as sleepwear it was buttoned to the neck and it was a mans shirt to boot but the sight of erin fresh from sleep tousled and rumpled with her curls flying free and her gorgeous blue eyes wide with enquiry somehow had the power to make something inside him kick hard luckily a twin spoke giving him time to gather his wits were rounding up the cows henry told erin solemnly hauling on the illfitting trousers hed worn the day before you have new clothes to wear now erin told him and then took on board what henry had said rounding up cows the boys dont need new clothes to do what they need to do matt told her still carefully concentrating on the twins in fact new clothes would be completely wasted were cutting cecil out from where hes been serving the cows hes due at the lassendale cattle show tomorrow the lassendale show youre still half asleep matt told her kindly william that windcheaters inside out surely you know the lassendale show erin and you a farmers daughter and all right of course she did the whole farming world knew the show he was talking about but shed never been there well why would she lassendale was a showcase of the cream of the countrys pedigree cattle and a prize from the lassendale judges meant the making or breaking of a stud farmer of course matt would be showing youre putting cecil in the show i surely am and then erin started feeling strange too matt was adjusting williams windcheater and the sight of him dressing the little boya job she should be doing herselfdid strange things to her insides things she didnt understand in the least she hauled her bedclothes up to her neck in an instinctive act of defence but for the life of her she couldnt think what she was defending and the boys she managed i cant cut a bull out of that herd without a good dog he told her his eyes twinkling hed overcome his unease in the face of her discomfortor maybe it was because shed hauled the sheet up so far or failing a dog then two obedient twins which i have here dont i boys yes william said the word solemnly and henry nodded his agreement now theres no need for you to get up matt told her ill give the boys some milk and a piece of toast each and well have a proper breakfast when were finished you go back to sleep back to sleep such a thing was unheard of go back to sleep when the twins were awake no youre not wanted matt told her making his voice severe is she boys cutting out bulls is mans work but matt she was bewildered by the plan a bull cecil is a pussy cat he told her seeing what her major worry was dont fret yourself you know i wouldnt let the boys near anything i considered dangerous with these two to help me well have him back to the yard in no time then well scrub him down make him beautiful and then we can introduce him to you personally but stop arguing and go back to sleep matt sleep sleep ha go back to sleep hed said but it was just plain impossible erin lay in bed and listened to the sounds of the boys in the kitchen she heard matt talking and she heard the boys giggling in response giggling they sounded just like they did when they were plotting trouble erin thought but the difference here was that matt was plotting trouble for them excellent trouble cutting a bull from the herd was just the sort of adventure they craved and to do it with such a wondrous person as matt he was wondrous erin thought sleepily he knew instinctively how to act with the boys take responsibility for your actions shed tried and tried to drum that into them and here was matt doing exactly that yesterday theyd hurt sadie so today they were doing sadies job she desperately wanted to join them but she knew that to do so would spoil it for them this was mens work matt had decreed and for erin to interfere to have their house mother hovering over them fussing and bossing while they did it would spoil it in a way she instinctively understood so somehow she forced herself to lie still then the bedroom door opened again and it was william carefully balancing a cup of tea matt said youd like this behind him was henry carrying a plate of toast with marmalade erin blinked and blinked again breakfast in bed good grief and matt was in the doorway behind them watching his charges with pride as they wobbled their responsibilities to her bedside tablewithout a single spill well done boys he told them he looked at erin and he winked okay lady wrap yourself around your breakfast then put your head on the pillow and sleepwhile we men go off and organise the world okay men lets go round us up some beef cattle she couldnt do it she physically couldnt lie in bed and do nothing it nearly killed her she drank her tea and ate her toast then lay and stared at the ceiling for all of half an hour then sadie sidled in and put her nose on the bedcover and erin fondled the old dogs ears and smiled in sympathy she knew exactly what the dog was thinking weve been made redundant girl she said softly and sadie waved her silky tail in agreement how does that make you feel sadie flopped down on the mat beside the bed put her head on her forelegs and sighed it makes you feel funny too another sigh i suppose i could just go see what theyre doing she told the dog from a distance sadie looked up at her with hope and erin shook her head not you girl you have a sore leg to look after then at the look on sadies face she burst into laughter oh you fraud you pulled a con and now youre feeling like youd like to change your mind she leaned down and lightly touched sadies bandaged leg im sorry girl but youre going to have to put up with it i have a feeling your leg might be more important than you know there was another sigh at that and erin was starting to feel like the dog understood every word she said which was good because erin surely needed someone to talk to i know how you feel she told her but for more reasons than one you need to keep your nose out of it but erin wasnt keeping her nose out if she stayed in that bed any longer shed bust something if there was one thing being brought up on a farm with seven siblings had taught her it was how to hide years of hide and seek had made her a master of the art erin washed and dressed with speed and then made her way down the paddocks moving from the concealment of one clump of river gums to another with the ease of a master the mustering teammatt and his dogcumtwinswere easy enough to find the boys were whooping and yipping loud enough to wake the fishermen back in bay beach their targeted herd of cows was moving uneasily away from this unknown quantity and by the time she reached the edge of the paddock where they were erin had a clear idea of what matt was doing he was using the boys just like hed use a working dog maybe they didnt have as much finesse as sadie possessed but his team strategy was effective all the same it was simple really matt would send the twins into the herd whooping at the top of their lungs and effectively splitting it down the centre half the herd would move one way and matt would concentrate on keeping the half containing cecil the bull packed tight into the fenced corner ignoring the rest they then had a smaller herd to work with once the herd was where matt wanted the twins moved in again to split a smaller herd with each foray of yipping and yelling they made the controlled group smaller and finally there was just cecil a confusedlooking beast but a magnificent specimen of hereford bull all the same he stood in his corner a twin at each side and matt before him while erin watched from her safe distance matt slipped a rope through the ring in the bulls nose the huge animal looked up at matt in a resigned sort of way and then he started plodding steadily toward the house before matt so much as tugged on the rope hed done this a thousand times before his body language said and while he might have tried his darndest to escape now that he was cornered like matt had said he was a real pussy cat so much so that erin wasnt surprised when matt slipped the rope into henrys hand so he could lead him and then scooped william up to ride on the bulls broad back the twins were so light the bull would hardly notice his burden he didnt cecil plodded on without changing stride you ride halfway and then swap with henry matt told them and from where she stood in the cluster of gums by the paddocks boundary erin could see the twins collective shoulders expand a notch or six theyd be so proud of what they were doing all their attention was on the bull henry was leading the bull with the solemnity of an undertaker leading a funeral procession and william was clinging on as if he expected cecil to buck and as she watched matt fell behind then turned his head toward the trees where erin was hiding and he waved and grinned caught for a split second erin hesitated then she grinned and waved back drat the man he had eyes in the back of his head she wasnt wanted though she could see that she left them to it and went quietly back to the house she was a house mother without charges and it felt very peculiar indeed by the time they finished doing what they were doing she was fed up with being a house mother without charges she desperately wanted to be part of it the urge to go out to the sheds was almost overwhelming instead somehow she made herself organise the boys clothing make the beds prepare another breakfast talk to sadie talk to herself im going nuts she told the dog i dont think id be very good at living alone shed been alone for three hours and it felt weird what are they doing out there she didnt know and sadie couldnt help her so they sat in the kitchen and waited and it was hard to know which of them was more frustrated finally they reappeared they were filthy the twins were mud splattered soaking wet and they were beaming from ear to ear they stood at the back door and fought for the rights to tell her everything all at once weve cleaned him and soaped him all over and now he shines and shines hes beautiful i rode on his back william squirted matt with the hose but he didnt mean to and matt didnt mind then matt appeared behind them and he was just as filthy as the twins wereand his grin said he was just as happy with his mornings work he smiled at erin and then looked doubtfully down at himself were a bit dirty to come in he told her she nodded trying not to laugh they were all so pleased with themselves but that mud i think you should stay outside she told them aw erin both twins howled a protest and then saw she was laughing their small faces relaxed and they took a tentative step over the threshold stop this minute she stopped them in their tracks in a voice that charlotte or matts dead mother would be proud of go not one inch further matt blinked he hadnt thought it of her and he was right she wasnt worried about her kitchen floor she was concerned about something else do you have a camera she asked and when he nodded she made him tell her where to find it because youre not getting rid of one spot of that gorgeous mud until ive documented this moment she told them i want a photograph of you guys standing next to a beautiful cecil so i can remember this moment for the rest of my life it wasnt just a memory for erin she took the photograph from three different angles with matt standing proudly one hand on each twins shoulder and all beside matts magnificent gleaming bull and she knew this photograph would be precious for many reasons the boys had so few memories so few possessions if she took copies of this and framed it itd become as valued as tigger the tiger she thought and she finished taking the shot and raised her eyes to matt in gratitude thank you she said and her words held a whole wealth of meaning he got it in one my pleasure he told her and if his voice wasnt quite steady it wasnt for the want of trying then they trooped through the kitchen showered the boys inspected and accepted and donned their new clothes and they breakfasted properly they sat at matts big kitchen table and wrapped themselves around bacon and eggs and toast and cereal while erin watched with amazement at what they were demolishing the boys were normally picky eaters now they ate and talked and ate and talked like there was no tomorrow and all the time matt watched like a benevolent genie whod wrought this change with a wave of a magic wand they were great kids he was thinking the best do you like your new clothes erin asked and they nodded over slices of watermelon matt had done a vast grocery shop the day before and hed done them proud hed had to do a few things since hed granted mrs gregory her holiday but he was finding that he didnt mind in the least the house was the cosier for it it was also messier matt looked ruefully down at the tracks he and the twins had made across the kitchen floor which mrs gregory wouldnt have tolerated to stay while she cooked breakfast but it was definitely cosier nice but we dont like your clothes henry was telling erin and matt agreed entirely whats wrong with mine erin looked down at her beautifully fitting jeans and longsleeved shirt theyre great you wear dresses henry said stubbornly and william tilted his chin in agreement and matt found himself with the kids yep erin wore dresses she looked great in dresses even the crimplene go into town and buy yourself something decent he growled now today i can look after the twins my dresses are homemade she told him so my mothers sewing machine is still here buy yourself what you need and ill twinsit while you sew well help the twins announced and erin grinned at the thought that conjured up oh great i can see a twin sewed into each side of the zipperwith sadies nose at the bottom they chuckled at that but matt wasnt to be sidetracked seriously erin mmm it was time for her to tilt her chin he tilted his right back he could be obstinate too the clothes charlotte bought were just to tide you over until you got a wardrobe you liked he glanced at his watch the drapers open on saturday afternoon you could go in now but the twins the twins and i have more work to do he told her and im more than capable of looking after them by myself then he paused at the sound of a car pulling up outside he knew that sound and maybe i dont have to he continued heres the help i need it was charlotte of course it was charlotte and erin schooled her face into an expression of pleasure after all charlotte had shopped for her and she was matts affianced wife the fact that erin had never been able to stand the woman should be irrelevant so as charlotte walked into the kitchenwithout knockingshe found matt and erin smiling a welcome and the twins looking up from their bacon with expressions of distrust the distrust was nothing new or personal the twins distrusted the world youre still eating breakfast charlotte as beautifully presented as ever in her smart slacks and blouse and beautifully arranged chignon stopped on the threshold and stared at them all in amazement her eyes fluttered to the delicate silver watch on her wrist matt darling its ten oclock and then she saw the mud on the floor and her breath drew in horror what on earth has been going on theyve been cleaning cecil erin told her rising and crossing to the woman at the door she kept her smile straight took charlottes hands in hers and kissed her lightly on the cheek before charlotte could pull away i hear congratulations are in order youre engaged to be married thats lovely news charlotte and youre not to be disgusted with us this is our second breakfastand the mud is cecil mud cecil charlotte thought this through and her face cleared oh the bull of course youve been cleaning your wonderful bull for tomorrows show but matt you know you should have stripped at the dooror made the children do it at least she regarded the twins as one might regard two interesting but slightly disgusting creatures from the sea and it took an almost herculean effort for erin to keep her smile pinned on itll only take minutes to mop but the troops were hungry she told her well i guess it was in a good cause charlotte said reluctantly as long as you do intend mopping erin i dont see that matt has the time were leaving at the crack of dawn tomorrow youre leaving it was henry his eyes swivelling toward matt his face was horrified im taking cecil to the show matt told him its a twoday affair so ill only be away for one night his brow creased i didnt think you were coming charlotte ive managed to find a place at the hotel she told him the royals very expensive but it still has places she gave her tinkling laugh the laugh that made erin shudder i thoughtnow that were engaged we should do things together urk the boys winced and inwardly erin winced along with them charlottes sweetness was almost repelling and it seemed matt found it almost as distasteful he dredged up a smile and rose carrying his plate across to the sink well thats great then he turned back to erin and his face was under control again erin now that charlottes here i want you to hop it go into town and do your shopping but what for charlotte looked from erin to matt and back to erin i did all the shopping you could possibly want yesterday and it was wonderful erin told her but matt shook his head charlotte if everything you owned in the world was destroyed by fire could you imagine another woman supplying you with everything you need on one shopping trip without even discussing it with you first you dont think that erin might just want to buy a couple of things herself i guess charlotte faltered at matts logic but she obviously didnt in her view erin was a charity case and charity cases deserved what they got but matt was no longer listening go erin ill just clean upand the boys can come with me no matts voice was implacable he took her shoulders steered her to the door and forcibly propelled her out charlotte and the boys and i will clear up and then well take hay around the cattle well be so busy well hardly miss you i dont expect you back here before four oclock so go she cast one worried look at the twins but matt wasnt taking no for an answer if youre sure im sure and sos charlotte arent you sweetheart charlotte was stumped there was nothing for a well broughtup young woman to say to that but yes and she rose to the occasion with fortitude of course charlotte gave them all her very sweetest smile you go and do your shopping erin ill look after your responsibilities drat the woman erins hands clenched on the steering wheel all the way into town and by the time she got there she was still having trouble calming down what matt saw in that coldblooded barracuda couldnt he see what she really was she was so nice to matt but so darned nasty to those she didnt consider important it was nothing to do with her she told herself as she drove into bay beach matts love life was matts business and that was that she was here to shop and then she saw shanni emerge from the greengrocer her face brightened shanni was a really good friend like erin she was a local girl from a farm where money wasnt in oversupply and so like erin shed been given the cold shoulder by charlotte from a very early age what erin needed now was a coffee a chat with her friend and a very long whinge where are the kids she called and shanni beamed as she dumped her shopping in her car and headed across the carpark to her friend theyre at mums oh great i was just going to head out to see you you want a coffee and a chat do i ever erin told her if you dont mind a bit of bitchiness thrown into the gossip thats my very favourite kind of gossip shanni said and tucked erins arm into hers what gives back at the farm it was matts temper that was giving hed loaded the trailer with hay the twins had helped cheerfully enough but when they headed out to the paddocks charlotte decided she was coming too then as william heaved his first bale off the trailerno mean feat for one so smallshe told him how to do it right the cattle trample it if you put it down in full bales she told william sharply wait until matt cuts the twine and then throw it off a quarter at a time williams small face fell he dropped behind the trailer and henry after looking at his twin decided to do likewise they stumped along unwillingly waiting to go home charlotte scolded matt tried to make things right but the more that was said the more the twins turned stubborn and mute youll be glad to get away tomorrow charlotte told him kids are okay in small dosesin very small doses theyre good kids if they were good kids theyd have been adopted long before this hush charlottes voice was carrying matt cast a glance behind him he didnt think the twins had heard but be a bit careful of what youre saying im only telling the truth charlotte said stubbornly for heavens sake they actually burned down a whole house they should be a bit grateful for what youre doing instead of grumping along like two spoiled brats yeah right but they didnt look like spoiled brats matt thought as he tried to cheer them up they just looked like kids who knew they were hopeless and expected to be told that at every available opportunity come and help me brush cecil he told them as they finally fed out the last of the hay hell be dry by now and he needs to be brushed like hes never been brushed before if hes to win oh matt really charlotte again unable to resist putting in her oar as if they know the right way to brush a bull ill help boys i want to watch tv henry said and william chewed his bottom lip and said nothing id really appreciate it if you could help me silence erin arrived back at the farm feeling very much better there was nothing like venting a little spleen with a friend she thought cheerfully as she turned into the gate that a couple of bolts of material a really gorgeous readymade dress new shoes and a bottle of her favourite perfume supplied by shanni had made her feel she was ready to face the world again or ready to face charlotte they were in the kitchen erin pushed wide the door and knew theyd been talking about her the conversation stopped dead as she entered and matt bit his lip it wasnt anything good erin thought but then when had charlotte ever said anything nice about her or anyone who had less money and influence than charlotte hi she said brightly determined to be cheerful i had to come home bay beach ran out of things i could buy did the insurance money run to all this charlotte asked incredulously looking at erins parcels she sniffed thats the same perfume as sally wears it costs a mint and youve never bought a dress from dellas i do get paid erin said gently im not exactly a welfare case charlotte she dumped her parcels and somehow kept right on smiling then because she knew itd cut right to the bone she couldnt resist i even had money left over for lacy knickers because a girl just never knows and that was enough of that where are the boys theyre watching television charlotte snapped watching matts face and not being reassured at all hed definitely heard what erin said and there was definitely a level of interest there theyve been distinctly unhelpful i expect theyre tired matt threw in trying to appeaseand trying not to think of erin in lacy knickersbut erin was no longer listening she left them to each other if matt was stupid enough to believe he loved charlotte then they deserved each other the twins werent watching television erin went from there to the bedrooms then she searched the house but there were no twins finally she returned to the kitchen theyre not in the house she told matt and watched as his eyes widened where else could they be theyre watching television he walked forward as if he thought she just wasnt looking hard enough and flung open the sitting room door the television was blaring but there were no twins they looked at each otherand they started to run she checked the river first it was erins golden rule check out worstcase scenarios and work backward the most dangerous places for the twins to be were the machinery shed and the river so while matt checked the sheds she ran down along the track theyd used to go swimming they werent there but something else was there that made her suck in her breath in dismay oh no she looked back up at the house and her fears were confirmed there was matt emerging from the shed where cecil had been groomed he was holding a twin by each hand erin couldnt see his face but she could guess itd look like thunder because as soon as he saw the empty stall hed have guessed she turned around again and she sighed the river flowed on golden sand and then curved away inland as it did the sand turned to mud that was where cecil was he was no longer confined brushed and beautiful in the shed ready for tomorrows show he was rolling full length in the mud doing what every selfrespecting bull would do given all the peculiar odours theyd put on his body he was getting it all off and he was now disgusting chapter seven they deserve to be spanked ill do it if you wont charlotte was at her vitriolic best and erin silently counted to ten before she put herself between charlotte and the boys somehow she forced herself to think fast she needed a defensive weapon here and luckily she had one just granted to her by an indignant shanni you touch them and ill ill publish the poetry you and bradley moore wrote to each other when you were teenagers what a threat erins voice was whisperquiet and desperate but everyone knew she meant it matts eyebrows flew up in astonishment charlotte gasped and took a step back allowing erin to crouch protectively before her two whitefaced little boys now what erin thought desperately the boys knew exactly what theyd done and how naughty theyd been now they flinched but they met her look defiant and expecting the worst why did she always want to hug them she couldnt matt was still holding them a hand apiece he was angry she knew hed been distracted momentarily by her stupid threat to charlotte and she could see her threat would surface to haunt her but meanwhile he had every right to be angry what the charlotte was shocked to the core you never you used rob mcdonald as a go between erin said and managed a smile this was kids poetry they were talking about it was only teasing after all wasnt it silly move charlotte rob might be a police sergeant but at fifteen he wasnt so lawabiding the dratted boy copied them and shanni found them a couple of weeks ago when she was cleaning up out at her parents farm it might be crazy and wholly unethical but as a desperate ruse it worked brilliantly as a distraction this was a beauty thats ridiculous charlotte managed right off track yep it was but shanni had laughingly suggested it as a weapon and it had been in erins head at the wrong time bay beach was a very small town with a very long memory poetry matt said blankly bradley and erin had to choke back laughter and concentrate on the important issue here do you know where cecil is now she asked the boys gently she was more dismayed than angry heaven it was as if they tried to drive off anyone who was good to them theyd all put in so much work to make cecil splendid and to undo it all now didnt make any sense hes down in the mud by the river and hes filthy she continued all the work that you and matt did is wasted we dont care william whispered now matt wont be able to go to the show henry added he was scared stiff but still there was a whisper of defiance with her and there was the crux of the matter they wanted matt to stay right here so theyd taken matters into their own hands help erin thought bleakly they needed to be punishedbut how she couldnt let them off scotfree and here was charlotte ready to thrash them all of them erin included the woman looked at explosion point maybe erins threat hadnt been such a good idea concentrate on the twins she told herself youd better go to your room she said wearily trying to block out charlottes fury and think what was best her head was spinning oh matt im so sorry theres no need for you to be sorry matts face was still grim but there was a trace of understanding behind his eyes now theyd given their reason he could see it and damn hed had fun with the kids himself he could see why they didnt want it to end he hadnt thought it importanthed assumed theyd be fine here with erin while he was away for the nightbut looking at it from a kids perspective he could see where they were coming from and he could see the problem erin had with them now they needed consequences but where were the consequences in this one he stay home and theyd won thatd achieve nothing except trouble next time or hed work until midnight getting the bull ready again and leave them all to be upset in his absence erin feeling guilty and the kids feeling bad consequences charlotte was quietly having kittens by his side what had erin said bradley moore well well consequences this is a real shame he said and made himself look gravely at the twins instead of at erin he still had their hands now he gave them both a gentle tug so they were facing him unlike erin he didnt stoop he stayed looking down at them from his great height and he schooled his features into sad instead of angry orsadness instead of laughter i cant believe you did thisjust when id made the extra bookings he told them and they stared bookings the twins knew they were expected to respond but they didnt know how they didnt know what the word meant for accommodation he told them since youd done such a fine job helping me with cecil and since he needs a lot of grooming at the show id decided you needed to come with me ive just booked hotel rooms for you and erin so all of us could come erin blinked had he he hadnt hed only just thought of it she decided as she watched his face but it was a great idea the boys faces dropped to their boots and their look of incredulous disappointment was stunning you were going to take us henry whispered and matt nodded yep but its no use now we have a filthy bull charlottes jaw had dropped in disbelief you didnt hush charlotte matt told her kindly bradley moore eh brad was a bachelor farmer living not five miles away the man was horse mad and had the brains of a peanut but he couldnt think of that now i guess none of us can go now matt said silence erin was looking stunned as well she might she couldnt think of a better punishment for the boys than this if shed thought for a week to miss out on something as brilliant as the lassendale show she felt a stab of disappointment herself and had to remind herself that hed only made it up to punish the boys what if we catch him again henry asked we could wash him matt glanced at his watch it was fourthirty already i have things to do he said a lot if im to get to the show i havent even started feeding yet if hes in the mud all by himself then we could catch him william was right there with henry and their two active little minds were in overdrive if you gave us the rope and we can wash him we know how to we helped the first time and now we can do it ourselves erin compressed her lips trying not to smile now what had matt backed himself into a corner but no he rose to the occasion with fortitude i dont have the time to do it myself he told them but if erins willing to supervise and youre willing to try theyll never do it charlotte snapped but matt simply raised his eyebrows and smiled they can try i dont want to miss out on showing cecil unless i must hes a champion but i wont get the highest stud fees for him unless hes shown can we try the twins were turning to erin their eyes a mixture of hope and despair they knew they couldnt do it without her help and they needed her so what was new kids always needed erin and she was a farmers daughter supervising the cleaning of one docile bull should be a piece of cake you really have booked us accommodation she asked suspiciously if she did let the boys go to this effort matt couldnt let them down at the end of it i really have matt told her his eyes met hers and held and something intangible passed between them some assurance that wasnt all about accommodation there was a moments pause then what are we waiting for erin asked come on boys lets go find us a bull and four hours later once again they had a fine looking bull cecil was brushed and groomed to within an inch of his life and the three of them had never worked so hard to make him that way he was some bull erin thought to have put up with it all twice in one day he had and the boys had worked themselves to the point of exhaustion to make him perfect theyd stopped briefly for dinnersandwiches eaten on the back step so they wouldnt have to clean upand then gone straight back to work until theyd finished they gave cecil the final brushstrokes right on eight just as matt strolled in for final inspection hed kept far away from them all evening knowing that was what was right but it had cost him some resolution to do so charlotte had gone home an hour or more back and it had been an almost superhuman struggle to stop his feet making their way to the shed now though it was all worthwhile as he entered to find three beaming faces proudly displaying what theyd done and cecil was practically beaming too he looked magnificent what do you think erin asked and he heard the note of anxiety behind her words she still thought that maybe he couldnt keep his word that hed say the bull wasnt good enough or there was a problem with accommodation but matt was a man who was owed a few favours as soon as charlotte had gone hed made some phone calls and everything was set except charlottes temper he thought ruefully shed slammed off home in a vile mood and he could see all sorts of problems looming ahead erin had overstepped the mark with her threat but then he knew that charlotte had been perfectly capable of slapping the boys and he also knew how urgent it had been to stop her she didnt understand what he instinctively didthat a slap to kids whod been kicked around in the past meant the undoing of all of erins work so in matts eyes erin was forgiven and who couldnt forgive her now she was wet and mudstained and there was a soap bubble in her tangled curls that he just wanted to reach out and what do you think she asked again this time more urgently and he practically had to slap himself to get his attention back where it was supposed to be right the bull cecil i think our cecils never looked so good he told them and he included the boys in his broadest smile well done all of you does that mean we can come to the show henry demanded and matt nodded of course i promised didnt i yes but theyd hardly believed him william and henry exchanged significant glances and erin could tell matt had gone up another notch in their estimation here was a grownup who meant what he said and there hadnt been too many of them in their lives in their eyes matt was reaching hero proportions and in erins cecil was quietly munching from his feedbox and erin ran a hand down his glossy back forcing herself to think of practicalities rather than thinking of matt it was hard but necessary matt was engaged to charlotte she reminded herself bluntly and even if he hadnt been he was way out of her league even if her errant heart was starting to think otherwise it was just the way he smiled she thought and the way he made her smile right back his gentleness and his intuitive knowledge of little boys cut it out she told herself harshly there were still things that needed to be settled ill ill pay for us for the hotel accommodation she told him but he shook his head nope the boys worked hard for this this is their payment but he held up his hand no buts just say thank you kindly and go to bed she grinned at that thank you kindly and go to bed she said and the twins giggled it was a great sound she looked down at their exhausted but happy faces and she could have kissed the man whod made this happen she darn near didbut she remembered all too well what had happened last time shed tried something like that once was enough any more might be a disaster so at nine the next morning she was in the car following the truck which was towing cecil they had to go separately the truck didnt fit five bodies and erins car wasnt strong enough to tow the trailer charlottes bmw could have done it but matt had enough sense not to suggest it charlotte was angry enough already and to have the twins sitting on her gorgeous leather upholstery would be unthinkable she hadnt suggested it herself although he knew she didnt like travelling in his truck this way though she had matt to herself and erin was forced back into her place behind her betters which erin didnt mind at all she decided as she watched the trailer disappear around the first bend they were moving fast let them go as the boys snoozed contentedly in the back she turned the radio up and she sang along to schmaltzy songs at the top of her voice she was taking her boys to the lassendale show they were happy she was happy and not even charlotte could spoil this one for her it was hard to say who was more impressederin or the boys the show was an agricultural paradise it lasted for two weeks matt had only come for the two days of hereford judging and showing but there were exhibitors there whod camped the entire time as an exhibitor matt had passes and hed given one to erin before he left therefore she parked her car easily enough at the foot of the mountain that overlooked lassendale and then strolled with her two dumbstruck charges through the throng of people out to enjoy themselves lassendale had started off a century before as a tiny country cattle show now it was the biggest show in australia in the most gorgeous setting the natural bushland had hardly been disturbed apart from the show ring and the cattle pavilions the displays and sideshows were set up under clusters of spreading gums crowded or not the place retained its natural beauty and the sound of the distant sea could be heard whispering beneath the hubbub of the crowd erin looked around her and felt a frisson of excitement building it was gorgeous we can afford to take our time she told the boys there were things here the boys would boggle atamazing machinery scary ghost rides and clowns where you poked ping pong balls into their mouths because every player wins a prize matt and charlotte would already be here with cecil but they wouldnt need erin or the twins the judging was not for an hour there were so many things to keep the boys entertained that she could take her time to find them but we need to see cecil straight away the boys were tugging her hands with urgency what if matt needs us to help he might not get him looking beautiful in time what if he lay down in the straw and messed his coat and we want to see the judging erin hurry erin grinned they felt totally responsible for the bull and she could only hope he didnt let them down when it came to judging time not that it really mattered if the judges didnt think cecil was magnificent then the boys would simply decree him an idiot and do their own judging in their eyes cecil was simply the best as was matt and erin didnt take much persuading to turn her feet toward the cattle pavilion even if he was with charlotte the boys were right cecil did look magnificent standing in his stall he seemed to have gained an aura of winner about him that hadnt existed at home hes a born champion matt told them as he stood back and admired his bull with pride see how he holds his head he never does that at home he knows there are people looking at him and its all he can do not to preen oh for heavens sake charlotte had been jolted to bits in matts truck shed been stuck here for an hour while matt groomed his precious bull and she wanted to be off to see the horses but she couldnt go because erin and the boys were coming and some basic instinct told her shed best stick around but she didnt need to be gracious about it the way you talk about him youd think he was intelligent youre saying my bulls not intelligent matt teased her with his eyes but she didnt smile back she wasnt in the mood for smiling i know hes worth a fortune but hes a bull matt now you could put it much more diplomatically than that erin told her while the boys petted and fondled cecil as if he was a very large and dopey dog rather than a pedigree bull you could say youre sure hes almost as intelligent as his owner and matt would have to take it as a compliment then as charlotte paused to work that one out she scooped the boys back from the bull leave him be boys matt has to take him through for judging now we want to watch itll take an hour or so before we know the outcome matt warned the judges look at everything well wait henry said firmly and matt and erin exchanged looks what harm could they get into matts raised eyebrows asked and erins imperceptible shake of her head told him she had the utmost faith in the boys to be on their best behaviour as they were no one was allowed near the cattle during judging only their owners stood by their side as the judges went over every inch of each beast most family and friends took this time off to visit the fairgroundsfor something far more exciting than watching men watch cattlebut for all the interminable judging time the boys stood with bodies leaning over the fence that divided the public from the judging ring they were too far away to see what was happening but it was as if they were willing cecil to win erin thought as she watched their intent silent faces they watched and watched as if part of themselves was being judged as indeed it was theyd done the hard work theyd paid their consequences and when the blue ribbon was placed around cecils neck it was as much as erin could do not to burst into tears at the look on their faces william did he buried his face into erins breast and sobbed while henry just stood and stood dumbstruck and silent well done us erin said in a voice that shook gathering henry into her as well as william she found a tissue and mopped williams soggy face well done all of us and well done cecil then she looked up and matt was at the fence leading cecil away from the judges and beaming fit to bust hed seen them all theyd been small figures in the distance but hed been so aware of them that the longing to win was no longer purely about what he could earn from his magnificent bull he knew how much the boys wanted this hed wanted this ribbon for themand for erin he looked at her face and he knew the trouble to get cecil hereto get all of them herehad been worth it she stood her twins still tucked in beside her and her eyes glowing with happiness she was wearing charlottes sensible clothesjeans and a checked shirtand her normally unruly hair had been tied back in a sensible ponytail she wore no makeup but her face was lit with joy and he wanted to hug her so badly instead he contented himself with hugging the twins grabbing them and swooping them over the fence while cecil looked on with placid bovine approval this calls for a celebration he told them he pushed a hand in his pocket and handed a note over to erin here you go cola and chips fairy floss and a ride on the tunnel of death courtesy of me can we do that in reverse order erin said faintly thinking this through gee matt thanks very much theres champagne for the grownups later he told her and his smile was so warm she almost melted he was only being kind she told herself sternly cut it out erin stop imagining things we dont want to celebrate by ourselves henry told him casting a look for reassurance at his brother can you come with us i cant leave cecil matts voice was sure and erin nodded the farmers didnt leave their cattle there were living facilities in the cattle pavilion no one brought a bull as valuable as cecil to a show and left him to the mercies of the general public even at the small shows around bay beach shed learned that no matter what theyd do tonight matt would be with his bull sleeping on a camp stretcher beside him tell you what she told the twins why dont we go and buy a feast a celebration feast as much fairy floss hot dogs chips and fizzy drinks as we can find and bring it back to share with matt now it was matts turn to say gee thanks and erins blue eyes danced itll be all our pleasure is there anything youd like to add to our list he thought about it fairy floss huh a beer would do nicely before or after fairy floss good grief coming right up she sang and they trooped away leaving matt and cecil staring after them shes quite a girl he told cecil and cecil pushed his great head against matts chest and nudged him sideways as if reminding him of his duties he got the point youre right i have a woman im an engaged man matt shook his head as if dispelling a dream he looked down at his bull and he grinned not like you you can have thousands of them in the human world were restricted to one and a very suitable one she is too charlotte had gone to inspect the horses and he badly wanted her here now to see cecils ribbon and to share the moment or maybe he didnt maybe it was enough that erin had seen it and was coming back to celebrate where are you going to sleep it had turned into a party the twins were working their way through mountains of junk food erin had had the forethought not to bring back one beer but a crate of two dozen and half the cattle pavilion seemed to be crowded into cecils stall not charlotte though she was off doing her own thing which was how it should be matt thought doubtfully as henry questioned his sleeping arrangements that was why hed decided shed be a suitable wife shed lead her own life and hed lead his but it was sort of nice being surrounded by kidsand by erin where are you sleeping henrys small hand was in his clutching him urgently as he repeated his question erin says were staying in a hotel but youre not im staying here where his eyes met erins for a fleeting moment over henrys head she was laughing at something one of the cattlemen had said but he knew by the sudden stillness of her body that shed heard what was being said and was gently mocking him see if you can stay uninvolved her body language said and for the life of him he couldnt matt gets to sleep in the nice comfy straw with cecil and all these great people and these wonderful animals she told henry making her voice mournful while poor old us get to sleep between sheets in a really comfortable hotel silence while the twins took this on board then came the inevitablewe want to sleep on the straw too henry said yes said william it would be sort of fun erin thought staying here with these downtoearth farmers instead of going back to the hotel putting the boys to sleep and then spending the evening with charlotte no spending the evening alone matts booked us into a really great hotel she told the kids with a swimming pool itd be better here we dont want a swimming pool matts rivers better yes but we dont have sleeping bagsand ill bet matts already paid a deposit for the hotel she was all with the kids on this one but it wouldnt work even if their sleeping bags hadnt been burned in the fire which they had sleeping in the cattle pavilionwith mattwas probably unwise in more ways than one but bad news had a habit of travelling fast in country communities even though they were now a hundred miles from bay beach most of the people in the pavilion knew exactly who erin and her boys were they were receiving sympathy from all sides and they received more now bet your sleeping bags and stuff were burned in the fire the cattleman shed been talking to growled and when she nodded he chewed his bottom lip there you go then boys he said to the cattle shed in general kids and the lady want to stay here weve been thinking of a way we could help and here it is he hauled his hat from his head and tossed a twenty dollar bill into it heres a start he passed the disreputable akubra on to his neighbour this is a whip round and when we have enough my bertll go downtown and fetch what you need three full swags with our compliments no arguments girl the hotel room matts booked will be snatched up by any of a score of people who need accommodation and who dont figure like us that the place we have here is fit for kings and as for the swags itll be our pleasure to buy them for you the generosity was immediate and almost overwhelming it left erin with nothing to say but thank you despite erins protestations there was no resisting the wave of generosity passing through the shed and the hat with the money disappeared out the door before she could see it bert returned half an hour later laden with swagspadded sleeping mats sleeping bags mosquito nets and pillows following him in was charlotte and to erins surprise she appeared delighted with the new sleeping arrangements thats wonderful she told a bemused matt tucking a proprietorial arm through his it means erin can stay here and look after your beastly bull and you can stay at the hotel with me there would now be a free room erin thought and then thought theyre engaged why would matt even need a spare room the thought for some stupid reason made her feel ill it didnt suit the twins either theyd been checking out the sleeping bags with whoops of delight but now they paused mid whoop matts sleeping with us william said uncertainly and henry stuck his thumb in his mouth in affirmation the little boy looked up at charlotte as if she was some sluglike creature who even his small boys interest in sluglike creatures would still find repelling for once erin was in sympathy with his sentiments entirely but she couldnt admit it of course matt can stay with charlotte she made herself say it makes sense of course it makes sense charlotte snapped resentful that erin felt she had any influence at all on matts sleeping arrangements but matt had other ideas he knew by now exactly what the twins were capable of not that theyd worry cecil he thought he knew them well enough by now to accept that if he told them they were guarding cecil then theyd do it as if their lives depended on it but what else they might do no erins job was to look after her twins and his job was to look after cecil he couldnt ask her to do both im sleeping here he told charlotte and watched her face darken damn now he had to feel guilty dont you trust me with your bull erin teased and he cast her an exasperated glance you have enough on your hands i normally look after five kids she told him and her eyes were still teasing damn they had the ability to mesmerise a man two kids and a bull should be a piece of cake erin darling dont be stupid charlottes hand was still resting on his arm and he had to fight back the urge to shake it off you know you can come do you know how much this bulls worth he demanded driving her against the ropes if there was one thing charlotte understood it was money but matt he didnt trust them completely erin thought watching the affianced couple and who could blame him if it was her priceless bull would she leave him with the twins yes but then she knew her twins look lets compromise erin suggested goodness here she went again this was what being a house mother was all aboutfinding compromises before there was a scene and the cattlemen listening around them meant that a scene would be quite spectacular matt what if you take charlotte out for dinner while we care for cecil then you can come back here to sleep i guess well probably be dead to the world by the time you return but well set up our bags right by cecil and we promise we wont leave him alone for a moment hell be safewont he boys yes said william and henry took his thumb from his mouth long enough to say yes if he really has to go out with her he really does dont you matt and with the eyes of the entire pavilion on him what was a man to do but agree chapter eight as restaurants went charlotte would have rated this one as entirely satisfactory show time was lassendales biggest two weeks of the year the hotel charlotte was staying in was five star and the restaurant chefs had pulled out all the stops to impress a clientele which for these two weeks was international and wealthy therefore mattwhod packed a suit as he always did for business meetings with those who were interested in what cecil could provideescorted charlotte into the dim recesses of the dining room and he knew he was in for a gastronomical treat he wasnt disappointed the waiter took one look at the sleek and svelte charlotte and her handsome companion and he ushered them to the best table gave them the best service and they were treated to the best food lassendale could offer matt had an appetiser of some sort of tiny goats cheese souffle entrée was ginger chilli prawns cooked to perfection and then steak steak cecil matt found his thoughts wandering right back to his bulland to the people whod be guarding him all through appetiser and entrée hed fought to keep his attention on charlottes small talk but he could ignore the pull of his conscience no longer maybe we should give sweets a miss he told charlotte tensely im a bit unhappy about cecil he wasnt he just he just didnt know but it didnt seem right that erin was back there and he was here oh for heavens sake charlotte gave a soft laugh and put her hand over his curiously the motion made him flinch it was all he could do not to pull away and the sensation was starting to worry him this was the woman he intended marrying he told himself to flinch was ridiculous he forced himself to return the pressure of her hand as she continued darling erin does come from solid farming stock i remember she used to take her fathers herd droving through the drought years when she was little more than a child herself my parents were horrified but i gather she coped very well she had too matt thought droving hed forgotten that matt let charlotte chatter on but his thoughts flew elsewhere in his late teens thered been a drought which had left every farm in the district low on feed farms like matts and charlottes where thered been money to spare had brought in food from interstate but the douglas family hadnt been in that position and jack douglas bereft from the loss of his childrens mother simply didnt care that had been the end of erins formal schooling he remembered with seven siblings to feed and clothe she couldnt afford to let the farm go under aged all of fifteen years old shed taken herself out of school and driven her cattle around the dusty district roads letting them graze on any roadside where thered been any growth at all it was a desperate measure to keep her breeding stock alive somehow shed managed it and managed it alone though he still didnt know how and he remembered his mothers fury when she discovered his father had taken erin a pile of hay to let her stay in the same place for a while if the drought keeps up much longer well need it ourselves shed hissed you dont have to feel sorry for every destitute little tramp in the district destitute little tramp he looked into charlottes flushed face and he knew shed felt exactly the same erin had been very much alone then and she was very much alone now ill go back he said flatly and the hand in his suddenly stilled matt dont be stupid id like sweets and theres dancing afterwards but i have responsibilities and then he looked up as a man he recognised appeared in the entrance bradley moore of course bradley always stayed in the finest establishment and he was always looking for someone to talk with about his horses charlotte was just the woman she even liked horses he lifted an arm hi bradley over here matt you like bradley dont you to his amazement charlotte blushed from the tip of her manicured toenails to the roots of her sleekly chignoned hair yes but there you go then he said amiably why had he never seen how suited these two were bradley i need to go back to my bull could you keep charlotte entertained on my behalf why bradley the sort of halfwit who couldnt decide whether to look like a really important person or a halfbaked kipper looked stunned but incredulously delighted of course of course matt beamed ill leave you be then will you come out and watch cecil in the grand parade tomorrow charlotte i might she said peevishly she was seriously annoyed it depends on what bradleys doing right ho said matt with all the amiability in the world and made his escape they hadnt missed him a bit that much was clear the moment he walked into the cattle pavilion while hed been wining and dining charlotte the cattlemen had set up a barbecue the aroma of seared sausages and steak hit him the moment he entered the doors and he thought fleeting of the grossly overpriced steak back at the hotel and wondered how much better it had been a hundred bucks better he wondered and he knew darned well it wasnt hed missed out on sweets back at the hotel but he neednt have worried the moment he was sighted he was handed a plate of pavlova get that into you matt mckay a cheerful young matron told him you almost missed out and then get into a set your family have been at it an hour or more and if you dont join in soon theyll have danced their legs off without you his family it was the strangest feeling but that was exactly how it felt he stood on the sidelines absently spooning in pavlovawhich was a shame because the crisp meringue and the gorgeous sunripened strawberries deserved all his attentionand he watched his family dance swing your partners round we go the square dancing was at a frantic pace one of the cattlemen had produced a fiddle another a mouth organ and the centre of the pavilion had been cleared for the dancers now it was a mass of whirling laughing cattlemen and women teenagers kids and even the odd dog and erin and her twins were in the middle of everything they were part of a set the twins were obeying the callers instructions as if their lives depended on it and erin erin was being swung from one appreciative cattleman to another and what she was wearing it was the new dress shed bought in town with shanni and it was gorgeous all the colours of the rainbow with a full circle skirt that flew out like a whirling flaming hoop around her it was a dress that had to be seen to be believed her hair was flying free her gorgeous blue eyes were sparkling with laughter and her face was flushed with exertion she looked so desirable that it almost killed matt to stay on the sidelines and eat his pavlova but to join the set you needed a partner and there were no spare women except except the pavlova lady whod just handed over her last piece of pavlova with a whoop of triumph matt cast off his coat and tie seized the unsuspecting lady and whirled her onto the dance floor before she had time to object now it was just a matter of working his way up the line to erin hey william matts here henry was doing his darnedest to whirl around a very fat lady of advancing yearsand not doing such a bad job of it either the lady was whirling as required though henry trying valiantly to clutch her around the waist merely had an armful of thigh and her breast was threatening to crush him at any moment william was doing better he was paired at the moment with a young lady not much olderor biggerthan he was but the responsibility of the occasion didnt give him time to respond there was a twirly bit coming up and he had to get it right but erin had heard matt she was flying past him as she threaded in and out of the dancers darn matt hadnt realised this wasnt a change your partners set she was threading and so was a stud of a cattleman who he didnt recognise but disliked on sight what have you done with charlotte she called and he dredged up a smile left her with bradley her eyebrows hit the roof she gave that delicious chuckle and then someone else swung her away she flew back to the arms of her cattleman and she was lost to him there was no more contact then for about five minutes until it was time for matt and his partner to take their turn threading to the lead then as he whirled erin around to change to the other side of the set she laughed up into his face you must have the utmost faith in her she teased and he glowered why wouldnt i with your bank balance still she was laughing no indeed and then erin was gone leaving him to glower some more and then regain his composure as he joined his partner again and found she was looking up at him in mute enquiry she really was bouncy and pretty herself he told himself the twins were having the time of their lives and the whole pavilion was having fun even the cattle were watching with bovine approval there was no earthly reasonor even a logical onefor a man to sulk just because erin was dancing with someone else he gave himself a huge mental shrug and decided to have fun which he did they danced on the music went on into the night the twins decided it was more fun whooping around the cattle stalls with other kids than being squeezed from bosom to bosom the cattlemen ended up with their wives or lovers and matt matt finally ended up with erin they danced on the music slowed and maybe he should have stopped but erin felt sort of nice with her hands in his then sort of closer her breasts against his chest his mouth nuzzling her soft curls the scent of some faint perfume drifting upward and making him feel that was enough of that enough this was tantalising unwise unplanned thoughtless and hopeless the music stopped as the musicians finally ran out of puff and erin and matt were left looking at each other in the middle of the dance floorcumcattle shed they were still holding each other still sort of feeling they had twins as the music stopped the kids in the pavilion returned reluctantly to their respective parents most were heading off with one or both parents to a hotel but a few were camping with the cattle tenders as matt and erin were its time to go to bed william announced importantly for what must surely be the first time in his life he had ever asked voluntarily to go to bed he was headbutting erins thigh to get her attention totally unaware of the currents of sexual awareness between the two adults he was onto the next thing on the twins agenda which was sleeping in the straw we need to set up our beds henry told them and reluctantly erins hands were released and the twins were included in between them there was a sandwich of adults with kid filling and the frisson of warmth and linkage remained the same it felt so right so we do matt said but his eyes were still on erin there were matters here that were unresolved and that had to remain unresolved he thought fiercely forcing himself to remember charlotte back at the hotel and all the logical reasons why hed decided to marry her charlotte was a sensible choice he told himself harshly good grief if he married because of a spurofthemoment attraction he could have married fifteen years ago and where would he be now burdened with school fees chaos change to his mothers lovely ordered house marry with your head not your heart his mother had said over and over until it had become almost a mantra there was more of his mother in him than he thought he decided ruefully fiftyfifty gene split yeah there he had it he was half his father who loved the farm and didnt mind a little chaos occasionally and half his mother who liked order and beauty and hey matt were just organising somewhere to sleep erins voice was chiding him gently and her blue eyes were full of laughter she could see exactly what he was thinking damn her do you think well all fit in with cecil william was asking anxiously and somehow matt tore his mind from where it definitely wanted to go and forced himself to think of sleeping arrangements and there were dangers there too of course well fit erin said soundly we just have to persuade cecil to move to the back of his stall hmm easier said than done the stalls werent huge but they were all the space allocated to them which was why at most one or two people were bedding down beside each animal if cecil lay widthways at the back of the stall the thing was possible but if hed done that his rear would be against one wooden division and his nose would be pressed against the other cecil was nothing if not large so cecil being the sensible animal he was was lying full length on the hay his nose poking out onto the walkway so he could gaze his fill at the dancers he was one sleepy bovine and he looked as if his intentions to shift were at about nil i suppose if we all shoved erin said doubtfully and matt grimaced yep you and a twoton crane might do it which left two strips of hay three feet wide on either side of cecil stretching back the eight feet or so to the rear of the stall we can take a twin each and sleep on either side matt said slowly but it wasnt the arrangement his gut wantedand he might have known it didnt suit the twins either we want to sleep together of course you will be sleeping together matt told them without much hope of being heard except instead of a pillow between you therell be cecil we cant share tigger and cecils as big as a mountain henry put a finger on his nose see hes up to here erin choked and matt frowned her down didnt the woman realise there was no alternative apparently she didnt of course you must sleep together she told them you cant cut tigger in half so into the bathroom into your pyjamas and then into these wonderful sleeping bags now it was her command voice and the boys responded accordingly okay they hesitated just long enough for william to ask but where will you sleep matt and i will top and tail on the other side of course she saidas if the matter had never been in doubt top and tail matt was frowning and she grinned easy to see you havent slept in a family with eight children she told him you fit two in a bed this way and it minimises fights it doesnt stop them entirely another grin but im sure we can fight quietly you sleep with your head near cecils head and i sleep with my head near cecils butt well be cosy as two bugs in a rug the only thing is she looked down at her toes and grimaced yes he said resignedly this woman was nuts nice but definitely nuts after all that dancing and carting cattle around all day maybe youd better not take your boots off mr mckay if theres one thing i cant bear sleeping with its a man with stinking socks matts socks werent the problem there wasnt room for matts camp bed or erins blowup mattressnot bothbut the hay was thick and fresh matt hauled his sleeping bag up to his chin tossed his pillow beside cecils head and lay down erin did the same lying in reverse but nobly matt had left her the side against the wood partition on the other side of cecil the twins snuggled in with plenty of room their noses barely reached cecils neck and their toes didnt reach his rear end once assured erin and matt were settled for the night right on the other side of cecil they closed their eyes on their shared pillow snuggled tigger and were out for the count two exhausted but perfectly content children as erin was content matts legs were distracting and she was absurdly aware of the presence of his body so close to her but this was a way of sleeping shed been brought up with she could cope erin it was a hoarse whisper and matts toes nudged her shoulder to gain her attention he had it yep she had to whisper back the entire pavilion was settled to sleep now and the lights had been turned low cattle and cattle carers alike were purposefully sleeping not matt erin cecils chewing she choked on a bubble of laughter hes what hes chewing she thought about that and nodded into the dimness i wouldnt worry cattle do not right in my ear they dont take away his feed then honestly hes not chewing his feed matt told her and there was a trace of desperation in his whisper at a guess hes chewing yesterdays feed or even his toes nudged her shoulder again as if to emphasise the awfulness of it by the smell of it even the day befores are you saying erin asked trying not to laugh out loud that your champion bull has halitosis if halitosis means breath that stinks like rancid garlic then yes matt told her forgetting to whisper and being shushed from about six different stalls for his pains thats exactly what im saying and he keeps trying to lick my face he loves you oh right you want to swap sides so im against cecil all that means is that hell lean over your feet to lick my face so so im shifting matt was nothing if not a man of decision and some decisions were easy cecil or erin erin won every time he rose sleeping bag and all hopped until his feet were with erins and then flopped down again onto the straw which meant that now his face was level with cecils tail and erins nose there was no room for two pillows they had to share uh oh maybe this hadnt been such a good idea after all the intimacy which had been building during the night had dispersed a little while putting the twins to bed and settling themselves now however it slammed back like a lightning bolt unconsciously erin found herself hauling her sleeping bag zipper higher right to her chin as if that could protect her from what she was feeling hey im not into seduction mode here matt told her seeing her movement and trying to make light of it its just if i have a choice of being kissed by you or by cecil being kissed hed meant to say licked no that wasnt right either hell his whole body was going rigid with the strain of having her so close you prefer me to cecil like matt erin was trying desperately to keep things light she chuckled and rolled over to face himwhich was another mistake as she hadnt realised how close he was his nose was inches from hers major mistake you her voice cracked and it was only after a couple of desperate swallows that she made it work again you mean it matt its the very sweetest thing to say but im very sure you dont mean it one of the guys i was dancing with tonight told me what cecil is worth thatd make ten of me and then some maybe but only one of charlotte she teased gently shes a lady who knows her worth she isspecial matt said grudgingly and tried like crazy to conjure up charlottes image the image refused to be conjured all he could see was a smattering of freckles one pert nose and gorgeous laughing eyes and lips that were so soft hell shes a lucky lady too erin whispered warmly into the dark seemingly unaware of the sensations he was feeling to be marrying you youre one fantastic guy matt mckay to have given the twins today it was just great and itll stay great as long as cecil doesnt roll over and squash the pair of them he must stop looking at her lips he must as if he would erin said indignantly as well as expensive hes also intelligent he is at that and it was the truth matts pride in his bull was almost overwhelming cecil was the result of years and years of careful planning and selective breeding up until now hed been matts pride and joy he still was but up until now cecil was the first thing he thought of when he woke in the morning and his last thought as he slept at night and if hed had to choose between cecil and charlotte the choice would be obvious and absolute cecil or erin though no this was ridiculous he liked a simple and ordered existence he thought desperately he wanted an existence where he farmed and charlotte kept the house and his social life nicely ordered that was how hed been raised with his mother and father living together but in separate worlds and that was the way he believed the world worked as it would continue to work exceptthere was this woman right before his nose but this woman came with complications and they werent just minor hiccups they were major she came with a pair of troubled twins and he just knew wherever erin went it wouldnt be just the twins thatd follow get involved with erin douglas and he knew thered be more kids his and others every lame duck in the district every hard luck story and the boundaries between house and farm would cease to exist he knew it thered be a riot of kids and dogs inside and out and erin herself wouldnt know her place shed be out heaving hay or grooming cows oror somewhere he couldnt get away from her like now he was trapped two inches from her cute nose and hell all he wanted to do was kiss her would you stop looking at me like a rabbit caught in a floodlight she said suddenly and there was no way he could escape the gentle mockery in her tone could she really know what he was thinking apparently yes matt mckay you are very very cute but you are an engaged person and i am not the least bit interested i take the lust im looking at in your eyes right now as a compliment i am exceedingly grateful for all youve done for me and the twins but i want nothing more from you than enough space to go to sleep so you can stop looking at me like im going to lunge at your body any minute and you can go to sleep now hey im not expecting anything and neither am i she said firmly so theres nothing to stop either of us from sleeping and without another word she rolled over and put her face to the wall he rolled over too which left his nose pressed against cecils butt the comparison to what hed just been looking at was ridiculous and her butt was against his there was simply no room for it not to be sleep ha all he could feel was her all he could think of was her she was so so right out of his league in every single way he could think of as for erin shed said she was going to sleep but it wasnt quite that easy he was too darned close too darned male tootoo everything i am not interested in matt mckay she told herself fiercely not not not but he was the most gorgeous male shed ever slept with in her life that wasnt saying much she thought ruefully erin had always been so involved with her kids that men usually ran a mile sensing that commitment with erin meant commitment to a whole lot more but matt was certainly gorgeous and he was so darned nice he was so nice that she wanted to turn right over and thats enough of that she whispered into the dark go to sleep chapter nine erin slept late late that is in cattle terms it must have been three am or later before shed finally fallen into an uneasy slumber she was dog tired and she was accustomed to noise so maybe it wasnt surprising that when she finally woke the rest of the cattle pavilion was bustling as were matt and the twins erin rolled sleepily over and found herself looking at ten legs four belonged to cecil who was standing looking regally around as his minions worked over him four belonged to the twins who armed with a brush apiece were intent on making cecil look even more regal and two belonged to matt well well sleepyheads finally decided to grace us with her consciousness good morning miss douglas goodgood morning she brushed the sleep from her eyes and sat up then gasped and hauled her sleeping bag up to her neck she must have pulled the zipper down in her sleep and her nightdress wasnt exactly decent have a coat matt said and tossed a waterproof down to her though by the glint in his eyes she knew hed seenand approved of what hed seen bathrooms thataway lady but youd better scuttle or youll miss breakfast breakfast she was still befuddled by sleep and totally bewildered pancakes at two oclock he told her doing a sweeping circle of the pavilion until he was pointing to a barbecue at the far end courtesy of the country womens association but the dress codes a bit rigid nightgowns with unfastened buttons dont reach their standards she gasped enough she clutched his waterproof to her while awkwardly escaping from her sleeping bag then bolted tinglingly aware that his eyes stayed on her until the door closed behind her it was a silly happy busy couple of hours before the grand parade breakfast was delicioussteak and sausages for those with strong constitutions but pancakes and honey for those with a bit more finesse which is me erin declared watching matt chomp into his beef and in front of cecil too honestly matt have you no sensitivity if you think for one minute that cecil will end up as beef steak his cousins might theyd have to be pretty inferior cousins i dont care im sticking to pancakes what about you boys and although the twins desperately wanted to be like matt honesty prevailed and pancakes won the day weaklings matt declared but the boys looked up into his twinkling eyes and knew he was kidding them honestly erin thought for a man to get away with calling the twins weaklingsand for the twins to love it she could seriously fall for this manif he wasnt already spoken for or if he wasnt rich or if a million other things that werent going to happen breakfast finished the whole pavilion settled down to the serious business of making their animal the most magnificent the animals left here now were all winners but none looked as great as cecil erin thought but she knew she was biased the four of them worked as a team going way past the necessary preparations for a bull whod already won champion of his class do you think i should tie a big blue bow around his ears she asked as she stood back and admired their handiwork and maybe a matching one on his tail over my dead body matt stood beside her and grinned ill have you know my bulls a heman and i want him to stay that way his testosterone level would plummet at the first bow and that would never do she said mockingly a mckay male with suspect testosterone we try to keep it above the run of the herd matt said smugly brains or balls erin nodded sagely as she gazed at cecils amazing appendages yep i can see the choice has been made here then as matt drew in his breath she took a wise step away from him come on twins she said choking back laughter at the expression on matts face theres no way you can get cecil more beautiful than he is right now its time for matt to take him out wait a bit matt had control of himself nowalmostand he was thinking he was enjoying himself enormously he thought and the realisation was hitting home that his enjoyment was coming to an end it shouldnt be the grand parade here was the ultimate achievement already hed had a steady stream of potential customers national and international pass by cecils stall and assess for themselves his stud potential in the parade theyd be watching from the stands making their final decision on which stud farm to choose cecil moved magnificently in the stalls he looked great but out in the open he swayed with a majesty that had to be seen to be believed for potential customers interested in herefords there was now no choice matt knew and he also knew his income for the next twelve months would skyrocket so for matt the parade was the culmination of years of hard work this was what he his father and his grandfather had spent years achieving why then did he feel reluctant to take the rope attached to cecils halter and tug the giant beast toward the parade ring because this year showing cecil and winning first prize wasnt the highlight he thought suddenly it was working side by side with others with this funny warm and lovely woman and her two troubled charges this was pure novelty factor he thought harshly trying to bring himself back down to earth he had no intention of working side by side with a woman he worked alone that was the way hed been brought up it was the order of things now and forever matt oh darling hes wonderful it was almost a relief to look up and see charlotte bearing down on thema charlotte refreshed by a good nights sleep in the hotel and wearing her signature apparel of white on white white slacks white linen blouse with collar that just stood up the right amount a white on white silk scarf casually knotted the very epitome of casual elegance in a wealthy farmers wife she didnt have straw sticking out of her hair like erin did she hadnt stepped in a cow pat in her only pair of shoes forcing her to wear borrowed gum boots three sizes too bigas erin had she was a much more suitable woman matt told himself the trouble was she might be more suitable but she wasnt nearly as much fun life wasnt fun he told himself hadnt his parents taught him anything work wasnt fun fun was something you had intermittently with your mates when the women werent around fun was hell he didnt know what fun was any more wasnt fun what theyd had this morning hes a finelooking beast with a jolt matt hauled himself out of his strange line of thought and realised charlotte wasnt alone bradley was right behind her his portentous tones echoing through the pavilion i hope you dont mind me escorting charlotte back here yep the weed still remembered the drubbing matt had given him at school when hed paraded his selfimportance from age ten and he wasnt risking anything here but when i found charlotte had no one to drive her you brought her from the hotel very kind matt was suddenly feeling almost overwhelmingly claustrophobic im sorry charlotte i have to go cecils required in the ring bradley could you look after charlotte for me creighton bow is also required in the ring bradley said stiffly the horses come in straight after cattle my lads are grooming him for me now creighton bow oh right bradleys wonderful horse umright did he win then he gained a second placing i felt the judging overlooked ill look out for him matt said hastily well done but inside he was cringing in repugnance to let his lads groom what he knew was a magnificent stallion without even supervision to stay the night in the hotel while his precious bloodstock was here the claustrophobia was rising by the minute i need to go but then there were two urgent little hands tugging his shirt can we come too please matt can we come too matt hesitatedand was lost a thought hit him and it was as if a thunderbolt had crashed into his solar plexus good grief matt please why not hed seen this happen livestock had been led into the ring by youngsters before and hed always thought how the hell could you put all that work into breeding and preparing an animal and then let someone else show it it was like bradley letting someone else groom his horse but it wasnt like that he realised suddenly bradley let someone else do the hard work and then would take the glory himself hed lead creighton bow into the ring matt looked down into the two desperately eager little faces and he knew that if he let his bolt of lightning idea have its way hed have two levels of pride not one hed never seen it before but there it was all those years of watching kids his father would never have dreamed of such a thing he thought and if he did his mother wouldnt have allowed it but he wasnt his father and the idea was like slicing the past from the future he cast an uncertain glance at erin unsure how shed react but there was no chance of taking her aside and sounding his idea out she looked ridiculous he thought she looked unkempt frazzled overbooted and underdressed beside charlottes perfect dress code but his lips twitched at the sight of her and it was only with difficulty that he turned his attention back to the twins they were waiting to be turned down he could see by their eyes that theyd asked to come too but they were accustomed to knockbacks as erin was accustomed to knockbacks on their behalf i have a proposition he said and they stared in incomprehension aa propos an idea if youre willing whats your idea they were all looking at him charlotte and bradley william and henry and erin mostly erin or maybe it was mostly erin he was aware of youve seen how quiet cecil is he was talking more to erin than the twins aware it was she he had to convince rather than them yes then if i take him to the entrance and get him into position in the parade would erin allow you to take him around the arena for me there was an audible intake of breath from every last one of themincluding from matthew himself was he mad trusting his precious bull to two urchins but he looked down into their incredulous faces and he knew that he had nothing to fear at all cecil would be as safe as houses they considered him theirs and he was as precious to the boys now as their tigger heaven help anyone or anything that threatened their cecil bradley was the first to find his voice of course youd trust your beast to these he paused stuck for words and then found what he was looking for these brats theyre not brats matt said evenly theyre my right hand men and id rather trust my bull to these two than to hired handsas you have your precious horse it was impossible to keep the disdain from matts voice bradley might come from a family who bred champion steeplechasers but youd never catch bradley doing anything as menial as grooming and as for calling his kids brats erins kids he reminded himself hastily not his erins matt youre not serious it was charlotte putting in her twobobs worth but matts eyes were on erin erin is it okay with you erin thought about it for a whole two seconds flat for her precious twins to be given such a trust at the focal point of the most prestigious show in the country she met matts look head on and the eyes looking back at him were bright with tears of course it is she managed if you want to boys if we want to the twins could scarcely breathe for the enormity of what they were being asked you meanlead him around the ringall by ourselves all by yourselves matt said solemnly still watching the wave of emotion washing over erins face if i didnt think you were capable i wouldnt ask it of you ill be standing at the pavilion doors waiting for you to bring him back but once hes out in the arena hes all yours charlotte was not impressed in fact charlotte was about as seriously annoyed as erin had ever seen her bradley had disappeared to take charge of his horsehis lads had done the work but there was no way he intended handing over the glory to anyone else matt and the twins took themselves off to place cecil in his parade order and erin and charlotte were left together to do whatever they wished charlotte didnt wish if i hadnt come in matts blasted truck id go home now she muttered as the last of the menfolk disappeared from view i only wanted to see matt in the grand parade she did too erin thought as she followed her through the door to the stadium matt was a man who stood out in any crowd and to sit in the stadium and casually let all around her know that there was her fiancé well for charlotte it was the culmination of twenty years of effort instead of which she had to content herself with two sevenyearolds leading the bull of her fiancéand it hardly had the same impact to say those children are leading my fiancés bull i guess you can always watch bradley erin told her determined to be goodhumoured with the woman she was feeling so cheerful herself she felt like doing a little jig on the spot for her twins to be given such responsibility she tucked her arm into charlottes and refused to withdraw it even as charlotte tugged sharply away maybe she had to be even nicer hey charlotte im sorry for saying what i threatened about your poetry she told her you know id never really tell anyoneand in truth shanni burned them we were only teenagers charlotte said displeased to the core as well as having to put up with the absence of matt in the parade she also had to put up with this disreputable member of the lower orders acting as if she was her friend her friend charlotte plumped herself down on a seat and huffed not put off in the least erin plumped beside her it was just childish stupidity id forgotten all about it charlotte added bradley hasnt erin told her thoughtfully you must know that hes always thought you were the ants pants theres no need to be coarse why have you always refused to go out with him erin said curiously and got an angry glance for her pains when erin still looked an enquiry charlotte thrust out her diamondadorned ring finger as if that explained all because matt and i not at fifteen erin told her flatly or even at twentythree if i remember rightly matt didnt go out with anyone until he was seventeen and then it was with sally mckinley how on earth do you remember that i was three years younger than you and matt erin told her simply her eyes twinkled come to think of it i still am but thenwell matt was school captain and a hunk even then so whatever he did was the cause of major school gossip he and sally i dont want to hear no erin chuckled her agreement she paused scanning the cattle starting to emerge from the pavilion but there was still no sign of cecil and the twins more to keep her mind off what the twins might or might not be doing she kept right on probing but i seem to remember that bradley was goodlooking too why would you never go out with him silence while they both thought back remembering it had been no secret that bradley had been keen on charlotte the poetry had been part of years of secret notes and bradleys despair inexpertly disguised and pounced on with glee by his peers and by those younger than him bradley in his teens was a spoiled brat and as far as the rest of the students were concerned his passion for charlotte made him fair game especially the impoverished and scorned younger set to which erin belonged more silence normally charlotte would simply ignore a question such as erin had just posed normally she would just ignore erin but things werent normal today charlottes social set werent here really darling cattle shows you know not our scene her two men were both out of reach and charlotte had to either sit alone in the stands or pretend to talk politely to erin she could do it erin had been grooming bulls for hours both cecil and others she looked like a farm handsomeone the elegant charlotte would employ so she could spread her finger so the morning sun just glinted on her diamond and give the impression that her purpose here was to discuss cattle quality with the staff and she was feeling so grumpy with matt she might as well tell all i could have had both of them she confided and erins eyebrows rose respectfully she was playing along for all she was worth here she could have been a peasant shocked to the core by the goingson of aristocracy and charlottes carefully controlled trill of laughter through the stands meant erins ploy was working oh not both at once she continued but yes bradley was certainly keen hes still keen now hes asked me to marry himoh ive lost count of the times so why not accept why pick on i mean why did you choose matt erin asked respectfully and once again charlotte laughed are you kidding theres no choice matts family have had their land forever his grandfather even had a title charlotte gave erin her aristocrat to low life look meaning with her level of intelligence erin couldnt possibly understand but erin did there were still people to whom the phrase old money meant something and charlotte was certainly one of them she chose her words carefully so otherwise you didnt really mind which one you chose of course i did charlotte simpered and waggled her diamond bearing finger some more im engaged to matt arent i of course and but erin was no longer listening the twins had emerged from the pavilion doors they were leading cecil and erin was effectively silenced so was charlotte she puckered her lips in distaste as the twins proudly and solemnly led their charge around the ring erin knew that all charlotte could think of was why wasnt matt leading them and erin was thinking of matt too but in a totally different way her gaze never left the faces of her two little boys and all she could feel was gratitude she was so grateful she felt like weeping damn she was weeping below her was the purest of pure bloodstock being led by the cream of the nations farmersand in their midst were her two abandoned and unwanted little boys they were all she could see and she could only see them through a mist of tears they were totally unsmiling and solemn as judgesevery sliver of concentration bent on leading their charge around the arena with the dignity he deserved what a gift erin sat absolutely motionless with every fibre of her being willing nothing to go wrong nothing did and when the boys had taken cecil twice around the arena and matt had come forward to help them tug him back through the great pavilion doors erin reached for her handkerchief and blew her nose hard charlotte shifted sideways in distaste but erin couldnt give a toss well somehow she managed to find her voice she rose and the smile she gave charlotte was tremulous thats it then are you coming to congratulate them what congratulate the twins you have to be kidding i meant all of them erin said carefully matt too but charlotte was fed up with a matthew she hadnt been able to boast about bradleys not out yet she said shortly ill stay and watch the horses at least bradley has the sense to lead his own beast out sense maybe it wasnt sensible for matt to let the twins lead cecil erin thought it wasnt sensible in the least it was just plain wonderful it was a subdued set of twins erin took back to the farm and it was a very quiet time erin had of it for the next few days it was as if they needed time to absorb what had happened to them they simply couldnt believe it the grand parade had been televised expecting matt and cecil to be in it shanni had had the forethought to videotape the program she and wendy brought the tape out to the farm and the twins watched themselves on television over and over again its a miracle wendy said frankly watching the pair of them usually unable to sit still for more than two minutes at a time the twins had been still for more than half an hour and shanni was growing more and more incredulous how on earth have you done it i havent done anything erin said a trace of trouble in her voice which her friends could hardly miss its matt whos transformed them they follow him like two little shadows and thats a problem i think it may be why wendy probed gently maybe matts just what they need but its a temporary arrangement erin shook her head and watched the children for a bit longer i justworry i guess at what will happen when theyre moved on yet again and how about you im sorry how about you erin douglas wendy hadnt been erins friend for years without being able to read her face like a book and she didnt like what she was reading now how heartwhole and fancyfree are you when its time to move onwill you be able to walk away without a backward glance it was two weeks before charlotte dropped her bombshell and those two weeks probably ranked as two of the happiest of the twins lives and erins the farm was one huge playground now that matt had showed his trust in the twins they repaid him with absolute loyalty they kept up their allotted duties as sadiereplacements until sadie became tired of limping and took her duties back with relish they obeyed every spoken and unspoken command the wonderful matt directed at them occasionally even erin was brought up short by the twins curt command will matt think this is okay and matt usually did because matt too was enjoying himself the twins and erin herded his cattle they helped cut and bale his hay the climbed his haystacks they swam in his river they roamed his farm and usually he wasnt far behind them if erin took the twins down to the river for a swim ten to one hed arrive within the hourjust to check that things are okay how can they be anything else erin would demand you have the boys hypnotised honestly matt theyre starting to love you but he didnt see the problem only erin saw it and she worried about it and she worried about herself too this was only for six months she told herself firmly this was only until the home was rebuilt and then she had to walk away from here and leave matt to charlotte but it wasnt to be for six months theyd hardly seen charlotte since lassendale matt had disappeared a couple of times to visit her for dinner but erin and the twins were persona non grata with charlotteand that was the way they liked it so it was with some surprise that they saw her car pull up one morning early after breakfast charlotte gave the car door a businesslike slam and strode purposefully toward the house uh oh said william and erin thought the same matt rose to greet his beloved and the three watched with interest no passionate hugs here thought erin matt smiled a welcome but they didnt even touch hi charlotte what brings you here because ive been longing to see you that was what she should have said erin thought and with a blinding flash of clarity she also thought thats what i would have said instead charlotte said no such thing because i have such good news charlotte told him not even bothering to greet erin and the children priscillas has had a cancellation and the church is free at the same time priscillas you know priscillas the great reception house up in the hills behind town it used to belong to sir reginald chester and his family but they let it go to ruin the people whove restored it have done such a fantastic job its the best matthew and its the only thing thats been holding up our wedding as i refuse to hold our reception anywhere but at the best mummy agrees but now its all set four weeks from today then two weeks honeymoon on norfolk island and back here as man and wife and she looked at erin for the first timeand beamed erin flinched she couldnt live with this woman she thought even if she was welcome and the thought of playing third party to a newlywed matt and charlotte made her feel ill i thats great she managed her eyes moved to matt who was looking distinctly uncomfortable ill organise something with tom if we can stay for those six weeks well be out before youre back from your honeymoon youre welcome to stay matt started but charlotte cut in over him of course youll stay until we get back from our honeymoon she said sweetly but after that matt and i have talked about it three adults looking after two children is a bit of overkillwouldnt you say erin well of course it is and matt wont hear of moving the children out until the orphanage is rebuilt she tucked her arm in his society hostess approving her slightly eccentric husbands absurd acts of generosity so after we return ill play mother to the boys she looked doubtfully at erin i suppose the orphanage can find somewhere for you to stay shes acting like im an orphan myself erin thought wildly good grief erin can stay here matt growled but erin and charlotte ignored him youre saying you and matt wish to be the boys foster parents erin demanded she felt sick why though she had no right to be the boys werent hers and if matt loved them then maybe itd turn out to be a longterm solution for them they loved matt so much and as long as they stayed out of charlottes way which wasnt going to happen she decided marshalling her thoughts as the twins looked on in confusion charlotte had made not the slightest effort to conceal her dislike of the children how could the twins possibly be expected to ignore that dislike theyd cause trouble the minute erin left youd be good for us wouldnt you charlotte asked them gimleteyed dear god erin thought maybe they would and the thought of subdued twins was almost worse than the thought of naughty ones ill have to talk to tom before i can agree she managed toms the director of bay beach orphanage arrangements like this are up to him in answer charlotte gave her lovely soft carefully cultivated laugh its a wonderful offer erin how could tom refuse how indeed chapter ten im sorry that was sprung on you charlotte hadnt stuck around for long with only four weeks to go i have so much to organise goodness matt we havent even sent out the invitations yet mother and i have so much to do and with that she was gone the twins not understanding a word of what had been saidtheyd formed the habit of tuning out whenever charlotte was aroundhad left to do their allotted morning tasks and erin was left facing matt she felt sick what had he said she gave herself a mental shake hauling her thoughts together i guess you dont have to be sorry its been very generous of you to offer to have us this long and we now have another six weeks you can all stay for as long as you want he said more forcibly than hed intended and erin gave him a half hearted smile matt you know thats not possible six weeks will give us time to find erin i want the twins that startled her she sat back and looked at him and for the first time saw the pain and the longing behind his eyes pain matt matt whod been so careful for his whole life to keep him existence emotion free who was marrying charlotte as yet another way to keep his world ordered and emotionless and yet there was definitely pain and longing you want to keep them she asked incredulously and he nodded yes hell erin theyre great kids if i can persuade charlotte if i can get her used to them then ill adopt them god knows they deserved better treatment than theyve been getting i look after them she said and got a swift shamefaced smile for her pains of course you do i didnt mean to infer that you dont but you know what bay beach is like like every local ive heard their story and what i didnt know exactly ive heard by asking around and i think if charlotte gets to like them do you think she will theyll be outside with me most of the time he gave her a halfhearted grin she knows i want children and this way she wont have to get pregnant to have them thatll be a bonus a bonus was he kidding erin thought of the possibility of bearing babies for matt and she felt her heart constrict at the thought there was a wave of almost indescribable longing stop it erin she told herself sharply there was nothing down that road but pain so youll have a wife and family with minimum effort she managed and he nodded as if her question was entirely reasonable yes i could even enjoy it you think the boys could too i dont see why not they need a mother they can get by with just me there hed said it it hung between them cold and flat an expression of what he knew his marriage would be an expression of all hed learned the world held the twins didnt need a mother he didnt need a wife well he didnt he thought bleakly and why the sight of erin whitefaced and trying desperately to disguise her desperation should have the power to move him to make him want to reach out and take her hands in his and hold her for comfort he told himself harshly for nothing but comfort it wont work matt erin said sadly its a fine offer but the boys need a family we would be a family nope erin you cant keep them forever youre being selfish and youre being blind she rose and she felt blind herself washedout and ill this man was so special and he was committing himself to a woman who resembled nothing so much as a piece of cold cod fish and he was committing because charlotte wouldnt interfere with his life because he didnt know what a family could be she could show him she thought wildly she could teach him but her help wasnt being asked for all she could do was look out for her twins i need to talk to tom she said bleakly i cant make any promises if tom says its okay then its none of my business let him try i beg your pardon you heard what i said there were two women and one man seated in the kitchen of bay beach orphanage home number one the twins were outside with the other kids and lori erin and tom were sitting at the kitchen table holding mugs of coffee before them the mugs were ignored there was trouble on all of their faces erin had outlined the basic facts lori whod heard an interesting version of what was happening from wendy was wise enough to keep her own counsel and tom had reached his own conclusions from what ive heard charlottes not the woman to make the twins happy he said but the twins think matts great and he can keep them under control okay hes made the offer and its a good one we owe it to the boys to see if itll work but im not leaving them there indefinitely tom said raising his hand to silence her nor am i making other arrangements for you yet erin weve put too much trouble into the boys and seen too much improvement to risk losing all our good work now what i suggest is that we ask matt and charlotte to spend a weekend together before the wedding with the boys if after that they still want to go ahead with keeping the twins then well assess them as potential foster parents tom its a gamble he said his wise eyes resting on erin and seeing things that maybe she didnt even realise she was showing but well take it it was a very long shot tom thought and it wasnt entirely the twins future he was fighting for here but maybe it was worth the taking erin never found out what means matt used to persuade charlotte to spend a weekend of her precious wedding preparations caring for the twins all she knew was that he had toms right its sensible he told her for us to come back from our honeymoon and have no idea how to care for the boyswell itll be less of a shock for everyone if we do it this way i dont like to leave them erin said doubtfully and matt thought suddenly that he knew exactly how she felt he didnt like her leaving either but that was emotion speaking if it had to be then this was the best way you know were capable of looking after the boys no ones capable if they make up their minds to be trouble they behave for me matt told her i know but she was still troubled and the twins were not pleased why do you have to go she had her reason all worked out you know shanni shes expecting another baby shes tired and her husbands just had an operation she needs help and ive offered to give her a little holiday that much was the absolute truth if erin had to take a break she might as well make herself useful we dont like it when you go away you know i had breaks as a house mother you coped then but we didnt like it henry said mutinously we always get into trouble when youre away oh dear you wont get into trouble when youre staying with me matt told them clapping his big hands on their shoulders and smiling down at them with a nononsense smile charlotte and i can look after you very well we dont like charlotte you hardly know charlotte this was stupid arguing with children erin where will you be williams eyes filled with tears and erins heart clenched heck theyd wrapped themselves around her heart like a hairy worm she loved them so muchand she had to set them free this way was right she told herself fiercely this way they had a chance of what they needed most in the world a family i wont be far she told them shell just be around the other side of the bay matt told them missing erins warning glance she knew it wasnt safe to be specific as to her whereabouts but he didnt pick it in fact if we go down to the beach this afternoon and take the binoculars youll be able to see nick and shannis house across the sea is it near near enough for me to come right back on sunday night erin told them ill be gone for two sleeps and then ill be back so no problems please theyll be fine a heavily pregnant shanni waddled into her friends bedroom with two cups of hot chocolate and handed one over to her friend come on erin its friday night at nine oclock and youre worried already by sunday youll be a nervous wreck and i should be doing this for you erin took her chocolate and grimaced in guilt nick made it shanni said placidly hes still on sick leave and doc emily says he might as well make himself useful light housework is fine she told him and you should have seen his face when she said it court appearances are out but ironings in erin chuckled but her heart wasnt in it if only i could be sure charlotte would look after them hey shes not a monster shes close matt loves her she must have something going for her matt thinks she wont disturb his life thats why hes marrying her shes just like his mother hmm shanni plonked herself down on erins bed and the bed sagged alarmingly boy im huge she said placidly not disturbing his life hey thats not much of a basis for a marriage its what he wants is it i wonder shanni asked or is it just what he thinks he wants she wiggled more comfortably onto the bed and let her mug of chocolate rest on her very pregnant bulge the baby inside her moved and her hot chocolate splashed onto her robe she ignored it as if such events were commonplace nick used to think he liked being a bachelor she added contentedly and here he is and he couldnt be happier sometimeswell sometimes men dont know what they want sometimes its up to us women to show them i sure dont know how hmm shanni said again and the look she cast at her friend was very thoughtful indeed it had to be tonight damnation just when he wanted to spend the night with the twins he was forced to leave them with charlotte but he had no choice one of matts prize cows was down with her first calf and she was in all sorts of trouble at eight matt rang the vet and at ten they were both knee deep in trouble from dinner time on matt didnt see the twins there couldnt be a problem with them though he told himself as he worked on into the night charlotte had decreed that dinner was to be followed by the twins bedtime that should be fine so when finally his calf was successfully born he headed wearily for the house with only a little guilt weighing him down but he couldnt help thinking it would have been better if hed been able to say goodnight to the twins himself and at first glance things were just fine charlotte was sitting placidly in the sitting room waiting for him this was the vision hed had when hed asked her to marry him he thought as he opened the door a man should come home to this rather than what he was accustomed tosolitude and takeaway pizza charlotte was looking serene and lovely and the room was looking beautiful to match even though the night hardly warranted it the wind was getting up and shed lit the fire the vases were filled with carefully arranged flowers shed waxed the furniture and all his mothers carefully acquired porcelain pieces had been polished the room looked just as it had when his mother had been alive and he paused on the threshold for a moment to savour it order and calm and two great kids in bed sleeping soundly this was what hed always known was right and as he crossed the room to give charlotte a swift kiss of appreciation he thought finally that hed done the right thing but apparently not completely charlottes nose was wrinkling in distaste phew matthew you smell hey ive washed and taken off my boots he told her offended this was good clean cattle smell after all i thought id come and find you before i took a shower then think again she told him calmly cattle smells in the living room are unacceptable but weve succeeded in delivering a great little calf he was determined to tell her his good news mum and calf are both well matt arent you interested after youve showered fine only it wasnt fine he knew instinctively that if erin was here shed be excited for him sure the flowers wouldnt be gorgeously arrangedmaybe thered be a bunch of daisies in a jam jarand the porcelain wouldnt be polished but hell this was what he wantedwasnt it ill just go and check the twins he said and her brow snapped down as if hed just mentioned something else that was distasteful theres no need theyre asleep you didnt have any trouble with them only a stupid argument about them sleeping in the same bed theyre too old to do that it seems they both wanted to sleep with that disgusting stuffed toy they insist on sharing i solved the problem by taking it away from them silence then you took away tigger he said cautiously is that what they call it she said and her voice was indifferent its revolting i locked it in the pantry he guessed he could only be thankful she hadnt burned it but theyre asleep anyway of course only of course they werent when he checked they werent even in their beds erin it was midnight the phone had echoed through shanni and nicks home shrill with urgency and nick had answered it on the third ring hed listened in appalled silence and then come to find erin now standing in the hall in her bare feet she heard matts fear echoing down the line what is it matt erin the twins have gone gone she took a deep breath fighting down panic as she forced herself to think it through erin hadnt survived this long as a house mother by giving way to hysterics at every scare you mean theyve run away it looks like it iokay matt she took a deep breath theres no problem you told them i was just around the bay remember theyll be walking on the beach somewhere ill come no n no she really took on board his fear then and it was vivid and dreadful it reached her heart as his statement that the twins had disappeared had not why not ive checked like you i thought of the beach first so i took the farm bike down there straight away but i went by the river first shanni and nicks house looks miles by beach but it looks much closer across the water the twins will have seen that erin the rowing boats gone and the tides running out at full pace if they took the boat theyll now be well out to sea they promised they wouldnt use the boat matt muttered they promised quarter of an hour later erin and matt were in the police launch headed out into the bayalong with half the fishing population of bay beach every boat that wasnt already out fishing was called into action rob mcdonald was taking no chances i want them found and i want them found fast if they realise theyre drifting away from land theres no telling what theyll do but they promised matt said again into the night and there was quiet desperation behind his words maybe were wrong to be looking out to sea maybe they havent used the boat it could have broken away itself erin i trusted them not to break their word i think theyre in the boatand i dont think theyve broken their vow ornot on their terms erins voice was winterbleak erin i heard them promise i trust them and you know what i said when they promised she whispered into the night the boat was slipping out of the harbour a flotilla of fishing boats behind them i said while youre living with me you obey my rules and then i left them he closed his eyes erin its not your fault she said bleakly its mine i let tom talk me into this and i might have known it would end in disaster dear god the sea mist had slipped in over the water the night was almost eerie in its stillness they stood alone in the bow each feeling sick with what they might or might not find before them erin didnt know where charlotte was she didnt ask once shed heard about tiggers removal it was maybe just as well she didnt know dear god it was a prayer said over and over again into the night instinctively matts arm came out and held erin hard around her waist for a moment she resisted but her need for comfort was too great she let herself be pulled into him and they stayed that way as the rolling swells of the open sea hit the boat and rob turned the launch out of the harbour and along the bay toward the tidal outpouring from the river matt and erin didnt move they were a man and woman as one with one prayer it was the longest night erin had ever known the flotilla formed a pack rob and the most senior of the fishermen worked out a pattern of grid lines based on tides currents and wind and each boat was given a course to follow it was a myriad of crisscrossing lines with all hands of every boat glued to the guy ropes and all eyes trying desperately to pierce the fog somewhere in this vast sea were two little boys in a rickety old rowing boat that was never intended to be strong enough to be buffeted by waves like this the sea wasnt at its wildest but it was rough enough to frighten a grown man in an open rowing boatmuch less children they dont even have tigger erin whispered brokenly at one point and matts arm tightened still further he was trying to instil comfort with every ounce of his being but at the same time he needed comfort himself if only if only hed been a crazy blind fool to think this could ever work he thought leaving the twins to charlotte hed been left with his mother and he still remembered the coldness if his father hadnt been thereif hed had an erin to run to it might have been him in this damned rowing boat he thought and there was something of the lost and lonely child in the look he cast out over the water please let the boys be safe he said to himself and finally out aloud please matt mmm he could hardly hear every ounce of his being was concentrating on trying to pierce the fog he was willing the boys to appear whatever happens erin said softly matt whatever happens the boys know that youve loved them thats meant so much not enough he managed youre not to blame for this i am he closed his eyes for an instant before pushing them wide to continue searching i am to blame why because i didnt have the courage to change my life as i should have done as i will if i ever have the chance again please and finally just before dawn they found them there was a shout across the water from one of the fishing boats and then another shout as the boat on the intersecting grid saw what theyd seen immediately every nose of every boat swung into the same point and matt and erin almost fell over the bow in their effort to see when they finally did the fishing boat that had first seen them had seized the rowing boat with a grappling hook and was trying to haul it alongside which was easier said than done the grappling hook was too short the rowing boat hit the fishing boat with a sickening crunch the next wave hit before there was time to lower a man to reach the children and the fishing boat was forced to pull away if it hadnt they ran the risk of crunching the row boat to splinters floodlights played out over the water the children were crouched low in the boat clinging to each other in terror rob pulled the police launch in close but it was so rough he could do nothing half filled with water the old wooden boat was threatening to capsize with every movement and the twins didnt look up the mens shouts and the noise of the engines over the roar of the sea was only increasing their terror it was too much for erin before anyone could stop herbefore anyone could even realise what she intendedshed grabbed a lifevest and jumped into the water one second later matt followed it took erin precious minutes to clamber into the rowing boat and shed darn near capsized it as she did but she was born and bred by the sea the douglas children had always had boats mostly homemade by themselves and there were always too many children in them she was an expert in keeping old tubs afloat and blessedly her selftaught skills didnt let her down by the time matts head appeared dripping as he clung to the side she was holding her two little boys to her as if her life depended on it and she was able to move backwards to stabilise the boat and let matt haul himself on board and then she had the sense to shift again to the middle so that once he was safely on board matt could take all of them into his arms it was sandwich squeeze of halfdrowned adults and kids who held each other as if theyd never let each other go again forever around them the flotilla of fishermen and police watched with blatant approval and the odd goofy smile this was the happy ending theyd all wanted so badly they should move they should get the old tub into the lee of the harbour so they could shift the kids out of it they should but for this moment no one moved at all it was as if everyone knew that right there and then a family was being forged that would take more power than the sea to split asunder chapter eleven the children were asleep shocked to the core theyd been held tight while ropes from the fishing boat tugged them slowly and safely back into the lee of the harbour once there they were transferred to the police launch william clinging for dear life to erin and henry clinging just as closely to matt then theyd been dried off and brought home charlotte wasnt waiting i said a few unforgivable things to charlotte matt told erin briefly as they put the twins through a warm bath and snuggled them into bedthe same bedand watched them fall instantly asleep with their precious tigger between them i dont suppose shell be back oh matt im so sorry dont be ive been a fool and ive been blessed to get out of it as lightly as i have and now dried and dressed themselves they were standing in the living room watching the embers of charlottes fire die in the grate the first rays of dawn were breaking over the horizon out to sea erin still hadnt bought herself a decent dressing gown she was still wearing her huge flannelette welfare handout that made her look about ten years old and watching her matt thought back to the moment when hed seen erin dive from the boat something in him had almost died in that moment for one awful minute until she surfaced hed thought he might lose all of them he couldnt bear it and he couldnt bear to waste another precious minute marry me erin he said and the world held its breath she stared m marry you thats what i said he took the two short steps to bridge the space between them and he pulled her to him somehow he couldnt bear not to and as her soft body yielded to his he knew that he could never let her go again dear god he loved her so much how had he not known it before he loved her and loved her and loved her but she was pushing him away and her eyes were troubled matt its just the night its shock or something you love charlotte i dont love charlotte he glanced down at the beautifully polished coffee table and there was a diamond ring lying where shed tossed it in indignation at what hed said to her and she doesnt love me he continued you see shes given me back my ring not that i want it so now you erin paused still troubled you want me to wear it he shook his head at that absolutely definite no way suddenly his arms were holding her again and a woman would have to have super powers to resist his hold not that he said charlotte can have it if she wants it but youre not wearing her ring you and charlotteyoure about as different as two women could be and i was a fool to see it erin i love you the ring we buy we buy together and itll be a ring full of colour and light just like you sapphires and rubies and i dont know everything all the colour youve brought into my life dear heaven somewhere deep inside erins heart was starting to sing but not now not yet she couldnt matt he kissed her lightly on her damp hair and then because he could resist no longer he tilted her chin and kissed her deeply on her mouth the kiss lasted forever and was a vow all by itself yes love he said and his voice was a husky whisper filled with passion matt she was trying so hard to make herself say what had to be said she must tonight shed known as well as loving this man she had other loves matt i cant leave the twins was that all that was troubling her with a shout of triumph he lifted her high and whirled her above his head the twins you think i dont love the twins like ill love my own children theyre part of you my love a package deal its all or nothing and i want it all you she was swinging dizzily off her feet you mean youll adopt the twins well adopt the twins he said simply and looking down into his gorgeous loving eyes she knew at last that he spoke the truth here then was her happy ever after ending here was her home he set her down on her feet and his voice became surer he took her hands in his and their eyes locked so youll marry me he asked yes her heart screamed but there were things that needed to be said it was only fair to warn him matt your life will be chaos ive discovered i love chaos but you love your mothers lovely things she looked around the room this carpet the porcelain therell be accidents i know the kids we wont be able to keep the house to the standards you like the answer to that was easy he lifted one piece of porcelaina droopy romeo and juliet for heavens sakeand let it drop it hit the grate and smashed into a thousand pieces then as erin gasped in horror he grabbed the blackened poker from the fire very deliberately he walked across the room and drew in huge letters on the once pristine carpet matt loves erin matt she was shocked to the core thats vandalism if you were mine id spank you hmm his loving eyes mocked a challenge you want to try matt mckay erin douglas he teased right back now will you marry me or do i have to smash every piece of porcelain in the place before you agree wed be much better packing it up as a wedding present for charlotte and bradley erin said seriously and matt gave a whoop of pure joy very practical she was in his arms again very sensible youre my own gorgeous sensible crazy house mother my love my heart my erin now are you going to admit that youll marry me or am i going to have to kiss you senseless and keep right on kissing you until you finally grow so weak you agree and what was a girl to say to that yes please she said if only to stop you kissing me senseless i have news for you he told her i intend to do that anyway marion lennox
