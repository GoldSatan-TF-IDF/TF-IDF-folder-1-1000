a tale of jerusalem by edgar allan poe intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos passus erat lucan a bristly bore translation let us hurry to the walls said abelphittim to buzibenlevi and simeon the pharisee on the tenth day of the month thammuz in the year of the world three thousand nine hundred and fortyone let us hasten to the ramparts adjoining the gate of benjamin which is in the city of david and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised for it is the last hour of the fourth watch being sunrise and the idolaters in fulfilment of the promise of pompey should be awaiting us with the lambs for the sacrifices simeon abelphittim and buzibenlevi were the gizbarim or subcollectors of the offering in the holy city of jerusalem verily replied the pharisee let us hasten for this generosity in the heathen is unwonted and ficklemindedness has ever been an attribute of the worshippers of baal that they are fickleminded and treacherous is as true as the pentateuch said buzibenlevi but that is only towards the people of adonai when was it ever known that the ammonites proved wanting to their own interests methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us lambs for the altar of the lord receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver shekels per head thou forgettest however benlevi replied abelphittim that the roman pompey who is now impiously besieging the city of the most high has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar to the sustenance of the body rather than of the spirit now by the five corners of my beard shouted the pharisee who belonged to the sect called the dashers that little knot of saints whose manner of dashing and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees a stumblingblock to less gifted perambulators by the five corners of that beard which as a priest i am forbidden to shave have we lived to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of rome shall accuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated elements have we lived to see the day when let us not question the motives of the philistine interrupted abelphittim for today we profit for the first time by his avarice or by his generosity but rather let us hurry to the ramparts lest offerings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven cannot extinguish and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside that part of the city to which our worthy gizbarin now hastened and which bore the name of its architect king david was esteemed the most strongly fortified district of jerusalem being situated upon the steep and lofty hill of zion here a broad deep circumvallatory trench hewn from the solid rock was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its inner edge this wall was adorned at regular interspaces by square towers of white marble the lowest sixty and the highest one hundred and twenty cubits in height but in the vicinity of the gate of benjamin the wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse on the contrary between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits forming part of the precipitous mount moriah so that when simeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called adonibezek the loftiest of all the turrets around about jerusalem and the usual place of conference with the besieging army they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that of the pyramid of cheops and by several that of the temple of belus verily sighed the pharisee as he peered dizzly over the precipice the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore as the locusts in the wilderness the valley of the king hath become the valley of adommin and yet added benlevi thou canst not point me out a philistine no not one from aleph to tau from the wilderness to the battlements who seemeth any bigger than the letter jod lower away the basket with the shekels of silver here shouted a roman soldier in a hoarse rough voice which appeared to issue from the regions of pluto lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has broken the jaw of a noble roman to pronounce is it thus you evince your gratitude to our master pompeius who in his condescension has thought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities the god phoebus who is a true god has been charioted for an hour and were you not to be on the ramparts by sunrise aedepol do you think that we the conquerors of the world have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every kennel to traffic with the dogs of the earth lower away i say and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight el elohim ejaculated the pharisee as the discordant tones of the centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice and fainted away against the temple el elohim who is the god phoebus whom doth the blasphemer invoke thou buzibenlevi who art read in the laws of the gentiles and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the teraphim is it nergal of whom the idolater speaketh or ashimah or nibhaz or tartak or adramalech or anamalech or succothbenith or dragon or belial or baalperith or baalpeor or baalzebub verily it is neither but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too rapidly through thy fingers for should the wickerwork chance to hang on the projection of yonder crag there will be a woful outpouring of the holy things of the sanctuary by the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery the heavily laden basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude and from the giddy pinnacle the romans were seen gathering confusedly round it but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog no distinct view of their operations could be obtained half an hour had already elapsed we shall be too late sighed the pharisee as at the expiration of this period he looked over into the abyss we shall be too late we shall be turned out of office by the katholim no more responded abelphittim no more shall we feast upon the fat of the land no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense our loins girded up with fine linen from the temple raca swore benlevi raca do they mean to defraud us of the purchase money or holy moses are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle they have given the signal at last cried the pharisee they have given the signal at last pull away abelphittim and thou buzibenlevi pull away for verily the philistines have either still hold upon the basket or the lord hath softened their hearts to place therein a beast of good weight and the gizbarim pulled away while their burthen swung heavily upwards through the still increasing mist booshoh he as at the conclusion of an hour some object at the extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible вђ booshoh he was the exclamation which burst from the lips of benlevi booshoh he for shame it is a ram from the thickets of engedi and as rugged as the valley of jehosaphat it is a firstling of the flock said abelphittim i know him by the bleating of his lips and the innocent folding of his limbs his eyes are more beautiful than the jewels of the pectoral and his flesh is like the honey of hebron it is a fatted calf from the pastures of bashan said the pharisee the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us let us raise up our voices in a psalm let us give thanks on the shawm and on the psaltery on the harp and on the huggab on the cythern and on the sackbutt it was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the gizbarium that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no common size now el emanu slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio as letting go their hold the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the philistines el emanu god be with us it is the unutterable flesh
