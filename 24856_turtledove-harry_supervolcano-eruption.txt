harry turtledove supervolcano eruption i colin ferguson woke up with a hangover alone in an unfamiliar double bed not the best way to start the morning fuck he muttered and sat up moving made his headache worse even the quiet fourletter word seemed too damn loud always a bad sign the inside of his mouth tasted as if something had died in there a week ago thick maroon curtains kept out most of the daylight most but not enough he felt like an owl squinting at the sun yeah hed done a number on himself all right bigtime fuck he said again not quite so softly this time here he was in a rented room in for a second or two he noshit couldnt remember where the hell he was the hangover just hurt not remembering honest to god scared him if it hadnt come back to him he could have got the answer from the telephone book the nightstand by the bed was a twoshelf unit attached to the wall no drawerusing one would have cost an extra seventyone cents a room or whatever multiply that by a raft of rooms and you knew why motel never lost money the top shelf held a phone and his watch which was that close to falling on the uncarpeted floor on the bottom shelf lay the phone book and a gideon bible bound in bilious blue motel jackson wyoming the day after memorial day he did remember fuck he said one more time back when hed set up this vacation jackson wyoming had seemed about as far from the la suburb of san atanasio as he could get as far from the fiasco hed made of his life what was supposed to be a laugh came out more like a ravens croak that was one of those jokes that would have been funny if only it were funny you couldnt get away that easily most of the time you couldnt get away at all being a cop taught you all kinds of lessons that one stood pretty high on the list hed slept alone in that not very comfortable double bed because louise his wife of close to thirty years was currently living in sin as the saying went once upon a time with her aerobics instructor back in san atanasio and hed slept alone because fuck he said yet again this time in genuine horror bits and pieces of the night before came back to him you always remembered the shit you most wished you could forget hed slept alone because hed tried to pick up a waitress half his age and struck out as gruesomely as some poor hopeless highschool kid flailing away against randy johnson in his prime christ no wonder i tied one on he thought shameand a bladder full to burstingpropelled him to the head it was as severely functional as the rest of the unit its walls were just as thin too a guy in the next room was taking a leak at the same time as colin the other guy finished and flusheda spaceage whoosh long before colin did after his own whoosh colin fished three aspirins out of his travel kit they sat on his tongue while he filled the plastic glass with water once hed swallowed them he brushed his teeth that got rid of the dead animal he pulled off sweatpants and a ratty tshirtelegant nightwearand stepped into the corner shower stall the head was set into the outer part of the ceiling and pointed in at the control and the soap ledge that struck him as weird but it worked okayou mont he made the water as hot as he could take it without boiling like a lobster and stood under it for a long time a hollywood shower he would have called it in his navy days he was surprised the shower head didnt have an automatic cutoff if he could think of it some motel bean counter could too and probably would by the time he came out the aspirins were starting to work he figured hed live he wasnt so sure he wanted to but he figured he would up till now hed done everything in near darkness if he planned to shave without cutting his throat though he needed to turn on the light over the sink if he did another interesting question but he decided not one for right now a cop who aimed to end things could always find a quicker neater way than a disposable bic he flicked on the switch the vicious photons made him flinch so did the ancient alky who peered out of the mirror at him sallow sagging skin gray stubble not to put too fine a point on it he looked like hell scraping off the stubble helped a little so did visine a little he still had all his own hair and the stuff on his scalp unlike his whiskers was only beginning to frost once he combed it he didnt look too much older than he really was coffee he saidthe first word besides fuck that had come out of his mouth this morning he could get some down at the front desk but the coffee here was as chintzy as the rest of the operation he quickly dressed jeans sweatshirt denim jacket over it angels capthe calendar might say june was starting but jackson was cool and yellowstone seventyodd miles north and over a thousand feet higher was downright cold then he went down to his rental car and headed toward the national parks bubbas was a lot closer they brewed good coffee there and cooked enormous delicious arteryclogging breakfasts and they opened at half past six so you could feed your face and head out for wherever you were going what can i get you today dear the waitress asked when colin sat down she wasnt young or cute but she said dear as if she meant it maybe i should have hit on somebody like her last night colin thoughttoo late as usual aloud he said coffeeand a big bowl of vanilla ice cream it was the best hangover fighter he knew it made people give him funny looks though not this gal it didnt faze her a bit she just nodded hurt yourself last night you say oh maybe a little colin answered dryly ill get it for you right away then and ill keep the coffee coming the waitress bustled off caffeinated his stomach greased against the slings and arrows of outrageous single malts colin drove out of jackson past the park with the elkantler arches at each corner past the visitors center and north out into open country yellowstone was still more than fifty miles away but he didnt care he wasnt fighting traffic the way he would be on the harbor freeway or the a lot of the time his little ford seemed to be the only car on the road things here would get more crowded later in the season but they hadnt yet no one even checked his receipt when he came to grand teton national parkthe ranger station at the southern entrance was closed and empty off to his left towered the grand tetons themselves one of his guidebooks said that was french fr big tits the sharp jagged snowtopped mountains didnt make him think of boobs they reminded him of a cats back teeth made for shearing meat into swallowable chunks whose cats back teeth maybe gods even the guidebook allowed that only a very lonely french trapper could have imagined those mountains were breastlike colin wasnt so sure the book had it straight there how about a french trapper whose wife had run off with an aerobics instructor that sounded just about right to him clouds rolled in they were lower than the tetons and blocked them from view pretty soon rain started spattering down rain in june seemed perverse to someone from la but colin could deal with it besides it would stop pretty soon and then start up again whenever it felt the urge hed seen that on his drive up the day beforeand on the drive down and while he was in yellowstone erratic weather was the price you paid for beating the crowds his older son rob would have appreciated the empty highway rob spent much more time on the road than colin did hed taken five expensive years getting an engineering degree from uc santa barbara since then hed made his livingwhen hed made a livingplaying bass in a band called squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles best damn outfit nobodys ever heard of was how he described it not without pride colin didnt hate the music some of the bands songs were funny some were clever a few managed both at once he did hope rob wore earplugs at every gig and every rehearsal otherwise his son wouldnt have any hearing left by the time he hit thirtyfive squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles liked turning it up to eleven the guys in the band liked smoking dope too they liked it a lot rob no less than any of the others he didnt waste any time pretending he didnt smoke it either hypocrisy wasnt in him any more than it was in colin if such things came down through the gene pool hed got it from his old man i could bust you for that colin had said the first time he smelled sweet smoke and walked in on rob toking go ahead then his son had answered he didnt yell fascist swine but he might as well have and of course colin had done no such thing hed woken up the next morning with a hangover at least as vicious as this one though rob hadnt pointed out that pot didnt hurt you the morning after for such small mercies colin was grateful with a cops cynical certainty he was sure he wouldnt get the larger ones several cars sat by the side of the road at an oxbow bend in the snake river people with binoculars and spotting scopes and cameras with long lenses peered out across the water colin kept going he was only a halfhearted birder a bald eagle he would have stopped for but those seemed unlikely here he couldnt get excited about some duck species he hadnt seen before right now he had trouble getting excited about anything that was part of the reason hed come here the hope that being somewhere different doing something different would start him perking again hed seen plenty of new stuff all right but none of it did much to distract him from the mess his family had turned into or from the south bay strangler the bastard who got his jollies raping and murdering little old ladies from hawthorne down to rolling hills estates over the past five years hed done in at least thirteen of them plenty of dna evidence to put him away if he ever got caught but no matches showed up with anybody whod run afoul of the criminaljustice system probably a pillar of the fucking communityexcept when he goes hunting colin snarled there in the ford where nobody could hear him hed voiced the idea before whenever the south bay police met to coordinate the hunt nobodyd wanted to listen to him he snorted as if that were anything new it started raining harder colin fiddled with the windshield wipers trying to keep them going just fast enough to wipe away the drops before the windshield got too spattered to see through and no faster such relentless precision was a habit of his it had driven louise crazy crazy enough to shack up with a guy ten years younger than she was evidently what did they call women who did such things nowadays there was a word for it not being on the front lines of american slang colin had to go fishing inside his head he caught it though cougars he felt good about remembering then not so good because it was something he needed to remember a squirrel darted across the highway it was smaller and redder than the squirrels in san atanasio but just as stupid and suicidal he slowed down enough to keep from squashing it cougars he repeated sadly he wouldnt have figured louise for one not till it happened but then he hadnt realized his marriage was in trouble till it blew up in his face which proved what exactly proves you dont know shit about women thats what he answered himself you were supposed to understand your wife better than any other woman right obviously he hadnt and he still didnt know why his daughter had dumped her longtime boyfriend three weeks after louise bailed on him maybe louise and vanessa had plotted it together maybe it was just in the air like swine flu bryce miller still came by the house every week or two part of that was bound to be misery loving company part of it colin clicked his tongue between his teeth not a happy noise the sad and sorry truth was he liked bryce better than vanessa bryce had his head on pretty straight even if he was writing a thesis about hellenistic poetry vanessa vanessa got touchy she snapped like a mean dog if things didnt go the way she wanted colins foot came off the gas pedal did you just call your one and only daughter a bitch unhappily he nodded he hadnt done it in so many words but hed done it yeah that was the word for vanessa not as in touchyfeely either here came the rangers station at the south entrance to yellowstone it wasnt even nine oclock yet not bad this station was manned colin pulled up to one of the gates stopped and rolled down his window a smiling ranger in what looked like a marine drill sergeants hat to colin said welcome to yellowstone that meant have you paid yet colin held up his map and stapled to it the passgood for a weekhed bought the day before nodding the ranger changed her lines welcome back to yellowstone thanks colin drove in the road up from the south entrance ran pretty straight for twenty miles colin held to a steady fortyfive even so a couple of cars and a monstrous suv zoomed past him the guidebooks warned that the rangers were fanatical about enforcing the speed limit especially on this stretch of the yellowstone highway system maybe that was pious bullshit or maybe he rounded a curve a rangers carith a light barnow flashinghad pulled over the suv the guy behind the wheel looked righteously pissed off colin chortled tough luck sucker he said you could still see what the big fires of had done to the park some dead tree trunks went on standing tall some lay scattered across the meadows that had replaced some of the old lodgepolepine forests and the lodgepoles that had sprouted since the fires ranged from the size of coffeetable christmas trees up to twenty or twentyfive feet tall about half the size of the burned ones when the road finally forked you swung left to go to old faithful and the swarm of famous geysers near it colin had done that the day before his first day in the park he supposed everybody did they were yellowstones number one attraction and he had to admit old faithful lived up to its billing if you swung right instead you went to west thumb an arm of yellowstone lake there was a geyser basin there too and an information station with a bookstore and there were restrooms with quite a bit of bubbas coffee sloshing around inside him that mattered to colin west thumb basin it was he pulled into the parking lot at half past nine not many cars in it yet hed beaten the rush to old faithful too but he suspected there was no enormous rush to beat here the potholes scarring the lot argued that way had more people come they would have kept things in better repair a round hot pool threw up clouds of steam by the entrance to the lot it didnt have a sign or anythingjust a wooden warning rail around it to keep idiot tourists from cooking themselves he found a spot near the start of the boardwalk that let visitors go by the geothermal features in reasonable safetyno the parking lot wasnt crowded after he killed the lights and motor he got out locking the car door as soon as he closed it was as automatic as breathing signs in several languages warned people to stay on the boardwalk the crust was thin you could fall through right this second boiling didnt seem so bad he shivered despite sweatshirt and jacket it had to be down in the forties it had been in the upper eighties when he flew out of lax well he wasnt in la any more that was the point of this exercise if it had one blue funnel spring was blue the thumb geyser sputtered and blew out steam the fishing cone sat a few feet out into yellowstone lake you couldnt reach it from the boardwalk once upon a time his guidebook said people had steamed freshcaught trout in there some of them had hurt themselves trying it now the fishing cone was off limits to a close approach farther back from the shore ice still covered much of the lake that was just too weird for somebody whod lived most of his life in southern california it made colin think of uncle toms cabin a lot of snow still lay on the ground too it was beautifulno two ways about that the beauty and the snow were reason enough for some people to live in these parts colin shook his head in the forties the week after memorial day forget about it he worked his way around the boardwalk a duck swimming in the unfrozen water close inshore eyed him decided he was dangerous and taxied along the surface wings beating till it got up enough speed to take off the black pool was a sickly green not black colin had no idea whether the abyss pool on the other side of the planked path led to the abyss by the sulfurous steam rising from it though he wouldnt have been surprised somebody in a broadbrimmed hat a rain slicker and jeans was hunkered down on the narrow lakeside beach back to colin intent on something he couldnt see not six feet away stood one of those stayontheboardwalk signs what the hell dyou think youre doing he growled a line whose every intonation was honed by years on the beat the miscreant jumped and whirled back toward him only heno she a woman in her midthirties with short honeyblond hair and attractively weathered features that said she spent a lot of time outdoorsprobably wasnt a miscreant after all she wore a picture id on a lanyard around her neck the way rangers here did and she answered checking a seismograph why what business is it of yours colin felt like a jerk he wouldnt have minded vanishing under the oh so thin oh so hot crust that seemed to have no trouble at all supporting the womans weight sorry he said and for once he meant it im a cop back home i saw you out there where i didnt think you were supposed to be and i jumped to a conclusion and i went splat she weighed that on one side of the scales was something like okay fine now fuck off asshole hed earned it too but a couple of other tourists were coming maybe she didnt want to cuss him out in front of an audience all she did say was mm i can see thati guess then fateor somethinglent a hand the ground shook more than hard enough to need no seismograph to detect colin staggered he was glad to grab the handrail on the boardwalk for ten or fifteen seconds he felt as if he were standing on jello at last the earthquake stopped holy moley said one of the approaching tourists nobody told me it was gonna do that lets get outa here shirley he and shirley did at top speed wavesnot big ones but wavesrolled up onto the beach the ice farther out cracked with noises that made colin think of what would happen if the jolly green giant dropped a tray from his freezer darker streakswaterappeared between the remaining chunks of ice eyeing them and the direction from which the waves had come colin said thats gotta be a maybe even a epicenters that way somewhere he pointed northeast one of the womans eyebrows jumped i was going to ask you where home was but now i hardly need to norcal or socal socal colin answered san atanasio la suburb of course he had to come from california guessing the richter scale was a local sport of sorts how about you he asked that she knew it was a local sport and that she used local slang for the two rival parts of the state argued she was a californian too sure enough she said some of both i grew up in torrancewhich wasnt far from san atanasiobut im finishing my doctorate at berkeley so im norcal now in his mind colin prefaced berkeley with the peoples republic of the same as he did with santa monica the university was good though marshall his younger son had been bummed for weeks after he didnt get in hed followed rob to uc santa barbara instead hed followed rob into smoking pot too and still hadnt graduated one more thing for his old man to worry about not the most urgent one at the moment i didnt know you could get quakes that big up here colin said oh yeah the woman answered this is the secondbusiest earthquake zone in the lower fortyeight after the san andreas there was a in the park in and a west of yellowstone in that one killed twentyeight people and buried a campground a landslide dammed the river and made what they call quake lake you can still see drowned trees sticking up out of the water a will do it all right colin said soberly how many people would an earthquake that size kill in la or the bay area one hell of a lot more than twentyeight it sure will she agreed as colin had before she pointed northeast i think youve got the size just about right too practice he broke in uhhuh but she hadnt finished you got it right if the quakes from magma shifting in the sour creek dome but if its from the coffee pot springs dome thats farther away so the quake would have to be bigger didnt feel that far off colin said the jolts were sharp not rollrollroll the way they go when theyre a long way out heres hoping youre right she didnt soundor lookhappy and she had her reasons the coffee pot springs dome literally just showed up on the map a little while ago and its swelling like a stubbed toe its like the magmas found some new weak area that gives it a path up toward the surface colin knew what magma was the hot stuff that spewed out of volcanoes here in yellowstone it was also the canned heat that kept geysers boiling and hot springs bubbling he had trouble putting those two things together though what would happen if it did he asked did what get to the surface yeah would it be a volcano like mm kind of now the look on her face said hed disappointed her hed known something about earthquakes so shed hoped he would know something about volcanoes too that shouldnt have bothered him if anybodyd had practice disappointing women he was the guy but obscurely he didnt want to disappoint this one she went on like a volcano the way a siberian tigers like a kitten maybe huh he said brilliantly to try to salvage things he added im not staring at your chest im just trying to read your name badge that got him a crooked grin well its a story im kelly birnbaum he gave her his own name she came up and shook hands over the boardwalk railing hed known police sergeants with a less confident grip she looked west i bet you went to old faithful before you came here well yeah colin hated being predictable sometimes he wassometimes everybody wasbut he still hated it dont worry people do that its what the thing is there for you know kelly said that made him feel worse not better then she asked after you looked at all the stuff there what did you do i had lunch hed testified in court too often to be anything but literalminded this time she stuck out her tongue at him which made her look about twelve you sound like a cop all right lets try it again what did you do after lunch did you drive up to the black sand basin yes honor colin answered deadpan okay kelly said in nowweregettingsomewhere tones you can see the caldera wallthe edge of what fell in the last time the supervolcano eruptedreally well from there i think theyve got a sign about it too do you remember that uhhuh as a matter of fact colin took the camera out of his jacket pocket powered it up and thumbed back till he found the pictures he wanted one was of the sign shed mentioned the other was of the caldera wall itself an almost vertical cliff of solidified lava several hundred feet high with lodgepole pines growing up out of it here and there kelly leaned forward to look at the photos in the viewfinder she nodded thats it all right thats whats left from the last time it went off i mean maybe years ago it shot out about two hundred and forty cubic miles of ash and lava and rocksay a thousand times as much as mount st helens how about compared to krakatoa colin asked or the earlier one in the si forget its name but the one that made the year without a summer mount tambora she beamed at him people did that when you surprised them by knowing more than theyd expected about what they were interested in that was about thirtyfive cubic miles krakatoa was only a squib next to it six or seven cubic miles wow colin didnt need a calculator to do the math so this eruption was a heck of a lot bigger than either one of those by himself or with his colleagues he was as foulmouthed as any other policeman he didnt like to swear in front of women though it wasnt the only reason he often felt like a dinosaur these days right kelly said but this one went off million years ago too only sixtyseven cubic miles that time only colin echoed the word seemed to hang in the cold moist sulfurous air only she repeated cause it went off million years ago too and that was the big one something like six hundred cubic miles of junkenough to bury california twenty feet deep for real the ash reached from the pacific to iowa and from canada to texas there was a thought alongside which even a hangover didnt seem such a big deal colin did some more math in his head um million years ago million years ago years ago seems like its about due is it nobody knows kelly answered and even if it is about due that might mean its ten thousand years away instead of a hundred thousand or it might not but people here and people back in berkeley dont like the way the coffee pot springs dome is bulging all of a sudden what would it be like colin said slowly if it did go off for real i mean the way it did the biggest time he wondered if shed say it would be indescribable but she didnt take rhode island blow out lava and ash all around the edges then drop it half a milemaybe a milestraight down onto molten rock she cocked her head to one side waiting to see what hed say to that what he said was best thing that could happen to the lousy place huh whatever shed expected that wasnt it for my sins i got stationed in providence when i was in the navy colied lained if america ever needs an enema thats where youd plug it in oh kelly laughednervously ive heard the same thing about buffalo and syracuse only from people whove never been to providence colin spoke with complete assurance if you say so kelly hurried on then wed get the ashfall all over the place like we did before and bunches of particles would go twenty or thirty miles up into the stratosphere and block off sunlight best estimate guess you mean colin broke in guess youre right its not like we can make the experiment best guess is global temps go down about five degrees celsiusnine degrees fahrenheit for years ten twenty two hundred nobody knows colin thought about that la nine degrees cooler would be more like portland or seattledifferent but not too bad but seattle nine degrees cooler would be more like anchorage brr and anchorage nine degrees cooler would be like the north pole so would london and stockholm and moscow and lots of other places the north pole would be more like the south pole the south pole he didnt want to contemplate what the south pole would be like start of a new ice age he asked there doesnt seem to be any causeandeffect between supervolcanoes and glaciation kelly said but it sure wouldnt be fun back seventyfive thousand years ago mount tabo in indonesia blew up its lake tabo nowthat was even a little bigger than the biggest blast here and about that same time genetics studies show homo sap almost went extinct we got squeezed down to a few thousand people why the bad weather from the supervolcano makes the best sense happy day happy uh bleeping day colin almost slipped thatll give me sweet dreams tonight if it makes you feel any better youre standing in the middle of the last big caldera kelly said cheerfully and theres another calderaa smaller newer oneunder the water in the west thumb there are little calderas all over the place in yellowstone if you know where to look oh boy colin said an aftershock rattled the boardwalk another tourist whod just set foot on it decided this was a hell of a good time to go somewhere else she hustled back toward the parking lot nothing much now kelly sounded disdainful that wasnt even a nope not even close colin agreed he realized hed just spent fifteen minutes or so talking with a reasonably attractive woman without getting shot down in flames that was one of the more pleasant novelties hed run into lately he asked where does somebody doing research at yellowstone stay in the employee housing at lake village near the fishing bridge you cant fish from any more kelly said not the black hole of calcutta but not the ritzcarlton either makes dorm rooms look good ouch im sorry for you colin remembered the ucsb dorms rob and marshall had lived in before they moved to offcampus apartments vanessa had commuted to long beach state till she decided she knew it all and quit halfway through her junior year shed made a living ever sincehe gave her that much he also remembered what student housing had given his sons to eat i hope the foods better anyhow not so youd notice kelly made a face then she asked how about you where are you staying while youre visiting here jackson he answered he saw that surprised her you could go through cash in a hurry in jackson if you were so inclined and plenty of people were what i dont look like i just finished a term as ambassador to the un he asked himself himself answered you bum you look like you just started a term for drunk and disorderly he wasnt that bad not after caffeine and painkillers but himself could be rougher on him than anyone else with a sheepish grin he added an explanation she could hear motel oh okay she laughed so youre not gonna sweep me off my feet drive me away in a goldplated mercedes and fund my research for the rest of my life now that you mention it no colin said but if that wasnt an opening hed never heard one if that wasnt an opening shed do unto him as the waitress had the night before trying his best for suave he went on if youve got a phone number or an email though he waited to see if hed wind up with egg on his face she pulled a little imitationleather card case out of a jacket pocket extracted a card and started to hand it to him then she said hang on second thoughts she scratched out the phone number on the card and wrote in a different one this is my cell the one thats printed here is my office back in berkeley i wont be there till fall and theyre liable to kill all the landlines anyway to save money budgets it wasnt a fourletter word but she sure made it sound like one thanks hed rarely been so sincere about what sounded like ordinary politeness and let me borrow that pen a sec would you he scratched out not only the phone number but also the email address on his card here this is my cell and this email doesnt go through the official police system thank you she looked at the card before she stowed it away you just said you were a cop not a lieutenant he shrugged all it means is i wear a suit more often than a uniform no goldplated mercedes not even tinplated oh it means more than that it means youve spent a lot of time working hard kelly said quietly later on if either one of us decides this wasnt such a good idea she didnt go on or need to to show she didnt need to colin gave back a quick nod no harm no foul sure he said if he figured she wasnt young enough or skinny enough or whatever the hell he wouldnt write or phone if she thought he looked too weatherbeaten to stand or that he really was a lush coming off a bender she wouldnt call back or return his email it would all be very clean and civilized he had zero intention of not getting in touch with her again a drowning man didnt push away the spar hed just grabbed did he not likely what shed do then again he could only wait and see and if she didnt decide he was too strange to deal with he could only wait and see how they got along or if they got along at all for now kelly said youll want to do some more exploring and after the quake i really need to check that seismograph i got more data than i thought i would as if to underline her words another little aftershock rattled the boardwalk what colin wanted to do was hang around right here and get to know her as well as he could as fast as he could but he saw shed given him a test question between the lines it said if you come on too strong you blow it if he couldnt work that out he flunked so he said sure glad to meet you and went on his way he drove up to dunraven pass which he might have done anyway and looked south across miles and miles more than thirty of those miles he later figured out to the distant mountains on the far side of the caldera the middlesized caldera he reminded himself then he left the park altogether which he wouldnt have done if he hadnt talked to kelly birnbaum he drove into the town of west yellowstone up us to us and west on to hebgen lake and on to quake lake the visitors center there perched high on the debris that had slid down from the far side of the madison river and dammed it after the temblor the rangers at the center seemed impressed hed ever heard of the quake they didnt worry about the supervolcano maybe it was too big to worry about hoping the world stayed lucky seemed a better way to go ii not far from marshall fergusons apartment in ellwood was a historical marker it said a japanese submarine had fired twentyfive shells at the oil refinery there in february no need to worry about subs now the refinery was long gone too marshall by contrast intended to stay in ellwood as long as he could hed started out at ucsb as an engineering major the same way his brother had rob had stuck it out marshall switched to history in the middle of his sophomore year calculus was tougher than he was it landed him on academic probation but he didnt quite flunk out he hadnt stayed a history major long ancient greece interested him most but if you were going to study ancient greece in any serious way you needed ancient greek as far as marshall was concerned foreign languages were even more poisonous than calculus hed counted himself lucky to get a b in spanish at san atanasio high they held your hand every step of the way in high school if you fell on your face at the university that was your problem not theirs and so film vanessad been sweet as usual about it that kind of bullshit is what youre good for marshall shed told him its very um creative itll put you more in touch with your inner self your feelings the right side of your brainor is it the left his mother had said when he told her the news that would have made him happier if hed taken mom more seriously getting in touch with her inner self eventually meant walking out on dad marshall might have rolled with it more easily had she acted happier afterwards but she just seemed confusedmore confused than usual even rob said you help us make videos for the band youll get your fair cut the way squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles were doing then that would have been a fair cut of nothing he didnt need calculus to understand how much a fair cut of nothing was dad was the one who worried marshall though for one thing he was hard to snow for another he wrote the checks he eyed marshall the way he would have looked at someone hed busted for running a ponzi scheme i told you id support you till you got your bachelors he said uhhuh marshall had just nodded sometimes the less you said the better off you ended uwith dad anything that came out of your mouth could be used against you i didnt figure the sheepskin would take twelve or fifteen years dad went on an ominous mumble in his voice yeah well marshall spread his hands but that wasnt good enough dad kept staring at him willing words out of him he had to be a hell of an interrogator marshall found himself saying i didnt exactly expect it would work out like this either that held some truth anyway dad grunted i dont like to go back on my word ill keep footing the billsfor a while but i dont like getting taken for a ride either im getting tired of these new majors you hear me sure dad marshall said arguing with his father was a losing proposition and not just because dad wrote the checks colin ferguson had never smoked but owned a deep raspy voice that suggested two packs a day for thirty years marshall had a tenornothing even close to a baritone his moms voice was high and thin and so was his hard to sound serious about stuff when you squeaked it wasnt that marshall didnt or wouldnt work hed glommed on to the usual parttime jobs at groceries and fastfood places and retail outlets those were great for pocket money and gas money and the like they didnt come within miles of making him selfsupporting not in santa barbara it had some of the highest realestate prices in the country which made apartments similarly screamworthy he had no idea how he would make his living once he did get that sheepskin did anybody hire people with film degrees or would he still be going do you want to supersize that maam when he hit fifty that wasnt what he thought of as the american dream and so he tried to finish as slowly as he could ucsb was a good school for that and goleta an even better town if it wasnt the party capital of the usa he didnt know what would be the student newspaper listed a cocktail of the weekfor people over twentyone only the pious disclaimer always said one of the spring rituals was couch burning getting publicly rid of furniture too beat up for even students to stand the goleta fire department did not approve which probably worried nobody who didnt work for the goleta fd another ritual was going home for summer or at least part of summer going home for marshall meant the house where hed grown up the house where dad still lived hed see mom sure but he couldnt stay with her the condo she shared with teo acosta didnt have room for guests and theyd made it plain they wouldnt have wanted any anyhow marshall didnt know what to make of his folks breakup what kid ever does his father said as little about it as he possibly could when he had to say something his jaw clenched even tighter than usual mom would talk at the drop of a hat or without one but marshall had seen long before she left dad that you couldnt count on everything she said when he came home after finals this summer he found his father reading a book about the geology of yellowstone park in a way that wasnt too surprising dad had gone there on vacation after all the card hed sent marshall featured something called the fishing cone and was postmarked at old faithful station that was kind of cool even so geology marshall pointed to the book which had an aerial photo of some colorfully steaming pool on the cover its interestinga hell of alot more interesting than i thought before i went there dad said and besides ive read everything there is to read about the south bay strangler none of it does any good or wedve caught the son of a bitch by now and he stopped short and marshall prompted nothing by the way his father said it it was definitely something marshall didnt have dads experience at questioning suspects but he didnt need it to know that cmon give he said who am i gonna tell the tabloids entertainment tonight the huffington post dad despised the huffington postand to be fair its rivals on the right he chuckled uneasily if marshall was any judge i hope not he said well then cmon i uh met somebody yeah dad was uneasy all right what did he think marshall would do tar him and feather him and ride him out of town on a rail tell the huffington post for real worse tell mom mom had always said she wanted dad to be happy but no she wasnt always a reliable narrator cool howd you meet her what are you doing about it does she live around here if not for the cool in front of them all those questions asked at once would have made dad clam up for sure we met during an earthquake at yellowstone he answered after a pause to decide if it was okay she goes back and forth between there and berkeley weve talked on the phone a few times and sent emails and texts back and forth thats about it he shrugged as if in apology it wasnt more it was more than marshall had expected even as things were cool he said again but whats up with the geology she studies it dad said which took him by surprise she was checking a seismograph when the quake hit another chuckle got more than she was looking for then i guess marshall said so youre getting into it because she is maybe some his father was relentlessly honesteven about himself as much as anyone could be but it turns out to be pretty interesting stuff all the geysers and hot springs and whatever marshall knew he sounded vague hed never been to yellowstone and what he knew about the place came from some halfremembered national geographic documentary or was it ken burns one or the other yeah all that dad agreed dryly would you still care about it if you didnt find out about it from marshall stopped you didnt tell me her name kelly dad said you know what i would i really would i dont see how you could not be interested once you knew what waswhat isgoing on there he sounded convinced just because he sounded that way of course didnt mean he was and even if he was that didnt mean he was right idiot vanessa ferguson said her voce not nearly sotto enough the idiot in question was her boss mr gorczany had written between you and i in a letter soliciting a bid on the widgets his firm produced vanessa wondered if she was the last person alive who could actually use english grammar these days she changed the boner to between you and me fixed a couple of other clumsy phrases and printed the letter for his signature even if he wrote like a baboon he owned the company he lived on an acre and a half in palos verdes and he bought himself a new bmw every year vanessas job title was technical writer which translated into hired keyboard she had a cramped onebedroom apartment and an eightyearold toyota corolla with bad brakes where was the justice in that thanks vanessa nick gorczany looked over the letter before inscribing his john hancock he was very blond about thirtyfive and putting on weight because he knew all about widgets he thought he knew all about everything he pointed to between you and me are you sure thats right yes mr gorczany vanessa said braining him with the softball trophy on his desk would only get her talked about besides who said any brains lurked inside that skull i dunno it looks funny he said frowning the object of a preposition takes the accusativethe objective if you like that better all she had to do was reach out grab the ugly trophy and if you dont believe me see what the word grammar checker says she never bothered with the word grammar checker but it wasntquitedumb enough to make the moronic mistakes mr gorczany did maybe you know that but i bet don walsh over at consolidated doesnt he said change it back to you and i i dont want him thinking were a bunch of yahoos but its wrong that way vanessa said helplessly if he doesnt know its wrong then its not wrong for him nick gorczany told her she rolled her eyes good god in the foothills why do i bother that will be enough of that miss ferguson now mr gorczany spoke with some snap the snap of a boss putting a thirdtier employee in her place he sometimes looked at her in a way she found mildly annoyingnot enough to call him on even for her but annoying even so the way he eyed her now scared her as it was meant to do i begin to see why youve worked at so many different places the past few years if you cant get along with people youre going to have problems now fix that letter please by get along with people he meant do as youre told she almost choked on the injustice of it she also almost told him to fold the letter till it was all corners and shove it up his wazoo but the economy not to put too fine a point on things sucked if she punted this job how long till she snagged another one longer than her savings lasted it might be close and so she contented herself with stalking out of his office head high back stiff the look on her face made a software engineer who was coming in to show him some printouts flinch it also made a couple of people talking by the coffee machine stare that didnt bother her it wasnt as if either one of them knew anything changing between you and me back to between you and i took only a few seconds printing out the letter only a few more they would have gone even faster if she hadnt done them through a red mist of fury this was what the world was like too right it was you got along better if you were one more smiling moron than if you gave a rats ass about doing things right the phone rang as vanessa reached for it she thought how tempting it would be to scream fuck you and slam down the receiver or to imitate marshall and answer with yankee stadiumsecond base and let the jackass on the other end go from there tempting god how tempting but no shed just reminded herself she needed the paycheck gorczany industries vanessa ferguson speaking if she sounded like a slightly constipated robot well mr gorczany couldnt can her for that hello sweetheart hagop nersessyan had a voice like a lions rumbling purr it was the first thing that attracted her to him shed rapidly found out there were others he knew things in bed poor lame bryce didnt even suspect she wondered how shed got tangled up with a loser like bryce to begin with the same way shed ended up working here she supposed it had looked like a good idea at the time hello she said but even hagops voice didnt cheer her up as much as she thought it should have i will see you tonight he said confidently i will close up shop early and i will see you tonight he bought and sold fine oriental carpets i dont know vanessa said works pretty crazy right nowwhich was putting it mildlyand i may not be fit company for anybody i will see you tonight hagop repeated she knew what that meant he was horny he had definite rhythms well he mighthe was a year older than her father bryce seemed to be turned on all the damn time and hed expected vanessa to feel the same way she didnt just want to screw she wanted to be wanted to be seduced no wonder they hadnt lasted even though shed thought about marrying him well okay she wasnt happy with herself for giving in she never was shed find some way or another to get even now she hurried on listen i cant talk ive got to get this document to mr gorczany tonight then hagop said he meant after dinner of course he wasnt offering to take her out he had a good deal of cash but he was slow about parting with it shed wondered if he was married that would explain why he didnt want to be seen in public with her she didnt necessarily mind being a mistress but she wanted to know if she was one some internet work convinced her that wasnt the issue hagop just didnt like to spend money she waited outside mr gorczanys office till he stopped speaking in tongues with the software engineer then she brought in the letter and set it on his desk here it isthe way you wanted it her words might have been carved from ice he scanned it to make sure she wasnt saying one thing and doing the other shed thought about that but hadnt figured she could get away with ita good thing too nodding he scrawled his signature at the bottom take it to the post office i want to make sure it gets todays postmark we could have taken care of this sooner if you hadnt gotten foolish about it she got off at half past four it was now by the digital clock on his desk the trip and the wait in line would cost her anywhere between ten minutes and half an hour depending on how retarded the post awful clerks were and he was waiting for her to complain about itshe could see that so she just said right between clenched teeth and carried the letter out with her fingertips as if it stank of manure as far as she was concerned it smelled worse than that the line at the post office was long and moved slowly as soon as vanessa saw the plump blond woman at one of the two open stations she knew it would be bad that gal couldnt count the fingers on one hand and get the same answer twice running they talked about employees going postalhow about customers who gathered dust waiting their turn she collected a receipt when she handed off the letter she wasnt about to pay postage for gorczany industries then back to her car and back to her apartment she picked up her mailjunk and a cable bill the cat gave her a big hello when she came in pickles always did a day in there with nothing but two fish tanks to watch wasnt very exciting vanessa petted the fatbottomed marmalade tabby and fluffed its fur then she fed it some kitty treats after that it stopped caring about her shed performed her functions which made her superfluous till the next time the beast wanted something cats were more honest than people vanessa nuked a jenny craig frozen dinner it was better than going hungry anyway she ate a yogurt for dessert hagop would have liked her plumper than she was had she thought shed stay with him she wondered why she didnt whatever the reason she stuck with jenny craig she tossed her silverware into the sink the apartment had no dishwasher she did dishes when they started getting stinky or when she ran out of clean ones that appalled her old man not that it was any of his business the buzzer sounded there was hagop waiting for her to pass him through the buildings security system she did a few seconds later she heard his shoes on the stairway up to the second floor she had to remind herself she was supposed to be glad to see him spokane wasnt a big city with washington state there though it had plenty of little clubs this one had been around a long time the joints nameharvey wallbangerproved as much lots of things had come back into style over the years but not drinks with galliano in them as far as rob ferguson was concerned a wallbanger was a nasty thing to do to a perfectly good screwdriver but squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles had played here the year before rob and his bandmates were glad to be back the sound and light guysthe guy on lights was a girl actuallyknew what they were doing the management didnt try to stiff acts as a matter of principle the way so many clowns who ran clubs did and the crowd was lively and enjoyed the show they had last year anyhow which meant they were the same kind of weirdos as the ones who played in the band and if that wasnt a judgment on them then it was a plate of spaghetti and meatballs or something rob turned to justin nachman who would have been squirt frog if the band were set up like that justin played lead guitar did most of the singing and had as much fame as anyone in a resolutely unfamous band could claim what would you call the kind of stuff we play rob asked beats me justin answered cheerfully i dont put labels on it i just play it long as you dont call me late for supper you can call it anything you want he meant it or near enough nobody in the band was on the wrong side of thirty but justin had a good set of love handles theyd gone round that barn before of course theyd been going round it since the band formed congealed was the word justin usedin santa barbara rob and charlie storer the drummer were the analytical ones justin and biff thorvald who played rhythm guitar didnt sweat it they did what they didand hoped they did it well enough to keep them from needing to look for honest work charlie said were probably somewhere between frank zappa and al stewart hed said that before arguments came and went like tides and almost as regularly rob sighed whats wrong with this picture he asked a rhetorical question if ever there was one he answered it too for one thing most of the people who listen to us have never heard of zappa or al stewart i think youd be surprised charlie said al stewart still gigs at places like this zappa would i bet only being dead makes it harder maybe a little rob agreed in tones hed picked up from his father in some ways they were like water and sodium and caught fire whenever they touched in othersmost of them ways rob never thought aboutthey were very much alike thats what i said charlies brown hair frizzed out in a perm that looked as if hed stuck his finger in an electric socket it bounced when he nodded which he did now yeah yeah rob wasnt about to be sidetracked in which he also took after colin the cop without noticing it the other thing i was going to say is i dont think there is any place between al stewart and zappa sure there is charlie said they both write interesting offthewall lyrics only zappa stopped caring about whether he sounded like a rockandroller after a while but al stewart still does well as much like a rockandroller as you can sound with just a couple of acoustic guitars rob pondered that it wasnt one of charlies usual comebacks biff bailed him out before he had to respond to it saying cmon you guys give it a rest okay lets do the sound check and hit the greasy spoon next door we dick around much longer my bellyll growl loudern my axe he brandished his guitar the socalled greasy spoon next door was an outstanding vietnamese place rob remembered it fondly from the last time they were in spokane you couldnt get better pho in santa anas little saigon and the only place you could get better vietnamese food than you could in santa ana was ho chi minh city which had been saigon and was likely to be saigon again one of these years an idea tickled the back of his mind maybe we could do something with places thatve had more than one name tsaritsyn stalingrad volgograd st petersburg petrograd leningrad back to st petersburg weve done songs about russia justin said not just russia saigons ho chi minh cityi was just thinking about thatand constantinople is istanbul nowadays and is it strassburg or strasbourg rob tried to make one of those last two germanic and guttural the other nasally french justins frown warned him he wasnt the most cunning linguist running around loose but the lead guitarist said well write it and well see what it looks like most bands came up with tunes and found lyrics that went with them not squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles with them words usually came first that had to be one more reason they wouldnt hit the jackpot any time soon al stewart already did a song about constantinople charlie pointed out and they might be giants did istanbul not constantinople does the world really need three it wouldnt be the same kind of song as those rob said give me a break man doctor seuss used constantinople too see everybody does charlie could be relentless enough you guys biff sounded more forceful this time he struck a ringing chord to emphasize the suggestion they tuned up theyd played in pasco two nights before and in portland two nights before that theyd been on the road together since foreverit sure seemed that way anyhow they didnt need long to get ready for what they would be doing later that night then it was off to the place next door fee fie pho fum rob said happily not even charlie called him on that one pho had to be the best comfort food in the world even better than chicken soup you could put almost anything into it robs favorite was beef tendon before he started eating pho he wouldnt have imagined you could boil beef tendon long enough to make it meltingly tender he wouldnt have imagined it turned so delicious when you did either the waiter and the cook and the proprietor were all the same little guy he had a wispy mustache and irongray hair his english was good but no one would ever mistake it for his native tongue had he got out of saigon just before it turned into ho chi minh city rob wouldnt have been surprised not many americans like that one he said roundeyed americans i mean they see it on the menu they make a face when he made a face he showed more wrinkles than he did with his features in repose theyve never tasted it then rob said he left a big tip although the place was so cheap it was a big tip on a small bill they went back to the dressing room and passed joints around rob couldnt prove using weed made him play better but he sure thought so time slowed down when he was loaded there seemed to be more of it between the notes so he had as much as he needed to nail them one by one and he could hearhe could almost seehow they fit together ever so much better than he could straight everything sounded better stoned too justin stepped into the corridor and checked the house a few shouts out there said people spotted him doing it he came back with a grin on his round face well make enough to go on to the next gig he reported theyd been doing that for a few years now as far as rob was concerned it beat the hell out of a day job a local band played a short set before they went on the locals got the kind of hand an opening act could expect rob remembered getting that kind of hand himself and remembered being pumped about it now a guy with a booming baritone shouted here they arethe band youve been waiting for lets give a big spokane hello to squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles and damned if they didnt applause was a drug too anybody who didnt think so had never tasted that particular high it was one of the reasons rob came out here and waved to the people beyond the house lights the other two were oldies but goodies to piss off his old man hed sure done that and to get laid till he couldnt even stand up not so easy when you were on the withdrawn side but rob had no complaints they started out with pleasures not least to bring along people who were hearing them for the first time always a few newbies in the crowd why not let em think they were listening to regular rock n roll at least for a little while i would bed you i would head you id do anything thats right for your bodys sweet delight justin sang rob strummed and found chords without conscious thought a good thing too right this minute yes he seemed to have all the time in the world he knew he didnt but he seemed to and that was all that counted after the song ended they got another hand somebody in the front row squirted justin with one of their namesakes a piece of madeinchina plastic madness from archie mcphee somebody else called out i dont believe in evolution well if you find a band called squirt frog and the created tadpoles maybe you should latch on to them justin answered easily he was fast on his verbal feet he got a laugh it was still fading when he went on if you didnt like that last song you really wont be able to stand this next one they swung into punctuated equilibrium not everybody could make a song out of stephen jay goulds attack on classical darwinism but justin nachman wasnt everybody he was wasting a masters in biology even more thoroughly than rob was squandering his engineering degree well they were having fun werent they they were tonight they got called back for two encores afterwards they sold cds and signed them for the people who thought autographs proved reality they plugged the new single on their web site they did all the other necessary things that separated musicasbusiness from musicasfun then they went back to the motel not completely alone a little sleep or something would be good theyd play in missoula montana tomorrow night another long haul another university campus with luck another crowd another paycheck sometimes this gig looked an awful lot like work but only sometimes colin ferguson took notes on the things he read he found that helped him remember them better he often kept the scribbles to himself when they held nothing earthshaking he didnt bother cops are no less nosy than other people cops in fact are nosier than most other people if they werent theyd make lousy cops and so colin wasnt particularly surprised when sergeant gabriel sanchez pointed to a sheet of paper on his desk and asked who the hell is huckleberry tuff not who gabe what colin said oh yeah sanchez said he had a bushy black mustache just beginning to get gray flecks and sideburns a good half an inch longer than the san atanasio police departments dress code allowed anyone not on undercover drug duty he reached for the pack of camels in his breast pocket naughty naughty colin said the san atanasio pd had gone smokefree the year before colins father had died of lung cancer one bad inch at a time he had his share of bad habits and then some but cigarettes werent one of them ah fuck sanchez said without heat ill go outside when im done bugging you then okay whats huckleberry tuff sounds like a gangbanger whos read mark twain colin chuckled kinda does doesnt it but its this layer of rock the supervolcano under yellowstone park laid down when it went kablooie two million years ago and change theres lots of iti mean lotsin wyoming and montana and idaho okay whatever sergeant sanchez had expected that wasnt it and how come you give a rats ass about this superwatchamacallit normally that would have been an altogether reasonable question as things stood though colin had a reasonable answer cause this gal ive got interested in is studying the supervolcano geologist i guess youd call her oh i gotcha the mediumbrown skin on sanchezs hands had a lighter streak on his ring finger that testified to his own recently deceased wedded bliss cautionpolice work may be hazardous to your marriage they didnt issue warning labels like that but they should have the sergeant leered and laughed a dirty laugh geologist huh long as she gets your rocks off hardeharhar colin had heard that one before from almost every cop who knew what a geologist was before he could say so his telephone rang he picked it up ferguson he listened for a moment then seemed to sag in his seat shit he said heavily are they sure whats the location he wrote down an address on the sheet that held the words huckleberry tuff then slammed the handset into the cradle gabe sanchez might not make original jokes but he could sure read between the lines another one from the strangler he asked looks that way mildred szymanski seventyseven found dead in her place nobody saw her she didnt answer her door for three days and the neighbors finally called us bedrooms a messlooks like she put up a fight shes naked from the waist down jesus sanchez reached for his smokes again if he had lit up colin wouldnt have said a word but he jerked his hand away instead mildred nobodys named mildred any more who the fuck gets his jollies raping little old ladies this guy does colin answered its in one of the apartment buildings near san atanasio boulevard and sword beach avenue wanna come with me sure we can damn near walk sanchez said colin nodded the scene of the crime was only a few blocks from the cop shop as soon as they got outside sanchez did light a camel he smoked in quick furious puffs and stamped on the halfsmoked cigarette when they got into one of the departments unmarked cars a plymouth that had seen better years it wheezed to life when colin turned the key the sunbreeze apartments had seen better years too theyd probably been a cool place to live when they went up in some s realestate boom now they looked more like the sunbleached apartments lots of serious armor added on as things went downhill secured the entrance and the gateway to the underground parking garage two blackandwhites were parked in the noparking zone out front their red and blue lights flashing colin pulled in behind one of the cop cars a uniformed officer started to wave the plymouth away then recognized him the guy grinned sheepishly sorry about that lieutenant no sweat malcolm colin said as he and gabe sanchez got out when reporters talked about san atanasio these days they called it working class that meant most of the chatter colin heard from lookyloos was in spanish some was in tagalog some in korean and some was in english the people who used english as their native tongue were up near the late mildred szymanskis age theyd liveere a long time and hadnt let all the changes to their town push them to places like torrance and redondo beach an ambulance arrived with the coroners car right behind it dr ishikawa and a photographer climbed out of the car the guys in the ambulance sat tight they wouldnt be able to take the body away till the police and the coroner finished their jobs ishikawa waved to colin another one he called in a harsh grating voice havent been inside yet the lieutenant answered i just got here too but thats what the call sounds like a tall skinny bald man with tufts of white hair sticking out of his ears stumped up to colin you catch the son of a bitch who done this you hear he said sir ill do my best colin told him what else could he say a tv news van started sniffing for a parking space keep those clowns outside colin growled to malcolm he hurried into the apartment building gabe sanchez at his heels he hated scenes of violent death but he hated dealing with the blowdried vultures who gorged on them even more and he was given to telling the truth as he saw it which endeared him to neither reporters nor his superiors a glance at the mailboxes told him mildred szymanski had lived in apartment a glance at the body on the bedroom floor in the apartment told him the south bay strangler likely had struck again sooner or laterprobably soonerhed have to talk to the newshounds after all iii well were here colin said as he pulled into the driveway san atanasio was only a few minutes away from lax colin despised the airport who in his right mind didnt but the trip back and forth was easy enough rain drummed on the roof of his middleaged taurus and splashed off the windshield in the passenger seat kelly birnbaum grinned a crooked grin why dont we ever meet when its sunny hey its february even la gets rain in february sometimes anyhow colin said i know she admitted it was coming down even harder in norcal ill tell you that he thumbed the trunk button head for the porch ill grab your bag such a gentleman her eyes twinkled several raindrops nailed his bifocals before he could get under cover himself he wasnt wearing a cap now the way he had in yellowstone he wiped off most of the water with a hankie and undid the dead bolt and the regular lock thena gentlemanhe held the door open for kelly go on in she did its so big she marveled its just a house when youve lived in dorms and gradstudent apartments and tents as much as i have a house looks humongous i freak out when i visit my parents down here and their place is smaller than this youve got it all to yourself too yeah colin said tightly marshall visits sometimes his room still has his junk in it the rest its mine all right such as it is kelly caught the edge in his voice sorry ive got footinmouth disease dont worry about it if i didnt have this place all to myself i wouldnt have pried your phone number out of you when we started talking there by the lake and im darn glad i did he set a hand on her shoulder she moved closer to him me too she looked around some more everything is so neat books dvds cdstheyre all where they belong i have to paw through piles of trash to find anything navy hangover he said with a shrug want something wet a beer i think but give me the tour first okay youve got to remember most of the stuff on the tables and the shelves and all is louises taste that taste ran to sadfaced icons enamelware boxes and figurines that nested one inside another colin didnt know why his ex had wanted to make the place look like a cheap imitation of the hermitage but she had thinking back on it some of the pieces hadnt been so cheap way too late to worry about it now well russian art is something different anyway kelly said diplomatically one upstairs bedroom had a closed door with yellow tape reading police linedo not cross running from the top left corner to the bottom right marshalls colin said dryly duh kelly winked at him colins study was next door with his computer and more bookshelves it looked out on the backyard some wet sparrows and mourning doves pecked seed from a tray feeder i like this kelly said it feels like you no saints on the wall here colin replied which might have been agreement he also had a work niche in the master bedroom the next stop hed been using it more since he didnt need to worry about waking up louise by turning on a light at odd hours kelly didnt seem to care about that she was looking at the bed colin needed no grad school to work out why if it bothers you theres still a bed in what used to be vanessas room all the bedclothes are new sincewell since same old mattress though she thought about it for a few seconds then she said that should be okay now what about that beer they went downstairs the kitchen was also humongous at least if you listened to kelly as colin poured a couple of sierra nevada pale ales hed drunk bud but going with kelly had opened his eyes to the notion of good beer he said i know why you say that all the time say what all the time humongous its what you guys call the top end of eruptions a real technical term like perpetrator or something youve been reading books again kelly sounded amused and accusing at the same time guilty i didnt know it wasnt in the rules colin raised his glass the pale ale was several shades darker than bud which was now that he thought about it the color of piss this brew had real ingredients in it heres to us they solemnly clinked then drank the pale ale had real flavor in it too a damn shame it cost as if it did to us kelly glanced around the kitchen which was as clean and tidy as the rest of the house i still get nervous saying that how come alarm bells jangled in colins mind he was pretty sure hed found a good one a keeper was she having doubts shed found one if she was idnt know what hed do if she was because people who go through divorces are usually crazy for a couple of years afterwards she answered seriously god knows ive watched enough gradschool marriages explode god knew colin had watched enough cops marriages explode including gabe sanchezs and his own if you were crazy did you know you were crazy if you knew you were crazy did that mean you werent really crazy after all or only that you couldnt do anything about it a da would argue one way a defense attorney the other hed seen people do some pretty nutso things after their marriages crashed and burnedno two ways about that hed seen guys date women and women hook up with guys they never would have looked at twice if they were in their right minds most of them regretted it soon enough one or two made it work hed also seen one guy smash his truck and end up in a wheelchair with gazillions in medical and legal bills because he hopped in while he was drowning his sorrows and one pretty good cop had got buried in a closed coffin because not even a mortician could make him presentable after he ate his gun suicide scared cops shitless not least because it sometimes seemed contagious if one guy did himself in it could happen that a couple of weeks later someone else someone nobodyd thought had any big troubles also took the long road out spooky colin didnt want to feel spooky right now which was putting it mildly kelly hadnt flown down from the east bay to make him feel spooky he hoped like hell she hadnt anyhow he put his hand on her shoulder again she smiled and moved closer to him the way she had before that eased his mind so hows the supervolcano doing he asked casually her smile winked out like a blown candle flame maybe hed spooked her my chairman doesnt like what its doing she said the way colin might have said the chief wouldnt like that she went on and i really dont like what its doing ive seen stuff in the papers he said nodding more quakes over the geysers schedules all fouled up yeah the tourists get upset when old faithful doesnt go off right on time kelly didnt bother hiding her scorn but thats only part of what i meanthe part that makes the papers and sometimes even the tv news the worst things dont they only show up in surveyors records and satellite radar readings how do you mean colin asked the magma domes are bulging pushing up especially the new one the one under coffee pot springs kelly said moving up by feet where they moved by inches even just a couple of years ago that led to the obvious question so colin came out with it is it getting ready to blow then nobody knows weve never observed a supervolcano eruption before so how can we tell for sure what weve got the way kelly knocked back a big gulp of beer said she sure didnt like what they had somethings going to happen though maybe itll go back down again it could maybe therell be ordinary volcanic eruptions we havent had any for seventy thousand years give or take and they might relieve the pressure or maybe you can drop rhode island half a mile straight down your chairman will know peoplepeople in the government i meanolin said slowly so will the other scientists who study this thing are they jumping up and down trying to make the feds pay attention in case yellowstone does go kaboom there ought to be contingency plans they call em in the service i know the geologists are talking to people in the interior department kelly answered and i know theyre having trouble getting anybody to listen to them its a she broke off groping for the word a question of scale i guess youd say she paused again plainly wondering if shed have to explain she didnt the south bay stranglers murdered fifteen little old ladies now thats a story people understand it it gets splashed all over cnn headline news colin said his voice thick with disgust but what hitler did and stalin and maoyou cant take in numbers like that and what they mean a good thing too anybody who could feel all those millions of murders would have to go nuts wouldnt he youd hope so kelly said uhhuh you would colin agreed so the interior department guys cant wrap their heads around the supervolcano not even close kelly said they see the studies and they go it cant be this bad and what our people give them is always cautious and careful and conservative even thats enough to make them not take it in or they say if it really does what you say itll do whats the point of planning for it its too big bend over and kiss your behind goodbye colin wasnt quite old enough to remember dropandcover drills in school but he knew plenty of people who were yeah like that except the supervolcano is so much bigger than an hbomb its not even funny kelly said it isnt radioactive colin pointed out no fallout well no she allowed not like you mean but it would put so much ash in the air she laughed shakily we sure have cheerful things to talk about dont we stranglers and supervolcanoes oh my theyre what we do and its better than not talking colin said after the kids got out of the house he and louise had hardly said anything to each other for days at a time she didnt care about policework shed cared that he hadnt been chosen chief but that was because shed lost face through his failure and he hadnt worried about how she got through her days with any brains in his head he would have noticed that that was a bad sign aerobics class hey why not kelly held up her empty glass i think i could use a refill colins glass was empty too he didnt recall finishing the beer but if he hadnt a drunk pixie was hiding in one of the cabinets motion seconded and passed by acclamation he said and opened the fridge she gave him a quizzical look you talk funny sometimes you know too many city council meetings theyd make a penguin go jogging in the mojave honest to god they would kelly snorted you do talk funny hed heard that before from his fellow cops hed also got dressed down by his superiors for writing reports in english rather than police jargon jesus no wonder i never made chief he thought if anybody ever came out and just d what goes on in a cop shop theyd ride him out of town on a rail theyd have to some of his bitterness at getting passed over went away the administrative part of the job would have been a piece of cake knowing which asses to kiss and when on the other hand even if hed tried he would have made a hash of it a police chief had to be a pol too and that just wasnt part of his makeup the second beers vanished faster than the first ones had what do you want to do now colin asked could i take a shower kelly said you go through the airport and you sit on a plane you feel all grubby even if the flight only lasts an hour and after that well who knows she grinned at him sounds better than anything else i can think of colin said she came out of the bathroom off the master bedroom naked colin lay on the bed waiting for her she grinned again oh good she said you turned up the heat we arent wearing clothes no insulation he said gravely and he knew damn well that any woman ever born would shiver at temperatures he thought fine he had no idea why things worked like that but they did she got down beside him it felt a little strange a little awkwardthe more so for him because it was their first time here in this bedroom full of memories hed gone up to berkeley a few times before but they were still learning what floated whose boat with louise after all those years hed known or hed thought so if he were as smart as that how come shed bailed on him if people generally were as smart as they thought they were theyd be a hell of a lot smarter than they really were cops learned that fast most crooksnot all but mostwere crooks because they were dopes all of which went through his head in odd moments when he wasnt otherwise distracted before long he stopped having moments like that much too soon or so it seemed he lay on his back holding an imaginary cigarette between his first two fingers and blowing an imaginary plume of smoke up toward the cottagecheese ceiling she laughed the rain tapped softly at the roof then suddenly there was a much bigger noise up theresomething alive running from one side of the house to the other what the devil was that kelly said squirrel colin answered just a rat with a pretty tail you can hear crows up there too sometimes wildlife he made a face not like yellowstone even if we do get coons and coyotes and skunks every once in a while possums too yeah we have possums in berkeley kelly said a guy i dated a few timesgrad student in biologycalled em junk mammals pretty good name colin said and let it go right there of course shed gone with guys before him he didnt want to know all the gory details he snooped for a living he didnt care to do it on his own time the way she relaxed beside him just a little showed hed passed one more test was he going to stay crazy for another year and then some if he was present company seemed pretty good he started to tell her so before the words came out he noticed her eyelids had slid shut he lay there quietly in a few minutes her breathing said shed fallen asleep he sometimes thought sleepingreally sleepingwith someone was more intimate more trusting than merely going to bed and he could tease her for doing what everyone said guys always did or he could have if he hadnt started softly snoring himself about ninety seconds later if i jump god will you catch me louise ferguson remembered wondering about that a few days before she finally nerved herself to walk out on the emptiness that had been her marriage which was pretty funny when you got right down to it because most of the time religion meant easter eggs or christmas presents or a wedding or a funeral except for those last two she couldnt remember when shed set foot in a church but you needed to think of something outside yourselfdidnt you when you turned your life upside down and inside out back in the day she would have been a scandal prominent police officers wife runs away with younger man people would have cut her dead on the streetexcept for the ones who wished they had the nerve to bail out of their dead marriages too she rather missed being a scandal one of colins unendearing endearments for her was drama queen these days though anybody who couldnt stand living with somebody else another second went ahead and quit and no one got up in arms about it she might even have been a role model for vanessa whod dumped her livein boyfriend even having one much less dumping him would have been another scandal back in the day not long after the breakup with colin louise sighed now she had a companion fifteen years younger than her daughters louise wasnt inclined to judge im not a judgmental person she often told herself it was an odd way of asserting autonomy but it worked for her colin not only was judgmental he was proud of it too shed never known a cop who wasnt and shed known a lot of cops vanessa was also judgmental and competitive and several other things her father was when she set her chin and looked stubborn she might have been colin reborn shed always had that air even when she was only three years old louises cell phone rang actually it started playing addicted to love the old word stuck though even if the noise the phone made had nothing to do with a landlines boring squawky ring she fished the phone out of her purse which sat on the severely modern couch in teos condo hello hi mom hello vanessa i was just thinking about you louise wasnt going to tell her one and only daughter how shed been thinking about her keep it nice if you can had been drilled into her when she was a little girl shed tried to drill it into vanessa too but she hadnt had much luck whats going on something had to be vanessa didnt call her to pass the time of day hagops moving to denver her daughter couldnt have sounded more tragic if shed just watched a crowded orphanage go up in flames is he louise tried to hold her voice as flat as she could she didnt know why vanessa had taken up with a man old enough to be her father well she knew some of the reason hagop wasnt bryce miller and wasnt anything like bryce miller she made no effort to tell that to vanessa she knew useless when she saw it yeah vanessa said the business climate is better there thats what he says lower taxes fewer hassles the whole nine yards she paused now shes going to tell me whatever she really calltell me louise thought vanessa let the pause stretch long enough for the thought to form very clearly then she said so im going with him to denver louise exclaimed to live vanessa had lived in or near san atanasio her whole life she thought a shopping expedition to south coast plaza in orange county was like a safari in burkina faso but she said thats right ive already started looking for jobs online im sick of working for this idiot anywayam i ever are you sick of your paycheck louise had had some sudden painful lessons about money since shed stopped banking colins checks on the tenth and twentyfifth of every month but vanessa was good with computers shed find something with more certainty to it than arranging dried flowers louise was liable to have to find something like that herself dammit i thought i should probably tell you vanessa said and by her tone of voice shed been in some doubt what does uh hagopfunny name think about you packing up and moving to be with him he was surprised vanessa said ill bet he was her mother thought she went on but he got used to the idea okay did he louise had wondered if the older man was leaving town not least to get away maybe not something else occurred to her have you told your father yet oh sure vanessa said carelessly he doesnt want me to do it i know hes not crazy about hagop louise wasnt either but didnt want her opinions associated with colins it wasnt that now her daughter sounded impatient vanessa was good at that he kept going on that denver was too close to whats cooking under yellowstone park is he okay he sounded kind of i dont know loopy about it oh now louise understood what was going on you dont need to lose any sleep about him i dont think hes got a ah lady friend who studies volcanoes so no wonder hes all excited about them but there arent any volcanoes in yellowstone are there i dont know but thats what this woman girl whatever she is studies louises spiespeople from the old neighborhoodwere sure about that come to think of it marshall had said something about it too louise hadnt put it together with the other till now vanessa went on with her own train of thought the way she often did besides denvers like four hundred miles from yellowstone more even i looked on a map dad must not have he doesnt usually freak out over nothing but he sure did this time okay louise was thinking about denver a different way it was one more milepost marking how the family was fragmenting with all the people going their own way modern families did that it was part of how things worked rob spent so much time on the road with his silly band he was like a stranger when he did drift back into town listen mom ive gotta go breaks about over vanessa said ill try to come by before i move or maybe we can have lunch or something bye bye louise echoed but she was talking to a dead phone she sighed again and stowed hers in her handbag shed spent upwardsf twenty years the best years of my life she thought sincerely if not originallyraising the kids and for what to see them scatter to the winds the way kids did from their point of view it was as if she hadnt done a goddamn thing which meant what she frowned thinking about what stuff meantin capital letterswasnt something she did every day or every week either her style had always been more along the lines of do whatever you do then see what happens next besides frowning wasnt a good plan not if the man in your bed was younger than you were wrinkles stayed deliberately she made her face relax teo was so sweet he said he appreciated all the things she knew all the things she did with a lack of inhibition that amazed her when she noticed it had colin ever noticed had he cared not likely well if she wasnt going to live for her kids who was she going to live for she surprised herself by answering the question out loud for me thats who and you know what else its about time she started to pull the compact out of her purse then stopped to scope herself out at close range with that teenytiny mirror shed have to put on her reading glasses she didnt want to be reminded that she needed reading glasses not right now she didnt she walked into the bathroom instead yes that was better she could inspect herself here at a distance her eyes were able to handle on their own okay she had fine lines at the corners of those eyes okay some of the lines on her forehead werent so fine time went by no matter how little you wanted it to and shed spent a lot of afternoons tanning when she was younger shed looked terrific then her skin would be smoother and softer now if she hadnt her hair was perfect that was a line from an old song but she couldnt come up with the rest of it she was by god still a honey blonde if she had some gray roots that was between her and the clairol people and she kept the bottle with her tampons and pads where teo wouldnt stumble over it what she really hated was the sag under her chin it wasnt bad not yet but it was there and her upper arms flopped sometimes shed had a highschool english teacher whose arm did the shimmy whenever she wrote on the board the kids heartless with youth had laughed at her it didnt seem so funny any more my boobs sag too louise said sadly with a bra it didnt show but there were times important times when you werent wearing a bra and teos mouth and fingers would know her flesh was less resilient than it had been when colin started pawing her nurse three kids and that was what happened she turned around and looked back at herself over her shoulder her ass was too damn wide that also came from having three kids and from having all the years she did her best not to think about she was what she was most of the parts still worked most of the time with as many miles as she had on her and some of the bumpy roads her life had banged over how could she ask for more how simple she wanted everything to work the way it had when she was vanessas age that wasnt gonna happen but she wanted it anyhow who didnt when she went back to the front room she turned on the food network she wasnt a great cookcolin had once accused her of being able to burn waterbut she liked watching whizzes put meals together i could do that shed think even if she was one of the people for whom god cn hamburger helper they made everything look so easy though if tvs came with smell attachments wow after a while she punched the remote she didnt flip through channels the way a man would but she wasnt locked in msnbc said the iranians were doing something or other the president didnt like louise went back to the food network and then on to oxygen the iranians had been doing things presidents didnt like for well for ever footsteps on the stairs louise brightened she knew those light bright steps a key went into the lock and then into the dead bolt the door opened in bounced teo as fresh as when hed left this morningliterally because hed showered again at the gym louise smiled a thousandwatt smile darling she said and all but threw herself into his arms so how are those greek poets colin asked bryce miller they sat across the diningroom table from each other a chessboard between them colin had a cup of coffee in front of him vanessas exboyfriend a coke im getting theredissll be done next year maybe year after next bryce answered he was tall and skinny and pale almost to translucence with curly red hair and a wispy little beard after due consideration he pushed a pawn colin took it he played chess the way he approached most problems with straightforward aggression he simplified ruthlessly and tried not to make too many dumbass mistakes against a lot of opponents that was plenty good enough against bryce he won maybe one game in five enough to keep him interested not enough to let him imagine they were in the same league bryce moved a knight colin wagged a finger at him that nasty horse would fork his queen and a rook if he didnt do something about it he moved the queen to threaten the knight and the forking square bryce covered it with a bishop okay colin thought now i can get on with my own attack he moved a bishop of his own over on the other side of the board bryce had long thin fingers he picked up the knight the way a surgeon might lift a scalpel he took a pawn with it check he said regretfully one of colins pawns could wipe it from the board but as soon as he did that bryces bishop would assassinate his queen he eyed the board for a moment considering his chances after losing the queen he saw only two bad and worse he tipped over his king you got me good that time he said i saw the bishop defending but i didnt see it would turn to attack as soon as you unmasked it and the check meant i couldnt just ignore the lousy knight everything was obviousafter the fact it usually worked that way uhhuh bryce noddeda spider encouraging a fly want to play again he tried not to look too hopeful but colin shook his head not right now that one kinda stings he leaned back in the diningroom chair something in his shoulder crunched bryce could sit forever in any position and never get uncomfortable colin hadnt been able to do that even in his twenties he tried a different tack hows the world treating you these days oh fair to partly cloudy i guess youd say the younger man answered maybe a skosh better than that writing your thesis leaves you hostile and having a relationship blow up in your face doesnt exactly make you want to go out and party either tell me about it colin said with more feeling than hed intended bryce nodded yeah you know what im talking about all right so i ought to be down in the dumpster right hadnt heard anybody put it like that before but it seems like a possibility colin said you arent though i arent bryce agreed i had another poem accepted by a pretty good journal theocritus updated you might say theocritus was one of the plusyearsdead poets he studied colin knew that much and not a nickels worth more still he brought his hands together in one silent clap not bad he said thats two in a few months as soon as the words came out of his mouth he wondered if he should have left them in there bryce had got the first acceptance just before vanessa threw him out cause and effect jealousy vanessa made a hell of an editor she had all the tools she needed to be a writer herself except the nerve she would rather submit to a root canal without novocain than to an editor bryce said uhhuh again he owned a pretty fair poker face colin couldnt tell what he was thinking that might have been just as well they pay you anything for this one colin asked now bryce snorted derision for a silly question copies by the way he said it he figured he was lucky not to have to buy them my mom will be happyshell have something to put on her shelf and show my aunts and uncles but you cant make a living as a poet or i sure as hell cant anyway not with the kinds of things i write so i do em as well as i can for me if anybody else likes em cool if nobody does i can live with that colin wondered whether he was kidding himself or knew he was blowing smoke you didnt sit down and write poems if you didnt want other people to see them you probably wanted to end up on the new york times bestseller list bryce was right about one thing though if you modeled your poems on ones from some ancient greek you damn well wouldnt other thing is bryce hesitated perhaps almost as carefully as he would have while building and polishing one of his poems he usually wasnt shy about telling colin what was on his mind which meant no sooner had colin realized what it meant than bryce confirmed it ive met somebody i like she seems to like me too well see where it goes thats all good for you colin was glad he could say it quickly he didnt want bryce thinking he liked him only because hed been attached to vanessa so have ibut youve heard about that right bryce raised an eyebrow well all run for the hills when the superduper volcano pops its cork said in a different tone of voice that would have made colin want to punch him in the snoot as things were and accompanied by a disarming grin it wasnt so bad somethings gonna happen there i dont know what i dont know when neither does anybody else including kelly colin said nobody knows when the big onell hit either ive got an earthquake kit in the steel shed out back though and a little one in my trunk dont you i have one in the car harder to put one in the shed when youre in an apartment bryce said could be colin admitted so whos your new friend whats she do howd you meet her her names susan ruppelt she was moving into the ta office i was clearing out of we got to talking and i got her email and one thing kind of led to another shes working on the holy roman empire tenthcentury stuff maybe eleventh ad you mean not bc thats right too modern for you then hey what are thirteen hundred years between friends bryce grinned again he looked as happy as a cat lapping up cream he hadnt looked that way while he was with vanessa not after the first few months maybe it would last longer this time or maybe not even if it did things might fall apart years later colin had learned more on that score than hed ever wanted to find out luck he said and meant it thanks you too bryces mouth twisted its as much as you can hope for isnt it luck i mean you grow together or else you grow apart i think susans on the sheltered side you know otherwise shed have more sense than to mess with a guy on the rebound well bring her by here one day colin said if i cant scare her away from you nothing will i may take you up on that bryce said you have been warned iv between two and three million people came to yellowstone every year in july and august they all seemed to be there at once cars and rvs and tour buses clogged the roads till they made california freeways at rush hour look wide open by comparison kelly birnbaum knew how to beat the crowds go a quarter of a mile off the asphalt and you shed way more than ninetenths of the visitors go a couple of miles from the highways and you were pretty much on your own that was bad news as well as good cellphone reception in the vast park was spotty at best if you got into trouble you might not be able to let anybody else know the idea then was not to get into trouble kelly was a city girl she didnt hike the wilderness because she particularly loved hiking the wilderness she went out there because that was what you did if you were a geologist working in the field what did the gravedigger in hamlet say something about familiarity lending a quality of easiness that was as much as she remembered considering that she hadnt needed to worry about hamlet since her undergrad days she was moderately pleased to come up with even so much one of the basic lessons was never to hike alone since she was part of a team of researchers trudging out to coffee pot springs that wasnt an issue ruth marquez came from the university of utah daniel olson who was younger than she was had just landed a tenuretrack job at montana state in missoula kelly didnt know whether to be jealous or to remember it was missoula and the calm unhurried fellow who needed to buy a vowel was larry skrtel hed been with the us geological survey the past twenty years and headed up the team he enjoyed hiking the critters are less likely to bite you or run over you than the damn tourists are he declared except for the bison maybe daniel said theyre as dumb as the morons who bought hummers when gas was cheap he was at least sixthree but kelly had seen his car a fireengine red honda the size of a roller skate keep your distance and they wont bother you larry said well usually famous last words daniel said the other hikers laughed as if he didnt mean it bison knew they were the biggest critters in the neighborhood and expected everything else to get out of their way some of the males weighed as much as daniel olsons little car they were dumb as rocks and lots of those males had testosterone poisoning not a good combination the geologists had set out from indian pond one of their colleagues took the car that brought them that far back to lake village a train led towards astringent creek which guided them most of the way north indian pond was a good place to start it lay near the northernmost edge of yellowstone lake it was about a quarter of a mile across and round as charlie browns head a hydrothermal explosion had gouged it out of the ground about years beforethat was what the radiocarbon dates said anyhow a bigger hydrothermal explosion had formed mary bay the nearby part of the lake down below mary bay the temperature got up over degrees the hot spot under yellowstone might still sleep but it was a long way from dead kelly shivered though it was a nice day she was slathered in deet mosquitoes buzzed around her just the same repellent or no repellent she knew she would pick up bites shed even been bitten through thick socks now she sprayed her ankles too but all you had to do was miss a couple of square inches anywhere and the mosquitoes would find them larry skrtel pointed to half a dozen lodgepole pines that lay tumbled like jackstraws when his hand went up a woodpecker that had been drumming on one of the trunks flew away those trees werent down two years ago larry said in a voice that brooked no argument five gets you ten one of the quakes knocked them over no one did argue with him kelly wouldnt have dreamt of it arguing with somebody who was obviously right was a losers game up the eastern side of astringent creek they went they were near the eastern edge of the caldera kelly shook her head of the last caldera she corrected herself this one stretched most of the way across the park the eastern edge of the one from two million years ago was also somewhere around here that ones western edge though lay well over into idaho quakes was that a brief rumble underfoot kelly had almost convinced herself she was imagining things when ruth marquez laughed selfconsciously and said did the earth move for you too everybody groaned but daniel said yeah i think so that was only a little onemaybe a larry nodded kelly smiled remembering colin guessing the magnitude of the stronger quake the year before they might never have got together if he hadnt life could be seriously strange sometimes harder to be sure when youre outdoors she said not as much stuff to rattle and shake when youre indoors somewhere theres less room for doubt larry paused thoughtfully im not sure ive ever been indoors for an earthquake he said daniel and ruth both nodded only proves you guys arent from california kelly said as far as the other geologists were concerned that made them lucky they teased her she sassed them back as the crow flies coffee pot springs was between twelve and fifteen miles north of yellowstone lake there were more ravens than crows in yellowstone and the land route was longer than the aerial one would have been they hadnt got an early start they werent hurrying either they were fit enough but none of them except possibly daniel was really fit kelly guessed they wouldnt get there before nightfall and she turned out to be right along with the deet she smelled of her own sweat and the sunscreen shed also used liberally up around feet sunburn came easy she also smelled the chemical odor rising from astringent creek yellowstone was full of such hellish reeks fire and brimstone had shaped this land and were a long way from gone even now freezedried food could have been worse that was as much as she could say about it but a million stars blazed in the night sky and the milky way glowed bright and ghostly you never sawyou never imaginedthe heavens like this in la or berkeley too much air too dirty too too many lights too many people was what it boiled down to kelly would have enjoyed the view more if shed stayed up longer but she soon sought her sleeping bag and she wasnt the only one her last conscious thought was i hope the bears stay away they must have she woke up undisturbed just before sunrise almost undisturbed an itchy bump on the inside of her left wrist said at least one mosquito had found a place to eat larry had real coffee and was willing to share kelly and ruth were glad to partake of his bounty theyd only brought instant daniel declined i dont drink it he said my god kelly exclaimed how did you get through grad school crank he answered calmly she didnt know him well enough to tell if he was kidding they buried their trash doused the fire and went on i want to put in for a new set of legs ruth said as she worked out the kinks oh good im not the only one kelly said neither daniel nor larry complained maybe they werent feeling it the same way then again they were guys so maybe they were just being macho testosterone didnt addle male bison alone here and there hot springs fumed and mud pots bubbled a lot of them didnt even have names there were more features like that in yellowstone than in the whole rest of the world a couple of dozen hot spots burned through the earths crust one of them raised the hawaiian islands another the galapagos chain but most of them lay under the oceans the lava that came from those was smoothflowing basalt the yellowstone hot spot alone sat under continental crust rhyolite was like granite only with bigger crystals when it melted it didnt spread out easily the way basalt did it was too viscous it just sat where it was till the pressure got too great then then the supervolcano went off they tramped along shallow creek getting close to the springs a coyote eyed them from the edge of the pines then drew back larry said if it was along the road half a dozen carsd stop so the jerks inside could photograph a wolf to wow aunt martha back home he was right once more kelly had seen it happen she knew the difference between the two most people these days though grew upnd stayedso isolated from nature that any wild animal seemed exotic to them that was one of the things that made yellowstone so precious here was a great big not too badly disturbed chunk of what north america had been like before europeans arrived you couldnt find anything like this elsewhere and not just on account of the wildlife and if the hot spot sitting under it discharged then what then youd gone and dropped thousands of square miles of unspoiled wilderness into what was literally the worlds biggest barbecue youd never see your bison or your wolves or your grizzlies again the really bad news was that would be the least of your worries steam rose ahead a small swell of ground kept the geologists from seeing the springs themselves for a little while kelly remembered them from the last time shed come this way not long before she met colin theyd been well hot springs if theyd been anywhere close to a road people would have stopped and snapped pictures of them and queued up to use a couple of odorous outhouses they werent so showy as the ones in black sand basin or biscuit basin northwest up the highway from old faithful but they werent half bad they lay within a rough circle of sinter the grayish white silica that precipitated out of mineralladen water as it cooled all things considered they reminded kelly of zits on the face of the earth on a larger scale that was what the yellowstone supervolcano was she wished she knew where she could get her hands on a dab of cosmic clearasil remember folkswatch where you put your feet no boardwalks here larry said fair enough he had more field experience than the rest of them put together stay off the sinter crust you can break through you wont like it if you dotrust me dont count on animal tracks either ive seen more parboiled critters than i like to think about most places id say the grass was pretty safe here with everything thats been going on im not sure how good a guide it is that doesnt leave much daniel observed as they climbed the low rise maybe we should walk three feet off the ground dont let me stop you larry said daniel gave him a sour smile going uphill made kellys thighs and calves ache walking gave you great legs better legs anyhow kelly feared hers would never be great but you paid a price everything you did came with a price the older she got the more sure of that she became as if defying time no not as ifif only she pushed the pace the rest of the way the others didnt mind letting her forge ahead theyd all come to coffee pot springs before it wasnt as if she were stout cortez well balboa if you wanted to be pickykeats would have got a c in western civ on that peak in darien staring at the newfound pacific except she was coffee pot springs had gone nuts a brandnew geyser threw water at least a hundred feet in the air some of the other springs werent just pools any more they boiled and raged blorping water eight or ten feet high trying to find their inner geysers too several of them she was convinced blorped from places that hadnt boasted springs before ruth and daniel and larry came up beside her as she had done they stopped and stood there gaping holy shit ruth said larry nodded recovering faster than the rest of them daniel pulled a camera from a pocket of his windbreaker and started snapping away kelly started to reach for her own little canon she knew earthquakes messed with the plumbing systems under yellowstone after the hebgen lake quake in sapphire pool at the biscuit basin went batshit it erupted so ferociously it wrecked whatever subterranean channels that supplied it with water then it went back to being a pool knowing about such things was all very well seeing coffee pot springs totally transformed that was something else again and as kellys fingers closed on the digital camera yet another sharp but mercifully short quake rattled the ground under her feet a voice said im scared kelly needed a second or two to recognize it as her own marshall ferguson gripped one end of his sisters coffee table he hardly knew the guy on the other enda shlub named lemuel something lemuel vanessa had dated him for a while in high school and even in college till she met bryce he did know that if he werent her brother he wouldnt have done this for less than a blowjob the table was about the size of a carriers flight deck and solid wood with planks at least three inches thick it weighed as much as a rhino all her furniture was like that why couldnt she have bought cheap flimsy crap the way most people did ready lemuel asked he didnt even go by lem definitely a shlub no but lets do it anyway marshall answered lemuel needed a few seconds to process that they lifted more or less together marshall swore the table was even heavier than it looked and they said it couldnt be done he thought to make matters worse they had to tilt it sideways to get it out the door dad was here and a couple of other younger guys vanessa had lured with one blandishment or another no sign of bryce of course no sign of vanessas current oldfart boyfriend either hed already gone to denver and no sign of rob dammit the band was gigging in some college town inwas it montana since marshall was taller than lemuel he took the bottom position as they lugged the coffee table down the stairs that kept it more nearly level it also left him bearing more of the weight lucky me he thought vanessa had been carrying boxes into the uhaul parked outside pickles was already in his plastic cat carrier and yowling as if he expected them to start vivisecting him any second now he probably did marshall wouldnt have wanted to drive to denver with a cat in a carrier on the seat beside him vanessa didnt seem to worry about it she also wasnt too busy to play sidewalk superintendent when the coffeetable haulers came up careful she said you dont want to ding it says who marshall inquired says me his sister snapped she liked dishing it out shed never been so good at taking it cmon lemuel saidto marshall not vanessa lets get this fucker into the truck before my arms fall off okay marshall was on the bottom again when they toted it up the uhauls ramp at least the truck was big enough to have one getting the table into the cargo space by lifting it wouldnt have been much fun come to think of it nothing about moving was much fun marshall wondered how vanessa would like driving this monster to colorado even without pickles and his editorials she would have needed a special truckers license to get behind the wheel of anything bigger god and the gas it would burn through and who are you gonna get to move you in he asked her will uh hagop help he knew a guy who said that helping somebody move was a proof of true love hed met vanessas new squeeze a couple of times but he wasnt convinced the rug merchant had a whole lot hes got a bad back she answered so do inow marshall said as he eased the table down lemuel covered it with a dropcloth then shoved it into a corner of the cargo bed and stacked boxes on top of it that made good sense marshall wouldnt have guessed lemuel had it in him funny im laughing my ass off vanessa said you dont have to be here you know if you want to go back to santa barbara and your bong be my guest he almost flipped her the bird hopped into his car and roared up the harbor freeway to the pissing her off didnt bother him one bit but dad wouldnt be happy which was putting it mildly and his father already had too many reasons to be unhappy at him and at most of the world anyway vanessa went on from what i hear there are almost as many wetbacks in denver as there are in la getting unloadedll cost me a few bucks but not that much if you say so marshall turned back to lemuel ready for the next exciting episode if you say so lemuel replied not a bad imitation of marshall maybe he was less of a dud than marshall recalled or maybe hed grown up some since who the hell knew just after noon vanessa made a food run she came back with enough burger king burgers and friesand to her credit onion rings tooto sink a battleship and enough cokes to float it again the moving crew plowed through the chow like sherman plowing through georgia and left little more behind grease sugar and caffeine marshalls father said engulfing a double whopper with cheese in a couple of chomps cant go far wrong like that amen dad marshall agreed his double whopper was lasting a little longer because he was scarfing onion rings between bites he patted his stomach i feel like i swallowed a bowling ball yup his father nodded and sucked up coke through a straw im really gonna feel it in my back and shoulders tomorrow im getting too damn old to play stevedore marshall was half his dads age he knew hed be sore come morning too who wouldnt except somebody who really was a mover he was also amused to watch dad look around to make sure vanessa couldnt hear before he cussed who was dad kidding himself most likely vanessa swore whenever she felt like it and she didnt care who was in range when she let fly dad looked around again then he swiped a couple of marshalls onion rings grand theft marshall said youre busted dude no evidence his father said with his mouth full and chewed harder to make sure hed got rid of it all after a heroic swallow he changed the subject i wish like hell your sister wasnt doing this ive told her so too but shes kinda hard of listening one of his patented dry chuckles followed you may have noticed who me marshalls wideeyed innocence made dad chuckle again he went on you really have no use f the rug merchant have you now he glanced around warily and kept his voice down when it came to critiques of her love life vanessa wasnt sweet reason personified as a matter of fact no dmv records say hes two years older than i am dad had the grace to look faintly embarrassed i mean im seeing a younger woman too but nowhere near that much younger his eyes slid toward marshalls sack of onion rings again too latethey were gone he sighed and ate french fries instead marshall thought hed said everything he was going to for a while but turned out to be wrong but hagop isnt what im worried about huh marshall said then he remembered what dads new girlfriend who from one brief meeting seemed nice enoughhe sure liked her better than teo did for a living or wanted to do for a living or however the hell that worked he clapped a greasy hand to his forehead oh for gods sake dont do the skyisfalling dance again like vanessa will pay attention to that tell me another one well she didnt his father admitted but the sky isnt falling the grounds getting ready to blow up thats worse you have no idea how much worse nobody has any idea how much worse marshall cocked his head to one side only you huh only you and kelly i mean to his surpriseno to his astonishmentdad walked right into it thats right his father stuck out his chin and looked stubborn heredity rob thought anybody could see where vanessaand rob toogot it he didnt see it in himself the same way but then who ever does that was beside the point though he rubbed his fathers nose in it the way you rub a puppys nose right after it pisses on the rug you know what you sound like you sound like youre ready for a rubber roomor else for a really rancid tv movie one only you and your sweetheart know the truthhe made the capital letters painfully obviousand you cant get anybody to pay attention to you give me a break dad winced its not like you make it sound he mumbled i understand lieutenant ferguson please tell me how it is then now marshall did his best to impersonate a shrink his best must have been good enough he wasnt made to be able to do what his father suggested dad was laughing when he made the suggestion though a good thing he was too marshall didnt want to mess with him it wasnt just training though dad had it and marshall didnt marshall didnt want to hurt anybody there were times when dad did once again vanessa got it from him marshall might be no threat to make phi beta kappa at ucsbnot as long as the weed held out anywaybut he was plenty smart enough to keep his big mouth shut on that particular pearl of wisdom come on you lazy bums get busy damned if vanessa didnt make as if to crack the whip she had lots of boxes of clothes which werent bad to carry and of books which were paper seemed to defy the laws of physics a x x box definitely weighed more than twice as much as a x x lemuel played macho and carried a x x box of books in each armonce after that he used two arms for one box they finished loading about three vanessa hugged them all and kissed everybody on the cheek thanks kiddo she told marshall pickles squalled mournfully in the background its okay thats why youve got brothers and other beasts of burden yeah youre beastly all right she pressed an engraved portrait of ben franklin into his hand i want to get going you guys can use this for dinner he started to say they wouldnt be hungry for a week after all the fast food theyd killed at lunch he started to yeah but he sure didnt finish hed been working hard enough that his appetite was already coming back to life by dinnertime hed be ready to make a pig of himself a cnote wouldnt buy prime rib for the crew but they could do better than burger king he did ask will you have enough to keep you going till you land something in colorado one way or another ill make it she answered she went over to their father he also got a hug and a kiss he said something too low for marshall to catch then vanessa tossed her head the way marshall had watched mom do a million times that meant dad had come out with something dumbagain was the toss heredity too or had vanessa just watched mom till she imitated her without even knowing she was doing it asking her wouldnt be so real smart either again marshall kept his mouth shut besides he could make a shrewd guess about the subject line on that hairflipping head toss five got you ten dad was going on about the time bomb ticking under yellowstone marshall had poked around online it wasnt that he didnt believe the supervolcano was there whether it was likely to go off day after tomorrowor a week from tuesday at the latestwas liable to be a different question that was how it looked to him anyhow he knew how much he didnt know about volcanoes in general and the yellowstone supervolcano in particular by what google and wiki told him though nobody knew much about supervolcanoes not one had gone off in the past umpteen thousand years and if none went off in the next umpteen thousand years that would suit him fine vanessa stuck pickles on the uhauls front seat and fastened the belt around his carrier then she climbed into the cab she started the truck it sounded like the beater it was how far from la to denver a thousand miles plus or minus after so many thousands already on the odometer why worry about one more another clunk meant shed released the hand brake the emergency brake dad still called it hardly anybody younger than dad ever did but the way the uhaul farted as it rolled off made marshall think that wasnt such a bad name after all if you needed to use the hand brake in that truck you might be in an emergency he displayed the hundred do we eat dinner or do we drink it what they did was spend the next ten minutes knocking it back and forth and then splitting the difference kirin and cheap tempura went mighty well after moving and they were all grubby enough that any place fancier than a japanese greasy spoon wouldnt have wanted their business anyhow could be worse marshall didnt remember he was echoing a book his folks had read to him when he was little the sentiment seemed to hit the spot as well as the food and the beer it did to him anyhow his father said thats what im afraid of you knew you were starting to make it in the music business when o uuldnt fit the whole band and everything you needed for your show into one big old suv the members of squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles were all bemused to be traveling with two but there it was rob ferguson knew he was the band cheapskate but not even hed said boo when they bought the second vehicle when it was railroad time it was railroad time and that was all there was to it they didnt go out of their way to look outrageous or even flamboyant squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles wasnt that kind of band they were just four tired guys in their twenties when they pulled off i and drove south toward the place where theyd crash tonight rob was sitting in the lead suvs front passenger seat which made him navigator and lookout there it is he said pointing to the sign on the west side of the street rubys inn sweet said justin nachman who was driving the band tried not to stay at the big national chains with them you knew what you were getting all right that was the good news more to the point it was also the bad news justin slowed down then he muttered under his breath whered they stick the stupid driveway rob was about to suggest where they could stick it when justin found it rubys turned out to share an entrance with the next motel farther south the little convoy pulled into the lot one of the girls behind the desk a blonde whod be porky in another five or ten years had not a clue concealed anywhere about her person the other a skinny brunette not only knew about the bands reservations but whistled the start of impossible things before breakfast one of the tracks from the new album michael jackson or mariah carey would have committed seppuku if an album sold the way out of the pond was doing well michael jackson was already dead but you get the picture for a band like squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles numbers that would have been disastrous for a big act looked terrific instead they were making more money on sales from itunes and the physical cd than they were from live shows which had never happened before theyd be able to afford to take some extra time getting their next release just right so maybe it wasnt an enormous surprise that the registration clerk knew one tune or another from out of the pond nice yeah egoboo for sure but maybe not an enormous surprise impossible things before breakfast wasnt a single though never had been never would be if you knew that one you not only had the album but you really liked it are you going to the show tomorrow night rob asked her she shook her head cant afford it she said regretfully whats your name tina morton he wrote it down show up at willcall theyll have a seat for you thanks she beamed at him that might turn into something promising later on or it might not he wouldnt worry about it now tickets were only twentyfive dollars but he wasnt far from the days when twentyfive dollars werent only himself and if the next album tanked instead of taking off from what out of the pond was doing hed go right back there again the rooms next door to each other were well rooms rob had been in a lot of different rooms in a lot of different places hed had some that were better than these more re worse these were on the ground floor as the band had requested they wouldnt have to shlep stuff up and down stairs after everything was out of the cars justin stretched and grimaced miming an unhappy back were gonna be too old for all this hauling one of these days one of these days soon he amended so maybe he wasnt faking the sore back what do we do then its not what we do then its what we do in the meantime weve gotta make ourselves a big enough deal so we can pay roadies to take care of all the heavy sweaty shit for us rob said what i want to know is where do you go for dinner when youre in missoula montana go ask tina at the desk justin answered or i will if you dont want to shes not half bad my old man always tells me never volunteer but ill do it not half bad is right rob said and she knows impossible things before breakfast how impossible is that pretty much so most places but every once in a while they do let the braindamaged ones out of the home for the terminally inane justin said rob shot him the bird and went back to the front desk to chat up tina when he came back justin gave him a sardonic hand twenty minutes man what were you doing like talking like right ive never heard anybody call it that before that long you probably did it twice i wouldnt have rob replied with dignity some people dont blow their load too quick the first time anyway about dinner you mean you remembered dinner too rob took no notice it wasnt easy but he managed back toward the interstate half a block is something called the stone of accord where the gaelic meets the garlic it says on the menushe showed me one corned beef and linguini cabbage pizza oh boy menu looked pretty good and theyve got moose drool on tap maybe a block and a half the other way is the montana club if you havent lost all your money gambling you can eat dinner there rob knew about poker clubs that doubled as restaurants san atanasio had several when he was little theyd paid the town a lot in tax revenue now thanks to the big indian casinos theyd fallen on hard times and without that tax loot so had san atanasio which is better stone of accord is a couple of bucks cheaper tina says the foods better too okay well blame her if it turns out to be crappy justin set a hand on robs shoulder but dont worry well blame you too if its good though she gets all the credit have you been talking with my father rob asked not altogether in jest the band walked up to the stone of accord the food proved pretty good the other three guys drank toasts to tina draft moose drool stout was as good as anything this side of guinness and if you wanted guinness instead all you had to do was ask for it the waitress recognized them you look just like you do online she exclaimed as if that were some kind of surprise not me rob said gravely i wouldnt let em photograph my tail we made him climb out of the formaldehyde bottle too justin said the girl just kinda looked at him which meant she didnt know what the hell formaldehyde was fancier than informaldehyde rob supposed he also got his low taste in puns from his old man you guys are playing at the civic stadium right she asked no over at the golden sluice near the university campus rob said ive been there no way its big enough she said people will be jammed in there lined up around the block like you guys are the hottest band to come to town in a long time god help missoula in that case rob thought aloud he said i like the way she talks me too biff thorvald agreed loudly he sounded as if he liked it a lot he got her name and promised her a ticket if they were gonna sell out the place why the hell not rob liked tina bettershe got the jokesbut the waitress was a long way from terrible no guarantees but sometimes life on the road could be a lot of fun v oh christ another one colin ferguson said mournfully not all the little old ladies who died in san atanasio went on the south bay stranglers page in the ledger not even all the little old ladies who got murdered in town did just the week before a punk ransacking a house for shit to steal so he could feed his habit put three slugs into seventyfouryearold lupe sandoval when she got back from safeway sooner than she might have one of them blew out the back of her head the punk sat in a cell awaiting arraignment colin had questioned him he still had no clue hed done anything wrong it made you wonder why you bothered sometimes meanwhile the widow sandovals family was scrambling for the cash theyd need to bury her maria peterfalvy though shed got out of hungary in one jump ahead of russian tanks a framed blackandwhite photo on her dresser showed her not long afterwards shed been a beauty no other word for it she wasnt beautiful now lying there on the bedroom floor in the cramped little tract house where shed lived for upwards of forty years first with her husband and kids then after he died and they got on with their own lives by herself she wasnt living now either gabe sanchez looked out through the window filmy curtains kept people on the outside from seeing in but not the reverse sanchez said heres the first news van happy fucking day colin answered mrs peterfalvy wouldnt mind his language not any more she wouldnt he patted his hair with his hand though he couldnt imitate a newsies perfect coif he held his fistan imaginary mikeunder sanchezs nose tell me sergeant why havent you been able to catch this strangler son of a bitch when hes knocked offwhat is it nineteen little old ladies now nineteen is correct yes sanchez replied as if he were really being interviewed and we havent caught him because he doesnt leave fingerprints anywhere and his goddamn dna isnt in any of our databases he eyed colin as if his boss truly were a braindamaged reporter so why dont you fuck off and die and let me try and do my job but dont you realize you arent protecting the public the way the public deserves to be protected colin persisted his eyes wide with inncent indignation or possibly raw ignorance gabe sanchez started to say something then stopped and shook his head man thats scary you sound just like one of the shitheads how dyou do it the more you repeat yourself the better the imitation you do colin said i mean if you only say something once it cant be important right it cant have any real significance either that too sanchez agreed and here comes another van wheres the coroner colin asked morosely hes the guy who needs to answer questions him and the dna analysts i mean but youre the officer in charge of the investigation that means youre the guy with all the answers gabe said you know you are lieutenant it says so right here on the box colin told him where to put the box and how to fold it before he did sergeant sanchez laughed he could afford to he wasnt the officer in charge of the investigation neither was colin ferguson or not exactly even counting mrs peterfalvy only seven of the south bay stranglers victims lived in san atanasio other poor harried cops were looking for him all over the region but colin was the man on the spot right now he walked out to face the wolves he wished they were wolves he might have thrown them raw meat he might have shot them if all else failed he might have reasoned with them reporters were immune to reason and there wasnt enough raw meat in the world to make them happy opening fire would have got him talked about he strode out onto mrs peterfalvys neatly kept front lawn sure as hell the newsies bore down on him like the slavering beasts they were the tv and radio reporters thrust microphones in his face he disliked them more than the ones who worked for newspapers the latter actually had to be able to write tv people just had to know how to read and they didnt even need to be especially good at that video cameramen aimed the tools of their trade at him like so many bazookas unlike bazookas though video cameras could blow up an unwary mans reputation the cameramen watched what they filmed with a certain ironic detachment unlike the pretty people they abetted they actually had to know what they were doing reporters manners came straight out of preschool four shouted questions at the same time they didnt go me no me no me but they might as well have like a playground monitor colin held up a hand if you all talk at once i cant hear any of you he said that made them yell louder but they started waving their hands too colin pointed to a porky hispanic guy from what he thought of as eyewitless news yes victor is that the south bay strangler in there victor asked neatening his hair with the hand that wasnt holding the mike no sir colin answered his face expressionless the victim is maria peterfalvy age seventynine he spelled the last name some of the reporters as he had reason to know couldnt spell their own right more than two times out of three victor stamped his foot on the sidewalk he pooched out his lower lip like a threeyearold working up to a tantrum but he did manage to say no what i mean is did the south bay strangler strangle her then why dont you say what ean in colins experience people who didnt speak clearly also didnt think clearly then again if you expected a tv reporter to think clearly you were much too naive to make a good cop we dont have anything back from the lab of course colin said as a matter of fact the lab techs arent even here so we cant be sure yet but you do think so the redhead in the dark green suit couldnt have finished lower than third runnerup in the miss california pageant six or eight years earlier had they hired her for her reporting skills or for the way she filled out that suit colin couldnt be sure about that either but he knew how hed guess he also knew that if he said no most of the newsies would leave in a huff the south bay strangler was sexy especially during a sweeps month who cared about some dumb ordinary murder though poor lupe sandoval hadnt so much as made the news even though she was just as dead as mrs peterfalvy everything we see is consistent with what the strangler does the detective said reluctantly it could be a copycat case of course but that doesnt seem likely certain details about the stranglers mo hadnt reached the media yet if they had one tv station or another would have shouted them to the skies with a big exclusive label pasted on how long will you let the strangler continue his terrorization of women throughout this broad area of los angeles county another tv reporter demanded as if it were all colins fault colin had been positive that kind of question would come from somebody it was one of the reasons hed so looked forward to meeting the press were doing everything we can to catch this guy dave he said if you can suggest anything weve missed well listen believe me we will thats not my place dave sounded indignant and well he mightthe next idea he had would be his first he went on what youve done hasnt helped mrs uh peterfalk much either has it colin might have knownhell had knownhe would get the name wrong and probably wrong like that peterfalvy he corrected with cold politeness and spelled it again useless of course the only time reporters were shown to be morons was when they came on with nothing to readduring a car chase for instance otherwise scripts from smarter people disguised their vapidity and foolishness any sign the stranglers slipped up here asked mort greenbaum whod covered the crime beat on the breeze for about as long as colin had been a san atanasio cop not quite long enough to have started out in a snapbrim fedora in other words but long enough to give the impression that he had well like i said before the lab hasnt turned the house upside down and inside out yet so i cant say for sure colin replied offhand though doesnt look that way gotcha mort had a recorder but he took notes too probably to organize his own thoughts looking up from the scribbles he went on hes bound to sooner or later isnt he lord knows i hope so colin said or maybe hell pick on a little old lady who sleeps with a under the pillow maybe he will colin agreed im still hoping we catch him though we dont want to have to rely on civilians for doityourself justice woudnt you have a better chance if the san atanasio police departmentif all the police departments in the impacted areawerent so incompetent dave had finally figured out that colin had mocked him for screwing up mrs peterfalvys name cops werent supposed to do that to tv personalities the natural order of things was the other way around now stung the handsome man in the hugo boss suit was trying to get his own back the tv news would be a hell of a lot better if you clowns werent braindead too colin didntquitecome out with it you couldnt let them know what you thought of them and the chief would ream him out if he got into another slanging match with a reporter life was too short a damn shame but it was i already told you were doing everything we know how to do to go after him state personnel and the fbi have given us a hand too colin said we expect to succeed how many more innocent victims will perish before you do dave asked dramatically he never knew how close he came to becoming one of them the coroner and the lab technicians pulled up then some of the reporters descended on dr ishikawa for pearls of wisdom he and the techs hadnt done anything or viewed the crime scene yet but that didnt trouble the fourth estate other newshounds went after the neighbors for quotes about the late mrs peterfalvy if the neighbors didnt tell them she was a nice old lady who never bothered anybody colin would learn something new about human nature sergeant sanchez came up behind colin boy that musta been fun he said in a low voice always is colin agreed i want a cigarette and i dont even smoke i want a drink too i notice you arent saying you dont drink good for you sherlock but i dont on duty i dont unless i really and truly need one or more than one ill never tell sanchez said somebody will or a surveillance camera will catch it or something else will go wrong i dont need one that bad wouldnt mind writing a ticket for that cocksucker from channel though think their vans close enough to the hydrant there to write them up colin eyed it no he said regretfully besides theyd have a cow if one of us did it theyd say it was on account of they were asking questions we didnt like and theyd be right but he didnt say that i didnt mean you or me thats why god made the guys in the blue suits sanchez hadnt been out of a uniform so very long himself by the way he talked hed never worn one well colin had been that way himself most cops were let it go he said its not like the dickhead would pay the ticket himself tv stations theyve got money falling out of their assholes wish i did gabe sanchez said morosely the bills my kids run up they think im made of the stuff so i really can crap it he eyed colin yours are pretty much grown do they ever stop scrounging offa you eventually pretty much the one whos still in college goes a long way toward making up for the other two though and there are the lawyers bills too but you know about those colin said fuck do i ever sanchez winced those mothers send their kids to harvard and its like petty cash for them no wonder they run the country no wonder at all colin nodded gabe had that one straight all right did he ever colin consoled himself by remembering that even lawyers brats at harvard fell foul of booze and dope and some of them would decide they were more interested in discovering themselves than in getting a diploma some would figure they already knew it all and again leave without the sheepskin some would graduate and then try to make it as rockn rollers instead of sensibly imitating dad and mom he knew all the verses to all those songs maybe in the end things evened out maybe he wouldnt bet anything he couldnt afford to lose dr ishikawa came out of mrs peterfalvys neat little house we wont be sure till the dna results come in but it sure looks like another one yeah i figured the same thing colin said will this guy ever fuck up hed put on an optimistic face for the tv morons among his own kind he could say what he really thought cops were like family they didntusuallyhold the truth against you not that that did you a hell of a lot of good but there it was and colin took what small advantage of it he could the rockies there they were right out the apartment window vanessa liked that on clear days you could see mountains in los angeles too but they sat lower on the horizon and they sure didnt march from north to south in one magnificent straight line when it got smoggy they disappeared then again the rockies also disappeared when it got smoggy till vanessa moved here she hadnt thought denver could get smoggy surprise too many cars in not enough space could do that almost anywhere denver had so many cars and so many people whod moved here in the past twentyfive years to escape the crowding and pollution in wherever the hell they were from that its freeway system was hopelessly overstretched morning and afternoon traffic crawls made vanessa miss las commutes before she moved she wouldnt have imagined anything could pickles was not a big denver booster hed spent the first couple of days after he got here pissing and shitting on the apartment rug shed gone through a bottle of that natures miracle enzyme junk but the place still smelled of cat part of that was marking his new territory of course and part was expressing his opinion of anybody who could coop him up in a carrier for as long as it took to get from california to colorado he couldnt write angry emails but he got the message across vanessas new job didnt pay as well as the one shed left but the apartment was bigger newer and cheaper than the one shed had before people in denver bitched about the high cost of housing vanessa wasnt impressed even after a couple of market meltdowns la still cost more she didnt particularly like her new job amalgamated humanoids made everything from crashtest dummies to fancy audioanimatronic robots they competed for a lot of government grants so they needed someone to write and edit proposals reading rfps from the feds proved that washington did believe in capital punishment at least by boredom reading what allegedly bright amalgamated humanoids engineers fondly imagined to be english proved some people grew up without a native language that was the kindest explanation vanessa could find anyhow she hadnt likeeli job shed quit so she could move to denver either and she hadnt liked the one before that she really hadnt liked the classes she was taking at long beach state which was why shed got a job instead she wasnt happy unless she disliked something not that shed ever put it like that bryce had not long before she told him to hit the road cause and effect she would have denied on a stack of bibles that the crack had anything to do with the breakup she would have said the same thing about the poem hed had accepted it was when you got right down to it a pretty goddamn stupid poem one thing she didnt love about amalgamated humanoidsshe was starting a collection the way she always didwas the wild upanddown workload proposals had iron deadlines if they had to go out by pm tuesday precisely you made sure they did if that meant pulling sixteenhour days saturday sunday and monday you pulled them and if after that you spent the rest of the week counting paper clips and rubber bands and goofing around online the boss didnt care you stored up energy for the next crazy time not everything in denver was perfect then but it was no worse than la as soon as vanessa turned in her california license plates for ones stamped out by colorado convicts she felt more or less at home the one down spotthe place where she was unhappy without wanting to be unhappy in a manner of speakingwas her love life when she was in the throes of writing or of translating into english someone elses godawful attempt at writing a proposal she didnt have time for hagop and she soon started to wonder if hagop ever had time for her i am too busy he would say when she called him not all the time but often enough to be annoying more than often enough vanessa had a low annoyance threshold he wasnt always too busy oh no when he woke up with a bulge in his pants he was charming and attentive and sweet till she put out then the carpet business consumed him again bryce had been horny all the damn time hed sulk and get pissy when she said no and if she said no two or three days running hed play with himself instead it made her feel she was just a convenience for him maybe a little more enjoyable than a hand but not absolutely necessary shed told herself things would be different with an older man he wouldnt keep bugging her the way bryce did and hed be grateful when she gave herself to him well yes and no hagop wasnt horny all the damn time biology wouldnt let him be but when he was he bugged her just as much as somebody half his age would have once he got what he wanted he ignored her till the next time he started feeling the pressure again vanessa had never been one to suffer in silence as soon as she got irked enoughwhich didnt take longshe called him on it the only reason you want me around is so you can fuck me she said one evening after hed done just that the blunt language would have made her father flinch so she hoped it would have the same effect on any man his age no such luck hagop leaned up on one elbow and looked at her his heavyfeatured face expressionless he liked a light on in the bedroom seeing what they were up to helped him get where he was going after a moment he said and this surprises you because if were lovers youre supposed to love me not just lay me not just make love to me love me vanessa saidot justor what the hell did i go and get rid of bryce for she kept that part to herself she had an accurate suspicion that hagop wouldnt care why bryce sure hadnt cared why shed dumped the guy she was living with before she met him all hed ever cared about was getting it in hagops face remained studiously blank i am afraid you may ask more than i am able to give oh yeah id better not vanessa glared at him ive got news for youi didnt pack up and move to colorado just to be your fuck toy i did not expect you to move here at all he answered with a shrug as long as you did though do you expect me not to enjoy it things were falling apart vanessa didnt need to be the king of babylon to see the writing on the wall you filthy son of a bitch she snarlednot the ideal endearment when they were both naked in her bed and his seed still dribbled out of her to make a wet spot but most heartfelt you moved here to get rid of me it was obvious now why in blue bleeding hell hadnt it been while she was still back in san atanasio with dignity hagop shook his head i moved here for exactly the reason i told you in california i saw the chance to make more money rug merchant she jeered thats all that matters to you isnt it he got out of bed and started to dress i am going to pretend i did not hear that count yourself lucky that i am his voice held nothing vanessa knew all about hot rages meeting a cold one gave her pause shed fight like a wildcat all the same it wouldnt be hard for her to end up dead in this apartment where she hadnt lived very long so i did not move here for the purpose of getting rid of you hagop continued tonelessly tucking his shirt into his slacks that as they say in the trade was an added bonus an added redundancy but she didnt say that either she did say what am i supposed to do now he shrugged again this is no longer my worry you are old enough to be an adult unlikely as it sounds you will land on your feet or on your backwhichever suits you and then before too long you will find out that the next one whoever he is does not measure up to your imagination either he walked out of the bedroom pickles meowed at him he didnt answer the cat the front door opened it closed it didnt slamhagop was still holding things in his footsteps faded down the stairs with the door closed she couldnt hear them at all by the time he got to the bottom you bastard you stinking shitheaded bastard she whispered then she all but ran into the shower shed used it not long before he came over but so what now she wanted to scrub every trace of his touch off her body she didnt usually use a bath sponge tonight she made an exception she turned the water up as hot as she could stand too once she finally came out she stripped the sheets off the bed she wanted to throw them out she really wanted to douse them in gasoline and make a bonfire out of them wasnt some ancient movie called the burning bed if she could douse hagop in gasoline and make a bonfire out of him but she couldnt oh she could but she was much too likely to get caught the asshole wasnt worth doing hard time for as a cops kid she knew better than most how godawful state prison was and she couldnt even toss the sheets replacing them wouldnt be cheap after making this movemaking this move for that worthless reptilian turd she couldnt afford a lot of grand gestures shed just have to shove quarters into one of the buildings machines and wash that man right out of her bedclothes any of amalgamated humanoids products had more in the way of warmth more in the way of feeling than he did so why hadnt she realized that when she fell for him after she gave bryce the heaveho she shrugged shed been looking for a lifeline and shed found one now she discovered it had an anvil on the end not one of those cork floats she pulled fresh sheets out of a cabinet in the hall all the bed linen in there had been washed since hagops nasty sweat last polluted it it would have to do grimly she started making the bed pickles thought it was a game and tried to help in lieu of punting him she tossed a couple of kitty treats out into the hall and bribed him to go away bryce miller wondered if he would ever see a job after he finally finished his thesis the way the economy looked these days odds were against him hed played the gradschool game as well as anybody could hed been a reader hed had research assistantships and taships hed tutored highschool kids hed taught at a couple of community colleges the proof of his success was that he could see the end of the dissertation ahead and he wasnt broke yet maybe if hed chosen a sexier field than hellenistic poetry he shook his head wrong comparison hellenistic poetry could be plenty sexy it could here and there be downright filthy maybe if hed chosen a more practical field than hellenistic poetry but then i wouldnt be me he murmured he had his laptop set up on the table in the dining nook of the little onebedroom place hed hastily found after vanessa decided change was in the air papers and books covered about twothirds of the tabletop when he needed to eat he had to put the computer away if he hadnt found a secondhand copy of the persian boy when he was in high school he might never even have heard of the hellenistic age much less ended up trying to make a living studying it somewhere out in the big wide world there might be people possibly even englishspeaking people who could resist getting drawn in by mary renaults prose there might be but bryce wasnt any of them hed started trying to find out how much in the novel was real and how much she was making up most of it and not a whole lot respectively hed soon discovered writers were dangerous people they could warp the lives of readers theyd never met readers they couldnt meet because they were dead by the time some beatup old copy of one of their books fell into the rightthe wrong hands bryce wondered if he would ever write a poem that affected even one person as much as the persian boy had changed him he laughed at himself talk about setting your sights high out in the courtyard one of the poolside regulars did a cannonball that raised a splash like a young mushroom cloud three or four of the others gave forth with whoops and applause maybe a dozen peoplemore men than womenpretty much monopolized the pool here there was no law that said bryce couldnt swim in it he didnt think they would have gone out of their way to make him feel unwelcome if he had but that was the point they hung out there and he didnt the same kind of group down to sex ratio and precancerous tans had ruled the roost at the building where hed lived with vanessa he looked down at his own hands he was pale almost to invisibility no need for him to worry about melanoma no sir hed probably die of some fungus infection he caught from an egyptian papyrus of the second century bc or else of pneumonia brought on by aggressive library airconditioning another cannonball this one even bigger and wetter than the last more cheers from the regulars bryce eyed the waves rolling across the pool and slopping over the coping on the far side if you threw an asteroid into the pacific somewhere near new zealand waves would swamp los angeles the same way cheery thought he said the longer he lived alone the more he talked to himself he would have worried about it more if vanessas dad which was still how he thought of colin ferguson most of the time hadnt told him he did the same thing susan thought it was funnypeculiar that hed stayed friends with his exs father it wasnt even that they both found themselves in the same boat at the same time or that the boat was named titanic dammit bryce liked colin and for some reason it worked both ways had the older mans life worked out differently he would have made a good scientist instead of a good cop he had that restless itch to know to put pieces together till they formed a satisfying whole it probably wasnt an accident that his new lady friend was a geologist bryce wondered what hed seen in louise back in the day she was nice enoughshe worked at being nice in fact worked hard at itbut she wasnt what youd call long on brains so what bryce wondered again out loud chances were colin had been so happy he was getting laid regularly that he hadnt cared about anything else kai su teknon bryce wondered that was greek and it was what julius caesar had really said when he saw that brutus was one of the guys shoving knives into him on the ides of march it meant you too kid bryce was aiming it at himself now that vanessa was gone he wondered what hed seen in her past a pretty face nice tits and long legs that opened for him like the door into heaven what more did you need when you were first starting out you thought everything was just like the movies and you were guaranteed to live happily ever after he knew what shed seen in him shed been fighting with her thenboyfriend and bryce looked like an escape hatch that shed been fighting with the other guy should have been a red flag but when you had a boner that wouldnt quit it was easy enough to figure the fights were all the fault of the sob she was ditching did hagop whatshisname figure vanessas fights with bryce were all his fault maybe but then again maybe not hagop had a good many miles on the odometer chances were hed seen that things were rarely as onesided as the person talking about them made them out to be of course why would he care when you landed a girl young enough to be your daughter why would you care about anything it might not last long but wouldnt you have fun while it did when im in my fifties will i troll for girls in their twenties bryce was sure hed still look at girls in their twenties that was one of the things they were for but to touch instead of just look he hoped to n agaappily settled with someone by then hed hoped to be happily settled with vanessa whatever else might happen that wouldnt not now his phone rang he picked it up and smiled when he recognized the number hey susan he said i was just thinking about you in a manner of speaking it was true well good i was thinking about you too susan ruppelt said german or maybe dutch bryce guessed one of these days hed get around to asking her it wasnt urgent not the way it might have been a lifetime earlier in la these days any white whose first language was english counted as an anglo that cracked up bryce and some of his jewish friends which didnt mean they didnt take advantage of it susan went on how crazy should you get before your orals theres an interesting question youre going to you know whether you want to or not he answered she was scheduled to take them fall quarter it seemed a long way off to bryce but it wouldnt to susan tell me about it she yipped i know i know he tried to sound soothing hed survived his exams almost three years ago now and got blasted afterwards listen if your chairpersons worth the paper shes printed on she is susan broke in claudia can drive me nuts sometimes but shes one of the best in the country thats why i came here cool bryce stayed in soothing mode he still didnt call professor towers by his first name and wondered if he ever would but then again professor towers first name was elmer so chances were nobody called him by it that was neither here nor there though like i was saying if shes worth anything she wont let you go up for exams unless shes sure youll do fine she told me the same thing i dont know whether to believe it though susan said believe it bryce said firmly when you look back on them doctoral exams are more a rite of passage like than anything else they dont feel that way when youre looking forward to them susan sounded fretfuland who could blame her disasters did happen the year after bryce passed his orals a woman doing ancient rome gruesomely flunked hers no one but the profs who examined her was supposed to know what happened but word got out all the same the guy under whom shed studied had retired a few months after the fiasco ucla was still searching for a fulltime romanist with upcoming budgets looking as starvationlean as the current one the university might keep searching for a long time but susan wasnt like poor underprepared joanna bryce didnt know much about western medieval history he knew a solid scholar when he saw one and hed done a roman minor field himself as susan was going to with whatever temporary lecturer held the slot come fall hed tutored her after they started dating but not for longshe had a better grasp of the romans than he did hey you know your stuff he said the only thing you have to fear is fear itself you dont come down with stage fright do you not usually but im not used to going up on this big a stage either theyll cut you slack for that theyve seen panicked grad students before if i got through you can do it youre way more outgoing than ill ever be im just afraid ill forget everything the second they start asking me questions wont happen honest to god babe it wont they started me out with softballs so i could loosen up a little before they started hitting me with the tougher ones from everything ive heard from other people thats how they usually do it they know so much though come hell or high water susan was going to worry if they want to flunk me they can sure they can they can flunk anybody if they want to they sure couldve nailed me to the cross but thats the whole point they wont want to really susan said in a small voice really youll do great bryce answered theyd been through this before if she needed a shoulder to cry onor to fret onhe was glad to lend his hed got through what she was approaching he knew the bumps in the road he sometimes thought grad students were the only people fit to associate with other grad students no one else understood the peculiar pile of shit they had to shovel he also sometimes thought people whod gone through messy breakups were the only ones fit to associate with others of their kind for similar reasons thank you bryce susan breathed no messy breakups in her past so bryce hoped like hell he was full of it vi a secretary dumped the latest pile of printouts on colin fergusons desk here you are lieutenant she said thanks josie colin spoke spanish after a fashion small vocabulary bad grammar heavy accent it often came in handy on the street but he knew better than to trot it out with josefina linares it would only piss her off she went out of her way to show how american she was chances were he knew more espanol than she did he also knew shed had family in the states longer than he had he went through the printouts one by one they were dna records from convicted felons plainly the south bay strangler had never been nabbed for anything that required him to give a dna sample but if someone who was closely related to him had the near miss might point the cops toward the real perp it could work it had worked the lapd had busted the bastard they called the grim sleeper after his sons dna made them look in his direction hed got away with murderand with a whole swarm of other crimesfor more than twentyfive years but he sat in san quentin now going through the endless appeals that came with capitalmurder cases maybe one of these days hed get the lethal injection he deserved colin thought he did anyhow hed met only a handful of cops who opposed capital punishment or maybe hed die of old age firsthe was up around sixty the way justice worked in california old age seemed the better bet none of these dna tests was even within shouting distance of the south bay stranglers genetic material except for rape and murderdetails detailsthe strangler was a good citizen he came from a family of good citizens too or if by some chance he didnt his relatives were also careful criminals colin muttered darkly you couldnt give up too soon just because none of these samples led anywhere that didnt mean some other one wouldnt maybe it would come in the next batch wt was that song about tomorrow tomorrow you had to hope it looked better than today hed had to try to convince himself of that too often lately sometimes it was true hed had that enormous hole in his life after louise walked out on him kelly filled some of it anyhow did he love her did she love him even thinking the word scared him more than a crackhead with a shotgun how long would he need to work up the nerve to say it and vanessa had dumped or been dumped byshe couldnt tell the story the same way twice running which made colins bullshit detector go off the old guy shed been seeing colin came out with sympathetic noises whenever he talked to her but he was anything but brokenhearted the couple of times hed met the guy hagop had been perfectlyalmost greasilypolite the armenian didnt have a record colin had quietly made sure of that but the notion of vanessa sleeping with a man his own age had still given him the willies so he didnt need to worry about that any more what shed do next whether shed stay in colorado or come back to la whatever she would do she hadnt done it yet so he didnt need to worry about it yet so he wouldnt unless of course he did he still had plenty to worry about here at the cop shop not just the south bay strangler his thoughts about a crackhead with a shotgun werent free association somebody with a shotgun had blown the head off a korean who ran a liquor store near the corner of san atanasio boulevard and new hampshire that was only a couple of miles east of the station but it was anything but a prime part of town most of the time people robbed liquor stores to get money for drugs most of the time they started shooting because they were already amped to the eyebrows that made crack and crystal meth the two leading candidates a surveillance camera showed that the perp was african american so crack seemed more likely no guarantees but more likely three different news shows had run the surveillance videoincluding what happened when a charge of doubleaught buck caught the luckless soandso behind the counter square in the face this footage may be disturbing theyd all said or words to that effect it was a hell of a lot worse than disturbing as if they cared if it bleeds it leads with luck somebody out there would recognize the asshole with the scattergun with more luck whoever did recognize him would have the nerve or the moral indignation or whatever else it took to call the police it did happen not always not even often enough but it did no matter what the tv shows claimed though that wasnt why they ran their disturbing footage they ran it for the same reason they preempted things to show car chases it made people watch once youd said that youd said everything that needed saying as far as they were concerned the phone rang colin picked it up fergusonsan atanasio police hey colin nels jensen here jensen was a torrance police captain also chasing the south bay strangler any luck on the dna profiles if there was nels would find some way to take credit for it he was a pretty fair cop but he liked seeing his own smiling face in the paper and on tv hed be a chief one day and probably of a department bigger than the torrance pd because he was a glory hound colin might have been tempted to tell him no even if the answer were yes if he wanted yes so much he could dwork that produced it instead of scrounging off other people as things were though colin could say diddlysquat with a perfectly clear conscience ahh shit jensen said ive got one of my sergeants plowing through them too but he hasnt found anything close to a match i was hoping youd do better because im a lieutenant not just a chickenshit sergeant colin wondered at least nels had somebody in his department checking through them but if that hardworking sergeant did find a dna close to the stranglers two guesses whod announce it not the guy who did the work the captain whod assigned it to him i always hope colin said i dont expect too much thats all yeah i know that tune jensen agreed he was a cop okay ill check with you laterand ill let you know if we come up with anything juicy uhhuh ill believe that when i see it colin kept his mouth shut there it was usually the best thing you could do right he answered thanks he hung up from the desk next to his gabe sanchez raised a questioning eyebrow jensen colin said oh boy gabe silently clapped his hands together hes got everything wrapped up in a pretty pink bow i bet yeah right colin said torrance is looking at the dna tooi will give them that much yippy skip the sergeant was good at curbing his enthusiasm i notice you arent saying jensens doing it himself nah he gave it to a sergeant not like its important or anything sanchez flipped him off so what was his high and mightiness doing instead getting his teeth whitened for the next time he goes under the lights he didnt tell me but it wouldnt surprise me a bit one of these days the guy will fuck up gabe said colin wasnt sure whether he was talking about the strangler or nels jensen till he went on assholes almost always do they never think they will but they do its part of what makes them assholes yeah said colin for whom that was also an article of faith i just hope to god he does it soon when he got home that night he grilled a couple of lamb chops with paprika and garlic powder and nuked a package of frozen mixed veggies it wasnt exciting cooking it was an imitation of louises and she wouldnt show up on the food network any time soon even if she did watch it after they broke up at first hed eaten out almost every night that got expensive fast though this saved him money and it was more what he was used to half the veggies went into a plastic icebox dish then into the refrigerator he wrapped half a chop in aluminum foil and stuck it in there too it would do for lunch when he had a day off when he was done eating he washed the dishes and left them in the drainer to dryhe hated drying dishes the kitchen had a dishwasher but using it for one person was another moneywasting joke he pulled out a mystery after dinner most of the time he read them to laugh at them what the authors didnt know about police procedures would fill fatter books than the ones theyd written every once in a while he had the pleasure of finding a good one this one seemed betwixt and between not silly enough to laugh at not good enough to keep him turning pages he tossed it aside and grabbed the remote espn was showing the world series of poker poker was a fine gamehed won several grand in his navy daysbut it was not a goddamn sport colin changed channels a talking head on fox news bellowed his opinions to the world colin changed again just as fast he had opinions of his own and didnt figure he needed anybody elses secondhand ones cnn was showing what the hell was cnn showing a longdistance shot from a helicopter snowy ground with dead pine trees sticking up through the snow like whiskers on a corpses cheek a big plume of black smoke climbing high in the air mountains in the distance fuck colin said that looks like yellowstone he shook his head what could be going on in yellowstone in the middle of november it looked like a forest firea big old forest fire like the one theyd had back in the last century but that was crazy how could you have a big old forest fire this time of year wouldnt the snow on the ground and the snow on the trees control a fires size then a graphic appeared in the lower lefthand corner of the screen yellowstone eruption it said holy shit colin yanked the phone out of his pocket kelly was in yellowstone doing more seismic research when he dialed her number he got voice mail that didnt surprise him cellphone reception in the park was spotty at best hey hon its me just saw the news call when you get the chance hope youre okay bye the anchor had started yakking while he was delivering his message eruption in the lower fortyeight since mount st helens in he was saying it began this afternoon in yellowstone national park near ranger lake where the hell is ranger lake colin askedhe didnt remember hearing of it as if on cue a map of yellowstone replaced the eruption shot ranger lake lay in the far southwestern part of the park about as far away from a paved road as you could get this side of the canadian border a big red x near the lake presumably marked the spot where the volcano was going off geologists tell us that yellowstone national park was formed by ancient volcanic activity the anchorman went on the last known eruption there though took place some seventy thousand years ago by the way he said it that was long enough ago to be sure the fire down below was out now the story he was reporting gave his tone the lie he went on with us earlier today was kelly birnbaum an expert on the geological peculiarities of yellowstone and there she was on colins tv in a heavy jacket and a wool stocking cap kind of thing with her hair sticking out underneath no the eruption isnt a big surprise she said whats probably a surprise is that its been so long since the last one how will this impact attendance at our most popular and most beloved national park when summertime rolls around again asked the reporter who was holding a mike up to her face no way to tell yet she answered also no way to tell whether this eruption is a standalone so to speak or a forerunner to something bigger instead of letting the reporter find out what she was talking about cnn cut back to the anchorman and the shot of the eruption he sarted going on about the ash the new volcano was spewing into the air and about how it would impactthat seemed to be cnns favorite word tonightair travel in america commercials came on colin went back to fox news hoping to see something different the talking head there was trying to blame the eruption on the administration swearing colin switched to msnbc their talking head was blaming the volcano on congress no one on any of the news channels said anything about the supervolcano under yellowstone they couldnt all be that ignorant could they after weighing it colin decided they couldnt so why werent they talking about it because they hoped this wasnt the beginning of the big blowup because if they talked about it and this turned out not to be the big blowup theyd look even more like fools than they commonly did because if this was the start of the supervolcano eruption nobody could do anything about it anyway after a little more weighing colin decided any or all of those reasons might be good enough he wished like hell kelly would call him back kelly had never been on a snowmobile before if god was very kind she told herself shed never be on another snowmobile again noisy bouncy if you combined the worst features of a motorcycle without shocks on a crappy road and a chainsaw motor you were within screaming distance and screaming was what she felt like doing screaming was also what she had to do if she felt like talking with larry skrtel the usgs geologist was driving the hideous contraption on which she found herself a reluctant passenger daniel olson piloted another one with ruth hanging on to him for dear life the only way she could communicate with them was by shooting off a flare the scenery was beautiful most people never got to see yellowstone like this then again most people never had to worry about whether the ground would give way beneath their feet in the biggest goddamn volcanic eruption since the paleolithic knowing too much could be worse than not knowing enough and her colleagues gave her a hard time before they climbed aboard the snowmobiles teachers pet they called her and went on from there they should have interviewed larryhe really knows what hes talking about ruth was grinning when she said it kelly felt the needle even so hey cmon theyre cnn you cant expect them to know who to grab daniel put in were all probably lucky they didnt talk to that guy who analyzes leftover nutrients in bison feces nah they know bullshit when they see it kelly said everybody groaned she added they crank out enough themselves now she was zooming past half a dozen bison the big shaggy beasts pawed at the snowy ground with their forelegs working their way down to the dead but still tasty grass under that blanket of white they didnt like the noisy snowmobiles a couple of them trotted away from the mechanical contraptions that was good if theyd charged instead they could run faster than the machines were going then again maybe the snowmobiles flatulent buzz wasnt the only thing spooking the bison kelly needed a little while to realize exhaust from the machine daniel and ruth were riding wasnt all that was fouling yellowstones crisp cold clean lateautumn air you could smell sulfur almost anywhere in the park if the wind was blowing the rightor the wrong depending on how you looked t itway some of the ancient greeks had said quakes were caused by what amounted to earthfarts put one of those robed and bearded philosophers here in yellowstone and hed be sure he was right but what kelly smelled now seemed harsherhotter than the usual brimstone reek from hot springs or fumaroles the wind was blowing to the southwest at a right angle from their approach route toward the eruption but the new volcano made itself known all the same and the farther they went the less pristine and white the snow seemed volcanic ash had started pattering down from the big column of dust and ash ahead the prevailing wind would sweep more of it across wyoming and down into coloradoand who could guess how much farther than that nobody could not yet the ash still floating in the air could prove an even bigger nuisance the eruption in iceland had screwed up air travel between the states and europe and from one part of europe to another on and off for weeks if little bits of grit chewed up jet engines on routes between one american coast and the other that wouldnt be so goodwhich was putting it mildly airplane travel in this day and age sucked not being able to travel by airplane would suck even harder in a country as big as the united states but that wasnt all that was rattling kellys cage so far this seemed like a normal volcanic eruption the kind yellowstone often hadeven if often didnt mean lately nobody knew how a supervolcano worked though all the evidence pointed towards everything happening at once if lava spurted up all around and most of what was now the park fell toward the center of the earth it would all be over in a hurry anyhow larry steered a little closer to the bechler river which ran in the direction of though not into ranger lake the river hadnt frozen up yet ducks rose from it wings beating swiftly as they got airborne they liked snowmobiles no better than the bison had something ahead was burning larry waved to daniel they stopped side by side at first kelly thought she was seeing lava oozing up from some new crack in the earths crust that led down to the magma pool under yellowstone but no the lodgepole pines were burning which was pretty goddamn aweinspiring in its own way snow stifled wildfires that was a rule as old as the park well there were older rules how hot did the lava flow heat the trees hot enough to steam the snow off them and off the ground between them hot enough to dry them out and set them blazing some of what was going up into the air was genuine honesttogod wood smoke silence slammed down after the engines cut out it seemed all the more quiet because kellys ears were on the stunned side through it larry said i dont think we ought to get a whole lot closer yknow daniel spread his gloved hands youre the boss if you dont think its a good idea we wont but its a shame to come this far and not be able to go the rest of the way itd be a shame to get into trouble we cant get out of larry said and kelly knew they wouldnt be going any farther i wonder what it looks like from space she said what are the satellites picking up dust ash smoke ruth said oh more than that kelly said theyre bound to have infrared sensors to look through all the crap and see exactly where the hot stuff is coming out no doubt about it larry agreed that made kelly feel good the way a nod from one of her profs at her doctoral orals had shed understood something clearly very few things outside the bedroom were more satisfying inside the bedroom did colin know what was going on if cnn had somebody in yellowstone it was bound to be making the headlines but was he watching tv or listening to the radio she hoped he was she wanted him to see her hed be proud of her if he did and having him proud of her mattered it mattered a lot in fact was that love if it wasnt it sure felt like a stop on the way theyd known each other for a year and a half now theyd been lovers for more than a year colin hadnt said the word not once kelly hadnt either she didnt think it was her place to start talking about love he was the one whod been burned he needed time to work that through how long did he need kelly shrugged inside her anorak this wasnt the time or place to worry about that something not far enough ahead went boom a subsubbass a noise felt more than heard kelly felt something else too the ground shook under her feet ruth pointed into the sky whoa she said whoa was right a chunk of rock about the size of a school bus flew through the air with the greatest of ease for a bad second kelly thought the parabola it was describing would end right on top of her then she realized the volcanic bomb would fall short it did by a couple of hundred yards the ground shook again at the impact how much would a flying boulder that size weigh plenty and how hot was it hot enough so the snow went sssss when it came down that was just steam rising into the air ive never seen anything like that before daniel sounded deeply impressed i have in hawaii no snow there of course larry said but that was too close for comfort i think were like kansas city right nowweve definitely gone as far as we can go or maybe a little farther move we adjourn we probably shouldnt waste much time doing it either daniel still looked disappointed he didnt argue this time though that enormous boulder still steaming in the snow was a potent argument all by itself adjourn they did marshall ferguson wanted to talk to an academic advisor at ucsb about as much as hed wanted to have his wisdom teeth pulled the dentist had knocked him out beforehand hed got to eat ice cream and milk shakes for a couple of days afterwards and the lorcets the quack prescribed for pain werent the least enjoyable drugs hed ever swallowed no anesthetic here if he wasnt careful now he not only wouldnt get the shift in majors he wanted but he might end up with a bachelors degree at the end of next year back in the old days people said you could flit from major to major like a butterfly in a botanical garden times had changed they wanted you out the door diploma clutched in your sweaty fist ready to turn into cannon fodder for the big wide world marshall on the other hand liked living in santa barbara he liked the weed and the booze and the girls he liked the very idea of a town where they had a couchburning day he even liked some of his classes whatever the big wide world held in store it wouldnt be as much fun as he was having now he was all too sure of that and he was also sure his old man wouldnt keep subsidizing him once he said farewell to the university he wasnt allergic to work but he vastly preferred partying sooner or later it would have to end he was also too mournfully sure of that later was better though rob was still partying the lucky soandso he hadnt let an engineering degree get in his way but marshall had seen that playing in a band you wanted to take somewhere was also a hell of a lot of work besides unlike rob he was hopelessly unmusical himself hed thought without much hope about landing a hollywood job with a bachelors in film studies but like history it seemed more likely to lead to your working in retail the rest of your life that looked like hell on earth to him then again there was no guarantee hed ever get any kind of job at all with a filmstudies degree the way the economy bit the big one nobody was hiring anybody these days one more reason not to pile up enough units to make them throw you out if you probably couldnt get a job any which way staying in school looked great by comparison it sure did to marshall convincing dad wouldnt be so much fun but hed done it before hed be able to come through one more time a girl walked out of the advisors office she was kind of cute a brunette with a button nose and perky tits under a tight blouse marshall smiled at her you never could tell but she didnt smile back whatever the advisord told her it wasnt what she wanted to hear ms rosenblatt will see you now the secretary told him her nameplate said sande ankenbrandt her hair by coincidence or design was sandy too go on in uh thanks marshall did selma rosenblatther first name was on a plaque on the doorwas a little older than his mother shed let the gray in her hair show which made her seem older yet the way she eyed him warned that he was the eleventyfirst student shed seen today and that she wasnt delighted to have him here take a seat she said give me your name and your sin from her name hed guessed she would sound like a new yorker she didnt by the way she talked she was a valley girl only she wasnt a girl any more and hadnt been for quite a while sit he did on the vinylcovered badly padded chair in front of her desk behind it she was snuggled by a leather armchair they let you know who was who all right im marshall fergusontwo l s he said and rattled off his ninedigit student identification number some bureaucrat his ass in a fancy chair like the advisors must have come up with the acronym never noticing what he was doing by now it was too entrenched in ucsb life to be replaced ms rosenblatt wrote it down as he gave it to her and used the number pad on her keyboard to enter it into her computer he knew what shed see on the monitor his academic career in all its occasional splendor one of her sharply penciled eyebrows jumped a quarter of an inch well well she murmured the admiration might have been reluctant but it was real we dont see a transcript like yours every day my interests keep changing marshall said that was true and then again it wasnt his interest in staying right where he was had been remarkably constant ever since his sophomore year the proof of that was how far behind him his sophomore year lay now but here he was still an undergrad selma rosenblatt studied the transcript more closely she clicked her tongue between her teeth you know she remarked with the air of a literary critic approaching an interesting novel if youd taken introduction to geology two years ago they would have had to turn you loose shes on to me marshall thought how many losers sitting in front of his father had felt that same stab of panic hundreds maybe thousands marshall did his damnedest not to show it i wanted to he lied adding but i couldnt which was true that was the year the legislature and the governor didnt agree on a budget till november and everything went to uh the dogs sarcasm from his old manand an occasional whack on the behindhad taught him not to cuss in front of people of the female persuasion oh yes i remember ms rosenblatt assured him i didnt say you could have taken the course then i just said if you had then you switched majors of course and your breadth requirements changed you timed it well huh marshall aimed to play innocent as long as he could you timed it well she repeated with no rancor he could hear and what have you got in mind for today encouraged he answered well i was thinking of changing majors again to what again only curiosity in the advisors voicemarshall hoped creative writing he answered brightly well lets see how that would work well stack the requirements up against what youve already taken ms rosenblatt punched a few keys marshall didnt have her software but hed already gone through the same arcane calculations now he had to hope hed done them right she studied the monitor a slow smile spread across her face it didnt seem to want to take up residence there but there it was yes that may keep you enrolled a couple of quarters longer than sticking to film i gather youre not paying for your stay here uh no marshall admitted he was chuffedhed worked it out exactly the same way her program had we do try to get people on their way some students are more diligent in their efforts to stick around than others though ms rosenblatt said and it may be better for the states poor abused balance sheet to have you here paying in rather than out there collecting unemployment or welfare she studied marshall who knows maybe you will turn into a writer and maybe the horse will learn to sing herodotus marshall exclaimed he remembered the story read in translation if only he werent such a hopeless goof at languages very good i was a history major once upon a time tooand look where i ended up ms rosenblatt hit a few more keys the change is recorded now get out of here so i can take on someone who really needs advice what do i need then marshall asked you need your head examined but then thats one of the reasons you come to a university or youre missing something if its not selma rosenblatt pointed to the door scoot youll probably piss off your folks doing this but then youre probably doing it to piss them off marshall left another more than reasonably pretty girl was sitting there waiting for the advisor ucsb could spoil you that way but she also ignored his experimental smile as she went in to do whatever she was going to do every once in a while adults made you wonder if maybe they did know what they were up to after all marshalls dad could pull that off sometimes and ms rosenblatt had the same kind of mojo she saw right through him how many college kids had traipsed into her office to give her the knack of reading at a glance what made them tick she was damn good at it damn good but not quite perfect mom wouldnt care that he had a new major mom cared about mom and about teo and now and again about vanessa mom and vanessa were going through the same adventures at the same time which gave them a bond they hadnt had before sons mom remembered she had them and everything but all they did was remind her of dad the way things were there that was news as bad as it got even dad wouldnt be too bent out of shape after all the other changes marshall had made dad would just roll his eyes and wonder out loud if his kid thought his initials were atm marshall did think so but hed learned long before he got to ucsb that saying as much was one of the really bad ideas dad would also wonderpointedlyif marshall thought he could get a job with his new major in the unlikely event that he graduated marshall could hear the whole thing already inside his head he didnt even need to go home for it he hustled down the stairs and escaped air conditioning and fluorescent lights the sun smiled on him the sun smiled on all of santa barbara almost all the time it was may la was sweltering under a heat wave even san atanasio which caught a lot of sea breeze would be up in the eighties the valley riverside places like that marshall didnt want to think about them here he didnt have to it was seventythree maybe seventyfour it might climb to eighty on the hottest days of summer it might sink down to sixty on the coldest days of winter the campus had its own lagoon full of reeds and ducks and shorebirds how awesome was that guys and girls went by some wore shorts and tshirts some jeans and tshirts about one in three was talking into a cell phone or texting and trying not to bump into anybody bicycles wove in and out among the people on foot some of the riders were talking on cell phones too and yes some of them were texting even marshall didnt think that was exactly brilliant it wasnt that hed never done it but he didnt do it a whole lot a girl smiled at him he waved back theyd been in a class together last year year before he couldnt remember any more than he could remember her name she wasnt anyone special just someone vaguely nice he supposed she thought he was somebody vaguely nice too he was a creativewriting major now what kind of story could you make out of a couple of people each thinking the other was vaguely nice how would you even start or maybe that was the wrong question how would you end the story what would you be trying to say you had to say something about life the universe and everything didnt you otherwise why would you bother to write those all struck him as pretty good questions he didnt have answers for any of them how did you find answers for questions like those by writing would youor somebodysee what was wrong with what you did and how to fix it wouldnt you get awful tired of turning out crap sooner or later you were supposed to stop turning out crap werent you but how those struck him as good questions too the person he knew who came closest to being a writer was vanessa and cranking out reports and proposals and editing other peoples garbage didnt seem awful goddamn creative to him maybe ill learn he thought or maybe ill switch majors again even if ms rosenblatt does laugh at me vii berkeley colin ferguson always felt he needed a passport when he came up here the peoples republic of berkeley cops called it cops called santa monica the la beachside suburb the peoples republic too damn few cops had an idealistic view of human nature jerks and assholesthat was what their world boiled down to holy shit he said happily that was a parking space right around the corner from kellys apartment building parking spaces in berkeley were even harder to find than republicans he had to parallelpark to get into this one but he did it it wasnt even a twohour zone he could stay as long as he wanted he put on the club and got out there wasnt any secure entrance at her building people just went in and out most of the ones who did looked like college students that didnt automatically make them princes among mankind as colin had reason to know but kelly said shed never had her apartment broken into and her car only once plenty of folks in places with better security had worse luck a girlwell she was around vanessas age which made her a girl to colincoming down the stairs gave him a curious look as he climbed them she didnt say whats an old fart like you doing here her eyes did it for her but as long as kelly thought colin belonged he could suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous nearadolescents just fine he knocked on her door she did have a little spyeye so she could see who was there and she had a dead bolt it snicked back then she threw the door wide the smile on her face was bottled sunshine hey she said and threw her arms wide too they hugged with the door open then he went all the way in and she closed it behind him phone calls and emails and texts kept them up on what they were doing but not being able to get together all the time made the times when they could that much sweeter in between kisses they went through variations on how are ya how ya doin for some little while colin bragged about his parking fu kelly looked suitably impressed she knew how lucky you needed to be to cadge a space anywhere in the bay area kellys place looked quite a bit like brycesquite a bit like most grad students apartments colin suspected books and papers and printouts were scattered everywhere she wasnt compulsively neat about things the way he was that didnt mean she couldnt find whatever she needed though hed seen her pluck a journal out from under a blizzard of papers so she could check something in an article he had no idea how she knew it was there but she did she pulled anchor porters out of the refrigerator they clinked bottles whats the latest on the park he asked unless you had to fly crosscountry the volcano was old news by now it wasnt on cnn much any more even the latenight talkshow hosts left it out of their monologues still massively fucked kelly answeredshe was much easier swearing around himan he was around her i mean massively is the road down to jackson still closed oh you bet the whole pitchstone plateau is going back to being a lava field she said colin must have looked blank because she explained when you drive downdrove downfrom yellowstone lake to the parks south entrance you were driving across the pitchstone plateau its what happens to a lava field after it weathers for a hundred thousand years or so pines he said remembering lots and lots of lodgepole pines uhhuh kelly nodded they can grow on almost zero nutrients so they spring up first of course a gazillion acres of them burned back in and now theyre burning again i bet they are colin said even after all these years the charred lodgepole pines some still upright some fallen and more than half hidden by their upspringing descendants others lying out in the middle of what was now grassland remained a big part of what you sawhad seenat yellowstone whats the park service going to do when tourist season rolls around again cry kelly answered which startled a snort of laughter out of him she went on they ought to close it up completely but thatd cost em god knows how many hundred million dollars how much would getting tourists swallowed up in a big eruption cost em colin asked not altogether ironically governments and corporations did riskbenefit analyses all the time weighing whether lawsuits from a foulup were likely to cost more than not fixing what was wrong of course they couldnt fix it here but they could hope it didnt get any worse thats what theyre wondering all right kelly thought along with him from what i hear right now the plan is to let people in to see mammoth hot springs and the other stuff way at the north end of the park but to keep the rest of it offlimits maybe thats far enough away colin said you didnt think about yellowstones immensity till you were actually there it was bigger than some of the little states back east maybe but kelly didnt sound convinced youre worrying about the supervolcano you bet i am if it goes mammoth hot springs arent far enough away jackson isnt far enough away she took a long pull at her beer you werent supposed to drink porter like that which didnt stop her hell denver isnt far enough away colin grunted kelly looked at him in surprise then she nodded oh your daughters in denver i forgot yeah she is can you tell her to come back to socal i can tell her all kinds of things whether shell pay any attentionthats a different story what i say about vanessa is shes hard of listening she goes her own way no matter what most of the time colin would have thought that was a good thing rob did too and colin admired him for itreluctantly but he did here though what are the odds itll blow the odds nobody has any idea a lot of geologists hope the ranger lake eruption will take off some of the pressure down below you donelieve it colin had listened to too many people telling too many stories to have any doubts on that score kelly shook her head no i dont i wish i could but i dont remember how coffee pot springs started going nuts things there are crazier than ever more geyser eruptions there than at the upper geyser basin with old faithful and all the rest swarms of people would go to see em if the place werent miles from the nearest road picturing a park map in his head colin remarked thats a long way from ranger lake it sure is kelly said and left it right there maybe colin should have too but what kind of cop would he have made if he believed in letting well enough alone if theres a serious risk it will blow shouldnt they make some kind of plan theyd gone around that barn before kelly he realized too late would have spent a lot more time brooding and talking about it than he had it was it was her south bay strangler was what it was i used to think so i really did for a long time she said slowly and spread her hands now i just dont know any more its too damn big how do you make a plan that says we need to evacuate the whole midwestand thats just for starters you dont you cant the best you can do is hope it doesnt happen pray if you think praying helps it wont hurt like not being there when the hbomb goes off colin said well yeah she barely gave him the benefit of the doubt only this is so much bigger than an hbomb it aint even funny she meant it hed grown up at the tail end of the cold war imagining something that dwarfed mankinds finest warlike foolishness took mental muscles he wasnt used to exercising the biggest thing ever huh not ever kelly said seriouslyhe might have known better than to say something like that to a geologist a really big supervolcano will blow out maybe six hundred cubic miles of rock yeah youve said so before he nodded thats a lot of rock it sure is but years ago the siberian traps let loose a thousand times that much lavaenough to bury about ninety percent of the lower fortyeight and sixtyodd million years ago the deccan traps coughed up enough lava to bury alaska pretty much so the supervolcanos small potatoes next to those even if its plenty big enough to screw us to the wall sixtyodd million years ago colin echoed isnt that when the dinosaurs went under i thought an asteroid was the numberone suspect for doing them in an asteroid sure hit then whether that was what finished them or whether the deccan traps had more to do with it people are still writing papers and the siberian traps happened about the same time as the even bigger extinction between the permian and the triassic how about that colin said tonelessly in the scale of things she considered the south bay strangler wasnt worth noticing he couldnt think so big much as he wished he could eveneven the supervolcano was beyond his comprehension you have any other good news well the sun could go nova and fry the whole planet like a pork chop she sounded cheerful of all things and she told him why but it wont go supernova its not massive enough poor thing aww he said which got a laugh out of her you start thinking about stuff like that what can you do about it not one goddamn thing so why dont we get drunk and screw kelly said he wondered if she knew that was a country song from before she was born he doubted it like anything her taste in music didnt run that way but it struck him as a terrific idea even so justin nachman charged into the dressing room at neptunes resort waving a new yorker around as if he intended to swat a fly with it the dressing room was tiny and cramped and hot and several flies were buzzing around as far as rob ferguson could see everything in new york city was tiny and crampedexcept for the stuff that was enormous and mindblowingly magnificent every bit of it squalid and stupendous alike was insanely overpriced the cover of the new yorker as rob finally discovered when justin stopped brandishing the magazine was a photorealistic painting of an entrance to yellowstone park with a brandnew volcano with a fujiyamastyle perfect cone sending up smoke and fire in the background the sign at the entrance read closed next years a long line of cars and motor homes stretched away in disappointment seeing it reminded rob of his fathers girlfriend he shied away from that he wanted things back home to be the way they were supposed to which to him meant dad and mom together he understood that what he wanted wasnt about to happen hed understood that maybe even before dad did understanding it was a long way from liking it though what are you doing with that thing he asked justin before the bands front man could answer charlie storer added its last weeks anyhow the drummer actually read the new yorker sometimes justin rarely read anything but email and texts these days hed got over his biology degree bigtime now though he opened the magazine to the front section in smaller type were in night liferock and pop he burbled that got his bandmates attention as he must have known it would well whats it say they chorused or words to that effect biff thorvald might have been the loudest of them then again so might rob or charlie squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles bring a musical sensibility that mixes cowboy bebop with bebop deluxe from oxnard california to manhattan justin read oxnard biff exclaimed in disgust oxnard was a gritty grimy workingclass town closer to la than to santa barbara and had about as much in common with the latter as passaic new jersey did with the hamptons charlie made grossout noises too yeah i know it all looks the same from this side of the country justin said rob thought of an old surreal map hed seen the usa from new york citys viewpoint about half of it was this side of the hudson then there was upstate pennsylvania texas and california with a palm tree sticking up out of the pacific to show hawaii evidently that kind of attitude lived on i wasnt done yet justin said he took a deep breath and read some more under his brillo fright wig lead singer justin nachman effectively puts across the upandcoming bands quirky lyrics he patted his yiddishe afro me and dylan right in your dreams charlie said sweetly your wet dreams biff agreed of course rob razzed justin too no responsible band member could do anything else but at the same time he chewed on the new yorker s assessment could you mix anime and one of the stranger british outfits from the s if you could did squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles do it that wasnt altogether impossible he supposed but it struck him as more likely that the music writer was just getting cute justins thoughts went in a different direction they often did he started waving the magazine around again not the cover of the rolling stone but as close as were likely to get he said the others nodded rob would have loved to make the cover of the rolling stone that implied serious success serious sales with luck even serious money he knew it wasnt in the cards the music writer nailed the reason why too quirky could get you to upandcoming to serious success not likely does the notice talk about snakes and ladders too charlie asked that was an important question all right if the new yorker didnt mention the opening act theyd get pissy about it and who could blame them i think so lemme check justin opened the magazine once more hadnt he already looked if any of them was going to go all rock star he was the guy he was the one the new yorker d mentioned by name after all but nobodyd put his ego ahead of the band yet theyd been good about that better than a bunch of outfits that had fallen apart for the sake of somebodys usually aborted solo career justin read again with them is another california band snakes and ladders with a distinctive twang it was a mention yeah but not one that would thrill the other band their lead guitarist wanted to be robin trower or maybe hendrix a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for no a distinctive twang wouldnt make lenny turn handsprings put that thing somewhere rob said if they havent seen it dont show it to them dont talk about it either by all the signs justin wanted to blow up the little notice till it was about the size of the tablets the lord had given moses on mt sinai he wanted to carry it around with him the way moses had carried the tablets down the mountain too no nothing wrong with his ego not a bit but he wasnt to the point where he needed another chair for it he might nod reluctantly but nod he did and he opened the case of a guitar he wasnt planning on using tonight and stashed the new yorker inside the way snakes and ladders played showed that they or at least lenny had seen the notice he tried to coax licks from his guitar that should have been illegal or more likely impossible and sometimes he did and sometimes he sounded like a man trying to strangle a cat that didnt feel like getting strangled it must have been an exhausting set to play it sure as hell was an exhausting set to listen to for squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles and for the crowd that packed neptunes resort the applause that followed it seemed more like relief than anything else a voice spoke from the heavens now welcome squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles if god had been a classicrock fm dj he would have sounded a lot like that more relieved applause cme as the band walked out on stage some of the relief rob judged was that they werent snakes and ladders you didnt always know what you would get with sf and the ets but brooding angst wasnt a big part of the mix rob waved as he took his place behind justin he looked out over the crowd before the lights went down scouting for cute ones who didnt do that cute ones were a main reason for joining a band to begin with and new york city offered a variety he hadnt seen since the last time they played in socal justin waved too good to be here he said sounding calm and saneto anyone who knew him an illusion but a soothing one at the moment i always wanted to play carnegie hall he got a laugh the club was packed with people in jeans and tshirts not the fancydress crowd rob imagined at carnegie hall they sat on metal folding chairs carnegie hall would have had better softer wider seats something in the air said a good part of the crowd hadnt showered any time lately once upon a time tobacco fumesamong otherswould have added to the fug nowadays new york citys public antismoking rules were as ferocious as anybodys which of course didnt stop the band from taking a few tokes before going on being an engineering major rob had lately designed an experiment to see if he played better stoned hed listened to recordings of himself both wasted and straight there didnt seem to be much difference one way or the other he still liked getting loaded though so he did other guys whod played new york had warned that fans there were different from fans in indiana or idaho if they like you man they really like you somebodyd said in wonder they know your shit better than you do after two songs three people in different parts of the room shouted for brainfreeze at the same time squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles hadnt played brainfreeze in at least two years rob had written the song and even he didnt like it any more it appeared on no album as far as he could recall it had never been recorded how did these dudesno one was a galeven know it existed justin shook his head his poufy perm wobbled we arent taking requests yet he said firmly other guys whod played new york also said fans there didnt want to listen to shit like that they soon proved right the crowd yelled requests between songs and even during songs which got old real fast but the band had marshall stacks and the audience didnt the guys on the stage could play over the crowd the converse wasnt true a murmur to the sound man let them do just that and the crowd didnt seem to mind new york bands had attitude maybe they expected their fans to show attitude too they damn near brought down the low ceiling when they whooped and hollered after the set and again after the encore then the band set to huckstering cds and posters sold briskly i already downloaded the music one girl told rob as she bought a disk but i cant download your autographs darn right he agreed scribbling his on the cover insert with a sharpie she paid cash too he approved of that so did all his bandmates they split the greenbacks into four equal piles after every gig what uncle revenue didnt find out about wouldnt hurt him one bit over on the other side of the anteroom snakes and ladders were shilling too they were trying anyhow but next to nobody wver to them lennyd put the fear of god in people all right that was fine for a fireandbrimstone preacher not so good for a rock n roller the other guys in his band seemed to be trying to talk some sense into him he tossed his head his mane flew he didnt want to hear it the more they talked the angrier he got he finally lost it will you assholes just shut the fuck up he screamed loud enough to make everybody stare at him hideously uncomfortable silence slammed down well justin said after a moment isnt showbiz fun enough people chuckledsome nervously but even soto let squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles if not snakes and ladders get back to the serious business of separating customers from their money were supposed to go to connecticut with them and massachusetts and on up into maine rob whispered to charlie storer what do we do if they break up it happened all the time which didnt mean it didnt screw things up when it did divorces were usually expensive and inconvenient rob thought of his folks again what do we do the drummer considered but not for long we damn well do without thats what rob grunted charlie was much too likely to be right maybe they could hook up with some local band that wanted to swing through new england that might work if they could find a band that felt like touring if the two outfits didnt clash like plaid and paisley if if if then rob stopped worrying about it the young woman who set down a cd cover insert to be signed was so pretty she shouldve been against the law no hulking boyfriend loomed behind her as happened much too often when rob found out her name was jane he instantly wanted to be tarzan he wasnt dumb enough to tell her that instead sounding as california cool as he could he said why dont you hang around if youre not doing anything else later on about half the time a girl would say she couldnt possibly because her hamster had the heartbreak of psoriasis the other half jane gave back a megawatt smile you mean it she breathed for sure for sure rob said solemnly cross my heart and hope to dying wasnt what he had in mind right then the little death maybeno definitelybut not mr big cmon around to this side of the table well find you a chair or something or what the hell you can just sit on my lap it wasnt quite you can just sit on my face but it also wasnt a line most guys could try on a girl whose last name they didnt know yet damned if jane didnt though she started running her fingers through his hair which distracted the hell out of him when he tried to sign the next autograph yeah he thought setting a hand on her leg while kind of pretending to steady her oh fuck yeah this is why i do this stuff what better reason was there louise ferguson took her sorry office skills to a sorrier job at one of the sorriest offices shed ever seen it was the american headquarters for a company that imported japanese ramen into the states when shed first married colin braxton bragg boulevard had been one of san atanasios main drags these days steelbarred fencing topped by coils of razor wire surrounded the ramen importers parking lot fencing like that could have kept out the taliban the importer needed a fulltime security guard along with it even so as soon as louise walked into the building a woman hissed at her in a harsh farmbelt accent you didnt leave anything out there you care about didja she shook her head nope she usually thought of her years being a cops wife as a total waste but theyd left their mark on her all right often in ways she didnt even notice she wasnt much surprised when the inside of the office proved as big a wild west show as the parking lot her boss was a mr nobashi he was about as inscrutable as a fireworks display he spent most of the time talking to the home office in hiroshima in impassioned japanese interspersed with things like ohh jeesus kerrist and goddamma son of a bicha when he wasnt swearing he spoke tolerable if schematic english he showed louise the spreadsheets she was supposed to ride herd on her heart sank when she saw them they were enormous and complicated and excel had always disagreed with her every chance it got she had the feeling it would get plenty here well ill try she said doubtfully if mr nobashi didnt get his hopes up real far to begin with he wouldnt be too disappointed later on she could hope not anyhow you no try you do he declared she nodded what else could she do you do was what she was here for if she couldnt do what was the worst thing that would happen hed fire her and shed have to try to land another job somewhere else somewhere better than this maybe but the odds were against it this seemed to be the kind of place where jobs lived these days the first thing she did after sitting down at the computer was copy her spreadsheets if she screwed up the copies shed have undamaged originals to fall back on how much good that would do her she preferred not to dwell on not right this minute thank you very much here the woman whod asked her if shed left anything in the car plopped a pile of printouts down in front of her youre supposed to plug these shipping invoices into the inventory system oh louise said a word full of gloom if ever there was one want me to walk you through it the first time the woman asked she added im patty if you dont learn it from me nobashi san sure as hell wont be able to explain it to you thanks would you please now louise knew she sounded pathetically eager but she didnt care maybe there was a cork ring on this ocean of trouble after all here what you gotta do is quickly and deftly patty did it when she noticed she was working on copieslouise hadnt even renamed them yetshe let out a wry chuckle you aint so dumb are ya sweetie if im not what am i doing here louise asked in return this time patty laughed out loud you see how i set up the inventory transfer she asked when louise shook her head patty did it again slower this time okay she said rising from the chair now you try it with no enormous hope louise did damned if it didnt work louise clapped her hands together in amazed delight she just missed cheering out loud see it aint so tough patty said now email the spreadsheet to the boss and go on to the next one before louise could the phone rang answering it was part of the job when she did somebody started gabbing at her in excited japanese one moment please she answered in english and pressed the hold button then she fumbled her way through transferring the call to mr nobashi patty also helped her there youre a lifesaver louise exclaimed remembering her thought of a few minutes before why didnt you get this slot cause i didnt want it patty answered calmly id sooner just crunch numbers most of the time nobashi pretty much leaves me alone on account of he knows goddamn well im good at what i do but youyoure gonna have to deal with him you poor thing you does he try to get his girls to go to bed with him is he one of those louise asked ill knock his block off if he does nah patty shook her head he knows bettern that guy he took over for two three years ago thought he could get away with that crap like he wouldve in japan the gal he hit on didnt slug him she sued the company insteadwon a pile of dough too so nobashi keeps his hands to himself whats so bad about him then mr nobashi chose that minute to yell coffee from his inner sanctum coffee and sweet rolls louise rapidly discovered that he ran on coffee and sweet rolls tea rice sashimi ramen even when sugar and caffeine werent enough to rock his world he sent her down the street to pick up big boxes of drumsticks and thighs at popeyes chicken amp biscuits so grease was definitely one of his basic food groups too he also guzzled bottled water by the case he didnt go to the refrigerator to grab a bottle himself god forbid that would have been beneath a boss dignity he yelled for louise to fetch and carry instead no matter what else she was doing bringing his supplies was more important by midafternoon that first day louise understood exactly why patty wanted nothing to do with the position she now occupied herself mr nobashi might not be a lech at least on company time a pain in the ass he definitely was but the ramen company paid pretty well the woman that other exec from japan had sexually harassed hadnt taken them for every nickel they owned besides as long as there were college students no ramen outfit would ever go broke marshall sometimes seemed to live on the stuff so had rob in his college days vanessa from what louise remembered ramen was beneath vanessas dignity as soon as it got to be half past five patty said i am so outa here if youve got sense youll bail too otherwise theyll think you want to make like a salaryman and theyll keep you here sometimes i think mr nobashi lives in that crappy little office of his bail louise did a different rentacop was guarding the parking lot a burly hispanic guy who might have been an exmarine he tipped his smokey bear hat to her as she slid into her car teo was home before her better yet hed brought back thai takeout so she wouldnt have to mess with ground round or chicken youre so sweet she said colin would never have done anything like that he expected to be fed just like mr nobashi louise thought a little surprised at herself hey its your first day er younger lover said opening packages the smells of spices and coconut filled the condo how did it go its not exciting but i coped one of the gals there is showing me the ropes so that helps the japanese guy in charge is a real piece of work louise was checking out the plastic and styrofoam package oh you got that squid salad i like i thought that was the one teo made a point of keeping in mind what she liked and what she didnt even though theyd been together for almost three years now louise still wasnt used to that what had she ever been to colin but a convenience he was still hanging out with that geographer or geologist or whatever she was that vaguely irked louise who hadnt expected him to make anything last after all if she couldnt put up with him anymore what halfwaysane woman would be able to well from what shed heard her exs squeeze was a lot younger odds were she didnt have standards of comparison louise did she knew just how lucky she was teod barely had to lift a finger to sweep her off her feet how was your day she asked him as she spooned food onto a paper plate if she wasnt going to worry about cooking tonight she wasnt going to worry about doing dishes either no sweat he answered it made her laugh the way it always did for teo sweatingand making other people sweatwas making a living it was also what made him look so good colin was like a brick with soft corners shed forgotten what a man ought to be like till she signed up for the aerobics class she knew now by god and shed never forget again how many girls want your special program she teased she knew she hadnt been the first one hed attracted she just hopedand kept hopingto stay interested enough to keep ahead of the competition he grinned at her he knew what she was thinking sometimes he sassed her about it always gently thougha younger man didnt want to set an older woman worrying a younger man with a heart didnt anyhow nobody youve got to worry about believe me he said now and louise did believe him she brought the paper plate over to the table and sat down beside him no police scanner farted out calls the tv wasnt on tuned to the news nothing but the two of them and dinner who needed more sitting by teo she had no trouble forgetting mr nobashi either or her anxieties about excel and if that wasnt magic what would be viii colin ferguson tried to carry around in his head a map of everything the san atanasio police department was doing at any given moment the city grid was easy enough he knew the routes the patrol cars took and when each car would be where he also knew where the detectives were working and about the meth buy the drug squad was trying to arrange before long though something always screwed up his perfect picture thered be a big accident or a knifing outside a strip club on hesperus or a shooting in one of the cuban bars at the north end of san atanasio boulevard like splashes in a calm pool the ripples from something like that would distort the picture for a while he didnt need to do any of that hed been passed over for chief the one slot where such an encyclopedic grasp of what was going on really mattred he wasnt a hundred percent sure of making captain even hed annoyed enough people that simply passing the exam might not do the trick he carried around the mental map anyway hed started making one back in the days when he still rode a patrol car himself he could no more stop now than he could stop breathing the telephone rang ferguson he said into the mouthpiece stu ayers down in palos verdes said the voice on the other end of the line ayers was also a lieutenant and a pretty good guy like colin he was chasing the south bay strangler what can i do to you today stu colin asked to me huh ayers plainly didnt miss many tricks chuckling he went on could you shoot me the lab reports from your latest strangler case will do whats your email instead of giving one connected to the city of palos verdes ayers offered colin a gmail com account half apologetically he explained my captain thinks im spending too much time on this lets keep it private huh sure colin said after he hung up though he thoughtfully rubbed his chin he called up the fat folder of documents but didnt email it right away he looked up the palos verdes police departments phone number called it and asked to be connected to lieutenant ayers whos calling please whoever the gal handling the pvpds calls was she owned one hell of a sexy voice this is lieutenant ferguson from san atanasio please hold lieutenant ill put your call through the music palos verdes played while you were on hold was different from what san atanasio used but no more interesting fortunately colin didnt have to listen to it for long stu ayers here whats cooking colin did you just call me a minute ago and ask for the electronic file on the latest south bay strangler killing not guilty ayers responded answered at once no it wasnt the same voice as before not too different but definitely not the same the authentic lieutenant ayers went on somebody just did huh yup dunno if hes a snoopy ordinary civilian or a reporter or what but he wanted that file you didnt give it to him nope im not always as dumb as i lookonly sometimes colin said ayers laughed colin went on my bets on a reporter he knew to use your name and everything so he could have taken some wildass guesses for the times or the breeze or whoevers paying him like those cocksuckers dont do enough of that anyway ayers said tell me about it well thanks im glad i thought to stop and check colin exchanged goodbyes with his opposite number then got off the phone he eyed the folder front and center on his monitor the one hed almost emailed a nasty smile crossed his face he created another folder with an almost identical name he filled that one with subfolders and subsubfolders and on down for several levels all of them bore titles that had to do with the case all of them led nowhereexcept to other interestingly named folders nested within well all but one if mr snoop out there was persistent enough he would eventually find a deeply buried folder called evaluation of case that one did have a document in it one with colins threeword assessment of the situation nice try asshole he typed he sent the spurious folder to the no doubt equally spurious gmail com address that done he deleted the folder from his own hard drive and leaned back in his chair till it creaked he felt hed accomplished more than he did on some days when he cracked a case the sob on the other end whoever he was would have to open all those folders one by one with all that horseshit around he was bound to find a pony in there somewhere wasnt he now that you mentioned it no for the rest of the afternoon colin was actually interested every time his phone rang would it be the fellow hed thwarted calling to tell him where to head in or would the soandso come up with some new scheme to seduce information out of him no and no respectively but anticipation did keep colin in the game he knocked off at five on the dot that didnt happen every dayor every week either he put on his jacket and drove home the la basin was sweltering through a latesummer heat wave weathermen bleated that it might hit in the valley newsmen said the brushfire danger was extreme all of which meant jack diddly in the south bay which reliably got the sea breeze it had topped out in the mideighties at san atanasio city hall across the street from the cop shop by now it was at least ten degrees cooler than that whatever fires the santa anas blew up wouldnt come within miles as usual the first thing colin did when he got home was pull the mail out of the mailbox a pile of cataloguesretailers could smell christmas from months awaya cable bill a bill from the pool guy a statement from his lawyer and a postcard from rob it showed a big apple with a goodsized worm iridescent green sticking out his head and neck the worm wore a toothy grin and a yankees cap colin snorted that was his older sons style all right glued to the back of the card was the little new yorker notice about squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles local appearance the commentary below was in robs spiky script still not famous but we may make it in spite of ourselves love from your kid that anyone could want to be famous still mystified colin as tv had trained him to do he associated the word with divorces and court appearances and rehab and jail time he knew more than he wanted about all of those except rehab and that was the one famous people blew off anyway he went inside he had a little steak waiting in the fridge hed broil that while he nuked a package of frozen mixed veggies as usual not exciting cooking but functional a hell of a lot better for him than the fatandsodium bombs that masqueraded as frozen dinners hed eat the rest of the vegetables tomorrow with whatever meat he defrosted then he thought about a beer not without regret he shook his head it wasnt that he never drank alone but he didnt do it very often a drink had a way of turning into a few drinks a few drinks had a way of turning into a drunk hed done too many drunks for a while right after louise left he remembered waking up hungover in that motel in jackson goddamn wyoming hed met kelly that day if hed scored with the waitress the night before he didnt think hed be as happy as he was now the way thingshad worked out he counted himself pretty lucky if kellyd been here now he would have had a beer with her but she was off in yellowstone keeping track of the new volcano colin dusted the steak with ground pepper and garlic powder and put it in the broiler the microwave buzzed as the vegetables spun round and round inside in lieu of that beer he poured himself water from a pitcher with a brita filter in the refrigerator he turned on cnn to keep him company while he cooked indonesian pirates were saying theyd kill the crew of a russian freighter if they didnt get a ransom big enough to suit them colin was sorry for the scaredlooking sailors whose images went up one by one france or germany might have come through with the cash the russians mostly didnt make payoffs like that a congresswoman had been caught with her hand in the federal cookie jar she was loudly denying shed done anything wrong and claimed it was a sexist plot because the investigating committee happened to be all male yeah right colin said in a way it was reassuring to see that corruption crossed gender lines too a radio commentator was in hot water for making slurs about glbt people colin was a cop so of course hed never heardor tolda fag joke in all his born days of course commercials came next he hit the mute button the doughfaced brunette shilling for an insurance company was annoying even when he couldnt hear her but she wasnt as annoying but why did ad men seem convinced the american public had a collective iq of maybe with a tail wind colin grunted as soon as the question formed itself like any other cop hed seen enough aggressive stupidity in his time to understand exactly why admen thought that way the news finally returned the young woman reading it was another beauty contest runnerup or maybe winner that she was dropdead gorgeous had nothing to do with her getting the job of course again of course mother nature is showing off her power again she said take a look at this video from an alreadybeleaguered yellowstone national park she must have been a college graduate she didnt make a hash of beleaguered when it came up on the teleprompter he waited for her to explain how the eruption by ranger lake was screwing up air traffic over the rockies this time more to the point he waited for her to explain how the eruption was impacting or even being impactful of air traffic to his way of thinking the only way the eruption could impact air traffic was by pitching a volcanic rock through an airbus windshield but reporters loved the bullshit jargon even more than cops did which was saying something she threw him a curve though and not one of hers as he took the steak out of the oven she continued another new volcano has started blowing its stack in yellowstone this one is a good many miles away from the ranger lake eruption its located not far northeast of a set of geysers called coffee pot springs oh shit colin said softly the video was taken from a helicopter it showed the kinds of things hed seen before black smoke and ash and dust rising high into the sky while lava set lodgepole pines afire on the ground after fifteen or twenty seconds a map replaced the view of the new eruption most people even people who regularly went to yellowstone didnt have the faintest idea where the hell coffee pot springs were so the map came in handy guidebooks didnt talk about them because they were sofar from the roads through the park and you had to hike across bear country to get to them colin anything but a yellowstone regular would never even have heard of them if not for kelly but he had oh myhad he ever the pretty newsie reappeared on the screen she said coffee pot springs recently showed a dramatic increase in activity hot springs turned into frothing geysers and blew boiling water more than a hundred feet in the air a geologist cnn talked to this afternoon said this was probably related to the new volcanic outbreak colin was pouring a sauce on his steak he proceeded to pour it all over the place mat too because there was kelly on tv again a mike shoved in her face she looked windblown and worried yes magmamelted rockin the coffee pot springs dome is moving up toward the surface she said as if she were taing a geology section it heated the underground water in the springs and now its starting to break through here the way it did earlier near ranger lake would the reporter ask her about the supervolcano how much panic could she sow if he did he didnt the picture cut back to the newscaster a porn star claims shes having a billionaires baby the woman said brightly well be back with the details after these messages colin hit the mute button on the remote again if that wasnt one of the great inventions from the tail end of the last century he didnt know what would be he patted up the spilled a with a paper towel after a couple of bites of steak and a forkful of the mixed veggies he discovered his appetite had disappeared he pulled out his cell phone he didnt get kelly he got her voice mail he said shit again but he wasnt amazed shed be really really busy and yellowstone had some of the crappiest cellphone reception of well anywhere at the beep he said this is what you were worrying about isnt it sounds like its time to get out while the gettings good be careful be as careful as you can anyhow love you bye for good measure he sent her a text too get out now love me it lacked the voice mails flavor but it sure as hell got the message across shed check texts before she listened to her voice mail because she could do it faster which didnt say word one about whether shed pay any attention to him she would if she felt like it otherwise shed ignore him he didnt need to be sherlock holmes to figure that out he wished he werent upwards of eight hundred miles away from her she might take him more seriously facetoface then again she might not he couldnt go all caveman on her bop her over the head with a club and drag her away from danger by the hair again though he wished like hell he could by the time he unmuted the tv the commercials were gone so was the story about the bimbo and the billionaire even in this highflying information age colin couldnt be too sorry about staying ignorant there the markets had dropped sharply the man explaining why had to be in his late fifties maybe even past sixty he had wrinkles he was losing his hair and what he had left was gray hed never make anyone mistake him for a movie star but here he was on tv anyway from this colin concluded that he might even know what he was talking about without a teleprompter for backup he kept hoping kelly would call him back she didnt another earthquake shook yellowstone kelly had lost track of how many shed felt he past couple of days some of them were barely therejust enough to startle you and disappear some were mean mothers getting up toward on the richter scale a quake that size would do considerable damage in a builtup area even one with strong building codes like san francisco or la what was it going to knock down here trees so what oh the yellowstone inn and the other fancy places in and around the park would never be the same but that was the least of kellys worries right this minute if the supervolcano went kablooie right this minute the united states would never be the same for crying out loud if the supervolcano went kablooie right this minute she would turn into a tiny part of that kablooie too because she was at the west thumb of yellowstone lake smack in the middle of what would be the new caldera a redhot zit on the face of the earth big enough to see from the moon that one was about a as usual larry skrtel seemed inhumanly calm feels about right kelly agreed the more often they come the more rattled i get she didnt see how you could avoid that human beings hadnt evolved to stay calm during earthquakes staying calm wouldnt help keep you alive while things were falling on you panicking might she sure felt like panicking now too many earthquakes took it out of anybody the same way too many body shots made any boxer fold up maybe larry wasnt anybody maybe he didnt have that earthquake panic gene he pulled out his phone checked to see if he had barsa better bet here than most places in yellowstone but no sure thingand must have found he did because he started dialing i hope thats somebody who can get us out of here kelly said she had colins messages along with a slew of others that said the same thing in different words they left her more annoyed than anything else didnt people think she could see it was sayonara time all by herself maybe not maybe shed given them reason not to she didnt feel like worrying about that so she didnt i hope so too the usgs geologist answered i he broke off and started talking into the phone heinrich larry listen mein freund things are getting a little more interesting than i really like right now im at the west thumb geyser basin and all the pools are going batshit like you wouldnt believe batshit its a technical term fliedermausscheisse okay fliedermausscheisse kelly silently mouthed the word and as silently clapped her hands with a dictionary and patience she could read scientific german thanks to fragments of yiddish from her folks she could make a betternot good but betterstab at speaking it than most of her anglophone peers but she knew she never would have come up with that particular terminus technicus in a million months of sundays not that it didnt fit it did like a skintight glove the pools around here had just sat and steamed for as long as anyone could remember they werent sitting and steaming any more at the moment four of them were flinging water into the air like super bowl champs spraying one another with champagne one was the fishing cone out past the edge of yellowstone lake the air unfortunately smelled of flatulence not of bubbly daniel olson was on his phone too talking with somebody from montana state he didnt look very happy no scratch thathe looked about as unhappy as any one man could whatever hed been counting on the person on the other end of the line couldnt or wouldnt deliver that was bad news standing where kelly stood there was no good news to see off to the southwest the ranger lake volcano was still doing its thing prevailing winds blew most of the ash across wyoming and down into colorado and even kansas not up this way but the relevant word was most she and her geologist comrades wore surgical masks gray grit coated the pines your feet crunched in it when you walked across the parking lot here and up to the northeast the new coffee pot springs eruption was also going great guns sending another huge plume of volcanic ash high into the sky most of that was blowing away from yellowstone lake too but it blotted out another big chunk of darkening blue anybody would guess that those two eruptions marked opposite edges of what was liable to turn into a caldera any time now and anybody could see that the passel of geologists were in the middle of the frying pan waiting to drop into the fire snatches of songs and poetry ran through kellys head it was much too liable to be the end of the world as she knew itthe rem tune had been all over the radio when she was much youngerbut she was anything but convinced that she felt fine and if this was the way the world ended it wouldnt be with a whimper this would be a bang to top all bangs ts eliot you missed that one the earth shook one more time next thing kelly knew she wasnt standing in the middle of the potholed ashgritty parking lot any more she was sitting on her ass the involuntary yelp that came through her mask said shed landed hard too ruth marquez also screeched as she went down kelly wondered how long her left cheek would be black and blue rending crashes from in amongst the trees said not all of them were standing any more either somehow daniel had managed to keep his feet hello he shouted into his phone hello he put it away shit some of the relay towers must be out if that wasnt a kelly left it there a was very bad news for a couple of horrifying seconds though shed feared a massive earthquake was the least of her worries did the richter scale even begin to measure the magnitude of the quake thered be if a statesized chunk of crust collapsed goes to eleven man in spite of herself kelly giggled as she got to her feet if she could think of this is spinal tap now she had to be well and truly deranged well of course you are you idiot she thought slapping ash and random dirt off herself as best she could if you werent what would you be doing here aftershocks kept trying to knock her off her feet she hoped like hell they were aftershocks anyhow if that big quake had been a foreshock the one it was warning of would send her half a mile straight down larry still had cellphone reception he could do a commercial for whichever wireless company he used listen heinrich that last one made all the others feel like love pats we dont have a lot of time to waste yes i know its getting dark weve got flashlights well set fires in trash cans to mark the parking lot yes i know thats against regulations well do it anyway he rolled his eyes and lowered the phone for a oneword editorial germans then he was talking into it again come on get moving my will says you cant have my desk if you let me cook instead of pulling me out yes heinrich of course im joking you hope he lowered the phone again any luck daniel asked some the usgs geologist answered some time tonight or tomorrow morning two helicopters will come and take us away from all this if they can land if heinrich really can pull the right strings if if if if this stretch of terrain is still in working order by the time they get here kelly put in yeah that too larry whistled tunelessly between his teeth anything that can happen can happen to you thats what they say i wish to hell they didnt know what they were talking about fires in trash cans you said kelly looked around there were plenty the people who ran yellowstone didnt like litter unlike volcanic eruptions they could actually do something about that lets start filling em up with dry branches and stuff drop zones ruth said its like something out of a world war ii movie no choppers in world war ii larry observed ruth sniffed okay fine a vietnam movie kelly and daniel said the same thing at the same time apocalypse now kelly cocked her head to one side listening for the strains of the ride of the valkyries she was half disappointed when she didnt hear wagners fierce churning music i love the smell of hydrogen sulfide in the morning daniel intoned smells like tenure hydrogen sulfide does smell a lot like tenure sometimes kelly said the others laughed so she must have got the tone right a good thing too was she jealous of daniel oh just a little wonder what happened to that cnn crew that interviewed you earlier in the day larry said theyll have helicopters kelly said like most academics she was positive corporations had more in the way of money and everything money could buy than they knew what to do with that only proved shed never worked for one sure they will ruth agreedshe was an academic too but will they have the sense to use them like most academics she was convinced people who worked for corporations were none too bright in spite of all that money like kelly shed never examined the paradox and exactly how bright did that make academics pine branches and old refuse made lovely fires if another earthquake knocked over the metal trash cans well they were on asphalt if a grass fire started all the same kelly told herself she just wasnt going to worry about it a grass fire was the least of what yellowstone had to worry about trail mix and beef jerky made an uninspiring supper they beat going hungry though kelly kept listening for thuttering rotors she kept not hearing them what if heinrich hadnt pulled the right strings then were screwed thats what she wondered how big a traffic jam there was now heading north from mammoth hot springs into montana park authorities hadnt been too smart leaving the northern attraction open theyd been greedy was what theyd been shed thought so at the time had anyone listened to her when she said so as if nobody listened to her fucking nobody she stopped right there colin did sometimes he listened so hard it got scary he might have been listening to an errogation nobodyd ever paid attention to her like that before him had she been ten years younger and less jaded and abraded by the world she would have been sure he listened to her with a lovers ears and being sure of that chances were she would have got burned again as things were she knew he listened to her like a cop so what he listened aftershocks kept right on coming some of them seemed almost as big as that or whatever the hell it was both as a geologist and as a californian kelly knew things worked that way knowing didnt stop each new quake in turn from almost scaring the crap out of her the crashes and thuds as more trees went down didnt help either something very large and just barely visible ran past them it ignored themit was heading for the trees on the far side of the lot no doubt hoping they wouldnt fall over like the ones it was escaping from was that a grizzly ruth asked in a very small voice that was a grizzly even larry sounded less cool and collected than usual if it had been a pissedoff grizzly instead of a terrified one bison might kill more people in yellowstone than bears did but one reason that happened was that people had an unfortunate tendency to treat them like cows not really dangerous critters a lot of years of natural selection warned that bears would chow down on people if they got half a chance larrys cell phone went off his ring tone was classical but beethoven not wagner the opening bars of the fifth that would get your attention if anything would hey heinrich whats up he said after listening for a while he sighed and went on fuck are you sure another pause shorter this time evidently heinrich was sure because larry sighed again well if thats the best you can do its the best you can do if were still here in the morning im sure well thank you for it auf wiedersehen i hope he killed the phone to give himself whatever small charge he got from the last word well kelly ruth and daniel made like a greek chorus or given the reputation scientists had these days a geek chorus no helicopter till morning larry said glumly sorry but thats the way it goes or doesnt go heinrichs a good guy but he cant get the government to get anybody airborne before then copter pilots dont like night flying to begin with when you factor in two erupting volcanoes its hard to blame anybody you know put that way he had a point the logical rational part of kellys mind saw as much the big aftershock that rocked the parking lot just then made paying attention to that logical rational part a skosh harder than it would have been in the geology department conference room back in berkeley what do we do if if the bottom falls out before sunup ruth asked her logical rational part was feeling the strain too larrys still functioned kelly supposed she should admire him for that but then again what was that parody of kiplings if if you can keep your head when all around you are losing theirs chances are you dont understand what the fuck is going on something like that anyhow larry proved he did though because he answered remember all those liability waivers we had to sign before theyd let us back into the park to study the ranger lake eruption well every one of the little bastards is still in force kelly remembered that pile of paperwork much too well what it boiled dowto was shed admitted to the us government and the parks and wildlife service that she was out of her everloving mind for coming back into yellowstone and agreed that anything that happened to her was her own goddamn fault not the feds at the time it had just seemed like more forms to sign off on that was then this was now now was a lot scarier bleakly she said after all that paperwork im surprised the government will try to get us out of here at all as a matter of fact so am i larry answered which did nothing to set her mind at ease he went on god only knows how many markers heinrich had to call in to get as much as he got i owe him bigtime now i hope i last long enough to have a chance to pay some of it back something out in the darkness went boom splash a new noise it was large but not very close the ground shook yet again if that wasnt a hydrothermal explosion ive never heard one daniel said have you ever heard a hydrothermal explosion kelly asked well no he admitted good she said neither have itill now i mean somewhere out there steam bursting through to the surface had just created a new pond near yellowstone lake or maybe taken a new bite out of the lakes shoreline with a shaky laugh she added well have a fresh tourist attraction if this turns out not to be the supervolcano after all we always wanted to study one ruth said sure from a safe distance kelly pointed up at the moon which the plume from the ranger lake eruption dimmed but didnt hide right now i think that would be a pretty safe distance nobodys messed around with the geology there for the past couple of billion years do you think its going to blow daniel asked she shrugged a mosquito buzzed near her left ear they werent so bad as they had been earlier in the summer but they hadnt disappeared the supervolcano meant nothing to them probably even the earthquakes didnt scare them except perhaps for squashing one with a toppling pine what could an earthquake do to a mosquito i still dont think anybody know for sure she said slowly were like preachers studying revelations trying to figure out if these finally are the last days if it goes now these are the last daysfor us anyway larry said kelly was oldfashioned enough to wear a watch in spite of carrying a phone she brought her left wrist up close to her face to read the glowing hands it wasnt even ten oclock yet what do we do for the rest of the night she asked assuming weve got the rest of the night to do it in ruth said if we dont theres no point to worrying about it so we may as well pretend we do as usual larry made good sense he continued we can try to sleep good luck daniel broke in we can try the older man said or we can stay up and talk not a whole lot of other stuff going on an aftershock contradicted him unfazed he corrected himself not a whole lot of other stuff going on that we can do anything about kelly had sometimes slept through small aftershocks in california ifsiz were tired a say might not wake you up even if it was centered close by sleep through quakes that started at and went up from there sleep through quakes that felt as if they started six inches under your shoes in the immortal words of any new york cabby of the past hundred years fuhgeddaboutit she learned more about her comrades that nightand they about herthan she had in all the time since shed met them how much shed remember when the sun came up if she was still here when it did was a different question telling when the sun came up was also a different question volcanic ash from the eruption northeast of coffee pot springs darkened the eastern horizon little by little the sky above that mass of tiny rock particles lightened somewhere beyond the ash plumes the sun still shone kelly thought of that reminder in the lord of the rings where tolkien talked about saurons smokes and fumes unlike saurons smoke screen this wasnt evil it just was she was gnawing on more beef jerky when in lieu of tolkiens eagles two helicopters came down out of the sky and landed on the beatup parking lot they were louder than a metallica concert the wind from their rotors tried to blow the geologists away the pilots both wore orange suits that made them look like animated carrots they gestured frantically along with larry kelly got into one copter ruth and daniel hopped into the other the cabins didnt cut the noise at all kelly was still fumbling with her uncomfortable seats safety harness when the copter took off again they flew due north which struck her as a good idea if the supervolcano erupted the plume would blow south and west and try to put some mountains between us and the eruption larry bawled over and over till the pilot got it they may shield us from the worst of the blast the pilot swore but he did it ix the helicopters flew like jinking halfbacks using the peaks of the rockies for blockers but they were running from not towards and what they were running from would flatten them more mercilessly than any middle linebacker ever hatched kelly found a whole new reason to be glad she liked football the comparison never would have occurred to her otherwise by the time they were zooming down the canyon between prospect peak and the slightly lower folsom peak to the west she and larry both wore helmets like the pilots they cut the din in the cabin a little and let the geologists talk by shouting instead of by screaming most of what kelly and larry had to say amounted to variations on the theme of go like hell dont get your knickers in a twist the pilot said when they banged on that drum once too often im going flat out now and theres no guarantee the sumbitchll go off while were airborne theres no guarantee the sumbitchll go off at all right every word he said was gospel truth but he hadnt spent the night on the ground in that potholed parking lot he hadnt felt the earth shudder under him only god knew how often he also hadnt been studying the yellowstone hot spot for his whole career maybe it wouldnt blow now maybe it wouldnt blow at all maybe the two eruptions would do whatever they did and then subside leaving yellowstone changed and damaged but still a place someone in his right mindsomeone not a geologist in other wordsmight want to visit big explosion wouldnt happen for another few thousand years or another few tens of thousands of years maybe but kelly couldnt make herself believe it while she stewed the pilot talked with people who werent in the helicopter at last he said okay this is what ive cooked up a carll be waiting for you at the butte airport thats about as far as i can go on my fuel load one of you people has a place in missoula right daniel was in the other whirlybird somebody out there had a feel for what was going on missoula was about miles northwest up i from butte if the supervolcano blew most of what it blasted into the air would go in the other direction missoula might get some but probably wouldnt get a lot and if the eruption held off kelly could head back to california ruth could go to utah assuming anyone would want to go to utah in the shadow of the big blast larry mostly hung out in and around yellowstone knowing him he might be meshuggeh enough to head back if he got some kind any kind of excuse meanwhile thanks she said a whisker ahead of larry she had no idea what daniels place was like if they couldnt crash on him well missoula was bound to have motels hotels even times like this were why god made plastic she might even get the berkeley geology department to reimburse her then again given californias neverending budget woes she might not one more thing she could worry about later if she was still alive to worry about it once they got over the gallatin range they were out of the mountains and forests and roaring along above ranch country the copter flew much lower than the airliners that had been kellys only source of views of the ground from on high she could see individual cows and even sheep from the herds and individual cars scattered along the pale asphalt of country roads that hadnt been repaved in a long time and got so little wear that they wouldnt need to be for quite a while yet there was i up ahead kelly had wondered if it would be packed solid with cars and rvs full of people fleeing yellowstone but it wasnt probably werent that many left to flee any more the interstate was two lanes wide in each direction but for the lack of traffic lights that would have been a boulevard in la or the bay area when your whole state was almost the size of california but held fewer than a million people you could have a fourlane main highway and go like hell instead of sitting stuck in traffic on a freeway twelve lanes wide bert mooney airport coming up the pilot said in due course kelly idly wondered who bert mooney was or had been the pilot did things with his stickwith the collective he called it as if it were a farm in the extinct soviet union the helicopter descended not far away so did the one carrying ruth and daniel whoever bert mooney might have been the two helicopters were his airports only current business kelly was used to airports like lax and san francisco and oakland that green ford sitting there near the terminal couldnt be the car theyd take away could it theres your wheels i expect the pilot said pointing to it sometimes simplicity had advantages touchdown on the tarmac a moment later was surprisingly gentle the other chopper landed three or four seconds after kelly and larrys a fuel truck pulled up and waited for their rotorsto stop spinning kelly took off her helmet now with the motor cut it wasnt deafening in here thanks more than i know how to tell you she said amen larry agreed not a big deal might notve been anything at all the pilot answered sometimes youd sooner be safe than sorry is all good luck to you guys you too kelly said as he opened the canopy and she scrambled out larry followed her ruth and daniel got out of the other helicopter they all started dogtrotting across the tarmac toward the car kelly presumed it was a rental she didnt know for sure but that was one more thing she could worry about later after they got to missoula seemed a pretty good time halfway to the green ford larry suddenly stopped intent only on getting to the car and getting onto i kelly sent him an annoyed glare whats the matter with you she snapped instead of answering with words he pointed southeast over the top of the low flatroofed terminal building kellys gaze automatically followed his index finger that great black swelling leaping cloud hadnt been there when they touched down a minute before it grew every second even across a couple of hundred miles kelly could see the lightning bolts lashing around its edges which meant they were how big how bright some questions either answered themselves or didnt really need answering one oh my god kelly whispered ruth crossed herself kelly hadnt known she was catholic with a last name like marquez it was a good bet though maybe ruth hadnt thought about being catholic herself any time lately seeing that ahead was the kind of thing that would remind you why isnt there any noise daniel asked why isnt the ground shaking dont worry well feel it well hear it too larry answered the earthquake waves and the sound waves havent got here yet but they will he looked as grim as a phlegmatic person could oh boy will they ever people heard krakatoa two thousand miles away and krakatoa was only a fart in a bathtub next to this what would have happened to us if wed been in the air when the sound wave or shock wave or whatever you want to call it hit us ruth said kelly looked back at the helicopter pilot he was staring toward yellowstone too even through the choppers plexiglas canopy she could see his mouth hanging open what happens to a fly when the swatter comes down she said if you hit a fly with a swatter the size of a house that probably came closer to describing the force matchup none of them went any closer to the car out here in the open they were about as safe as they could be even if the terminal building fell over it wouldnt fall on them i think we ought to get down larry said you guys are too young to remember drop drills but you know about em right an officious fifthgrade teacher from days gone by would have yelled at kelly for bad form but she didnt care she assumed the classic position on the pavement which was much smoother than the parking lot where shed spent the night beforethe parking lot that was now one tiny puff in that insanely huge mass of smoke and dust drop drills were designed to protect you against russian hbombs what did you do when something way way bigger than an hbomb went off not nearly far enough away whoa nelly larry yelled when the shaking started getting down was a good idea because kelly knew she couldnt have stayed on her feet shed wondered what the richter reading for a supervolcano would be it was enormous or whatever one step higher than enormous was shed put all this distance between herself and the epicenter and she was still getting tossed around like a rag doll it didnt want to ease up either like the energizer bunny it kept going and going and how much energy was being released all at once the calculator inside her head said tilt windows in the airport terminal broke one of the helicopters that had flown the geologists out of yellowstone went over onto its side luckily the pilot was still in his safety harness so he might be okay even more luckily neither copter had started refueling everybodyd stopped to gape at the cataclysm off in yellowstone the ground was still shaking when the wind came blast from an atomic bomb could wreck things far away from the actual explosion the roar came at the speed of sound it had had plenty of distance to attenuate and had gone around and over a couple of mountain ranges on the way that meant it was just far and away the loudest thing kelly had ever heard in her life somewhere shed read that artillerymen yelled to help equalize the pressure on their ears she tried it it couldnt possibly hurt and she felt like screaming any which way she blew twenty or thirty feet down the runway picking up more bumps and bruises and scrapes if she hadnt had her hands up to her face that would have been worse too part of the terminal did fall in on itself about then knocked down by the wind roaring around and through it flattened by the unending quakes wrecked by nothing more than the vibration from the great roar kelly would have checked all of the above on a multiplechoice test the green ford didnt flip over that was something how much she wasnt so sure could they make it to missoula shed traveled i before as she did in many parts of the country shed noticed how spindly the supports for the overpasses were building codes hereabouts didnt mandate anything like the quake resistance required in california so what would happen when something bigger than the big one hit even if it was a long way off theyd find out that cloud in the sky swelled and swelled it hadnt blotted out the sunnot yet not here but how much of wyoming and montana and idaho had seen night fall in the middle of the day more every minute as the long long shadow went on stretching it reminded kelly of the blast from mount doom when the ring went into the fire in the return of the king but sauron proved impotent in the end the hot spot under yellowstone was anything but how many millionsor was it billions probablyof tons of pulverized rock did that cloud represent not all of it would be thoroughly pulverized either how far could the biggest explosion in the past years throw boulders big enough to squash houses and cars how far could it throw rocks big enough to smash skulls people in a broad swath of the rocky mountain west were finding out right this minute sometimes the hard way and for the ones too close to the supervolcano flying boulders and ash in the sky would be the least of their worries good oldfashioned lava was pouring out of the caldera along with all the junk going straight up so were pyroclastic flowsmud and boiling water mixed into a hellbrew when vesuvius blew in ad a pyroclastic flow was what buried pompeii but like krakata like mt st helens like well everything vesuvius was only a hiccup next to this west yellowstone montana a tacky tourist town would be gone off the map so would gardiner montana at yellowstones north entrance and cooke city and silver gate montana to the parksthe exparksnortheast and cody wyoming a little farther east south of yellowstone the grand tetons were going to get another layer of volcanic tuff pasted on and it would be tuffand toughon jackson wyoming too and all that of course was only the beginning only the tiniest fraction of the beginning larry managed to make it to his feet his denim jacket had a hole in one elbow his jeans were out at both knees one knee was bleeding into the blue denim he didnt seem to notice well kelly had hurts she hadnt started reviewing yet too one thing at a time the ground went on rolling under them normally you wouldnt feel aftershocks from a quake that far away but that was a big quake and these were big aftershocks still they did roll instead of jerking as they would have done closer to the epicenter you couldlarry couldstand up while they were going on the wind blasting out from the eruption was still fierce too but not fierce enough to knock him over he could even yell through it and make himself heard lets haul ass while we can the farther we go before ash starts falling on us the better i dont know how the cars air filter will like all that grit and i dont know how the engine will like the crud the filter lets through kelly had known him for a while now he was lowkey unexcitable she translated what hed said into what would have come from most people he figured the air filter wouldnt like volcanic ash for hell and the motor would go queep and die once it inhaled enough grit how many carsand trucks and fire engines and ambulancesacross how many states would go queep and die when their engines seized up from overdosing on ash one more interesting question in the chinese sense of the word shed seen the maps that showed how far the supervolcano threw ash in previous eruptions most of the midwest and big pieces of the west were in deep deep kimchi and all that also was only the beginning can i stand up too she wondered only one way to find out ruth had already made it to her feet by the time kelly did daniel also did it though he limped as he went over to the ford knee ankle whatever it was he could after a fashion walk on it that would do for the moment larry tried the drivers door it opened he looked inside keys in the ignition he reported the pilot wasnt lying to us they got in the guys took the front seats the women sat in back it was fairlarry and daniel were taller than both of them as kelly fastened her belt she noticed shed barked her right palm ruth had a nasty scrape on her forehead and a bloody ear all that was stuff they could worry about later only after the belt clicked tight did kelly start giggling ruth who was also buckling up sent her a curious look she explained its the end of the world and im fastening my stupid seat belt so are you oh ruth managed a sheepish nod force of habit larry started the car hed also used his belt so had daniel who said we may need them if it is the end d people will be driving like bats out of hell if that wasnt a mixedup metaphorwell similekellyd never heard one being mixed up sure didnt make it wrong though larry drove around the battered terminal building people some of them bleeding were coming out through windows and doors i dont like to pass them by but he said no one tried to change his mind by montana standards butte was a goodsized town it held about people it had banks and offices and apartment buildings and fastfood joints just like a real city some of them had stayed up some had fallen down glass from countless broken windows sparkled in the sun like snow some of the glass sparkled on harrison avenue the street that would take them up to the interstate that wind hadnt been fooling around a flat would be all we needed right now wouldnt it ruth said bite your tongue kelly said sweetly hard some of the locals were helping others whod been hurt but lots of men and women stood on the sidewalksor sometimes in the middle of the streetstaring and pointing at the cloud swelling up and up and out and out from the supervolcano kelly couldnt blame them she kept twisting to stare back at it herself how high how wide how close more of each every secondthat was the only thing she was sure about larry turned on the radio hiphop blared out of it no doubt the station chosen by the last guy whod serviced the ford he punched buttons before long he found someone solemnly saying the president has declared a state of emergency in wyoming montana and idaho the governors of those states have also declared emergencies and have called out the national guard well thats a relief daniel said were all safe now will you sock him please kelly said to larry its a long stretch for me consider yourself socked larry told daniel as he swung the car onto the westbound i he pointed this overpass is okay anyhow that makes one kelly said ruth made as if to sock her kelly dipped her head in apology loss of life in and around yellowstone park is believed to be heavy as is property damage the newscaster intoned obviously he was in washington or new york city or some place like that some place where this seemed like one more natural disaster that didnt have anything to do with him or his wellconnected way of life and so it was for the moment he went on for the time being we have no direct reports from the impacted area all the geologists in the ford hooted and hollered no shit jackson ruth yelled which was among the more coherent editorials buyclue kelly added she and ruth both kept twisting around to look back through the rear window every time the cloud from the supervolcano looked bigger and blacker and closer they were making interstate speed how fast was it going how far would it come right about to missoula if past eruptions were any guideand they were the only guide anybody had how far the ash would blow in the other direction was an altogether different and much bigger question every so often the car would kind of lh for a little while as if a tire were low on air then it would straighten out and fly right again didnt they put any shocks on this hunk of junk daniel asked its not the shocks kelly said being a californian she had more direct and more varied experience with earthquakes than any of the others its the aftershocks this is what an earthquake feels like in a car oh daniel said in a small sheepish voice larry hit the brakes kelly had to look forward instead of back a pair of montana highway patrol cars had their light bars flashing red and blue an officer from one of them waved traffic towards an offramp sure as hell an overpass was down half a car stuck out from under it kellys stomach lurched like the ford in an aftershock when she thought about being in the other half it would have been over fast anyway all that concrete falling the highway patrolmanno patrolwoman she had boobs under her khaki shirt and a ponytailwaving cars to the ramp wore a mask like the ones the geologists had used in yellowstone that was smart whether it would be up to the challenge ahead whether the whole country would be up to the challenge ahead let alone one crappy mask larry finally got around to asking daniel if his place would hold four for a little while anyway if you dont mind sleeping on the couch daniel answered kelly and ruth can have the bed and ive got a spare sleeping bag in my closet ill use that should work larry agreed in musing tones he went on i wonder whether missoula gets gas and food and things shipped in from the east or from the west that was another fascinating question kelly hadnt started thinking in those terms but she realized shed start needing to supplies might be able to reach missoula from idaho nothing much would be able to cross montana for god only knew how long ashand probably boulders toowould already be raining down on livingston and bozeman i would be impassable stretches of it might end up under hundreds of feet of volcanic debris maybe some secondary routes farther north would stay open maybebut kelly had trouble believing it what would missoula and lots of places like missoula do when a whole bunch of what they depended on for daily living didntcouldntget through theyd damn well do without was what and what would come of that kelly knew the question really mattered she knew she ought to be worrying about it but she couldnt not right now thanks to that helicopter pilot she hadnt been smack in the middle of ground zero when the yellowstone caldera fell in on itself she was still here she was still breathing she still had a chance to go on breathing a while longer she still had the chance to find out the answer to her important question and perhaps to some others as well right this minute she figured that made her one of the luckiest and in a way one of the richest people on the face of the globe and she wasnt going to worry about a single goddamn thing the powers that be at amalgamated humanoids didnt mind if people listened to the radio at their desks every so often there was a little dustup when somebody listened to something the person at the next desk couldnt stand and turned it up instead of down when the allegedly injured party complained but that didnt happen as often as vanessa ferguson would have guessed not everyone was as touchy as she was though she didnt see iat way she bounced from npr to the classical station to political talk she would have liked to bring her ipod but the powers that be did frown on headphoneseven earbuds they claimed people got too distracted using those it sounded like bullshit to vanessa but she hadnt been there long enough to stick in her oar on something like that she sure as hell needed something to take part of her mind off the proposal she was editing if she gave the wretched document her full attention shed grab a paperweight or something and chuck it at her monitor uselessly long words in uselessly long sentences that twisted and writhed like worms on a sidewalk after a rain would the engineers write better if they learned english the way they learned programming however they learned that they couldnt very well write worse an announcer broke into a bach harpsichord concerto if that wasnt a hanging offense it damn well should have been i do apologize for the interruption the woman said but an important news bulletin has just reached us there is a majori repeat a majorvolcanic eruption in yellowstone national park this is on a scale far larger than anything previously known there is some concern that denver may be adversely affected please stay tuned for any further developments thank you bach returned cool and pure as far as vanessa knew she was the only person here who listened to classical music but exclamations floated up from several cubicles so the bulletin must have gone out on a bunch of stations vanessa remembered her dad pitching a hissy fit because she was coming here that was just too ridiculous though volcanic ash could screw up flight schedules suredenver politicos had been pissing and moaning about revenue reversals for months now even so yellowstone was well how far from denver was yellowstone anyhow vanessa had checked once before she moved here but shed forgotten she hit bing com to find out most people would have googled it but she was microsoft all the way from yellowstone to denver was about miles she laughed ridiculous to think that anything so far away could possibly do much here reporters got you to keep listening by exaggerating bulletins and the poor woman at the classical station had to read whatever they stuck in front of her she wouldnt have any way of knowing what bushwah it was nodding to herself vanessa closed the bing window and grimly returned to the proposal she tried to tell herself it wouldnt seem so bad with bach lilting out of the radio she tried but she didnt have much luck at first she hardly noticed the rolling motion under her but it built and built and kept on building a rolling motion rather than a sharp wham meant a quake was a long way awayall her california experience taught her so a quake a long way off that was this big was a lulu though a file cabinet somewhere not far enough away went over with a crash next thing vanessa knew she was under her desk trying to bunch her legs up under her so it would protect them too the rolling went on and on screamssoprano and baritonerang through the office make it stop somebody yelled but it wouldnt stop little by littleafter several more tall files fellit did ease up a final shake sent vanessas keyboard clattering down she supposed she was lucky the monitor didnt slide off the desk too and acoustic cottage cheese drifted from the ceiling like indoor snow she hit emshe scrambled out from under the desk she was one of the first to emerge maybe because she was a californian and more used to quakes several cubicle partitions had gone down along with the file cabinets she could see much farther across the office than shed been able to before lucky the power stayed on she thought which must have tempted fate or something because a doozy of an aftershock almost knocked her off her feet she squawked and grabbed for the edge of the desk to steady herselfand as she touched it the lights went out for a few seconds everything went as black as the inside of a mortgage bankers heart people started screaming in earnest vanessa didnt join them but she didnt miss by much then a few wan emergency lights came on somebody spoke from ceiling speakers that she hadnt known were there evacuate the building immediately evacuate the building she couldnt remember hearing an idea she liked better pausing only to grab her handbag she hurried toward a red exit sign glowing over a door the office was on the second floor along with everybody else she went down a gloomy hallway to the stairs several people limped a small man had his arms around the shoulders of two bigger guys as vanessa squeezed past the smaller fellow said goddamn file cabinet smashed my ankle hurts like a motherfucker pardon my french ive heard the word she answered he chuckled before he went back to swearing the stairwell was dark except at the bottom where dim daylight beckoned vanessa had done plenty of things shed enjoyed more than trying not to trip and break her neck or even an ankle of her own if anybody above her fell everybody on the stairs was liable to go ass over teakettle she made it she hurried to the front entrance it had those glass doors that automatically slid sideways when anyone approached printed across them was the legend in case of emergency push outward vanessa had seen it a million times without ever paying much attention to it but someone had pushed and the doors had indeed opened outward yet another aftershock hurried her into the parking lot how much could the building take what kind of quake standards did denver have out in the open she didnt have to worry about that so much she really had wondered if the ceiling would come crashing down people in the lot were aligning like iron filings scattered across a paper on top of a magnet they were all facing a little west of north vanessa turned that way too before she quite realized what she was doing she liked denvers western horizon with the rockies shouldering their way up into the sky as far as the eye could seeif air pollution let the eye see them at all this was a clear bright day the morning had been downright chilly she could see the mountains just fine and towering far above them she could see what all the other people saw that enormous column of smoke growing swelling every second that cant be yellowstone it cant someone said with the plaintive tones of a man hoping to be contradicted its too far away isnt it i mean a little ash at the airport thats one thing but this his voice trailed away vanessa wanted to believe it was much too far to be yellowstone she couldnt you could see the rockies most of the way to kansas in good weather that cloud obviously was a hell of a lot taller than the mountains for all she knew her father could see it back in san atanasioiv its getting bigger a woman said its heading this way plenty of crap from the little eruptionsthough they hadnt seemed little till nowhad headed this way that was why flights into and out of the airport had been hitandmiss for so long not all of this titanic cloud was heading toward denver obviously oh no thered be plenty to go around and then some but what would happen when denvers share landed nothing good vanessa could see that right away go home folks that was malcolm talbott who ran amalgamated humanoids were not going to get anything done today go home he repeated louder this time well see how things are tomorrow if they arent so bad well work if they are he shrugged we wont be the only one with troubles youd best believe we wont one more earthquake put a rolling period under his words nobody needed to tell vanessa twice she made a beeline for her car fumbling in her purse for the keys shed just unlocked the door when the bellow from the blast tore through denver yellowstone was over miles awayshed found that out sound took forty minutes or so to get from there to here she wondered what that bellow would have been like if she were only say fifty miles away she didnt wonder long it would have torn her head off she jumped into the car and slammed the door that helped a little less than she would have wished the car rocked under her she started it anyway and punched the radio buttons till she found news for once it didnt take long gigantic disaster someone was saying in a high excited voice several states are sure to be severely impacted vanessa started a reflexive sneer then cut it off things were going to come down on several states sure as hell things were already coming down on several states when you used impact as a verb that was what you were supposed to mean maybe this yahoo meant affect but for once he was literally correct well be right back after this important message he said the message proved to be important only to the maleenhancement company that put it out and to the radio stations bottom line vanessa hit another button will undoubtedly blanket denver an educatedsounding woman was saying how deep the ashfall will be and how serious its effects no one can yet predict it is already obvious though that removing it will be more challenging than clearing a heavy snowfall where can we take it that isnt also already covered in ash wasnt that also true of snow but snow eventually melted and you just had to get it out of the streets snow on lawns and parks was beautiful volcanic ash would be anything but how will volcanic ash affect people with respiratory ailments a man asked the only thing i can say right now is it wont be good the woman answered it wont be good for anyone and it wont be good for livestock and stockraising is particularly important in the eastern half of the state colorado had always been uneasily divided between agriculture and mining tourism added a third leg to the stand but now everything was knocked for a loop who besides geologists would want to come visit a city blanketedhow deep in volcanic ash escaped lunatics maybe some of this dustmaybe a lot of itwill reach the upper atmoere and be blown around the world the woman added global climate change may be severe that didnt sound good the hugely towering black cloud off to the west of north didnt look good the earthquakes that kept rolling through denver didnt feel good nothing seemed goodexcept vanessa had the rest of the day off x colin met gabe sanchez at a familiar spot in front of the coffeepot as colin loaded up more instant brain cells gabe said well its finally gone and happened whats gone and happened colin asked adulterating his java with cream and sugar he stood aside so gabe could get at the pot that superwaddayacallit in yellowstone went kapow sanchez answered i just saw it on a news feed from the net hey where you going man to find out whats going on for myself colin said grimly kellys still up there or she was last night oh hell thats not good gabe said tell me about it i hope everything turns out okay sanchez crossed himself raised a hardshell baptist colin had long since lost his religion most of the time he didnt miss it most of the time in fact he forgot hed ever had it it was easy not to believe in god especially a merciful god when you were a cop colin often wondered how guys like gabe managed every once in a while he envied them the solace their faith could bring this was one of those times the first thing he did was check his phone he breathed again when he saw a text from kelly on helicopter on my way out thank you jesus he muttered it was as close to a prayer as hed come in god knew how long one thing the cop shop could boast and that was fast internet when colin turned to cnn com he got live streaming video from a weather satellite there was a hell of a lot of smoke and under it patches of fire the headline was simple yellowstone catastrophe when he noticed the computeradded state boundaries on the video he realized that was an understatement but english didnt come equipped with words to describe anything this big no language did no language since the primeval ook had ever needed to cope with anything like this there was a story under the video the great collapse had happened only forty minutes earlier he shook his head in wonder the world was a connected place these days all right then he remembered hed had a coffee cup in his hand when he ran back to his desk he reached for it and discovered the world was a connected place in more ways than the information superhighway that gentle rolling motion under his swivel chair could only be an earthquake by the way it went on and on it was one doozy of an earthquake too cops and secretaries started exclaiminghe wasnt the only one who felt it but it stayed mild so it was a long way off holy crap he said thats got to be the supervolcano back more than a hundred years before theyd felt the san francisco earthquake in los angeles but yellowstone was a lot farther away than san francisco didnt that argue that the quake that went with the supervolcano eruption was bigger than the one that had flattened the city bythe bay how much would this one flatten he wondered what had happened to denver central colorado suddenly seemed much too close to northwestern wyoming he called vanessa he got her voice mail which might mean anything or nothing at the beep he said you okay give me a call and let me know bye hed done what he could on that front a little fiddling on the computer told him how far from san atanasio yellowstone was it also told him how fast earthquake waves traveled even if the wiki article did say they propagated he tried to imagine fornicating earthquake waves but his mind rebelled san atanasio would feel an earthquake in yellowstone about forty minutes after it happened assuming it felt such an earthquake at all yeah assuming he thought his cell phone rang he always answered the landline on his desk with some variation on ferguson here he said hello hi dad it was vanessa i just got home could you feel the quake there sure could whats it like where you are you just got home you said yeah the building where i work stayed up but powers out its out here too i dont know when itll come back she hesitated then added i dont know if itll come back and the sky oh my god the sky the clouds coming this way you can tell pickles is under the bed and he wont come out hes scared shitlessi cleaned it off the rug i believe that should you get out now while the gettings good colin asked i dont know im thinking about it will you let mom and the brothers know im okay i dont want to run my battery any more than i have toi dont know when ill be able to charge it again okay colin said though he looked forward to calling louise the way he looked forward to losing a tooth take care you too bye he started to add good luck but shed hung up by then sighing he called louises cell maybe hed luck out maybe hed get her voice mail and not actually have to talk to her but no that familiar voice once loved now not said hello in his ear hi its me his own voice was hard and flat i just talked to vanessa shes okay but it sounds like the quake hit denver a lot harder than it did here the same quake louise said incredulously so she wasnt with it at all colin filled her in in words of one syllable powers down in denver and the ash cloud is heading that way he finished from what kellyd said the ash might even dust los angeles louise didnt need to worry about that right now though good god she said id better call the poor baby dont colin said sharply shes trying to save her battery till power comes back if it does she told me to call you shes being sensible for once in her life he didnt say that what good would it do what good would anything do she talked to you instead of me mister high and mighty how did that happen louise demanded because i found out what was going on and called her colin answered thats m he was talking to a dead line again he powered off his own phone chances were louise would call vanessa just to show him chances were shed talk the kids ear off too well vanessa could tell her to shut up vanessa could try anyway he scrolled down the story under the wound in the earth it said the ash plume would top out at over feet twenty miles he thought none of the rockies was even three miles high you couldnt see the rockies from la even imagining you could was silly but something seven times as high he didnt know he didnt think he had enough trig left to find out either his longago highschool math teachers would be pissed off that he didnt but that was how the cookie bounced or the ball crumbled his highschool math teachers had been a bunch of bores rob was on the other side of the country touring with his band if anybody was okay he was marshall was up in santa barbara getting ready for a new quarter and another new major the eruption wouldnt trash santa barbara colin didnt think trashing santa barbara was possible the only thing that convinced him santa barbara wasnt heaven on earth was the realestate prices there heaven wouldnt have been anywhere near so expensive the cnn news feed said the president was urging everyone to stay calm during the present emergency how calm could you stay when a quake knocked down everything you had or when boulders or ash fell out of the sky on you colin routinely despised democrats in the white house and republicans routinely disappointed him but hadnt this clowns advisors briefed him about what a supervolcano eruption would mean or maybe they had as kellyd said some disasters were just too big to plan for you hoped they didnt happen if they happened all the same what could you do but duck and cover and roll with the punches and try your best to come out the other side if there turned out to be any other side to come out to half the country must have felt this punch maybe more and the eruption itself was only the first part of the combination the supervolcano would throw at civilization under those circumstances urging calm on people might not be so bad it wouldnt hurt and it might do a tiny bit of good something rumbled outside and went on rumbling during the big war the germans on the eastern front must have heard noise like that when the russians shelled them before sending in the tanks colin knew about naval gunnery but it was never this continuous for this youd have to line up guns of every caliber hub to hub shoot them all off at once and have enough ammo to keep shooting and shooting and shooting or youd have to have a supervolcano go off eight hundred miles away this sound had been traveling for more than an hour and it was still loud enough to shake the building almost as hard as the earthquake had in another hour or hour and a half the president would hear it in the oval office and three or four hours after that they might hear it in europe theyd heard krakatoa a couple of thousand miles away and this thing made krakatoa look like vanessas pickles next to a sabertooth gabe colin said through the rumble that wouldnt quit waddaya need sergeant sanchez answered cmere a sec colin said gabe got up from his own desk and ambled over colin went on we had better secure a supply of gasoline for the department and i mean right now this thing will screw transport like you wouldnt believe so why are you telling me why arent you telling the chief or else the mayor have we got the money in the budget to do anything like that can the city get it for us if we dont gabe was full of reasonable questions or rather he was full of questions that would have been reasonable a little more than an hour earlier the chief and the mayor would be full of it too colin had no doubts on that score the difference was he couldor he hoped he couldmake gabe see sense his superiors wouldnt want to listen as if they ever did this has to be unofficial colin said no refineries in san atanasio but there are some over in el segundo and down in lomita talk to the managers there tell em were gonna have problems tell em the whole states gonna have problems do it nowget there ahead of their own cops show em were on the ball see what you can do to get em to lend us a hand i got you gabe said you want em to think we know more about whats going on than their local people do uhhuh colin nodded thanks to kelly he did know more about what was liable to go on than most of the local competition the problem with that was the more you knew the worse things looked you could tell a refinery manager that california would have problems for a while you couldnt tell a guy like that that the world had just walked into a sucker punch if he didnt already know it for himselfand chances were he wouldnthe wouldnt believe you okay ill do it sanchez said better get moving while those guysre still shook up by the quake and the boom and shit good plan colin agreed the refinery managers would be shakenliterally and otherwise they might be more inclined to listen to bulky imposing sergeant sanchez colin would have bet his last quarter that things would get worse not better but you didnt want to tell civilians too much too soon they couldnt always handle bad news and he knew he was a cynical cop ready to look on the gloomy side both by training and by temperament he had to put that in the equation too kelly might not understand supervolcanoes as well as she thought she did it wasnt as if geologists had ever had a live one to study so maybe this wasnt a catastrophe after all cnn com notwithstanding maybe it was just a disaster colin laughed at himself only a cynical cop could have a thought like that and actually find consolation in it bryce miller had a window seat on the flight from ohare back to lax he couldnt stand lax he didnt know anyone who could ohare was even busier it seemed to run more smoothly though or maybe that was just his imagination the conference on the hellenistic world at the university of chicago had gone as well as hed dared hope he hadnt given a paper but hed critiqued one he thought his remarks were to the point the professors whod listened to him seemed to think so too something might come of that no guaranteesthere were never any guaranteesbut something might if he could get his thesis done or why think small they did hire people whod done all but the dissertation there was even a name for them abds they got paid less of course but after a tas money any real salary looked terrific the guy in the middle iggled he wasnt deliberately annoying but he was there right there and the woman in front of bryce had reclined her seat as far as it would go she wasnt trying to kneecap him which didnt mean she wasnt doing it he got out the pastrami on rye and the big chocolatechip cookie hed bought in the airport the bastards werent about to feed you he counted himself lucky the flight attendants had doled out a coke such extravagant generosity had to be bad for the bottom line somebody somewhere in the plane was eating something smellier than airport pastrami bryce was forcibly reminded of the modern fable about the stinky cheese man youd think whoever was chowing down would have more regard for everyone else trapped in the flying cigar with him but no and even that minimal regard might be too much to hope for going with a cops daughter and getting to know the cop himself had made bryce look at his fellow humans with a freshly jaundiced eye getting dumped by vanessa hadnt done anything to improve his attitude either he took a bite from the sandwich in selfdefense while he chewed he looked down out the window about seven miles down the landscape was flat and green and gold and laid out in geometric patterns the midwest from on high it wasnt great pastrami no way youd find great pastrami at an airport sandwich shop but it wasnt lousy pastramiall fat and peppercornseither and the cookie honest to god was pretty good it made a better lunch than american would have given him once upon a timebut also a more expensive one bryce slammed the tray into place again let the bitch whod shoved her seat way back feel it after one more look at the fields far below he leaned against the bulkhead and tried to sleep hed just dozed off when this is the captain speaking bryces eyes jerked open he was surprised he didnt bleed out through them the airlines customerprevention program was going full blast or so he thought till he saw one of the flight attendants she looked pale and stunned like the gal he knew whod flunked her orals this is the captain the slightly southern voice repeated weve just got word of an emergency ahead we are not going to be able to continue to los angeles we will have to turn around and head back towards ohare i am very sorry for the inconvenience but this is unavoidable i dont know yet whether well land in chicago or somewhere between here and there when i find out be assured i will inform you pronto the pa system crackled into silence at the same time as the cabin exploded into noise an emergency ahead what the hell was that supposed to mean what would make them turn around and head for chicago again a replay of that was the first thing bryce thought of as the plane began to turn the guy in the seat next to his fired up his iphone you werent supposed to do that in flight but bryce would have bet gold against gallstones his seatmate wasnt the only one breaking the rules right now people wanted to know what the hell was going on if the pilot wouldnt tell them theyd find out for themselves not thinking anything of it bryce looked out the window again his eyes started to track across it but then stopped as if physically seized they had to be bugging out of their sockets hed flown between anviltopped thunderheads that towered higher into the sky than his airliner not oftenmost of the time you stayed well above the weatherbut he had those had been goddamn bumpy flights too but those cloudsd gone up a little higher than his plane that black column off in the distance ahead if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes he would have been sure it was impossible even seeing it he thought it should have been not knowing how far away it was he couldnt say how high up it went he could say though that it went one hell of a lot higher than anything hed ever imagined let alone seen the guy next to him was staring at the iphone as hard as bryce was staring out the window supervolcano the man muttered to himself the fuck is a supervolcano no one could possibly have dropped an icicle down bryces back but that was how he felt he knew what a supervolcano was he might not have if not for colins new lady friend but he did colin had taken kelly seriously even before yellowstone started bubbling over bryce hadnt known how seriously to take her not then especially since he was hearing her message delivered through colin he knew now by god other people in the window seats on his side of the plane were seeing that colossaland seemingly expanding toocloud the word supervolcano started rippling through the whole cabin not everybody seemed sure what all it meant but it obviously wasnt good news does this mean we wont get to have dinner with uncle louie tonight a woman said some people were not overburdened with brains this is the captain one more time if i could have your attention please the man in the cockpit had to know the passengers were seething if i could have your attention please he waited for them to settle down a little before continuing some of you on the starboard side will have seen a large cloud of ash and dust rising into the upper atmosphere naturally all the people who hadnt seen it craned their necks in that direction trying to get a glimpse bryce admired the pilots power of understatement a lesser man would have been incapable of it that is why were turning around the pilot went on we cant fly over it we dont dare fly through itgrit does bad things to turbine bladesand it doesnt look like we can go around it there is some turbulence associated with this eruption and im going to ask all of you who turned on your smart phones to for gods sake turn em off again getting our electronics screwed up right now would be the last thing we need thanks very much folks bryce would have hit the flightattendant call button if the guy in the middle seat hadnt turned off the iphone maybe he was worrying about the hazard too much but if the captain was getting up in arms about it he figured he was also entitled to up ahead a few rows somebody didnt want to squelch his blackberry he loudly and profanely didnt want to in fact aided by two other passengers a flight attendant dispossessed him of it that brought on more profanity you can have it back when we land sir the stewardess said sweetly sweetly still she added then i hope you ram it up your stupid ass that startled the foulmouthed passenger into silence you didnt expect someone in a service industry to shoot back at you with your own weapons bryce hadnt expected anything like that either hearing it made him wonder how much trouble the flight might be in up till then hed worried what the dickens he would do in chicago once they got back there he had nowhere to stay he had a carryons worth of clothes and he had no more money than any other grad student now he wondered whether theyd make it back if that flight attendant felt she could let fly at a passenger she was wondering the same thing some turbulence associated with this eruption the captains bloodless phrase came back to bryce suppose you dropped rhode island into a frying pan big enough to hold ita figure of speech colin liked since as bryce had long known he couldnt stand rhode island what kind of shock wave would go through the air after you did that how fast would it go what would it do to any old airplane it happened to meet those were all fascinating questions werent they they sure were especially that last one bryces current perspective aboard one of those old airplanes made it even more intriguing he could do exactly nothing about it hed never felt helpless in this particular way before the guy sitting next to him must have made the same kind of calculation because out of the blue he said i did two tours in afghanistan when the mortars start coming in you just hope youre lucky after i got out of the army i didnt figure id ever have to worry about that kind of shit again yknow uhhuh bryce managed a nod he wanted to freak out but not in front of a bunch of strangers how much of what got labeled bravery was really just fear of embarrassment he couldnt see the cloud any more the airliners turn meant it was behind them now but he could imagine the shock wave tearing through the air and gaining on them every second a bell chimed in the cabin the seatbelt warning lights came on the captain has directed that everyone should return to their seats and remain there the boss flight attendant declared on the pa this is due to safety concerns for all on board and will be enforced as necessary that sounded tougher than airline personnel usually talked bryce thought of the coke hed had with his sandwich sooner or later it would make itself known again what was he supposed to do then if he couldnt get up pee in his airsick bag maybe and men had it easier there than women did the engines changed note once more they were working harder if that meant the plane was going faster bryce was all for it the intercom came back to life this is the captain speaking folks we have been cleared to land in lincoln nebraska we will be approaching from the northwest and i will have you down on the ground just as soon as i possibly can do please stay in your seats with your belts securely fastened this may not be real pretty but i will make it work one more piece of news that didnt sound so good bryce looked out the window again they were coming down like mad bastards no leisurely landing descent today when the pilot said he wanted to get down fast he wasnt kidding bryces physical eyes saw farms and ponds and roads swell beneath him his minds eye saw a red needle on an altimeter sliding from right to left altimeters probably didnt look like that these dayseverything now was bound to be digital so his minds eye wasnt as precise as it might have been so what lincoln the university of nebraska was there what did he know about the university of nebraska they had a good football team and a good university press who was their ancient historian what kind of classics department did they have hed talked with some of their peoplen chicago now he might try to crash on them for a little whilethey were as close to family as he had this side of youngstown ohio he didnt want to think about crashing on right now or crashing into or crashing anything when you analyzed poetry you always had to remember the difference between literal and figurative language bryce was fully aware of it here he still didnt want to think about crashing just now they werent that far off the ground any more if something went wrong could they try landing on one of these country roads they were long and straight and most of them looked as if they took maybe one car a week not ideal runways but better than nothing please raise your tray tables and return your seat backs to the fully upright position the boss flight attendant said we may be a little early with this announcement or she broke off one word too late how many people noticed the afghan vet beside bryce muttered fuck under his breath so he did some passengers still had no clue about how bad things were liable to be a middleaged womanbryce thought she was the gal whod miss dinner with uncle louiewas indignantly complaining that an attendant had no right to keep her from getting up and going to the bathroom i havent got time to argue with you the frazzled attendant snapped but if you even touch your goddamn seat belt im gonna crown you with my solidsteel coffeepot you hear me you better cause i mean it ill get you fired for this the passenger said shrilly now ask me if i care the stewardess answered and hurried to her own seat this is the captain one more time the drawl came out of the pa again i suggest you take a brace against your seat backs we have some turbulence coming up behind us and it may get kind of severe once the wind event is past well take a look around and see where were at then hang on folks see where were at then could only mean see if were still flying the veteran said fuck again more sincerely this time it might have been a prayer across the aisle a hispanic woman was telling her rosary beads bryce miller a secular baconscarfing jew wondered if she had some consolation he didnt too late for him to start praying now he knew more about the dead religions of ancient greece than about the one hed been born into then something gave the plane a kick in the ass bryce said fuck himself very loudly he couldnt even hear the obscenity through everybody elses chorus of screams and curses and prayers he waited for the wings to come off or the skin to peel away from the fuselage the only thing he hoped for in that moment was that it would all get over with in a hurry but the plane didnt come to pieces though booms and crashes said carts were going cattywumpus no matter how well theyd been stowed oxygen masks deployed from the panels hed never seen open before half the overhead luggage compartments flew open too they were stuffed so tight though that surprisingly few pieces flew out and clobbered people it was the first advantage hed ever found to charging for checked bags someone in the cabin had thrown up and missed the airsick bag someone elsemaybe more than one someone elsehad shit him or herself bryce hadnt though he didnt know why not in ultimate emergencies human beings turned back into the animals they were beneath civilizonsolationand intelligence it wasnt quite so bad after the first big boot the plane kept shaking but on a lesser level watch out for that first step bryce thought dazedly its a doozy in fact as the screams eased off it was as quiet as hed ever known it to be inside a plane in flight then he realized why all the engines were out which meant this wasnt an airliner any more it was the worlds most expensive glider the most expensive not the best it was way too heavy to be the best someone had once said the space shuttle glided like an aerodynamic brick the airliner would do better than that how much better bryce didnt know but he was about to find out the hard way this is the captain the man still sounded absurdly calm maybe that was attitude maybe training whatever it was bryce admired it still easily the pilot went on some of you will have noticed our descent is now powerless the turbulent airflow snuffed out our engines we have not been able to get a restart im sorry to tell you that we wont make it to lincoln he paused perhaps he was human after all that means i am going to have to find a place to put this aircraft down the best place weve got is dead ahead a reservoir called branch oak lake i am going to try and pull a sully as he had ive practiced this on the simulator many times now i get to do it for real just like he did another pause all i can do is give it my best shot if you all stay as calm as youre able to itll help i have radioed ahead to lincoln they will help us as quick as they can and so will the folks around the reservoir well be going in in about a minute and a half you folks in the exit rows youll have a job to do listen to the flight attendants good luck to everybody and god bless you all seat cushion may be used for flotation it said on the back of the seat in front of brycesand on all the others at least it didnt say floatation the way it did on some airlines for some idiot reason the idea of going into the drink with a misspelled safety device weirded bryce out he was four rows behind the exit ive got a chance he thoughtif the plane didnt smash itself to smithereens hitting the water if it didnt sink like a chunk of concrete if if if one more thing the captain added from the speakers if anybody goes for anything in the overhead bins clobber the jerk and then step on him this isnt the time to worry about your stuff youve got enough other things to worry about right both bryce and the veteran beside him nodded he looked out the window again here came the lake or reservoir or whatever the hell it was it was mostly quiet in the cabin now people had gone through panic and with luck come out the other side the plane flashed past a bird almost as a car might have on the one more look they were over water closer by the second here we go the captain said take your brace again the airliners belly smacked the smooth surface of branch oak lake the plane skipped like a stone then almost instantly smacked again this time it stayed on the surface the splash made bryces window useless he didnt care at least he hadnt got smashed to strawberry jam right away open the exit doors the boss flight attendant shouted and then passengers remember your flotation devices p anyone near you who is injured one more afterthought reminiscent of recess at elementary school take turns and damned if they didnt a mad rush would have hopelessly clogged the exits but the passengers moved toward them in an orderly hurry bryce paused at the edge of the aisle to let a woman go up ahead of him thank you she said youre welcome bryce answered he supposed thered been scenes of such civility aboard the titanic too the chilly water streaming in through the exit doors made the comparison much too apt but it wasnt even up over his shoetops yet he had no trouble moving against it when he got to the open door a flight attendant and one of the big men from the exit row were standing on the wing helping people come out you all right the attendant asked shit im alive bryce blurted she smiled there you go now off the wing and into the water get as far from the plane as you can he put his arms through the straps on the seat cushion and went into the lake it didnt feel too cold once he got used to it hed been in pools that were worse what it would feel like come february was bound to be a different question but it wasnt february thank god kicking was awkward in his adidases he pulled them off the plane settled behind him as he moved away from it he hoped the captain would get out damned if the guy hadnt pulled a sully if the passengers had anything to say about it he wouldnt be short of drinks or anything else he happened to want for the rest of his days some fun huh the afghan vet bobbed in the water a few feet away ive had rides i liked better bryce replied the other guy laughed the sky looked a million miles away from down here even though bryce had been flying a few minutes before the ugly black cloud rearing over the western horizon had to be the same thing hed seen up there buzzing noises swelled from distant mosquitoes to upclose harleys in a matter of minutes everybody who had a boat by branch oak lake must have put it in the water cornfed cornhuskers started hauling people out of the drink bryce waved to make sure they saw him when a guy in a baseball cap in one of the boats waved back and gave him a thumbsup he knew rescue was only a matter of time the nebraskan picked up the veteran first then putputted over to bryce strong sunburned arms helped him out of the lake and into the bottom of the boat where he lay like a justcaught bluegillexcept he lacked the energy to flop around you okay man his rescuer asked everything in one piece i think so bryce answered after taking stock thank you yeah the afghan vet said thank you amen he sounded as if bryce had reminded him of something important hed been too rattled to remember on his own and that was probably what had happened im gonna see how many more folks we can get aboard the local said and got the boat going again bryce didnt care hed made it so far xi squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles were on i heading north toward portland maine when the boom from the superano roared over their van they werent taken by surprise by then npr was tracking the progress of the enormous sound wave the biggest noise this poor old planet has heard in tens of thousands of years one of their correspondents declared yeahexcept for congress rob ferguson said justin nachman followed a snort with a reproachful look piss and moan piss and moan five minutes ago you were bitching about paying the toll before they let us onto this stretch of the interstate well it sucks rob said its how they pay for keeping the road up justin said as if reasoning with a possibly dangerous lunatic the van chose that moment to bounce on a pothole rob who was driving said they do a great job too we manage okay back home without this tollroad bullshit the lead guitarist rolled his eyes give me a break man how many years in a row is it that the california budgets been fucked up rob didnt know how many consecutive years it had been he did know he couldnt remember a year when the budget hadnt been a disaster area and he could remember further and further back as he got older close to twentyfive years now though he hadnt cared about the budget when he was a little kid twentyfive years seemed a hell of a long time to him hed never had the nerve to say anything like that to his father though he had what he was all too sure was an accurate suspicion the older man would have laughed in his face since he didnt have a good comeback for justin he concentrated on making miles charlie and biff were in the other van right behind this one they were on their own snakes and ladders had dissolved in new york city and they hadnt booked another opening act rob wondered what his bandmates thought of the supervolcano they knew about it everybodyd been talking about it when the band stopped at a roadside hardees for lunch seeing the star on something called hardees weirded rob out every time he came east in his part of the country the chain that served those same burgers went by carls jr well best foods mayonnaise was hellmans back here too bizarre all right he wondered if there was a song in it devastation continues to spread across wide stretches of wyoming idaho and montana the npr newsman continued gravely there are as yet not even the vaguest estimates of lives lost or property damage nor is there any way to stop the spreading ash cloud an astronomer has calculated that the supervolcano eruption might well be observable from the planet mars wow justin said can you imagine the martians going bummer man the earth is screwed bigtime rob could imagine it write that down he said we should be able to do something with it it sure as hell made a better song idea than arterycloggers with the wrong names the band always took write that down seriously stuff that was supposed to stay in peoples heads too often didnt justin produced a notebook and wrote better than even money nothing would come from the jotting but at least it wouldnt get lost they had reservations at a motel not far from the airport rob had spent enough time on the road that he was good at it which didnt mean he got off on it there were times when hed wake up cold sober not wasted on anything but still without the faintesg aea of where the hell he was the feeling didnt always disappear right away either rooms rarely gave a clue cable stations were the same everywhere pretty much if a paper was shoved under the door or waiting outside odds were it would be usa today hotel management types commonly felt it was better than the local rag the sad thing was theyd be right more often than not by the time he got down to breakfast hed usually have things figured outusually but not always he liked playing he liked performing he liked the smallscale celebrity status being in a halfway successful band brought travel he wasnt so sure about travel there were guys older than his father whod play a gig hop in a car and play at another club five hundred miles away the next night some of them had been big once upon a time and were still hanging on some had made a career out of being secondstringers they had their fansnot enough to get rich from but enough to pay the bills most of them most of the time that seemed to be about what squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles had to look forward to do i want to wake up wondering where i am when im fifty rob asked himself that question and another one every time he checked in somewhere the other question was do i want to wake up wondering where i am when im seventy so far he hadnt found anything else he wanted to do more he hadnt found any place where he wanted to grow roots either so tonight here he was in portland maine hed played in the other portland too justin sometimes got sick of life on the road the same way he did as far as rob could tell biff and charlie didnt care where they were for guys in a band that needed to stay on tourand in this age of mps and itunes how many bands didnt that was the right attitude after they checked in justin asked the desk clerk where can we get some dinner around here doesnt have to be fancy just yknow food she named a place adding theyve got the best lobster rolls in portland i think how do we get there rob asked eagerly he was in favor of lobster and shrimp and crab if the rest of the guys werent well the menu was bound to have other stuff on it they could eat directions didnt sound too complicated the band kept talking about getting gps god knew the systems were cheap these days but rob and justin both liked to navigate finding a place on your own made arriving mean something it didnt when a computer held your hand all the way there even getting lost could be interesting rob thought so anyhow charlie and biff thought their bandmates were full of it but theyd never missed a gig because theyd got lost so the rhythm guitarist and drummer didnt grumble much a roll split in half a little mayo even if under an assumed name lobsterlots of lobster a lobster roll a maine specialty the finest invention since the wheel as far as rob was concerned maine was one of the few places where lobster didnt cost an arm and a leg rob was happy to pay a mere arm for such concentrated deliciosity justin had a big bowl of clam chowdercreamy of course with not a tomato in sight tomato chowder was a new york city thing not a new england one the divide was as fierce as yankees and red sox rob actually liked both kinds which made him either a neutral or a heretic depending charlie got a chicken pot pie you could do that anywhere biff ordered the brrito rob didnt think he would have chosen a lobster roll in phoenix a burrito in portland maine struck him as an equally bad idea but it wasnt his stomach sometimes the less you said to the guys you played with the better off you were when they walked out of the restaurant the sun was going down it looked like a sunset the only screwy thing about it as far as rob was concerned was that the atlantic was at his back and the sun was sinking toward land he was conditioned to think of the sun coming up over land and going down in the pacific this felt wrongwrong enough for him to say something about it the other guys were all californians too they nodded hadnt thought about it but youre right biff said i read somewhere that after krakatoa blew up sunsets were spectacular for a couple of years because of all the dust and ash in the air justin said i was kind of hoping for something fancier thanthis he waved across the parking lot at the ordinary red ball going down into the ordinarily reddening western sky give me a break man rob exclaimed it just happened a few hours ago you know yeah yeah justin had the grace to sound sheepish but this thing is a lot bigger than krakatoa too this thing is a lot bigger than well anything i mean it happened in fucking wyoming and we heard it here instant gratification thats all you want dude rob wanted to bite his tongue damned if he didnt sound like his father if you played in a band and your old man was a cop what did that say about you nothing good for sure hey who doesnt want gratification charlie said well pick up some girls after we play there you go justin and biff said the same thing at the same time in the same enthusiastic tone rob didnt but it wasnt as if he hated the idea it wasnt as if he didnt do it himself either what was the point of even fairly small celebrity after all if you didnt take advantage of it why this is hell nor am i out of it vanessa remembered that was a line from a play but not which one or whod written it things she was interested in she rememberedand shed hit you over the head with the details too what she didnt care about was as one with nineveh and tyre which was also a line from something or other from what who cared if she ever needed to find out for some reason she couldnt imagine now she could always bing it if she got the chance she could denver was also becoming as one with nineveh and tyre shed never dreamt it could happen so fast ash started raining down on the cityjesus christ ash started raining down on the whole goddamn statethe day after the supervolcano went off vanessa got up that morning intending to go back to amalgamated humanoids there hadnt been any earthquakes big enough to wake her up during the night she had power again her digital alarm clock buzzed her at a quarter past six as shed set it to do when the electricity came on again so volcano or no volcano everything should have been pretty much back to normal well almost everything pickles remained one freakedout kitty and who could blame him cats and cataclysms didnt mix well she soon discovered she didnt mix so well with cataclysms either when she opened the blinds after she got dressed everything was grayish brown the walkway outside the apartment the stairs the grass in the courtyard the air everything she could barely see across the courtyard to the apartments on the other sidethere was that much crap in the air the breeze made it drift and billow now thinner now thicker fuck vanessa said which exactly summed up how she felt shed looked forward to watching snow fall in denver it was something shed never seen before she was an la kid all right what was out there now seemed like a filthy parody of the genuine article somebody across the courtyard opened his door and headed for his car he took about three steps before he started coughing and frantically rubbing his eyes at the same time his shoes kicked up ghostly clouds of dust and ash he turned around and went right back into his place as fast as he could how much volcanic ash did he bring in with him enough to keep him coughing and rubbing for the next week vanessa wouldnt have been surprised she was glad shed seen him otherwise she would have charged out there herself all of a sudden that didnt look like such a great idea instead after coffee and some oatmeal she went back into the bedroom and turned on the tv shed already given pickles his usual morning kitty treats now he jumped up beside her on the bed and meowed for more the world had broken routine shed broken routinewhy shouldnt he she fed him if food made him happy or at least happier fine then she opened up the bedroom blinds the blackandwhite fairyactually the shades of grayish brown fairyhad touched that side of the building too dust drifted the vacant lot next door the house on the far side of the house was painted a pink hotter than vanessa would have used for anything but lipstick you sure couldnt prove it now a couple of cars chugged by on the street their lights speared through the dust as if it were fog they kicked up enormous plumy wakes of ash as they went one of them stopped before it got to the corner the driver popped the hood and got out then like the fellow in the apartment across from vanessas the gal got in again and slammed the door only dimly visible her hazard lights came on this sucks bigtime vanessa said pickles meowed again if that wasnt agreement shed never heard it from the cat she turned on the tv a talking head on cnn was going on about the climatic implications of the eruption that wasnt what vanessa needed to hear if you were somewhere else somewhere far away you could afford to talk about such things vanessa wanted to know what to do about the mess she was in the middle of she grabbed the remote again and fired an infrared beam at the set cnn gave way to local news it was news for morons but the other local morning news shows were news for imbeciles if not good this was better it wasnt the usual morning crew but the gang whod done the eleven oclock news the night before they were in the same clothes they looked tired one of them sipped from a styrofoam cup if youre wondering where jud and mariska and meteorologist mark are they were advised not to come in today she said setting the cup down everyone in the denver area is advised not to travel todayor for the foreseeable futureunless its absolutely necessary this is an emergency the likes of which weve never known newsies usually laid things on with a trowel to say nothing of a shovel vanessa began to think that they werent exaggering this time looking out the bedroom window again she wondered if anybody could exaggerate this the advice the night newswoman gave was simple dont go outside if you have to go outside for gods sake dont breathe that was fine for the moment what happened when you ran out of food though if you had a choice between filling your lungs with crud and going hungry which should you pick if it wasnt dont know whether to shit or go blind what would be ash continues to fall the wearylooking blonde said brushing back a lock of hair that had come loose in spite of spray news for morons sure as hell some geologists believe it may get three feet deep all over the denver metropolitan area before it lets up roof collapses are probable especially in case of rain urk vanessa said a dismayed noise shed got from her old man she hadnt thought of that how much would a layer of volcanic ash three feet deep on a roof weigh how much would it weigh after absorbing as much rainwater as it could hold how much weight would a roof be designed to take some sure because roofs here had to hold up against snow but that much every time she heard a creak overhead she was gonna freak out she could see that coming like a rash you werent supposed to go outside into the ash theyd made that abundantly clear but what if the ash decided to come to you instead it was a good question vanessa wished she or somebody could come up with a good answer after commercialsthis didnt seem to be an urgent enough emergency to dispense with selling the producta newsman whose boyish charm had worn thin by this hour said no one is sure yet whether mandatory evacuation of denver and the surrounding areas will become necessary the governor who was in lamar at the time of the eruption has ordered out the national guard to assist in protecting colorado lives and property a newcomer to the state vanessa didnt know where the hell lamar was a road atlas showed her out in the southeast in cow country near the kansas border the governor was one lucky stiff that put him a couple of hundred miles farther away from the eruption things might not be so bad out there since the nighttime sports guy was still in the studio he came on the air the end of the rockies season and the early part of the broncos season had gone on indefinite hold vanessa despised baseball and football impartially the only thing she wondered was which wasted more time then the wornlooking newsman came back and said snowplows are doing their best to keep the interstates open south and east of the city to facilitate evacuation in the event that the authorities decide to implement it no one knows how long the big machines air filters can continue to protect them from the grit in the air by the same token no one knows how long the volcanic ash will keep on raining down from the sky either he added something he might not have been reading off his teleprompter right now nobody seems to know much of anything folks vanessa loathed facilitate and implement almost as much as she hated impact they were stupid and pretentious people used them to sound important and knowledgeable and ended up sounding like pompous assholes instead but if i and i were open at least partway shouldnt she get the hell out while the getting was possible even if not exactly good if they were already thinking about evacuation denver was really and truly screwed in the way of bureaucrats the authorities were nerving themselves before doing what they plainly needed to do she looked out the window again that car was still stuck there with others easing around it and kicking up more dust and ash as they went how long would her own elderly corolla last wouldnt she be worse off if she got stuck somewhere in the middle of nowherewhich to her defined all of colorado outside denverthan if she sat tight not necessarily if the plows couldnt keep the highways open how long would the town still have food how would anybody bring it in what would happen ifno whenthe waterworks stopped working or when the roofs started buckling and people discovered they couldnt breath indoors either she was a cops kid spinning out disaster scenarios came easy so did knowing that most people would sit tight till it was too late then start running around like chickens that had just met the chopper that was what most people did shed seen it for herself she didnt need to remember her fathers scorn for the common run of civilian and since that was what the common run of civilian did it behooved her not to do likewise her mind made up she threw some clothes and pills and tampons and a couple of books into an overnight bag she added bottles of water granola bars and anything else edible she could grab that wouldnt go bad right away she also threw in kibbles and treats for the cat if she slung the bag over her shoulder and carried the cat carrier in one hand shed be able to keep the other one free and she needed that pickles hated going into his carrier any old time he knew going outside meant troublethe vet and other notorious cattorturers and he particularly hated it when he was all jumpy anyhow he scratched her but good before she finally stuffed him in there youd better be worth it you stupid fuzzhead she snapped before she sprayed the wounds with bactine that little bottle went into the overnight too then she soaked a towel in the kitchen sink and draped it over the cat carrier she soaked another one for herself are you sure you want to do this she said aloud in a voice whose calm surprised her as a matter of fact she wasnt remotely sure damned if you do damned if you dont was another old phrase that fit much too well she might be worse off bailing out she might be worse off staying the swirling graybrown grit outside warned that she might be in over her head no matter what she did you could die out there or right here that was what it boiled down to vanessa had always been the kind who did something when she had a choice between that and sitting tight she wouldnt have given bryce the heaveho if she werent she wouldnt have followed hagop to denver either yeah and look how well that turned out her mind jeered la wouldnt be catching it like this but she wasnt in la she had to do what looked best where she was fuck she said one more time and lugged her chattels to the apartment door pickles yowled mournfully shut up she suggested he yowled some more ignoring him she shouldered the overnight bag and draped her own wet towel over her eyes and nose and mouth it didnt want to stay so she secured it with a rubber band the next little while would have to be in braille she opened the door got the cat carrier out and closed it behind her she groped till she grabbed the iron railing that would take her to the stairs and followed it till she found them left turn eminded herself sixteen stairs down to the courtyard right take em slow you cant watch what youre doing at what she thought was the bottom she felt around with her foot concrete sure enoughconcrete with a bunch of new grit on top the stucco wall that led to the parking garage would be over to the right to her vast relief her hand brushed rough plaster okay she knew where she was again anyone who could see her was probably laughing his ass off too damn bad anyone who could see her was inside an apartment which meant the sorry son of a bitch had his own problems she patted the wall every step or two to guide herself along she didnt want the stucco ripping up her fingers especially after the number the cat had done on the back of her hand she patted againand felt nothing ha found it she exclaimed in triumph here was the opening for the stairway down to her car some more groping got her to the rail attached to the stairway wall down she went how many stairs till she got to the bottom sixteen from her place to the courtyard but how many going below she couldnt remember she guessed it would be sixteen again and slammed her foot against flat concrete flooring hard when that proved one too many taking a stair that wasnt there was almost as bad as missing one that was but she didnt fall after a couple of steps away from the stairwell she adjusted the rubber band and let the towel drop away from her eyes though not from her nose and mouth she had to see to get to her car and she had to see to drive things werent so bad here as they were up top the air was still dusty and there was grit with footprints going through it on top of the smooth concrete it wasnt already hideously thick though the way it was in the courtyard she chucked her bag into the car then stuck pickles on the passenger seat she draped a blanket on the overnight bag so nobody peering in could see it was there at another time she would have stashed it in the trunk not today the less she got in and out the better she was just glad the tank was almost full as soon as she started the motor she turned on the lights you wouldnt normally need them during the day in denver but what did normally mean now nada that was what she backed out of her space goodbye god im going someplace she said kansas new mexico some place where things like this didnt happen like the frogs in cannery row she didnt have to open the window to use a card to open the gate a beam sensed the car coming up the gate slid back was it her imagination or did the thing sound creakier squeakier than usual what was all that volcanic grit doing to its mechanism how long would it keep working that wasnt her worry as long as the thing had opened this time vanessa drove slowly and carefully a good thing too somebodyd already rearended the car that crapped out down the street from her building she skirted the fenderbender and went on when she tried the radio all she got was static she pulled out her phone no bars she swore what the hell was going on tv back at the place had worked sure it had it was cable but how many zillions of tons of crud were fouling the air right now how much of that crud was tiny bits of iron some small fraction no doubt but a small fraction of a zillion was still a jillion plenty to jam radio and phone signals vanessa cussed some more she hadnt figured on that she hadnt figured on any of this who hado could have except for a handful of crazy geologists only theyd turned out not to be so crazy after all hadnt they traffic lights were still working but you couldnt see them till you got right on top of themif then she drove around more dead cars and around a couple of more accidents too one of them looked bad an suv had broadsided a car at an intersection maybe the driver hadnt seen the light till too late here was mississippi avenue she turned left ever so warily buckingham square shopping center was only a couple of blocks east not far past it she could get on the and it would take her down to i or up to i whatever her little heart desired her little heart desired to be back in la the wouldnt give her that not directly but it would get her started kelly birnbaum was fourhundredodd miles from the centerpiece of her academic career shed passed her doctoral orals not least by explaining in great detail what might happen if the yellowstone supervolcano ever went off looking back on that terrifying morning in the geology department conference room shed done pretty goddamn well only one trouble left she couldnt get any closer to see for herself just how smart shed been ash had dusted missoula but only dusted it the coating here was thicker than the ash from a bad brushfire would have been in california but not a whole lot thicker missoula lay almost straight upwind from the eruption both surface winds and the jet stream blew stuff away from here and missoula got dusted anyway you could go fifty miles down the interstate if you had a superduper air filter on your car if you had a vehicle with a superduper air filter and caterpillar treads you might make a hundred miles from missoula if you were real lucky you could get to butte farther than that no way jose wasnt gonna happen the ash was too thick the wind had already started blowing it into drifts that were thicker yet i was buried deeper than alas poor yorick had been before they started playing catch with his skull planes and helicopters were even more fugheddaboutit than cars if your cars air filter clogged past survivability you were stuck yeah but at least you were stuck on the ground if your aircrafts filter died so did you it was a long way down she was still living at daniels apartment along with ruth and larry daniel had got a cot so he wouldnt spend all his nights on the floor in a sleeping bag hed offered the cot to larry but the older man actually liked the couch kelly and ruth shared the bed the onebedroom place was crowded the geologists got on one anothers nerves nobody complained too much though they all knew things could have been worse refugees packed missoula everyone whod managed to escape from places farther east seemed to have stopped right here no apartments or hotel rooms were to be had for love or money people whod never met till they got here found themselves living together as intimately as the geologists were plenty of people were sleeping in their cars or in tentsand living like that in missoula as fall replaced summer and warned of winter ahead was not for the fainthearted kelly would have been glad to get out her own small berkeley apartment took on the aura of the earthly paradise in her memory but no flights came into or went out of missoula international they were near the edge of the nofly zone but they were in itthe air was too foul she couldnt afford a car even a ontrip beater prices had skyrocketed because so many people wanted to get away not even trains were coming into town she was stuck she did what she could with her cell phone and with daniels computer hed created new user accounts for her and ruth and larry they took turns on the machine and tried not to hog it but walking away from the apartment and talking on the phone where no one else could hear her was the biggest pleasure she got most days if shed had her druthers she would have talked colins ear off but he was still working and had his own worries if you had to be somewhere when the supervolcano erupted la wasnt the worst place something within shouting distance of normal life still went on there not that a cops socalled normal life was anything to write home about even so it had to beat missoula theres nothing fresh in the stores kelly complained no fruit no salad fixings no vegetableswell a few potatoes across the miles and the wireless link colin chuckled youre right next door to idaho remember spud paradise right i guess kelly said next to no fresh meat either and no fish at all most of what were getting is canned goods stuff that keeps it makes sense you know colin said that doesnt mean ive got to like it she answered nope prices are way up here theres talk about doing something to stop profiteers colin said whats it like there about the samethrough the roof kelly told him people bitch like you wouldnt believe who says i wouldnt okay maybe you would they wouldnt complain so much if they could get what they wanted there isnt even much fresh bread here noodles and rice and flour take up less space and last longer so thats what they ship in what do you do with flour if you dont have much in the way of anything to bake it with colin asked people in missoula were starting to ask the same question only louder kelly had an answer though not one shed offered the locals matzos what else huh in multicultural los angeles colin would know about matzos he clinched it by saying will that get you converts or a bunch of raving antisemites he took kelly by surpriseso much so that she laughed out loud she laughed loud enough in fact to make an unshaven guy in a sweatshirt and ratty jeans give her a funny look despite his shabby appearance he might have been anything from a wino to a bank president missoula was a funky place these days kelly didnt care what he was as long as he didnt bother her i love you colin she said well i love you too babe he answered they didnt throw the word around like a frisbee he was chary about using it at all considering how hed been burned kelly had never blamed him for that she wished she heard it more though it warmed her every time she did stuck in missoula montana in autumn she needed all the warming she could get and this was only the beginning the very beginning of the beginning in fact colin added i sure wish you were here and not there jesu sooner i hope let me see what i can do from this end colin said ive been working on a couple of things but they havent panned out yet ill keep trying didnt want to say anything about it cause i cant promise all i can do is try same as you okay kelly said how many strings could a socal police lieutenant pull in montana or maybe idaho what kind of connections did colin have to make him think he could pull any at all had he say spent ten years working alongside somebody who was now a county sheriff up here or chief of police in some little town near the state line kelly realized she had no idea it didnt seem impossible or even unlikely but she couldnt have proved it one way or the other there was a lot she didnt know about this man whose company she longed for she could have asked him but what good would it have done either hed finagle something or he wouldnt or maybe the trains or buses would start up again or shed be able to find a ride heading west or something she said her goodbyes and went back to daniels apartment it had a tv and it had books she was interested in reading stacked up against the rest of missoula that made it seem like heaven on earth even if this particular version of heaven was on the crowded side daniel was out when she got there probably at the university they were trying to get the fall semester going though the odds seemed poor she envied daniel his place here he fit in it made a difference larry and ruth were there though and greeted her with long faces what now kelly asked wondering if she really wanted to know the gas is out ruth answered i was going to heat up some cornedbeef hashmore stuff in cansbut the stove doesnt work nothings coming through the burnersyoud smell it if it was kelly found the next reasonable question have you called the gas company yet no the gas is really out as in there is no gas in missoula any more larry said the big pipeline that brings it into town comes from the east through montana i dont know how much ash and rock the supervolcano put down on top of it but enough to finally squash it or break it looks like thats not so good kelly said the other geologists nodded no gas for stoves no gas for heating water no gas for heating houses that was about as not so good as it got missoula was a place where you needed to be able to heat houses did you ever and the weather wouldnt get better on account of the yellowstone eruption oh no i was thinking what happens if the electricity goes next ruth said there was a cheery notion welcome back to the nineteenth century thats what kelly said only the twentyfirstcentury world wasnt ready to fall back more than a hundred years not even close unfortunately the supervolcano didnt care whether the twentyfirstcentury world was ready ready or not here it came xii it was a quiet saturday afternoon in ellwood there were times when marshall ferguson didnt appreciate his dad for getting him anpartment here rather than in isla vista which was right next to the uc santa barbara campus but his old man the cop had learned of isla vistas many bars and of couchburning and other quaint native rituals so marshall was out in the boonies instead nothing exciting had happened in ellwood since that japanese submarine shelled the place but living here wasnt so bad marshall didnt mind riding his bike to school or hopping on the bus on the rare days when the weather was bad he had a carof course but campus parking cost two arms and a leg he could get anything he needed at the big shopping center on hollister just a few blocks away and it wasnt as if ellwood had no bars it just didnt have quite so many it was still a student town but a quieter student town for quieter students no not so bad it wasnt as if marshall never drank oh nonot even close like his father was a teetotaler as if like his mother had never got up on a sunday morning making a beeline for the excedrin yeah right but he wasnt smashed on this ellwood saturday afternoon he could have been the quarter was still new nothing needed turning in monday morning so yeah he could have been but he wasnt he was stoned instead the apartment faced west so he could sprawl on the ratty but unburnt couch in his front room and watch the sun go down through the venetian blinds halfopen slats sprawled next to him was a little darkhaired girl named jenny they werent touching right now sooner or later he expected they would no hurry though no hurry at all not hurrying he passed her the pipe thanks she said he liked the way her lips closed on the stem as she inhaled the apartment was already fragrant with smoke it got a little more so she gave the pipe back he took another hit himself it was all good the dope the company the halfdark room the sun slowly sliding down between the slats thanks to the dope it seemed to slide slower than usual wow marshall said jenny giggledif that wasnt the stoner cliche what was even wasted marshall was embarrassed but he pointed out through the blinds and defiantly said wow again this time he amplified it thats quite a sunset you know santa barbara sunsets like a lot of santa barbara life often spoiled you and made you feel every other place in the world was tacky and not worth living in clouds and soft moist pacific air painted the sky in red and orange and gold could nightfall in say omaha come close not a chance this one was outdoing itself even by santa barbara standards marshall blamed the good weed hed got from a grad student in the creativewriting program it made him feel pretty goddamn creative himself though he would have been too languid to write even without a little darkhaired girl within arms reach but seriously would he have seen all those wild colors if he werent baked reds and maroons and tangerines and carmines and lemons and lavenders and magentas and fuchsias and how many others the crayola people had never heard of he didnt think so this is good dope he said seriously it is jenny agreed she held out her hand marshalls fingers brushed hers when he gave her the pipe they both smiled they had time when youre young and wasted time stretches like taffy she sucked in more smoke after a while she blew it out she admired days decline for a while then she said its not j the dope huh marshall said its not just the dope jenny repeated its the volcano thing in yellowstone too its like put a lot of stuff in the air sunsets all over will be special for a while oh marshall nodded cool he seemed to remember that big volcanoes did that the one theyd made the old movie about he tried to come up with the name it was on the tip of his tongue but chasing it down seemed like more trouble than it was worth a lot of things seemed like more trouble than they were worth a lot of things but not all he slid the palm of his hand along the warm smooth skin on the inside of jennys forearm it felt something like velvet something like electricity some of that was normal healthy horniness some of it was the dope too girls were wonderful any old time they got wonderfuler after a few bowls hey what didnt and he was sure the volcano had nothing to do with it jenny made a noise down deep in her throat that sounded more like a cats purr than human noises had any business doing her eyes sparkled dope definitely made it better for people of the female persuasion too she slid toward him they kissed for a while on the couch then they went into the bedroom marshalls bed was narrow for two but that just meant they had to press together tighter the amazing sunset played itself out in the frontroom wall forgotten the gig at bar harbor turned out to be a mistake the club crowd there didnt get squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles and it worked both ways new england seaside vacation towns seemed different from their pacific equivalents rob ferguson tried to figure out what made these people tick it wasnt easy some of the crowd were leftover summer people not all of them went back to boston and new york city right after labor day some stuck around and kept partying till what till their money ran out not likelythey werent the kind whose money ever seemed likely to run out till the cows came home was the way it looked to rob the rest were maine townies summer people and townies it reminded him of eloi and morlocks in the time machine and why not wells had been talking about the class system in victorian england the class system remained alive and well on the east coast of the modern usa for the summer people the band was just background noise the townies saw amplified instruments and expectedhell demandedstraightahead raucous rock neither was what squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles was all about you needed to pay attention to the band and it wasnt about headbanging or about ears that stayed stunned three days after the show a good time was had by few afterwards justin put the best face on things he could maybe bangor will be better or orono rob said oronos got a university of maine campus our kind of people will be listening to us stoned freaks and geeks you mean biff thorvald said rob made as if to bow to the rhythm guitarist but there wasnt room in the cramped dressing room precisely he said you know what the real trouble is as justin often did he answered his own question the real trouble is there arent enough stoned freaks and geeks running around loose to supt us in the style wed like to get accustomed to if you mean we aint gonna get rich like miley cyrus and justin bieber why dont you come out and say so charlie storer demanded we aint gonna get rich like miley cyrus and justin bieber justin said obligingly we dont have some corporate dickhead telling us what to do next either rob said of course not we know what to do next go on to the next town charlie said play there then head for the one after that rob remembered his own uneasy thoughts of not too long ago did he like doing this enough to keep at it the rest of his life could he make a living at it if he did if he didnt what would he do instead they got to stay in bar harbor with most of the summer people gone prices dropped like a stone the desk clerk at their motel said weve had a secretary of labor stay in one of your rooms not after labor day you didnt rob answered she gave him a dirty look but didnt try to tell him he was wrong afterwards he was sorry hed pissed her off hed seen plenty worse as usual afterwards was too late summer weather seemed to have gone home with the summer people the sun came up in blooddrenched splendor from the atlantic tinting the stacked clouds every shade of red and purple and red and pink and orange imaginable sunsets had been just as spectacular since the supervolcano let go when tv pundits werent bemoaning everything else about the disasterdeaths were well up into six figures and damage estimates heading toward the trillionsthey talked learnedly about particulate matter eyeing the sunrise justin put it a different way my grandfather went to sea in freighters for a few years when he was about the age we are now he always used to say red in the nightsailors delight red in the morning sailors take warning a bunch of nervous sailors out there then rob predicted i wouldnt be surprised justin shivered in the parking lot brr thats one nasty wind yeah well welcome to maine rob said but nervous sailors wouldnt have surprised him either he wished hed put on something heavier than an old ucsb sweatshirt the wind seemed to have taken a running start from baffin island how soon does it start snowing here justin asked sure as hell other cloud fortresses these more ominous gray and less pretty pink were stacking up to the north and west id say tomorrow or maybe this afternoon rob answered weve got chains for the vans right uhhuh justin said without enthusiasm they werent practiced at putting them on they werent practiced at driving in snow and ice either they were california kids what did they need to know about that kind of stuff trying to cheer up the lead guitaristor somethingrob said bangor and orono are north of here right fuck you justin explained he pointed to the diner across the street theyd had dinner there the night before it was okay cmon lets go feed our faces you dont want to wait for charlie and biff nah let em sleep if they want o theyll eat sooner or later and bangors not that far north from here justin used the word with more irony than rob had even if we leave later than usual well make our next date breakfast was pretty good you never could tell with local places they were like the little girl with the little curl with dennys you always knew what you were gettingwhich was both the good and the bad news this proved a step even a step and a half up from that the potatoes that went into the hash browns were fresh not frozen and not too greasy the same with the sausage which had a hint of somethingfennel you didnt taste every day and the overmedium eggs came to the table hot and exactly over medium biff and charlie ambled in when rob and justin were getting close to done biff ordered coffee you never do that dude rob said unless you got some meth i hafta get my heart started some kinda way the rhythm guitarist answered rob shook his head crank was not his drug of choice neither charlie nor justin volunteered any biff spread his hands see he said when the coffee came he poured in lots of cream and sugar so it wouldnt taste like coffee any more then he gulped it the sugar rush would help wire him for the morning too the waitress brought rob and justin more toast to give them something to nibble on while their buddies chowed down rob smeared strawberry jam on his it came in the same little foiltopped plastic package you saw everywhere oh well as he ate he stared out the tinted window and across the street at the motor lodge theyd just come from after a while he said is it the glass or is the light funny its the light charlie said i noticed it when i was coming over here did you biff huh biff said rob didnt need to be hercule poirot to figure out that biff hadnt noticed much of anything till he surrounded his coffee they paid for breakfast and walked out a guy about their age coming down the street on a bike stopped and said hey i was at your show last night i dont know about anybody else but i liked it thanksi think rob said not enough people had the guy gave a vague wave and pedaled off the light is funny justin was looking at the sun no clouds were close by or in front of it but he looked at it anyway rob could do the same thing the sun was uncommonly weak uncommonly white as if seen through fog but there was no fog you could see for miles without channeling the who rob turned and looked at his shadow he had one but not the kind he should have had on a sunny day they all started across the street not much traffic in bar harbor not after the end of the season is this like maine weather or volcano weather charlie wondered volcano weather rob heard something peculiar in his own voice something he didnt think hed ever found there before a sad certainty a doctor might have had that tone after seeing a chest xray with a dark spot on the lung all of a sudden particulate matter wasnt just a pompous phrase to rob there wasnt any fog down here no but way the hell up there that was liable to beno that was bound to bea different story how much crud had the supervolcano flung into the stratosphere how much sunlight was it blocking how bad would that screw up the weather and for how long he shivered the old gaucho sweatshirt felt even thinner and rattier than it had when he pulled it on he wanted something warmer an anklelength polarbear coat maybe or a goosedown sleeping bag with sleeves charlie hopped up onto the curb boy you sounded like a judge passing sentence there he said you totally did man justin agreed even biff nodded that wasnt quite how rob had thought of it but wasnt so far removed either out of the bluethe pale blue the almost icy bluejustin asked you ever hear anything from your sister the one who moved to denver no rob said tightly cell phones are down for god knows how far ive been hoping she could get to a landline or send me an email or something but no justin set a hand on his shoulder for a second thats hard man nothing i can do about it i keep telling myself theres more to vanessa than youd think she can get out of there if anybody can rob wished he hadnt added the last three words they helped remind him how enormous the catastrophe was denver was hundreds of miles from yellowstone but denver was also not far from the middle of the area the eruption had screwed blued and tattooed the tv said volcanic ash was coming down in alberta in texas in iowa even in california he didnt want to think about that so he turned to biff and charlie and asked are we ready to rock he knew he and justin were theyd cleaned out their room down to the last dirty sock charlie nodded didnt leave the drums behind honest that made biff snort it would be easier to forget an elephant than charlies kit even if the elephant would be harder to disassemble lets go then justin said they piled into the suvs under that pale unnatural sunlight they started up the road toward bangor pretty soon all the sunshine disappeared rob turned on his headlights it started to rain by the time they got where they were going the rain had turned to snow maine weather or volcano weather what difference did that make it was here and they were stuck in it the first thing colin ferguson did after sitting up in bed was check his cell for voice mail and texts from kelly or vanessa nothing this morning from either one of themnothing at all from vanessa since the eruption had anything in his own bailiwick gone wrong the folks at the cop shop would have called on the landline and woken him up after he took a leak he went downstairs to fix coffee he didnt have to go in today unless something hit the fan if kelly werent stuck in missoula but she was dammit so instead of enjoying himself with good company hed try to catch up on some aroundthehouse stuff his navytrained soul was dismayed by how much he just let slide its not like i dont work he thought defensively but his internalized cpo knew bullshit every time he always looked out the window while he waited for his water to boil this morning he looked and then he looked a double take harpo marx would have been proud of even with onandoff water rationing he kept his lawn green he was proud of it the same way he was proud of his wellorganized filing system only the lawn and the flowers werent green any more they were about the color of cement dust so were the leaves on the orange tree and the lemon ts prouand the magnolia so was the cinderblock wall which had been pink so was just about everything in the backyard the supervolcano had come to la the microwave chimed he absently took out the water and poured it into the brown plastic cone that held the melitta filterthe coffeenose the kids had called it when they were little a cat also grayer than it should have been he recognized the critter which lived down the block left almostgreen footprints on the grass it didnt like what was going on it would take a few steps stop and wash walk on a few more steps then wash some more how much grit was it swallowing what would that do to its insides nothing good colin was sure rationing rules said he wasnt supposed to water the lawn on saturday hed spent most of his life enforcing rules now he broke one he ducked under the sink to fiddle with the sprinkler controls nozzles popped up and started spraying the cat levitated then teleported the lawn turned green againexcept for patches still streaked with ugly brown sludge thoughtfully colin put on slippers before he went out to get the times and the breeze he didnt want to walk barefoot through that crud not even slightly he didnt it scrunched under his crepe soles and came up in little puffs the front lawn was gray almost the same color as the sidewalk the street which should have been asphaltdark was doing a sidewalk impression too one slightly spoiled by a few tire tracks his car was gray all the cars he could see were graywindows mirrors the whole deal all but one right across the street wes jones was breaking some more rules by hosing his nissan back to its original blue wes was a retired aerospace engineer who spent most of his time gardening like everybody else hed be playing catchup for a while colin waved to him some fun isnt it he called and grabbed the papers they were both wrapped in poly bags as if against rain volcanic ash slid off the plastic fun oh you bet wes pointed east even the suns gone nutso anything he disapproved of was nutso but wes didnt disapprove of much he was an easygoing guy huh colin hadnt paid any attention to the sun past noticing that the daylight looked wan and washed out now he did it sat low in the sky still red as if closer to its rising than it really was a hellacious halo surrounded it with a pair of sundogsfalse images of the sunon the halo hed seen a sundog once while in a destroyer off the coast of greenland with a sky full of ice crystals the sky above san atanasio had a different kind of junk in it he delivered his verdict holy crap yeah thats about what i was thinking wes replied anything from vanessa hed watched her grow up hed been an honorary uncle nope colin left it right there wes grunted well ill tell ida she needs to pray harder he was at least as skeptical as colin but his wife went to a methodist church every sunday and did good works during the week she didnt try to ram it down anybodys throat even her husbands she just did what she did theyd had their fortieth anniversary the year before colin remembered no more than a handful of cross words between them now he said it cant hurt i expect youre right and i expect im going back in the house wes scuffed at the ash on his driveway some of it was wet but some came up the way it had underolins slippers breathing this crap has to be hazardous to your healthto my health even wouldnt be surprised colin said which only gave him more reason to worry about his crossgrained daughter like missoula the la area was getting only a light dusting of volcanic ash but the shit was practically burying places like salt lake city and denver you could foul up your lungs inhaling sawdust at a furniture factory what the supervolcano spat out was bound to be a hell of a lot nastier than sawdust if vanessa had listened to himshe wouldnt have been vanessa he hadnt wanted to listen to anybody when he was her age either come to that he was none too good at listening to other people even now but what wes said made good sense things wes said usually did and colin had that coffee waiting for him back on the kitchen counter it wouldnt be too cold yet wes was already making for his own front door colin followed his lead he paused at the doorway and left the slippers outside the less ash he tracked in the better his bare feet left gray prints on the dark brown foyer tiles hed kicked dust up into the slippers well and some paper towels would take care of that coffee first coffee and the newspapers a notice on the front page of the breeze said we will keep printing as long as we can our paper supplier is in minnesota the supervolcano eruption has disrupted communication with areas to the east even when things come closer to normal we fear paper will have a lower priority than food and fuel but at least temporarily we may be compelled to go to webonly publication harder to have a cup of coffee and check your computer or your smart phone not impossible but harder and what happened if la lost power so much for webonly publication that was what the times didnt talk about a paper shortage maybe it got its newsprint from the northwest which was still reachable or maybe the editor didnt believe in borrowing trouble the headline there said senators from afflicted states appeal for federal aid afflicted colin slowly nodded as he considered the word it was one you seldom met outside the bible but no denying it fit here if the children of israel had ever met anything as overwhelming as the supervolcano eruption the old testament failed to mention it he did wonder what washington was supposed to do for wyoming and montana where the very geography had been pretty drastically revised how many feet of dust lay on idaho and utah and colorado and nebraska and kansas not just here and there in those states but all over everything or as near as made no difference how many bulldozers and trucks and years would you need to clear hundreds of thousands of square miles more than even the usa had in its back pocket he was sure of that colin also noticed the irony in the times headline las leading newspaper had leaned left for longer than hed been alive after an even lengthier spell of leaning hard right had the headline writer chosen his phrase with malice aforethought colin wouldnt have been surprised those senators appealed for federal aid did they before the supervolcano went blam they would have found federal aid about as appealing as hiv it all depended on whose ox was being gored didnt it almost all the senatorsand representativesfrom the afflicted states were republicans that didnt stop them from sticking their hands out if washington couldnt help them nobody could tlin it looked very much as if nobody could which raised other interesting questions was anybody at all left alive in wyoming western montana was hanging on but barely idaho and utah were in pretty bad shape too so was colorado though maybe not quite to the same degree the farming states farther east had also taken a big hit almost all those states were red as rudolphs nose if they got depopulated what would that do to american politics nothing good not as far as colin was concerned he grabbed the daily breeze again yes that was what hed read paper will have a lower priority than food and fuel what food he wondered out loud americas breadbasket had just taken one right in the breadbasket how could you bring in or move the harvest when volcanic ash smothered the fields and blanketed the roads and choked the life out of tractors and harvesters and trucks to say nothing of farmers one more thing that wasnt gonna happen the united states had been the worlds larder since the nineteenth century that was out the window too how was the usa going to feed its own people let alone the many many hungry beyond its borders who wouldwho couldtake up the slack anybody if no one did what would happen then colin couldnt see the details but the broad outlines seemed plain enough nothing good would happenthat was what how much of the countrys grain was stored in areas suddenly ungetatable on account of the eruption how many cows and sheep and pigs and chickens were dying right now hed read a newspaper squib about a yak farm in the colorado rockies was anybody saving the poor goddamn yaks yeah the country was screwed the part of the world that depended on the usa was screwed too and so was everybody else he was still only on his first cup of coffee he hadnt even started worrying about climate change yet he got up and put some more water in the microwave if he was going to do that hed definitely need more the knock on the door was loud and somehow officialsounding as if the guy doing the knocking had a hell of a lot of practice daniel had gone to the university which left kelly and ruth and larry sitting around his apartment waiting for something to happen well now something had larry went to the door he was the man that wasnt exactly twentyfirstcentury thinking but neither kelly nor ruth made a move to get there ahead of him kelly didnt even think about it till afterwards when larry opened the door standing there in front of it was the most coplooking cop kellyd ever seen yes hed know how to knock on doors all right shoulders chin khaki shirt with badge pistol on hip olivedrab pants sharply creased shiny black boots gunnery sergeants hat mirrored sunglasses even yes larry said in a tone that couldnt mean anything but youve got to have the wrong apartment but the cop rumbled is miss birnbaum here thats me kelly squeaked in surprise about the most nefarious thing shed done was smoke dope every once in a while and she hadnt even done that since shed started dating colin he made no bones about hating it it was still mildly illegal and she didnt get off on it that much anyhow quitting hadnt been hard miss birnbaum im roy schurz the cop said im chief of police in orofino idaho yes kelly said blanklyief ofand so and so i used to be a cop down in san atanasio california schurz answered colin fergusons a buddy of mine he asked me to see what i could do about getting you out of here are you ready to go colin had said he might be able to pull some strings he must have meant it colin kelly had discovered commonly meant what he said that was so far out of the ordinary she was still getting used to it am i ready she echoed yes maam chief schurz said ive got a humvee with a desert air filter parked out front its what i came here in in case you think i bounced in on a pogo stick or something the mirrored shades kept his face from showing how big a jerk he thought she was let me grab my purse kelly said all at once she believed it wasnt as if she had much more than that here she hugged ruth and larry tell daniel thanks a couple of million for me we will ruth marquez sounded wistful or more likely jealous kelly followed roy schurz out to the humvee it was a humvee too not a hummer a military vehicle painted in faded desert camo it mounted the biggest machine gun kelly had ever imagined a soldier sat behind the gun national guard schurz explained i borrowed the vehicleand edwards therefrom them colin he thinks youre something special he didnt say hell with me if i can see why but it was in his voice i think hes something special too kelly managed good when him and louise broke up he was mighty well broke up about it now hes more like his old self again schurz gestured hop on in it was a tall hop the humvee had humongous tires kelly climbed aboard the seat was severely functional chief schurz got in on the drivers side the engine might boast a desert filter but it sounded raspy anyway of course it probably had that filter because it had seen action in iraq or afghanistan it wasnt new or close to new it was a regular army castoff good enough for the idaho national guard chances were it had sounded raspy for years roy schurz put it in gear it rode as if it had left its shocks near kandahar that was for sure do we really need a gunner kelly had to shout to make herself heard well you never can tell schurz shouted back the humvee kicked up its share of dust and then some he pulled a surgicalstyle mask out of his shirt pocket and put it on with one hand the smokey bear hat went into his lap for a second no more he extracted another mask and offered it to kelly your own air filter thanks she put it on when she turned around to look at the machine gunneredwardsshe discovered hed also donned one the less volcanic crap you put in your lungs the better a lot could kill you pretty fast even a little wasnt good news twenty thirty fifty years from now she expected mesothelioma cases to shoot through the roof not much of what the supervolcano belched into the air was asbestos fibers but when you were talking about several hundred cubic miles of material thered be plenty to go around a missoula policeman with a shotgun stood guard at the edge of town he was also wearing a mask he waved to the humvee as it got on us heading southorofino evidently wasnt on the interstate chief schurz gravely waved back well you never can tell schurz repeated with the mask and shades his face was almost completely unreadable but the way he fidgeted in the hard uncomfortable bucket seat told kelly he realized he needed to say more people are starting to run low on all kinds of stuff theyre putting armed escorts on food and fuel convoys we havent had a lot of trouble yet and nobody wants it to start yknow i guess kelly said how many folks couldnt get to a safeway or a mobil station so easily these days how many couldnt get their hands on ground chuck or gasoline even when they did how many of those folks had guns in this part of the country quite a few and what would they do when they got hungry or otherwise desperate if you had to take what you needed or starve who wouldnt think about turning robber ive got some jerrycans of gas in the vehicle here chief schurz went on as if she hadnt spoken thats one of the reasons i brought edwards along nothing like a soldier on a caliber to keep people honest god you sound like colin kelly blurted all at once missing him more than ever now that she was actually heading toward him not stuck in missoula the orofino would that be fine gold in spanish police chief chuckled wouldnt be surprised if we rubbed off on each other some you ride in the same patrol car a few years thatll happen almost like being married only without benefits not knowing what to say to that kelly didnt say anything they climbed toward the hills which were covered with a light coating of ash a little too dark and a little too brown to look like dirty snow most of the clouds in the sky were just clouds it was a gloomy chilly lowering day her heart soared like a skylark anyhow she was out out out of missoula hardly anybody shared the road with the humvee she didnt know how many people used us on an average day but this had to be way down from that just across the idaho line schurz pulled onto the shoulder some grass showed through the ash here they were right at the western edge of the throw line is the uh humvee okay kelly asked as okay as it ever is he replied gotta throw in some fuel it can do more than a jeep can but christ its a gas hog he and the silent edwards emptied two camopainted jerrycans into the vehicle then he got behind the wheel again fired up the machine and drove on towards orofino xiii things in kansas were better than they had been in colorado vanessa was convinced of it even though she breathed through three masks worn one on top of the next and kept swimmingpool goggles on even when she slept her eyes itched all the time anyhow she hadnt got the goggles soon enough she couldnt take them off to rub or use visine or anything the air was still too full of fine dust pickles was even less happy than she was he couldnt wear a mask or goggles poor thing she didnt know what to do about him she couldnt keep him in the carrier all the time but she couldnt let him out either she still had nasty scratches from when shed extracted him from under the toyotas front seat she had to get someplace where hed be able to move around moreand where she would too widthemshe carried a snubnosed revolver in her purse her father had taught her how to handle firearms when she was twelve shed never used what shed learned she always worried more about a moment of rage or stupidity or black depression than about blowing away a burglar but the times they were achangin shed got the gun in pueblo another hundred miles and a little bit away from the supervolcano it hadnt been hit as hard as denver she stopped for gas and a fresh air filter she paid ten bucks a gallon plus another fifty for the filter and she didnt say boo she could count the cost later now was a time for doing what she had to do the guy who took her money was already wearing goggles where did you get those she demanded enviously he pointed across the street walgreens is still open she could barely see the sign through swirls of dust but she stopped there as soon as he finished with her car he used a mask too and had probably also got his hands on it at the drugstore volcanic ash came in every time the automatic door opened and would keep coming in as long as it kept working still like the air inside her car the air inside the walgreens improved on the general run of things there was a display of goggles with bright plastic straps only three boxes of masks were left one box to a customer maam the clerk said when vanessa tried to buy them all we want to spread em around as much as we can she could see the logic in that even if she didnt like it unlike the man at the gas station the walgreens clerk didnt gouge her for what she bought how long will you stay here she asked him as she put on the goggles i dont know a while longer ill see if it looks like its getting worse or better he answered it wont get better vanessa spoke with great conviction well you may be right he replied which had to mean i aint paying any attention to you lady she put on one of the masks before she went outside again too either it made a difference or her imagination was working overtime that was when she noticed the gun shop between the walgreens and a tropicalfish store the fish place was dark but a light burned in the gun shop out in the middle ofthishaving a real weapon looked like a terrific idea she went inside the man behind the counter looked like a shop teacher he was leafing throughsurprise a hunting magazine but he put it down what can i do for you he said i made it down from denver vanessa answered i want to keep going in case my car doesnt i may need to take some chances a pistol could come in handy he nodded if you know how to use one my dads a cop in california then you probably do he allowed youll have to fill out about five pounds of forms as long as theres no waiting period vanessa said im not going to wait not in this state he assured her i do have to perform a background check though right now the phones are out and so is the net he rubbed his chin turn around please huh mystified vanessa did i liked your foreground the man explained your background will definitely do too ill sell to you and well sort everything else out laterif there is a later thank you vanessa said more sincerely than she was in the habit of doing she handed him her visa card here he took it but he didnt do anything with it for a few seconds was he going to ask her for a blowjob too or something if he did shed she didnt quite know what shed do in normal times she would have told him to go fuck himself in normal times though she wouldnt have been standing here in a pueblo colorado gun shop she needed a piece if he decided he needed one too but it didnt come to that he just said you want to be careful on the road ms uhhe looked down at the little plastic rectangle in his handferguson a pistol can get you out of some tight spots sure maybe youd do better not getting into them in the first place though she shook her head if i hadnt bailed out of denver when i did i wouldve been stuck there if you dont get out of here pretty damn quick you wont be able to leave either im still thinking about it he said vanessa left it there she was a refugee not a missionary he went on youll want to buy a couple boxes of cartridges too am i right thats why god made plastic vanessa agreed as soon as she got back to the car she loaded the it was a doubleaction model you could safely carry a round in every chamber in the cylinder and she did she felt better having it she might have faced a nasty choice in the gun shop out on the road there were bound to be sons of bitches who didnt believe in giving any choices if she got back on the interstate shed end up in new mexico if she chose us instead shed cross the colorado prairie till she got to the kansas prairie kansas held no appeal sometimes though you didnt get what you wanted she hadnt been off i very long but when she went back cars were coming off at the onramp that couldnt possibly be a good sign and it wasnt a cop in a pigsnouted gas maskwhich had to work better than goggles and a surgical jobwaved what looked like an orange light saber he yelled something at vanessa she couldnt make out what it was reluctantly she cracked the window ash started coming in interstates closed the cop said his voice sounding distant almost underwater through the mask big old accident south of town worst mess youve ever seen i swear to god vanessa doubted that shed seen la messes after all but then she had second thoughts all the blowing dust might have done to i what tule fog did in californias central valleyit could turn i into slaughterhouse five and did just about every winter twenty or fifty or eighty cars and suvs and trucks all turned to crumpled sheet metal some of them burning with dazed and bleeding people wandering around coughing from the ash every now and then a fresh tinny crash as a new fool didnt spot the wreck up ahead soon enough maybe ill go east instead she said thinking and to hell with horace greeley good plan the cop said in that otherworldly voice if theres wrecks on they arent close to pueblo which meant they ound tt his problem but which also meant she could put some more miles between her and the supervolcano by interstate standards us was old and shabby it was also open though so vanessa did her best to make lemonade she might not be able to go as fast as she wanted to but at least she was going she tried to ignore pickles yowls which was like trying to ignore a toothache a lot of cars were crapped out by the side of the road she blessed the new air filter shed got in pueblo every so often shed come up on a car that had crapped out in the middle of the road a couple of times she almost rearended one was that how the giant pileup on i had started she wouldnt have been a bit surprised she was a little more than an hoursay thirtyfive milesout of pueblo when it started to rain when the first big drops splatted down on her windshield she let out a war whoop of delight rain would wash the ash out of the air if she could see where she was going shed get there faster but the rain didnt wash all the grit out of the airthere was too much of it in the air for that and when she turned on the wipers they did as much harm as good they pushed grit back and forth across the windshield she could hear it almost feel it scraping first one way then the other and it was rock grit some of it at least as hard as the glass it was grinding across arced scratches spread across the broad pane that wasnt smeared dirt the way she hoped for a moment the windshield was marked for good vanessa swore as loudly as shed whooped startling the cat into momentary silence there was so much ash and dust on the highway that she soon began to feel she was trying to drive through mud that was exactly what she was doing too she had to slow down even more instead of speeding up the way she wanted to a lordly cadillac escalade zoomed past her its giant tires splattered the side of her carand her side windowswith muck then the supersized suv cut in front of her she had to hit the brakes to keep from smashing into it or more likely going under it more gritty mud splashed her windshield the wipers did their best to shove it aside their best abraded the glass some more you dumb fucking asshole she howled and flipped the escalade the bird the imbecile behind the battleships wheel probably couldnt see her do it what with her filthy scarred front glass but she was most sincere then she remembered the brandnew in her handbag shed never understood roadrage shootings before theyd always seemed the province of gangbangers with shaved heads and teardrop tats now she got it somebody did you wrong so you went and made that sucker pay she imagined the escalade slewing crazily off the road flipping overwerent all those stinking suvs topheavy as hell and bursting into flame she imagined the jerk driving it toasting till he was overdone along with mrs jerk and all the little jerks in their car seats and she let out a long shuddering breath and made damn sure she didnt reach inside the purse a moment of fury would be all it took all right you couldntwell you shouldntgive in to something like that but people did all the time her old man wouldnt go out of business any time soon thinking of him made her stick one hand in her purse after all the only thing she took out was her cell phone maybe with the rain scrubbing the dust out of the air shed finally have bars no such luck she tried his number anyway again no luck nthing coming in nothing going out she turned off the phone and stowed it on she went slowly with the road the way it was and with her poor abused windshield the way it was slowly was the only way to go most of the people heading toward kansas had sense enough to see things the same way the jerk in the escalade was no doubt still doing ninety he was long gone in front of her even if she hadnt shot him she wished him no good every once in a while somebody listened when you made a wish like that less than fifteen minutes later she drove past the escalade it was over on the shoulder with the hood popped mr jerkwho proved what he was by not bothering with a maskstared forlornly at the engine if he was waiting for aaa to come rescue him hed have a long wait vanessa not only knew the feeling of schadenfreude she knew the word knowing the word sharpened the feeling if only sex worked that way the escalade shrank in her rearview mirror and vanished into rain and dust then she had to hit the brakes and crawl someone hadnt slowed down enough or had skidded in the new mud on the asphalt the crash hadnt closed us not yet anyhowbut it sure had snarled traffic if a jalopy in the backup decided this was a good time to overheat why are you borrowing trouble vanessa asked herself dont you have enough already in a way those were questions without answers in another they were questions that hardly needed answers she borrowed trouble because she was the kind of person who borrowed trouble if she wanted to she could blame that on her tightassed father or on being the middle child or on mrs mckenzie her neurotic make that nutso she thought remembering wes across the street from her folksfirstgrade teacher none of which changed things one goddamn bit she borrowed trouble this time she got to pay it back pretty soon no steam plume ascended to the heavens from some old clunkers radiator she inched along with everybody else but she kept on inching the accident involved four cars nobody seemed badly hurt men wearing wet clothes and glum expressions stalked around examining damage more gunk flew onto her windshield when the car ahead of her sped up as it found open road in front of it resignedly she waited for the wipers to clear the smear and to scratch up the glass some more the only way she could have prevented that would have been to stay in denver this might be a bad bet but that was a worse onethough poor pickles would have disagreed she found more things to worry about how much cash did she have left after that outrageous gas stop and air filter would it be enough to do her any good when she needed to fill up again if it wasnt would the station guy take plastic or could she find a working atm odds were decent she supposed if a gas pump was working an atm ought to be for now with the needle well above the h she kept making miles making miles these days came with a price though or at least it did in a big part of the country very much including the part she was in by the time she got over the state line into kansas her car was starting to sound like hell even with the new air filter how much volcanic crud was getting in despite the filter jesus how much had got in when she took off the gas cap to fill the tank in pueblo what was all that shit doing to her engine what was all the grit on the road doing to the rest of her moving parts how long would they keep on moving long enough she had to hope so in spite of the way the car snded she smiled for a second she must have been about ten years old when rob a couple of years older opened some atlas or other to a map of the usa theyre gonna build a college right here hed said pointing to the border between the state shed just left and the one shed just entered she remembered going yeah so big brothers were obnoxious enough even if you didnt let them get the jump on you when you did they turned insufferable she might not have known that word when she was ten but she sure had understood the idea and she remembered his leer he was just learning how to do it which of course meant he overdid it so theyre gonna call it the first united coloradokansas university hed answered only for short itll be vanessa had understood the idea of acronyms too even if she might not have known that word yet either fuck u shed shrilled and laughed so loud and in such delighted horror that their mother had come into her room to see what the hell was going on theyd both solemnly denied everything of course with no more than an open atlas for evidence mom hadnt been able to pin a crime on them even then you might have guessed rob would end up playing in a band called squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles vanessa didnt much care for the music though she had to admit some of the lyrics were clever she had no idea where the band was right nowsomewhere back east if she remembered straight if she did the odds rob was okay were good the odds on herself or on pickles or on the toyota red lights on the dashboard warned service engine soon the car was running hot even though the eastbound us heading away from the rockies tended downhill if it crapped out how far could she coast till the next hill anyhow and those were few and far between around here she drove through coolidge just over the border almost before she realized it was there if the place had ever had a hundred people she would have been amazed how many were still here and how many had lit out when the supervolcano erupted shed never know us paralleled the arkansas river the rain had washed some of the ash off the trees that grew alongside the river so they looked a little more like their old selves the river by contrast looked muddy and full and angry even though it wasnt raining all that hard for a little while vanessa wondered why then the old metaphorical lightbulb went on above her head the rain was washing volcanic ash off the trees sure and off the grass and off the ground generally and it was washing that ash straight into the river where else could the stuff go how long till the arkansas started flooding the missouri was a lot closer to the eruption which could only mean even more ash would be going into it so it would start flooding sooner if it hadnt started already the other rivers flowing from the rockies toward the mississippi would do the same thing they would also wash the volcanic ash toward and then into the father of waters what would happen when the big muddy turned into the big muddier and then into the big muddiest vanessa didnt know in detail but this was one of those times when the big picture did fine the big picture was lots of muddy water spreading out over lots and lots of land her motor coughed she forgot about the big picture somebody might have dropped an ice cube down the back of her shirt a human being who sounded like that would have been dying of emphysema the enine was dying too a mechanic wouldnt call it emphysema but it amounted to the same thing here came syracuse a roadside sign proudly proclaimed you could get gas there it also said you could get food chances were you could get gas from the food too even if the sign didnt tell you that go stop did she want to get stuck in the middle of nowhere if the car quit between towns wasnt this already the middle of nowhere was she better off with other people or as far away from them as she could get she kept going whether that made her an optimist or a pessimist was one more thing shed think about when she had time if she ever did which looked less and less likely after syracuse signs announced that the next town ahead was garden city by the way they announced it garden city might actually be something it had hotels and motels and fastfood joints and meatpacking plants some of the signs for those were in both english and spanish shed seen the like in la and denver of course spanish was the language in which a lot of hard work got done in the usa but in a place like garden city kansas evidently it turned out not to matter to vanessa the engine coughed again this time it sounded more like cheynestokes breathing than emphysema and like somebody with cheynestokes breathing her car died all the red and yellow warning lights came on as shed figured she would she rolled as far as she could then she steered over to the shoulder and stopped as soon as the motion ceased pickles quit sounding like an airraid siren relishing the silence vanessa spoke out loud well what do i do now her basic choices were sitting tight or getting out and walking toward garden city if she sat tight she was counting on somebody halfway decent rescuing her before she had to start walking to garden city if she got out shed feel like a snail without its shell and she and picklesespecially pickleswould be breathing the outside air that had just killed her car in a tv show theyd go to commercials when they came back shed find the right answer with the greatest of ease or theyd cut away to her somewhere else and shed explain to an admiring friend how shed got there unfortunately you couldnt cut away from life she had no idea what the right answer was or even if there was one she hadnt come this far by sitting tight though she got pickles and an abridged version of her stuffiron rations tampons a few socks and panties and an umbrellaand started walking she was glad for the umbrella right away the rain was so mixed with ash that everything it touched got dirtier that included her jeans from the knees down but she couldnt do anything about it she couldnt do anything about anything except hope her feet didnt blister before she got to garden city she almost slipped in the mud a car going by splashed a little on her if that went on shed look like someone made of muck by the time she got to the town another car sloshed past and splashed her some more she kept walking colin ferguson begrudged the time he wasted doing the i boogie from la to the bay area even with all the security bullshit flying would have been faster but ash in the air kept planes on the ground if you wanted to get anywhere you drove he hoped the taurus would make it driving was a crapshoot these days too california hadnt been buried r ash from the supervolcano the way the rocky mountain states and much of the prairie had been ash lay on the ground though and the ash in the air wouldnt screw up airplane engines alone it wasnt good for cars either hed made it over the grapevine anyhow that long tough climb getting out of la county had worried him but here he was easing down the other side hed thought about taking highway up to berkeley there was supposed to be less ash along the coast but while the pacific coast highway was breathtakingly beautiful it was also slow and wearing you couldnt just haul ass on pch you had to drive hed taken a chance for speed hed got away with it and now he had his reward i ran straight as a string through the central valley it was the short way north and it was the straight way north as long as you didnt fall asleep at the wheel you pointed the car and you went mountains off to either side fields lying next to the unwinding road occasional towns the landscape didnt change but the odometer did at one point the atmosphere changed and not for the better near kettleman city which wasnt one they collected cattle to ship them to market you breathed concentrated essence of bullshit for a few minutes as you went by then the air cleared again and you were relieved you couldnt smell what had relieved the cows any more except the air didnt completely clear oh the stink went away but a dust haze remained it was worst near the interstate where tires and the wind of many cars passage kept stirring up what the supervolcano had spewed all those miles away sunlight still seemed wan that wasnt only the ash in the lower atmosphere it was also the finergauge crapthe particulate matterthe eruption had blasted into the stratosphere sunsets kept on being improbably gorgeous showing every color of the rainbow sometimes the hues were splattered together in jackson pollock randomness sometimes stacked as neatly as the layers in a poussecafe they were never the same from one day to the next hell they were never the same from one minute to the next that ancient greek who said you could never step into the same river twice knew what he was talking about you could hardly step into the same river once it was chilly colin told himself that didnt necessarily mean anything fall didnt come to california the way it did to most other places it could be hot or cold or hot and then cold the only trees that changed colors were a few sycamores and they didnt get around to it till thanksgiving so chilly weather now didnt have to mean the supervolcano was doing what kelly had warned all along it would do it didnt have to mean that no but it sure was likely to colin beat the darkness up to berkeley that was good he knew the bay area well enough to sortakinda find his way around but only sortakinda trying it at night would have been harder he made it to kellys street and damned if he didnt find a parking space no more than two lengths away from where hed snagged one the last time he drove up it wasnt much longer than the taurus but it didnt need to be there were plenty of things he couldnt do by god he could parallel park her building had added a security door since the last time he was here nodding in approval he pressed her apartment numberon the keypad and buzzed that you colin kellys voice came out of the cheap speaker as if it were a tincan telephone connected by a string that wasnt taut enough who else were you expecting he had to ask twice the first time he forgot to press the answer button you might have been the thai takeout she replied after he did it right the doors lock clicked he opened it made sure it closed behind him and hurried up the stairs like somebody half his age if that wasnt love it sure as hell was a reasonable facsimile kelly opened the door while he was still walking towards it he wished hed thought to buy flowers he wished he were the kind of guy who thought to buy flowers before it was too goddamn late of course if he were that kind of guy he might well still be married to louise he was what he was he was where he was too and damn glad of it he grabbed kelly and clung to her as hard as she was clinging to him he wasnt usually touchyfeely eitherthe opposite in factbut holding her was like finding a life ring in the north atlantic after a torpedo hit your freighter jesus its good to see you he said hoarsely by way of reply she tilted her face up for a kiss before he could deliver it the buzzer in her apartment went off again she made a face sorry wait one she said and ran back inside this time it was the thai food the short skinny man who carried up the two big white paper bags had brown skin and a flat face which probably made him a thai by his english he hadnt been here long colin paid him kelly squawked he ignored her she was still squawking when they went back into the apartment the dinette table was strewn with books and journals and papers but kelly shoved them back to make enough space for two people to eat colin set the bags down on the woodgrain formica then he held out his arms and said where were we when we were so rudely interrupted you mean kelly stepped into the circle that closed around her right about here a few minutes later they spooned squid salad and larb and other good things onto paper plates one of the bags also held two thai iced teas sweetened with coconut milk in styrofoam cups colin slathered bright red chili sauce from little plastic containers onto everything but his iced tea id have to eat flame retardant if i did that said kelly who stuck to seasoning with soy sauce i like it colin answered and proceeded to prove as much by making his share disappear as he took seconds he said lord im glad to see you i told you that once already didnt i uhhuh but its okay i like to hear it im glad to see you too kellys expression darkened im glad to see anybody i was like three hundred miles from the supervolcano when it went off almost everybody who wasoh god i dont knowsay fifty miles closer is probably dead right now a circle five hundred miles across colin centered it on yellowstone and laid it over a mental map of the united states salt lake city wouldnt be far from the edge denver lay outside but not far enough outside to suit him still nothing from vanessa he said his voice harsh im sorry kelly answered still too early to know if it means anything though the whole middle of the country is fubard he stabbed a blunt accusing forefinger at her thats what you get for hanging around with an old navy guy why what ever can you mean sir she batted her eyelashes fit to make scarlett ohara gag it stands for fouled up beyond all recognition right or something like that yeah or something like that colin aimed the forefinger again but nobody your age says fubard its what you get for hanging around with an old navy guy like i said stuff rubs off suppose you let me worry about that kelly said and a cpo couldnt have put more bite into it she snapped the lids back onto the containers they hadnt emptied and stuck them in the fridge forks clattered in the sink she nodded to herself the rest can wait the trash colin knew he sounded disapproving being an old navy guy helped make him felix not oscar but kelly nodded again yeah the trash for her part she sounded defiant you keep telling me youre glad to see me how are you gonna show me after the long drive up and a belly full of thai food colin hoped he could show her hed seen that occasional bedroom failures bothered middleaged men more than their women but he was a middleaged man dammit and he especially didnt want to fail now he didnt for a man its always terrific kelly didnt seem to have any complaints she rolled over and made as if to go to sleep hey im the one whos supposed to do that colin protested what with the drive and the big dinner and the exertions just past he wasnt far from it she sat up he put an arm around her she leaned against him everything works here she said in wondering tones we had power in missoula but the gas went out landlines were iffy so was the net my cell was iffier i know i wish i couldve talked to you more colin said kelly nodded but kept following her own train of thought everything works i called for thai takeout and half an hour later it showed up theres no problem with food here not yet and were on the coast so itll keep coming in by ship the weather here wont get too bad californias lucky i dont know whatll happen to missoula once winter settles in she bit her lip no i do know i just dont want to think about it theres a difference maybe things wont be so bad colin said i was wondering about that on the way up hereright after i went past kettleman city matter of fact timing kelly held her nose colin laughed so did she but she quickly sobered it will be that bad it may be worse this was a big eruption even by supervolcano standards just aboutmaybe not quite but just aboutthe size of the one over two million years ago or the one that turned mount toba into lake toba so were in it for real were in it for real kelly agreed bigtime the ash has already taken out most of this years crops in the midwest and maybe next years too after that after that itll get cold its already getting coldnot so much heat from the sun can make it through the atmosphere things here seem fine now but the whole world is running on momentum when it slows down all we can do is all we can do colin said well pick up as many of the pieces as were able to and well try and keep em from getting any more broken than they already are how come the politicians dont have that kind of sense kelly asked im a cop picking up pieces is what i do he answered they sling bull i get it slung at me nobody asks cops what we ought to do about this that or even the other thing and when somebody does ask he mostly doesnt pay any attention to what he hears nobody paid any attention to the geologists either kelly said i mean im nothing but a grad student but there are people in my racket with clout nobody in washington wanted to listen to them though then they didnt have enough clout colin said i guess not kelly laughed a singularly humorless laugh you want to know what else most of my research is obsolete how do you figure that youre an expert on the yellowstone supervolcano whats more important right now im an expert on what it did the three times it erupted before this one im an expert on what that might have meant im an expert on the complicated geology that used to be under yellowstone and on the geysers and hot springs and stuff well the geysers are gone so is a lot of the geology that made them possible and now the supervolcano has gone off and everybody can see what it means and we dont need to worry about another eruption like this one for the next halfmillion years if that doesnt spell obsolete what does youre here colin said too many people arent a circle five hundred miles across like i told you a minute ago all you can do is all you can do nobody can do anything its too big kelly said gotta keep trying anyway colin wished he could make love with her again back in the day he would have managed a second round but that was then this was now he had to comfort her with words and words werent such terrific tools for the job xiv another motel room in maine but till you opened the curtainsand sometimes afterwardsit could just as easily have been in montana or oregon or arkansas the road was simply the road once youd been on it for a while by now squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles were veteran road warriors justin sat at the desk doing email on his macbook rob sprawled on the bed channelsurfing with the remote hbo was showing a prizefight the movie on showtime sucked the standup guy on comedy central had only one thing wrong with him he wasnt funny in a popculture course at ucsb rob had heard that people were calling tv a vast wasteland a generation before he was born it hadnt got better since only vaster he checked the laminated guide on the nightstand on this system msnbc was channel the president and grand ayatollah of iran stood side by side in a mosque in qom the president was a skinny swarthy little guy with black hair and a closecropped graying beard he wore a dark westernstyle jacket a dark shirt and no tie omitting the tie was the only place where robwho wore them at weddings funerals and gunpointsympathized with him in turban flowing robes and even more flowing beard the grand ayatollah looked like a man from another century as the camera moved in for a closeup of the two of them though you saw his heavylidded clever eyes the president was doing the talking the president in fact was pounding his fist into the palm of his other hand to make his point the grand ayatollah didnt keep an arm behind the presidents back or anything but you could make a pretty fair guess about which was the ventriloquist and which the dummy not that the crowd inside the mosque cared they cheered the presidents impassioned farsi with passion of their own to rob and to percent of other noniranian americans farsi was just guttural noise a translator who spoke almost unaccented american english spread the word to the wider world we have said for many years that the united states is the great satan now god is punishing the usa for its wicked war against islam and for its poisonous support of the zionist entity it is a great punishment and a punishment greatly deserved more applause from the crowd the grand ayatollah nodded in approval rob got the idea that he might have smiled if he hadnt had his smile muscles surgically cut to make sure he couldnt if only the americans mired in ignorance and disbelief had had the wisdom to embrace the teachings of the glorious prophet muhammad peace be unto him the president went on hey justin you listening to this bullshit rob asked now that you mention it answered the bands front man no guys been channeling pat robertson rob said and summarized the presidents remarks nice to see we dont have the loony market covered justin observed there you go rob said you know were screwed when the iranians can laugh at us when north korea starts its all hope abandon ye who enter here yeah thatd be something wouldnt it justin was about to say something more when his cell phone rang he put it to his ear hello speaking yes were looking for gigs right now the volcanos thrown everything for a loop in greenwood you say green ville sorry were from the other side of the country remember where exactly is greenville at the south end of moosehead lake okay when would you want us to play there and what are you offering they were in orono now theyd played several shows on and near the university of maine campus here rob grabbed a rand mcnally road atlas you couldnt get much more mainesounding than moosehead lake could you but greenville was just a little dot on the map he checked its populationa bit over greenville junction right next door added another or so given that the band was and intended to be caviar to the general where would they find a crowd rob circled greenville and greenville junction in the atlas then wrote people total next to them he showed justin the rand mcnally justin nodded he held out his free hand for robs pen when he got it he wrote a number with a dollar sign in front of it it wasnt an enormous number but it could have been worse theyd done what they could do around orono and bangor money coming in instead of going out would be nice well want cash up front when we get thereassuming we can get there justin said like i told you were from california ive never seen as much snow as this in my whole life before rob t just kept coming down and coming down and coming down it came down early enough and often enough to bemuse the locals and if you werent used to snow in maine you had to be one of the lovedandhated summer people hed heard people arguing about whether theyd ever seen so much snow so early in the season some said yes and said it was just one of those things the naysayers were inclined to blame it on the supervolcano no matter what caused it it was real even people whod been driving in snow since theyd got behind the wheel were having trouble snow plows had already started coming out so had rock salt and grit to try to keep roads passable and so had anguished howls from every agency that deployed snow plows and rock salt and grit doing so much so early they wailed would wreck their carefully crafted budgets justin wrote a date beside the proposed fee saturday after next ten days away he put a question mark by it rob nodded without great enthusiasm the lead time would let the people in greenville promote the showassuming they tried assuming anyone paid attention well mr walters well all give it our best shot and well see how it turns out justin said thanks for calling so long he highfived rob a gig uhhuh rob still wasnt thrilled biffll love leaving orono that nicole hes found how many girls have all of us left behind justin countered it goes with what we do i know rob nodded but sooner or later you meet a girl who counts more than the band even lennon met yoko that goes with what we do too justin said i dont think nicoles the one like that for biff if she is well its not like nobody on this side of the country ever played rhythm guitar mpf rob wouldnt give that more than a grunt squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles was what it was because of all four people who made it up the band wouldnt be the same without biff would it if they could get along without him could they also do without a bass player who wrote some of their quirkier songs rob really didnt care to contemplate that it was too much like contemplating your own death after your best friend got killed in a car crash instead of contemplating it he looked at the practical side of things thats still a week and a half from now you said in the meantime how do we make some money come in for a change instead of going out good question justin said if this were the s we could set up a free concert in a recordstore parking lot theyd sell their albums wed sell oursfor cash tooand everybodyd be happy buthe sadly spread his handswhere you gonna find a record store these days thats a good question too i wish i had a good answer for you rob said which is a more endangered species record stores or secondhand bookstores all of the above justin suggested people get most of their music online nowadays especially the people who listen to us rob said our bottom line would be better off if they didnt fuckin tell me about it justin said and when they want used books they hit alibris or abebooks or even good old amazon so we dont play in a recordstore parking lot or in a bookstore lot either rob said sadly we ought to play somewhere though you can still move cds if you sign em when people buyem not in orono not in bangor either weve done all the business we can do around here justin had a keen sense for how much of squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles any given area could supportor stand if you looked at it that way maybe rob believed the lead guitarist had that keen sense because he thought the same thing about these parts we already played bar harbor he mused aloud we dont want to go back there and there isnt much if we head north there isnt anything if we head north justin said with relentless precision you end up in canada and not the part of canada with lots of peoplethe part of canada with lots of moose how do you tell that from maine rob asked they were going to play by moosehead lake which on the map really did look like a mooses head and theyd already seen one of the big critters lumbering across a road deserted by everything except the moose and their wheels but justin knew what was what you head north from here you end up in quebec he explained in quebec the moosemooses meese speak french there you go rob clapped his hands i never wouldve figured that out on my own i knew i was good for something justin said not without pride also not without pride rob answered not me im good for nothing if you dont believe me ask my father hey at least your dad knows what rock is and probably likes some of it justin said my grandfather is like ninetyfour hes still got his marbles but hes so old hes on the other side of the line he was grown up when rock n roll started and its just kids noise to him like my dad with hiphop rob said yeah just like that justin agreed if you decide it isnt for you the first few times you hear it youll never get it so where can we play between now and greenville rob asked reaching for the road atlas once more some place where we havent been and where therell be enough people who havent heard us yet and might want to is there any place like that left in maine justin asked and if there is can we get there and get back through the snow boy you ask a lot of questions rob said come have a looksee what you think they both bent low to study the small print that showed town names bryce miller gravitated to university campuses the way bees went for flowers in lincoln nebraska the university dominated the town in a way ucla couldnt begin to in los angeles too many other things went on in la without the university of nebraska though lincoln hardly had any reason to exist not only that bryce had met a few of nebraskas classicists and their grad students at conferences they were the only people in the whole state he knew even slightly he hadnt expected to end up here with only the clothes on his back that hed ended up anywhere at all alive and in one piece was something close to a miracleand a testimony to the endless training pilots put in getting ready for emergencies they might er see in their whole career the red cross had put him and the other passengers from the plane minus a few whod ended up in the hospitalbut everybodyd got out alive in a motel commandeered for the purpose colin ferguson hadnt had many kind things to say about his stay in one a couple of years before now bryce knew why the place made getting away feel all the more urgent getting away though wasnt so easy volcanic ash started falling on lincoln three days after the supervolcano erupted the sky went gray and hazy the sun disappeared it might have been fog it might have been a sandstorm it seemed to combine the worst features of both red cross workers handed out surgical masks they were already wearing them some of them wore goggles too they didnt distribute those bryces guess was that they didnt have enough to go around he took the bus to campus a grad student with the fine classical first name of marcus his last name was wilson which was justthere asked him want to see something interesting like what bryce returned lets go over to the museum marcus said okay bryce was game it would have airconditioning it would keep out the worst of the dust he did wonder what marcus reckoned interesting maybe the museum had a good collection of classical coins or greek pottery or something like that if it did they werent on display on display were the bones of a bunch of extinct elephantoid creatures the la county museum of natural history had some too but not so many a placard declared that this museum boasted the finest collection of proboscidean fossils in the world but they werent what marcus wanted to show bryce marcus took him over to a much smaller display of fossilized rhinos from something called the ashfall state historical park wheres that bryce asked northwest of here marcus pointed to a map on the wall above the display case with the bones near a little town called orchard the text will tell you more about it the text told bryce that the dead rhinos were almost years old theyd been buried by volcanic ash at what had been a pond many more of them remained in situ at the state park along with the other critters that had been entombed by the ash at the same time that ash proved to come from a supervolcano eruption in idaho though that wasnt established till a generation after the fossils first got found this same geological hot spot the informative text went on is today responsible for the exotic geological features of yellowstone national park maybe the hot spot had been responsible for yellowstone yesterday today it was responsible for screwing up half the countryor the whole planet depending on how you looked at things bryce went on reading many of the bones on display here the text told him show the overgrowth typical of maries disease or hypertrophic pulmonary osteodystrophy being a classics major let him translate the greek and latin medical jargon into ordinary english bad bone overgrowth that had to do with the lungs sure as hell the plaque continued maries disease is caused by slow suffocation in this case it was brought on by inhaling volcanic ash and dust the rhinos and other animals probably came to this pond or waterhole to soothe themselves in the cool mud since a high er is another symptom of the illness the ashfall that killed them also entombed them and preserved them extremely well hey marcus bryce jerked a thumb at the plaque check this out the other grad student read it he grimaced thats exciting he said aint it just bryce used the bad grammar on purpose remind me not to inhale as long as im here sounds like a plan marcus eyed the text again how many cows and sheep are dying like that right now how many fossils will they dig up ten or twelve million years from now i dont know about the second part bryce said the answer to the first part is all the sheep and cowsand pigs dont forget about pigsout there minus three oh and the chickens too we dont want to leave the chickens out marcus agreed gravely but what are we going to eat once theyre all dead well the dust doesnt cover the whole country some of the livestock will live bryce said uhhuh what will it eat though the corn and the wheat and the rye wont get uh maries disease but they wont grow with a couple of feet of ash dumped on them either this is nebraska remember tv shows about farming draw fat ratings here they run commercials for tractors and things most of the country between the rockies and the mississippi is the same way wipe all that off the map and whats left on the menu crow bryce answered marcus gave him a funny look but then nodded and bryce found a question of his own how many people are going to come down with hypertrophic pulmonary osteodystrophy he delivered the polysyllables with a certain somber relish i dont know and if anybody else does they arent talking marcus said its liable to be everyone from here all the way to vegas who hasnt got a dust mask how many million people was that if they were all doomed no wonder no one was talking about it not even cnn headline news would want to lead with a story that went okay middle america bend over and kiss your ass goodbye bryce dared hope not anyhow which might have been the triumph of optimism over experience then he remembered that vanessa was living in denver he hadnt really thought about her since his plane ditched in branch oak lake how many people in denver were coming down with maries disease right this minute wasnt it easier to wonder how many werent he must have made some kind of noise as all that went through his head because marcus asked what did you say nothing bryce answered but it hadnt been nothing or marcus wouldnt have noticed awkwardly bryce explained i was just thinking about my ex she moved to denver a little while ago oh the other grad student digested that then he delivered his verdict bummer man talk about timing yeah no kidding bryce said ex marcus said exwife we werent married we were living together and then we werent bryce spread his hands you know how it goes well it went uhhuh marcus nodded bryce thought he might be gay but marcus didnt make a big deal out of it if he was after a few seconds pause he asked you still have feelings for her im going with somebody else whos a lot easier to get along with for a moment bryce thought that was a responsive answer when he realized it wasnt he sighed and said yeah ive still got some i sure as shit dont wish maries disease on her or anything like that he sighed again im not nearly certain it works both ways though so she told you to hit the road not the other way round this time marcus didnt make it a question oh well good luck to her and all that but you cant do anything about it i know but now bryce also knew hed have to keep reminding himself of that everything that had gone on had driven vanessa out of his thoughts ever since the shock wave hit his plane now she was back dammit like a chunk of gristle wedged in between two molars she wouldnt be so easy to dislodge after the display from ashfall the rest of the museum seemed an anticlimax to bryce he was relieved when marcus was ready to leave he carefully adjusted his mask before they stepped out into the open air once more he might have been a little casual about it before not now never again hypertrophic pulmonary osteodystrophy sounded righteously horrible and he noticed marcus taking pains to adjust the straps on his mask over his ears too everything out there was gray dust swirled through the air now thicker now thinner but always around it collected in drifts in front of fences that lay athwart the breeze it was inches thick everywhere bryces shoes scrunched and sank into it so that he might almost have been walking on the beach he left blobby indistinct footprints i wish it would rain marcus said that would clean the airfor a while anyhow it would yeah bryce was a southern californian used to wishing for rain and not getting it he had to remind himself that things worked differently in the midwest he looked up to the sky he could hardly see the sun through the dust still blowing east come on jupiter pluvius do your stuff marcus laughed jupiter pluvius roman rain god known only to classics students and oldtime baseball writers bryces ears pricked up baseball neep was meat and drink to him if you know about jupiter pluvius and sportswriters he began for the next little while he forgot all about the supervolcano here was somebody who spoke his language and it wasnt ancient greek garden city kansas was no garden not these days vanessa didnt think any of kansas was a garden these days the only good thing you could say about kansas was that it was farther from the supervolcano crater than colorado was it was still screwed it just wasnt screwed quite so hard nobody on the interstate had stopped and tried to molest her nobodyd stopped and offered her a ride either shed walked and walked and walked till her arms were about to fall off and her blisters bled and when she got into town at last nobody seemed the least bit interested in heading west with her and fixing her car sorry said a mechanic in a gimme cap with purolator filters in big letters on the front he didnt sound sorrynot even close i got more work in town than i can handle i take my tow truck out into that blowing shitscuse my frenchand i aint got but a fiftyfifty chance of comin back with your vehicle he put heavy stress on the hick in the last word which seemed much too fitting to vanessa she fixed him with her flintiesthell bitchiestand most footsore glare what am i supposed to do now pickles yowl from inside the carrier underscored the question all the same the mechanic remained depressingly unfazed yought to thank the lord you made it this far plenty of people aint he answered that was true but also infuriating he went on red cross done set up a shelter at the high school its three blocks over from here and two blocks up he pointed you cant hardly miss it even with all the crap in the air he wasnt wearing a mask he was smoking a camel the pack stuck out of a front pocket of his chambray work shirt written above the pocket in machineembroidered red script was the name virgil hick is right vanessa thought disdainfully and whatever happens to his lungs he fucking deserves it lugging pickles she wearily limped over to the high school most of the time you cant miss it warned that youd get lost but not today she wasnt the only tiredlooking person toting this that and the other thing converging on the school either a woman with a sohelpme beehive hairdo who looked pretty goddamn tired herself checked vanessa in at the front office denver she said when vanessa told her where she was from a carefully plucked eyebrow rose we only have one other person from denver here that i know of not many from there have been able to get this far i got out the morning after the supervolcano blew vanessa said now sounding proud as well as pooped i bet it just kept getting worse from then on i wouldnt be surprised the woman answered before we check you in though either ill take charge of your cat or you can let it go if you want to no pets here none its the rule by the way she said it even the idea of appealing against the rule was unimaginable vanessa did anyway you cant do that i got pickles all this way i wont turn him loose now then you can look for help somewheres else the woman with the beehive said flatly only there aint no somewheres else in garden city that struck vanessa as much too likely to be true what happens if you take charge of him he goes to the pound you kill him you mean he goes to the pound the woman repeated as if she didnt like to think about that tears stung vanessas eyes behind the goggles youre mean youre cruel youre hateful id feed him out of whatever you feed me wheres he gonna piss wheres he gonna crap what if he bites a kid or scratches somebody up what if he gets into fights with other cats and dogs well he wont on account of we dont allow any pets any like i said thats the rule no matter how mean and cruel and hateful it was it made sense in a bureaucratic way even though it made sense in a bureaucratic way it was mean and cruel and hateful trying not to sob vanessa carried pickles outside he wasnt an outdoor cat he wouldnt know what to do loose in the world but it was bettershe hoped it was betterthan just killing him even after so long in the carrier he didnt want to come out when he finally did he stared with big round eyes the ash and dust on the grass made him sneeze then a noise or something made him scoot away he slunk around the corner of the office building and was gone when vanessa went back in shed lost her place in line she had to work her way up to the front again she wondered if shed have to go through all the paperwork twice too but she didnt the woman with the beehive said lets seewhere can we put you the auditorium is full and so is the gym itll have to be a classroom susie have we filled up j yet susie was the next woman standing behind the counter sure did lucille theyre packed in there like sardines were working on the k block k it is lucille said and told vanessa how to get there heres your authorization card she added its good for rations and water and enough cot or floor or whatever they got for sleeping wonderful vanessa mumbled still leaking tears shed had nothing to do with high school since escaping not so good not so old san atanasio high well almost nothing shed gone to a fiveyear reunion with bryce and spent most of her time dishing the dirt on the local guy shed lived with before him with other girls whod also known that luckless fellow the guy himself didnt come which only made the stories better theyd done english in room k posters of shakespeare walt whitman and toni morrison hung on the walls a lesson plan for julius caesar covered one of the whiteboards a bookcase in a corner of the room held more copies of the mill on the floss than anyone in his right mind would ever need all the desks were gone including the teachers no cotsjust people the air inside was warm and stuffy though less dusty than the stuff outside vanessa shed her masks and goggles the room smelled of humanity but not of raw sewage which probably meant do we go down the hall to use the bathroom she asked half a dozen people nodded sure do a chunky guy said but you dont need no hall pass anyways and they dont hit you with detention if you smoke in there he was playing to everybody stuck in k with him he got his laugh too though not from vanessa she mourned poor pickles maybe putting him out of his misery right away would have been better but maybe someone would take him in before he starved or got eaten or choked on dust she could hope she had to hope she made herself ask another question what do they feed us it was del taco last time genyouwine dogmeat mexican the chunky man said he woofed and got another laugh if he hadnt been class clown when he was a skinny teenager with zits vanessa would have been amazed asshole she thought while mr class clown preened she almost said it out loud old porky wore thin in a hurry but some of the other jerks whod got here before her plainly liked him she kept her mouth shut and staked out her own little patch of worn dirty linoleum her purse would make a lumpy pillow but better than nothing maybe more people came in the room got crowded and even stuffier the power was out so the air conditioner didnt work with all the blowing drifting crud outside opening a window seemed a doubleplus ungood idea she was exhausted from her hike into town and the bad air sure didnt help the door opened again this time it was two red cross workers one pushed a wheeled cart with flats of water bottles the others cart was piled high with brown cardboard boxes mres the man said by way of explanation or apology we got em from the national guard armory they aint real exciting but they beat the heck outa empty meals ready to eat three lies in four words vanessa discovered maybe not a world record but in the running after she choked hers down she decided it made del taco a wolfgang puck special by comparison looking at the box she discovered hers had an expiration date eight years in the future on the one hand that made it fairly fresh for an mre on the other it said even germs wanted jack diddly to do with the goddamn thing still and all the red cross man had a point a full belly was better than a hungry one vanessa chucked her trash into one of the garbage bags the red cross people left behind then she went outside and down the hall to the johnwhich of course meant she gave up the chunk of floor to which shed laid claim the tp was just this side of wax paper even worse than the cheap scratchy stuff offices used and the roll was almost empty what would they do when they ran out she didnt know but she had the bad feeling shed find out mr class clown came out of the boys room at the same time as she came out of the girls boy that was fun he said and held his nose yeah vanessa nodded with one toilet backed up the girls room had been pretty rank too i wanna get outa here he said his name was luke shed found that out who doesnt she said but how do you aim to do it i know how to hotwire a car he answered if itll take me out of the fuckin dust before it goes bellyup im golden cops kid or not vanessa considered that with less disgust and more interest than she would have imagined before the supervolcano went boom how many thefts and robberies could you blame on the eruption hundreds thousands hundreds of thousands that would have been her guess luke went on anybody thinks im gonna sit here scarfing down meals revolting to eritreans he damn well better think again vanessa had heard meals rejected by ethiopians but not his take on the name that might have been why she said want a passenger ive got some cash i can pay for gas and stuff he looked her up and down as he did she realized shed made a mistake his wet gaze made her feel as if she had slugs crawling over her theres other ways to pay he said running his tongue over his lips as if he were running it into her ear cheapern cash and more fun too no thanks forget i asked she said and hurried back to room k he wouldnt try anything with people around hey he hurried after her she turned around the was in her hand aimed a few inches north of his belly button i said no i meant no what part of that didnt you follow okay okay he drew back a couple of steps he was smart enough to see hed get ventilated if he came forward instead then that was goodfor him dont get your bowels in an uproar you aint such hot sit trust me he wasnt so very smart after all he was trying to wound her but he thought shed give a rats ass about anything that came out of his mouth like you are as if she said just stay away from me and well both pretend this never happened otherwise ill blow your fucking head off you talked me into it luke eased around her hands plainly visible making no sudden moves vanessa got the idea he might have had a gun pointed at him before he went into the classroom first she put the pistol back in her purse before she opened the door he was already launched into a stupid joke by then he didnt even look at her that suited her fine not much in the way of brains but at least some street smarts night absent electricity was darkness absolute darkness claustrophobic and scary vanessa would have loved it had someone lit a candle but she like everybody else in k was left to curse that darkness she hadnt tried sleeping in a crowd like this since summer camp when she was a kid people muttering people twisting and crunching as they tried to find halfcomfortable positions on the hard floor people snoring people farting people in spite of everything she did fall asleep not too much later someone tapped or kicked her in the ankle she woke with a wildly pounding heart for a few bad seconds there in the blackness she had no idea where she was or what she was doing there memory came back piecemeal garden city red cross shelter poor pickles this stupid fucking classroom oh she tried to go to sleep again it took longer this time at least no one in here was having screaming hysterics that was something a whole room full of people could forget about shuteye if anybody did asleep awake asleep awake asleep awake it was still as black as the middle of an ss mans heart but she knew damn well she wouldnt go back to sleep again so she said to hell with it and waited till wan gray light started leaking through the windows then she discovered she wasnt the only one whod given up and was sitting instead of lying the red cross people brought more mres and water bottles mushrooms and beef tasted like mud with lumps some squishy others chewy no way to boil water for the instantcoffee packet she tore it open poured the stuff onto her tongue and washed it down with water it was as bad as shed thought it would be any caffeine though was better than none when she came back from the john she pulled out a copy of the mill on the floss and started reading it it was the only entertainment around unlike the vile instant coffee it wasnt as bad as shed thought it would be luke disappeared two days later maybe he did know how to boost a car stuck in a room full of increasingly smelly strangers vanessa wondered if she should have gone with him wasnt escapingthisworth some less than heartfelt fucking and sucking she hadnt thought so then as time dragged on in her crowded cage she got less and less sure shed been right xv every time colin picked up the times from his driveway it got thinner and lighter it might almost have been an african famine victim slowly wasting away it had started shrinking long before the yellowstone supervolcano of course the internet had been sucking the life out of newspapers for years but less and less per was making its way to the presses these days the times did wry stories about its own struggles for survival and the breeze which remained webonly no doubt envied its bigger rival that wasnt the only struggle going on when he drove to the cop shop in the morning gas stations reminded customers odd or even the governor had reimposed the everyotherday rationing scheme not seen since the arab oil embargoes mother nature could embargo los angeles too more and more stations flew red flags to show they had no gas at all thanks to gabes swoop right after the eruption san atanasios police department still had a tolerable supply how long that would last and what the police would do when it ran low colin preferred not to dwell on yet a burger king had a big sign in the windowsorry no fries try our onion rings when not enough spuds were making it into town to support the fastfood business la was in deep kimchi colin hadnt heard of a kimchi shortage and san atanasio abounded in korean restaurants maybe they brought their napa cabbage down from the nearby central valley it got coldhighs refused to climb into the sixties a rainstorm came down from the gulf of alaska and then another one and then another one still anything could happen in the fall everybody whod lived here for a while knew that people kept hoping things would warm up colin eyed the pale sun and the washedout sky and the unbelievable sunsets he hoped things would warm up too but he didnt expect it that was what he got for falling in love with a geologist he doggedly kept on with his own job if snow fell below feet and didnt want to melt right away if the mountains ringing the los angeles basin were white white white he couldnt do anything about that his own little corner of the world there he stood a chance gabe sanchez felt the same way though he pissed and moaned more than colin did man you figure the honolulu pds got any openings for an experienced cop he asked as he and colin drove through chilly rain to a liquor store that had just been held up by a shotguntoting robber you can always hit craigslist colin answered you want to get out of town though i bet theres less competition in fairbanks fairbanks gabe made a cross with his two forefingers as if repelling a vampire funny manfunny like a colostomy bag that fuckin town was in the fuckin deep freeze before this stupid superwaddayacallit blew its stack whats it gonna be like year after fuckin next the july icecube harvestll be terrific thats what maybe you didnt need to fall in love with a geologist to know how screwed up things were and how screwed up they were liable to get maybe you only needed your normal complement of working brain cells colin flicked on his turn signal and pulled into the cramped liquorstore parking lot a blackandwhite was already there red and blue and yellow lights flashing in the overhead bar he grabbed his umbrella and got out one thing he said as he and gabe squelched toward the entrance rains washed away most of the ash oh boy gabe said besides that mrs lincoln howd you like the goddamn play colin shut up the clerk inside the liquor store was a short plump filipina she looked pissed when colin asked for her story i already tell it she said pointing to the two uniformed policemen in there with her well tl it again please colin said maybe youll remember something new i dont think so the woman said colin looked at her it was the kind of look that got the message across she changed her mind okay i tell this motherfucker come into the store he point big old gun at me give me your money or i blow your ass away motherfucker say i open cash drawer i put money on counter motherfucker grab it and run i call police english as she is spoke colin thought the filipina used the twelveletter endearment as if it meant guy for all he knew she thought it did one of these years maybe it would hed heard plenty of other people use it the same way do you have surveillance video he asked her what you say she returned english as it wasnt spoke colin tried again a camera he said patiently a tv camera was there anybody in the world who didnt savvy tv maybe a few luckless natives stuck in the bad reception of the papua new guinea mountains everyone else bowed down before the great god of the modern age and his holy name oh tv yes the filipina got that she pointed up and behind her to a brushedaluminum box with a lens at the business end right there well check that out maam gabe said was the robber wearing a mask he had to do a showandtell to get across what a mask was when the clerk understood she shook her head something anyway colin remarked have to find out what the footage looks like if it shows the perps face and if hes nasty with that shotgun maybe we can get one of the tv stations to run it thatll help if somebody makes him he mighthe diddespise tv news but he wasnt too proud to use it there you go gabe said maybe its the same jerk who blasted that other clerk a while ago maybe it is colin agreed thatd be good well well see that motherfucker shoot somebody the clerks voice rose in understandable horror were not sure if its the same guy yet colin said you catch him you put him in jail you keep him in jail she said shrilly this not first time we get robbed nobody never get caught what kind stupid motherfuckers work for police huh colin would have got pissed off if he hadnt already figured out she didnt mean much by the word sighing he answered maam there are smart cops and dumb cops same as there are at any other kind of work she eyed him you smart cop or dumb cop probably he said let her make whatever she wanted of that back to business lets see what the camera picked up after some fiddling with the controls they played it back and watched it on the monitor next to the nowgutted cash register it was in color and highly detailed colin remembered the blackandwhite blurs you got from earlymodel surveillance cameras no more this was plenty good enough to id the perpand his shotgunin court he was about eighteen african american in a cheap knit watchcap a hoodie and jeans he had earrings and a tattoo on the left side of his neck just below his ear damned if i dont think thats the same guy gabe said its been a while colin answered but he suspected the sergeant was right whoever he was the way the robber yelled and waved the shotgun around ought to be plenty to rouse a tv anchormans righteous indignation colin knew the numbers to call channel sent a gal out to look at the video oh yes we can use this she said beaming at colin and showing off teeth undoubtedly capped do you have a hotline number where people can call if they know something sure do he wrote it down on the back of one of his cards under it he printed san atanasio pd hotline she might not think to turn the card over and remind herself where shed got it she didnt especially look like a dummy but you never could tell thanks she stuck it in her purse now what was the name of the liquor store where exactly is it when did the robbery take place the clerk was a woman she could see that on the video but he didnt mind if she made sure by the time she left they were both pretty well pleased with themselves the only trouble was the footage didnt run the big headline on the evening news was that the governor had ordered mandatory statewide rolling blackouts we have to conserve energy because less is reaching us due to the impactful nature of the supervolcano eruption he declared earnestly just because hed ordered blackouts and power cutoffs didnt mean hed get them right away half a dozen different groupsright left and centerconverged on his mansion waving picket signs and demanding that he change his mind this instant if not sooner a judge way the hell up in siskiyou county had already issued a preliminary injunction against the blackouts colin felt a certain amount of sympathy for him siskiyou county was cold and mountainous without electricity for several hours a day it would be colder yet and there was a car chase on the long beach freeway the station had to cover that liveor thought it did anyway so the people out there in tvland never got a glimpse of the robber with that shotgun and the tat it turned out not to matter one of the san atanasio cops took a look at the video and said fuck me if i dont know that asshole thats jerwilliam ellis i busted his sorry butt for armed robbery year before last i didnt know he was outa juvie jerwilliam colin said thats his name one word capital j capital w the cop said dont ask me why i just work here ask his mama okay colin shrugged it wasnt his business hed seen plenty of names stranger than that know where he lives last i heard in the projects on imperial that was north and east of san atanasio the big housing projects there had gone up after the watts riots a monument to lbjs great society theyd been breeding gangbangers ever since as projects went there were plenty of grimmer examples back east that didnt make the imperial gardens a garden spot have to talk with lapd colin said unenthusiastically the projects were in the big citys jurisdiction sometimes lapd cooperated well sometimes the big city cops treated their smalltown cousins like a bunch of scrounging hicks you never could tell till you tried better call quick the cop said way things are going theyll start canceling phones pretty soon too heh colin said for all the world as if it were a joke louise ferguson grabbed a shopping cart and headed into vons the supermarket on reynoso drive had been there for as long as she could remember and for longer than that too some of the regulars whod come in when she was just getting started were still regulars now regulars whose hair had gone white or light blue or pink regulars with wrinkles and bent backs and polyester tops microfiber my ass louise thought i say its polyester and i say the hell with it was that how it ended up was that how shed look twentyfive years from now would that cheery newlywed going up the produce aisle see her a lot further through the century and shiver as if a goose had walked over her grave probably you couldnt win the only way you could get out of the game was by walking in front of a truck or something louise didnt want to do that but she didnt want to get old either she especially didnt want to get old with a lover so much younger than she was men turned distinguished as they aged you respected their experience women went invisible or grew hideous one who gave a flying fuck or any other kind about some old broads experience did you come to the store to piss and moan or are you going to shop some too louise asked herself she chuckled wryly she had the cart she had her listshe was an organized shopper might as well drop some cash as usual she headed for the produce first the newlywed looking unhappy now not cheery had her reasons not much filled the bins most of what was there didnt look very good the prices were through the roof a sign above a bare bin that should have held potatoes said sorry were doing the best we can the scary part was louise believed it nobody who could get his hands on higherquality veggies would have put these sorry specimens on display sucks doesnt it the newlywed said i couldnt have put it better myself louise answered they smiled at each other and rolled their eyes at least for a moment misery loved company things got no better in the rest of the market the shelves had lots of odd spotty gaps louise had noticed a few of them the week before now they came right out and poked her in the eye she didnt need long to see what the pattern was you could still buy local stuff anything that came from back east was in short supply she got what she could some of what she couldnt get she could work around no tissues in sight but they had plenty of tp for some reason if you had to you could use it on your nose as well as your rear end and rice could substitute for potatoes oh not exactly but close enough where theres a will theres a lawyer she thought then she tightened her lips so her mouth turned into a thin bloodless line that had beenand no doubt still wasone of colins jokes well whatshernamekellywas listening to them now she hadnt heard all of them a million times yet only a few hundred say if she stuck with him as long as louise had hed be pretty ancient by then and kelly would be no spring chicken herself people said you were crazy for two years after your marriage sank much of what people said was bullshit nothing else but that though seemed pretty much true louise felt a lot more stable a lot more grounded than she had when she walked out the old front door for the last time grounded or not she couldnt get away from what had been so familiar for so long would colin and the things hed done and said keep bubbling up inside her for the rest of her life it sure looked that way on the outside the break was clean on the inside she could still hear him dammit she steered the cart to a checkout stand as she displayed her vons club card for the discounts the hispanic kid bagging groceries said hope you dont mind plastic bags theyre the only ones we were able to get thats okay louise said they were supposed to be phasing out plastic no they were supposed to have phased it out maybe theyd won some kind of dispensation on account of the supervolcano the pope gives dispensations you mean an exemption damn straight she could still hear colin in her head oh vanessa would have said the same thing but not in the same tone of voice and she hadnt heard one damn thing from vanessa since yellowstone fell in on itself reminding herself of that made her miss whatever the bagger said next im sorry she tried to look interested and attentive i said if youve got some of those cloth totes with the handles it might be a good idea to bring them the next time you come in who knows how much longer well be able to get any bags at all okay ill do that louise had several of them in a drawer who didnt some people were bound not to and theyd be the ones who raised a stink when the market didntcouldnthelp them corral their groceries louise stowed the vons club card and took out her trusty visa she was signing the store copy of the register printout when the checkout gal remarked maybe youre lucky to get plastic bags today its coming down in buckets out there it is louise hadnt paid any attention to what the weather was doing now she looked out through the big plateglass windows it is she agreed in dismay it hadnt been when she got there can i run back and buy an umbrella that would make the two women behind her in line love her to death the checker turned to the bagger run get mrs ferguson an umbrella orlando hustle si virginia orlando said and he was off like a shot he came back with an umbrellaan umbrella with a tacky floral pattern but what could you do a lot faster than louise could have got it for herself she paid cash it was quicker than plastic and she did care what people thought even if they werent people she knew buckets was barely the word for the way it was pouring la didnt usually get deluges like this the umbrella kept her top half dry from the waist down she was soaked anyhow it was blowing almost horizontally out of the northwest the plastic grocery bags were a blessing brown paper would have disintegrated in rain like this louise threw the sacks into the trunk and waded around to the drivers door getting in wrestling the umbrella shut tossing it down in front of the passenger seat and slamming the car door took only a few seconds all the same louise let in enough water to fill a hazard on the golf course down the street quite a bit came down on her in the process too yuck she said that wasnt nearly good out throh she tried again shit better definitely better shed given up trying to understand why people told you not to swear it didnt help the human condition as much as getting drunk or screwing but it made a pretty fair bandaid then she said shit again getting in letting in all that water and wet air and having the gall to go on breathing had steamed up the inside of the car windows for all the seeing out she could do she might as well have been in the middle of her own private fog bank she turned on the motor and hit both front and rear defrost blowing warm air across the inside of the windshield made things worse before it improved them shed known it would so she didnt bother cursing werent a couple of old paper towels hiding under the passenger seat they were and they werent too wet either she used them to wipe off the side windows or as much of the side windows as she could reach once she finished she started to wad them up so she could give them the old heaveho once she got home thoughtfully she caught herself kleenex was gone from the shelves how long would paper towels last these would dry out and she could use them again she shoved them back under the seat uncrumpled start the windshield wipers turn them up to high she couldnt remember the last time shed done that but she sure needed to now turn on the headlights if the wipers were going you had to do that it was the law as a cops wifeyes yes dammit a cops exwifeshe not only knew about stuff like that she took it seriously and in a downpour like this you needed to give the other jerks out there all the chance to see you they could get a ginormous suv was shoehorned into the space on her left as it always did that made backing out a special delight she wondered why the damn things had got so popular and stayed so popular so long she shrugged nothing she could do about it now but escape this one without getting rearended she managed that she pulled out of the parking lot and onto the street she started back toward the condo trying to look every which way at once shed been driving for thirty years shed seen from experience that people in la didnt know how to handle rain they went too fast and they tailgated if she hadnt seen it for herself the stories colin brought home from the cop shop would have rammed the lesson home so she wasnt astonished when things ground to a halt halfway home disgusted yes ticked off you betcha astonished no way it was about time for the news station to run its traffic report on the off chance she hit the third button on the radio fic on the fives came out of the speakers freeway crashesand there were a slew of themcame first then the announcer said and theres a bad surfacestreet accident in san atanasio near the corner of sword beach and th street at least four cars are involved and a light pole is down across the road thatll put a hitch in your gitalong he sounded absurdly cheerful of course he wasnt stuck in it louise was she slid into the right lane ignoring the horn from the asshole who didnt care for it then she got off sword beach with almost as much relief as soldiers must have felt escaping the genuine article in stores and restaurants and gas stations and banks and all the other impedimenta of western civilization fronted the avenue as soon as you got away from it things changed white clapboard houses from before the war sat side by side wit faded stucco ones from not long after the house where shed raised her family with colin was only a couple of miles away but in a much better neighborhood a much whiter neighborhood too louise might be living with a hispanic man but when she didnt watch herself she still eyed faces darker than her own with suspicion that was one more inheritance from being married to a cop even if it was one she wished she could have escaped not many white faces here mexicans salvadorans blacks koreans filipinos you could find everybody and every kind of holeinthewall eatery in san atanasio a lot of lawns hadnt been mown any time lately some of these men mowed other peoples lawns for a living and had no time or energy to worry about their own before the rains started the grass would have been yellow or brown it greened up in a hurry though a few lawns had cars on them an asian woman with an umbrella pushed a stroller along the beatup sidewalk a black guy whod got up onto his roof with an aluminum ladder secured a blue plastic tarp with broken bricks to bandage a leak till the roofers showed up that wouldnt be till after it quit raining of course if it ever did nobody paid any attention to her as she drove along it wasnt a neighborhood like south central where people stared at any white face san atanasios everybody included honkies too and when you were in a car especially a car closed up against the rain you were halfway towards invisibility anyhow she hit the brake as a boy on a bike zoomed out from nowhere plenty of kids ran here and there rain or no rain well okay it was saturday no doubt their older brothers had scrawled the graffiti that marked fences and garage doors the way cat pee marked toms territories san atanasio had a graffitiabatement program you could call in and get them painted over for free you could but nobody here seemed to care and how long would a program like that last now that times were hard and getting harder probably not long but then again who could say where spray paint came from if it wasnt made here the gangbangers would have trouble getting any more would they go back to buckets and brushes or would they cut it out louise told herself sternly it wasnt her worry even if it had been she couldnt do anything about it these days back when she was married to colin shed fed him tips and hed used some of them she was damned if shed call him or email him now unless it was about the kids she wanted nothing to do with him she didnt want that either but she knew she was stuck with it if she turned left here she ought to be able to get back on to sword beach beyond the accident she turnedcarefully the rain was really coming down in buckets you never saw rain like this in the fall you hardly ever saw rain like this in january or february as wet a season as la had there was the stop sign at sword beach louise didnt california it the way she would have in good weather it wasnt only that shed lost the immunity to tickets cops and cops spouses enjoyed in their hometown some jackass barreling along the street after going slow for so long was liable to cream her she made good time after she turned on to the thoroughfare the accident receded in her rearview mirror she saw a lot of smashed sheet metal two blackandwhites an ambulance a fire engine and a yellow truck with a cherrypicker from the department of public works a mess all right she supposed the public works guys were in charge of the downed light pole back to the underground parking lot that had become as familiar as the old driveway used to be she popped the trunk and grabbed as many sacks of groceries as she could carry rainwater dripped from the bumper it rilled down to the center of the concrete expanse and vanished into a softballsized drainage hole with a metal grate over it louise got soaked all over again lugging the groceries up to the condo oh you poor thing teo exclaimed when she came in are there more let me fetch the rest dont bother why should you get wet too louise said but he wasnt listening to her he plucked the keys out of her handbag and vanished down the stairs he came back with the rest of the sacks a couple of minutes later sure as hell he was as wet as if hed just come out of the shower the keys clanked when he put them back in her purse forty days and forty nights he said more happily than the sentiment deserved louise was already putting stuff in cupboards and the fridge she missed her old kitchen she didnt have room to swing a cat in here i wouldnt be surprised she agreed there was a godawful wreck on sword beach too i had to kinda go around it to get home she told him about it did you teo said louise nodded so did he as if that explained something hed wondered about and it did i thought you were taking a while getting back well i was couldnt help it louise replied hand me that chub of ground round will you she stuck it in the freezer you can still get beef she said i know its fatty and everythingteo worried much more about nutrition than anybody shed known beforebut you can still get it the earth is angry at us he said who would have imagined a volcano could throw all our plans for a loss he was a football fan louise tolerated that as for who would have imaginedwell colin had been tiresome about it even before the supervolcano erupted of course that was because his new squeeze worried about such things people rubbed off on each other as they rubbed against each other you couldnt help it she smiled teo smiled back and ran a hand through her wet hair as far as louise was concerned shed got the best of the bargain there was a technical term for what riding a bike through heavy rain was like it bit the big one was what it did marshall ferguson had a plastic poncho that kept him at least partially dry it bit the big one anyhow but so did the ucsb parking policy there werent nearly enough spaces on campus the ones that were there cost too bloody much a bike was a lot more practical most of the time this past week riding the bike to school tempted marshall to take the bus instead but he would have got drenched waiting for it and it stopped three blocks from his place so he would have got drenched walking to and from too you couldnt win a car zoomed by it kept its distance most santa barbara drivers unlike their counterparts in a lot of southern california at least had some notion that they shared the road with people on two wheels that didnt mean the tires didnt pick up water and plaster it against marshalls side then splash him in the face as the toyota got ahead of him this happened at least half a dozen ties before he finally got to campus as he did every day when he arrived he wondered if the bus wasnt a better idea after all he wondered the same thing every time he pedaled home in the rain maybe i should suspect a trend he thought somehow though he climbed aboard the bike every morning instead of walking to the bus stop he always figured things would get better this next time he might have been like that annoying song about tomorrow tomorrow or he might have met one of the short definitions of insanity doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result hey at least i have fun he muttered as he escaped the nasty traffic at last whether getting cold dirty water flung in his kisser from speeding michelins honest to god counted as fun was something hed worry about some other time campus bike racks took up less room than parking lots did but they filled up just as fast he found a space put his bicycle in it and locked the machine to the rack he used a lock and a chain his father approved of hed got el cheapos at firstand one unhappy day his sophomore year hed had to take the bus back to his place after biking in that morning his old man made him pay for the new bike lock and chain out of his own money too he hadnt appreciated that he also hadnt had his bike stolen since everybody else on campus looked as wet and miserable as he did well almost everybody a tweedy prof strolled along under an umbrella big enough to keep the supervolcano crater dry the guy was almost bald on top but his gray hair came down to his shoulders all the same hed probably grown it out when he was a kid around decided it looked way cool and never bothered to change his mind in spite of changing styles and changing hairline tenure could do that to you you stopped needing to change so you didnt and if people snickered at you behind their hands so what you still had tenure marshall wished students could get tenure that was what hed been trying to do all his years here he liked imagining himself at fiftyfive paunchy maybe balding too still living in an apartment with ratty furniture in ellwood or goleta still soaking up units still smoking dope and still laying coeds whenever he got the chance what more could anybody want he was mournfully aware it wouldnt happen for one thing his father wouldnt keep fronting him cash forever and you couldnt make enough money oddjobbing it to pay for your place and your food and your car and all the other shit you needed to say nothing of university fees one more thing that bit bigtime in fact for another even if his old man had been willing to leave him on the gravy train for the next thirty years ucsb wasnt by rights he should have graduated long since hed passedway passedthe ordinary limits on time of attendance and total units adroit majorchanging and a couple of petitions the administration had carelessly approved left him still working toward his sheepskin pretty soon though hed graduate no matter how much finagling how much wiggling or how much kicking and screaming he did he hadnt had many expectations before the supervolcano knocked the economy flat and stomped on it now life with a bachelors degree looked depressingly like going back to san atanasio back to his room at the old house and sponging off his dad while he flailed around looking for work that wasnt there rain or no rain people were out on campus collecting donations for all the millions whod had to evacuate on account of the eruption cash canned goods old clothestheyd take anything marshall had given them money he couldnt see how canned gooor beatup jeans would make it from santa barbara to the midwest hed even asked about that they wont an earnest guy with a red cross pin on his pocket replied but there are plenty of refugees at the western edge of the ashfall too oh marshall hadnt thought about that the next day hed donated a can of roastbeef hash and a can of mandarin oranges so they didnt exactly go together bfd today he walked past the wet volunteers he was low on funds and he hadnt stuck any cans in his backpack the rain lowered everyones spirits the volunteers didnt try very hard to get people to stop they stood or sat under polyethylene sheeting that didnt keep off enough of the rain and looked as if they would have donated their souls to go somewhere warm and dry marshall could actually do that campus buildings werent very warm because thermostats got pushed way down after the eruption but it wasnt raining indoors he could shed his poncho he could even go into a mens room and use a paper towel to dry off a little new stickers in there warned dont waste paper goods what wasnt in short supply these days on to the room for the creativewriting class professor bolger wasnt what marshall had expected he made the students write well surprise but he also made them submit what they wrote submit it to markets where they were competing against people whod been freelancing longer than theyd been alive when bolger had announced that requirement a girl bleated well get rejected marshall would have beaten her to it if he hadnt been exhaling at the moment instead of inhaling the prof answered a squawk with a question suppose you do how are you worse off because the girl explained marshall nodded that sure made sense to him listen to me bolger said grimly you are here to learn something about writing and you are herewith luckto see if you can make money writing to make a living at it even if youre good enough and stubborn enough and lucky enough you cannot possibly sell your work if you never submit it and so you will how often do you get rejected marshall asked he assumed bolger did if the answer came back never what the hell was the guy doing teaching here why wasnt he all over the bestseller list i have a stack of slips this high the prof held his hands six inches apart and that doesnt even count emails nobodys going to like your work all the time you have to get hardened to that it doesnt mean youre a bad person it just means that editor didnt like that piece that day he made it sound simple and logical marshall still quailed at the idea of some hardbitten probably cigarchewing editor laughing at something hed worked hard on logic would take you only so far xvi when vanessa heard loud diesel engines outside the red cross shelter in garden city the first thing she wondered was whether shed slipped a cog hardly any motor noises had been around lately the cars that could get out of town had got hardly any more vehicles were coming in out of the west so what the devil was going on curiosity felt odd she knew more about the people cooped up in room k with her than shed ever wanted to find out she knew how they smelled worse by the day so did she she knew how the mill on the floss came out knowing didnt stop her from wondering why the garden city school district inflicted it on defenseless high schoolers some of the refugees passed the time by playing cards that had already caused two fights money seemed like a joke when you couldnt buy anything with ittill you started losing then to some people it stopped being funny and if vanessa never saw another mre it was liable to mean shed starve to death which was worse seemed less and less obvious the mres did give her and her fellow inmates at the refugee center the strength to complain they complained about the food though nobody did the old catskills shtick and added and such small portions not even the most dedicated complainerand vanessa was right up therewanted more of the military rations as far as she was concerned they only proved gis were heroes they complained about the accommodations they complained about the stinking heads they complained about having to go outside through the dust to use the stinking heads they complained even more about the idea of using a bucket behind a curtain in the room not that there was enough space to set up that kind of niche anyhow everybody complained about how smelly everybody else was they complained whenever somebody farted since they were eating mres all the time people farted a lot some were sound and fury signifying nothing some could have cleared out madison square garden clearing out k wasnt so easy you had to flee into the dust farts were only noxious that stuff was whatever came after noxious pickles was out in it she wasnt the only one who complained about having to abandon a pet maybe somebody out there had taken in her poor dumb kitty she could hope so but she couldnt make herself believe it guilt gnawed at her one of the red cross people came into the classroom in the middle of the morning that alarmed vanessa the way a change in routine alarmed a guy halfway through a twentyyear sentence it was different something had to be wrong with it grab your stuff put on masks if youve got em and come outside in a neat line the woman said for all the world like a kindergarten teacher but she added something a kindergarten teacher wouldnt have we are going to evacuate the people at this center to a site farther east there is a god vanessa exclaimed amidst the general hubbub the announcement set off a doughy middleaged woman gave her a disapproving look of course there is she said her voice a harsh kansas rasp that sounded straight off a depressionera farm have you accepted our lord jesus christ as your personal savior i dont think jesus had shit to do with the supervolcano and i figure i saved myself when i got the hell out of denver vanessa answered to make herself perfectly clear she added you can do whatever you want with your own stupid religion as long as you dont dump it on me when her father talked about religion he described himself as a bornagain pagan his father had been a dour baptist but dad got over it vanessas mother had messed around with various new agey things without letting much stick her brothers were as pious as she was rob enjoyed getting into debates when mormon missionaries came around one memorable summer afternoon mahall tried a more direct approach he turned around and dropped his pants no mormonsor even jehovahs witnessesrang the doorbell for a long time after that ms doughface looked as if vanessa had sprouted bright red horns and a long barbed tail youll burn forever she said yeah well suppose you let me worry about that too okay vanessa said she pushed past the woman she would have hauled off and belted her with any more provocations none of the squabbles in k had left anyone badly hurt but everyones temper was frayed vanessa wasnt close to the front of the line she also wasnt close to the doughy woman whod ended up near the back serves her right vanessa thought lines were also forming in front of the other overcrowded classrooms a mans voice floated through the air so did volcanic ash people were kicking up but vanessa tried to ignore that wherever were going its gotta be better than this now there was something to say amen to one by one each classrooms worth of refugees headed up toward the front of the high school at last a red cross man shepherded k forward vanessa hoped with all her heart she never sawor smelledthis miserable place again some of the buses growling out front were commandeered from schools they were bright yellow with the names of rural districts stenciled in black below the windows more were as military as mres and painted olive drab all of them had big fat superduper filters sticking out from their engine compartments if you were going to go anywhere with all this shit blowing aroundand it wasthat was how you had to go about it the bus into which vanessa climbed was a military model that didnt and probably couldnt make it less comfortable than a school bus the driver was also military he wore desert camouflage and a gas mask he touched a door when the bus was full the doors rasped shut vanessa who was sitting not far from the front got the idea they were supposed to hiss instead of rasping you couldnt put superduper filters on everything even if grit didnt murder the engine this bus had a strictly limited life expectancy as long as it got her away from garden city kansas before it dropped dead she couldnt have cared less where are we going someone asked as the bus pulled away from the high school its called camp constitution sir the driver answered vanessa could hardly hear him over the roar of the bus in motion military specs plainly didnt worry about noise inside the cabin as for where its located at its between muskogee and fayetteville oklahoma arkansas one of those states the ass end of nowhere either way why on earth would they dumphow many refugees there no sooner had the question occurred to vanessa than the woman right behind her asked it out loud maam they briefed us on account of thats where the dust from the volcano stopped falling the driver said which made a certain amount of sense he continued so thats how come fema was tasked with setting up camp constitution there by the way he repeated the name he seemed to like it vanessa didnt to her it sounded like some bureaucrats effort to make squalor and misery sound patriotic hearing that fema was running the place did nothing to reassure her either had fema ever run anitt hadnt screwed up if it had it wasnt within her memory how many people aboard the olivedrab bus were having that same reassuring thought at least one besides vanessa a man yelped how come the army isnt running this camp the army cant do that the driver sounded as shocked as anyone could through a gas mask it isnt the militarys responsibility to run a civilian facility inside the usa but the army might do it right fema sure wont the man said which was exactly what vanessa was thinking this time he got no answer the driver was concentrating on the interstate in front of him he needed to concentrate because he was going through a pretty fair sandstorm less dust and ash floated in the air than right after the eruption but more lay on the ground the bus convoy stirred it up again the army bus boasted airconditioning soldiers traveled in more style than vanessa would have guessed what kind of fancy filters kept the ac from overloading and crapping out she didnt much care breathing air that wasnt close and moist and didnt smell like too many other people felt wonderful or whatever one step up from wonderful was then there was a pop outside one of the windows on the left side blew in at the same instant or close enough one of the windows on the right side blew out so much for the airconditioning even as people were screaming and squealing and trying to get bits of glass out of their hair the driver grabbed an m vanessa hadnt noticed by his feet he fired a burst out through his window the din was horrendous and set the passengers making even more noise than they were already another shot from outside punched through sheet metal by what would do for a miracle it didnt punch through any people the driver squeezed off a fresh answering burst he hadnt a prayer of hitting whatever maniac out there who was shooting at them maybe he could make the asshole duck anyway whats he doing a woman howled vanessa thought it was the gal who had a personal savior that didnt make it a dumb question though some people are kinda unhappy were evacuating from west to east and on account of were taking folks out of red cross shelters first the driver answered with commendable calm kinda unhappy here meant something like pissed off enough to try to commit murder vanessa had no trouble working that out she wasnt so sure about her fellow refugees shed never been one to underestimate the power of human stupidity then she imagined herself on a lifeboat in the middle of the pacific instead of in a freshly ventilated olivedrab bus that all of a sudden stank of cordite she imagined some poor bastard treading water as the boat went by it wasnt going to stop for him and let him climb aboard if he had a gun wouldnt he use it no wonder the guy out there in the dust started shooting vanessa supposed they ought to count themselves lucky he only had a varmint gun not an rpg for whatever reasonmaybe his car bought a plot right awayhe was stuck in the middle of the dust how much longer could he or anybody else last here how many more like him were scattered from nevada to here how many of them would be able to get out how many would die of one lung disease or another or else starve because the continentwide fooddistribution system suddnly had a hole you could throw a few states through bound to be hundreds of thousands millions more likely how many acres of corn and wheat and soybeans were dying under the dust how many cows and sheep and pigs and chickens they werent going to evacuate livestock not when they didnt have a prayer of getting even a fraction of the people out which meant what exactly it means im goddamn lucky to be on this bus vanessa decided that was obvious and made obviouser by someone in the bloodwarm water with the circling dorsal fins opening up on her less obvious maybe was that if things kept on the way they were going pretty soon an mre would be something to fight over not something to swear at that might have been the scariest thought vanessa had had since the supervolcano blew up the man from the national park service and the man from the us geological survey nodded in jerky unison yes if you want to do this you have to sign all the releases the usgs guy said you have to acknowledge in writing that you are doing this at your own risk that you know it is dangerous and that the federal government is not liable if you are injured or killed we have a little too much on our plates right now to worry about nuisance lawsuits yeah just a little the national park service guy agreed kelly was ready to sign on the dotted line kelly was in fact eager she wouldnt have come to this meeting if she werent a chance to fly over the supervolcano crater look down and take pictures she thought she would have signed away her immortal soul for that let alone a chance for her heirs and assigns to take a bite out of uncle sam if something went wrong and something was liable to she hadnt told colin about this little jaunt for fear he would call her ninetyseven different kinds of idiot if the supervolcano so much as hiccupped while they were over it theyd be toastto say nothing of toasted theyd fall out of the sky and go into the magma pit threequarters of a million years down the road theyd be part of the next big show a tiny part but part even so she signed on the dotted line she signed repeatedly on the dotted line the governments attitude seemed to be that anything worth doing was worth doing in quadruplicate several other grad students and a couple of profs also indited their john hancocks in all the requisite places what did it say that more graduate students than faculty members were willing to risk their lives for science that people whod got tenure had more brains than those who merely dreamt of it or that profs lived a better life than grad students and didnt want to chance throwing it away was all of the above an acceptable choice one of the other intrepid grad students asked do we know its safe for the plane to take off son we dont know the sunll come up tomorrow the usgs man answered it may go nova between now and then or the earth may quit rotating or whatever the hell what i do know is when the plane takes off im gonna be on it ive already signed all this bullshit paperwork if thats not good enough for you i dont know what else to say no one seemed to have any more questions after that the national park service man said be at oakland international by five am day after tomorrow airport security will be in place for our little jaunt wit run that by me again kelly said we sign all this stuff saying we know were risking our lives but theyve got to make sure nobodyll hijack the plane and crash it into the crater wheres the sense in that the usgs man grinned at her hi welcome to catch he said it doesnt have to make sense its government policy those people may pay me but they dont pay me enough to lie for them and so at a few minutes before five in the morningwell before dawn in other wordskelly sleepily put her cell phone and laptop in a tray and took off her shoes she passed her little bag through the xray machine can you open this please a sternlooking black woman said when it came out the other side when tsa people said please they didnt mean it kelly unzipped the bag the woman pawed through her meager stuff then grudgingly nodded what was wrong kelly asked your bagels looked like something they werent supposed to the black woman answered she told the story of the bagels of mass destruction to the other geologists waiting to go out to their chartered learjet they gave back the mixture of laughs and groans shed looked for what else do you expect from a system designed by very sharp people for very dull people to work one of them said kelly hadnt thought of it like that when she did the rituals of airport security made more sense shed never been on a private jet having enough room to stretch out in her seat made her want to abandon southwest american and united forever i could get used to this she said as the plane taxied toward takeoff in that case what are you doing studying geology asked her chairman who had the window seat beside hers geoff rheinburg was grayhaired and pudgy but more than plenty sharp you should have gone into programming and turned into an internet billionaire then youd have a jet for every day of the weektwo for saturday if you wanted i spend more time doing geology than flying kelly answered after a little thought and i can use computers but im not much for making them sit up and beg this is more fun then you may possibly be in the right place after all rheinburg allowed was he old enough to have started out on a slide rule back in the days before pocket calculators if he wasnt he came close the plane shot down the runway and zoomed into the sky air traffic here and most places in the usa was still screwed up with flights way way off their usual level maybe that tough black gal had checked out the bagels for no better reason than that she was bored stiff this is the pilot speaking the learjets intercom had better sound quality than a commercial airliners the mans voice didnt sound as if it were coming through a tincan telephone he went on i am going to give you the usual advicekeep your seat belts fastened at all times i mean it more than usual though we will be flying over the crater at forty thousand feet look for turbulence all the same that sucker is enormous and it is hot hot air riseswhy do you think old politicians float away and never get seen again that won him a few startled laughs kelly wondered if hed ever flown for southwest she hated the seating stampede but enjoyed the way the crew sometimes spoofed the usual instructions about seat belts and exit rows and oxygen masks my brotherinlaw told me i needed my head examined when he found out i was making this flight the pilot went on i told him i needed some help with the down payment on a house i want to buy that doesnt necessarily make him wrong you understand whats your excuse folks he ought to be doing standup kelly said we cant throw things at him when hes behind that locked door professor rheinburg said too bad isnt it they flew on the engines sounded like engines kelly approved there was still a lot of dust and ash in the air and the supervolcanos afterbelchesmajor eruptions on any normal scale but the scales werent normal now and wouldnt be for a long timekept adding more the planes that were flying needed much more frequent engine overhauls than anyone had dreamt they would from oakland to yellowstone was about an hour and a half no not to yellowstone to the supervolcano crater yellowstone was gone dead off the map in the most literal meaning of the words yellowstone had either fallen half a mile toward the center of the earth or was buried deep in lava or pyroclastic flows or volcanic ash yellowstone was screwed blued and tattooed not to put too fine a point on it people worked on laptops or fiddled with the sensors and other instruments that were the real reason for the flight the pilot didnt make the usual announcement about electronic devices the geologists might have lynched him if he had without electronic devices they fell all the way back to the start of the twentieth century or maybe even to the nineteenth after a while the pilot did come on to say folks we are getting close im going to do what im supposed to do when turbulence is likely im going to tell you to make sure youre in your seats with your belts securely fastened dont be dumb now if there isnt turbulence flying over this critter then theres no such animal we dont want to have to scrape you off the ceilingor off your neighbors lap geoff rheinburg gave kelly a wry grin as he checked his belt no offense but the only gal i want on my lap is my wife he said okay by me she answered tightening her own a little she knew he was happily married nice that somebody was she figured colin would get up the nerve to propose one of these days before too long she also figured she would get up the nerve to say yes when he did what happened after that was a crapshootas far as she could see just like every other marriage since the beginning of time three minutes till we reach the edge of the crater the pilot said welcome to the biggest goddamn roller coaster in the world kelly peered out unlike a commercial airliners the learjets windows were big enough to give even somebody in an aisle seat a good view of the wider world shed looked down into active volcanoes before shed gone to the big island of hawaii yeah work as a geologist could be rough but the volcanoes there which went off pretty much all the time were as different as you could get from the yellowstone supervolcano the supervolcano was like the little girl saving up more spit it saved and it saved and it saved till its igneous cheeks couldnt hold any more then then it went and trashed half the continent and that was only the first act the followup which did a number on the whole planet was just getting started even in the widewindowed learjet she leaned toward happly married professor rheinburg to see better he didnt wince so she hadnt forgotten her deodorant even though shed crawled out of bed at some heathen hour lots of gray and brown down below nothing green not any more life would be trying to reboot down there it had likely already succeeded in a few tiny spots but not in a way you could see from eight miles high or eight and a half the edge of the world fell away down below as soon as it did the plane started bouncing in the air yes the crater was heating things up wasnt it oh just a little here and there the floor had already crusted over and looked like well bare rock one of these days one of these centuries it would form the bottom of the new caldera that would take the place of the one at the heart of yellowstone theyd need to give it a new name kelly wondered whether theyd still speak english when they got around to it lava still boiled and bubbled in between the congealed places it wasnt as impressive as the stuff in the return of the king for one thing that lava was cg for another you were looking at it up close and personal not from fortyoddthousand feet kelly whod first read the lord of the rings when she was nine wondered what would happen if you dropped saurons dread creation right into the middle of this she expected itd be gone for good hell if mount doom happened to sit on top of a supervolcano hot spot one of these days it would have been gone for good that was why there was a big stretch of the rocky mountains without any mountains some of those patches of molten rock are miles wide rheinburg murmured most likely to himself even if he wasnt talking to her it was a useful reminder the scale of this thing was ridiculous was one of the words that occurred to her then the learjet did some upanddowns she devoutly hoped it was designed for as urgently she hoped the bagels of mass destruction would stay put for anyone who needs the reminder you have airsick bags in the pockets of the seats in front of you the pilot said if you need them i do hope youll use them we dont want the next batch of passengers to think we were playing vomit comet now do we oh shut up professor rheinburg said under his breath he looked green around the gills kelly suspected she did too shed never been airsick or even feared she might be now she discovered there was a first time for everything she grabbed her bag just to stay on the safe side next to her her chairman did the same thing neither of them needed to use theirs horrible noises from behind them and an acid reek in the conditioned air warned that someone hadnt been so lucky oh dear rheinburg said sympathetically kelly kept her mouth shutkept it clamped shut in fact that sour stink sure didnt help her stomach she tried her best not to think about it wasnt lava fascinating sure it was then they were past the great pockmark in the earths skin and over more devastation of the same kind theyd seen on the approach the air smoothed out kellys insides relaxeduntil the pilot said well turn around now and make our second pass over the crater while were heading for home shed been about to stuff the airsick bag back where it belonged on second thought that could wait till they got back to the idaho side of thingsalthough idaho or big parts of it was an idea that had come and gone whats that song about how much do you have to pay to keep from going through all these things twice professor rheinburg asked beats me kelly said whatever the song he was thinking about was it came from his generation not hers she added what i keep thinking about is we volunteered for this proves the army guys know what theyre talking about when they say thats a bad idea doesnt it rheinburg said a uturn at upwards of miles an hour took time and space to execute they didnt fly back over the supervolcano crater right away then they had a little while to brace themselves then the plane started bouncing some again kelly didnt think it was quite so bad this time through she might have been more ready for it as she had before she stared down at the broad expanse of what was as close as anyone was likely to see of hell on earth beyond it lay the ash beds and stuff that would become tuff how many towns and farms and roads somewhere under there professor rheinburg said vanity of vanitiesall is vanity hey no fair kelly said you cant not build something because the supervolcano goes off every years besides they built a lot before they even knew it was there they sure didand its gone now along with everything they built after they knew the grayhaired prof spoke with a grim relish that reminded kelly of colin then he switched gears and grinned at her of course looking at the bright side of things youve got a straight shot at a tenuretrack position youre one of the top experts on the worlds biggest problem for at least the rest of your life well sure assuming there are any universities left once everything shakes out kelly wouldnt let anybody outgloom her without a fight yes assuming rheinburg said so he probably won that round marshall ferguson had long since stopped taking snailmail seriously when you could email or text or talk on the phone mail with stamps on it that took days to get from hither to yon seemed downright medieval and snailmail from the other side of the continent had got slower and more erratic since the supervolcano went off to think theyd said it couldnt be done he opened the box on the ground floor of his apartment building only every other day or so he did need to check every so often because some bills still came by snailmail corporations lacked a sense of humor when you forgot to pay for cable or your utilities most of the rest of what he got was junkspam on paper spam that cost the senders a little something to print and mail that had dropped off dramatically after the eruption paper was scarce and expensive these days which made junk mail a losing proposition even the local restaurants had quit mailing out discount coupons and that was a goddamn shame he almost chucked the envelope with the bland corporate return address unopened somebody back in new york city was trying to get him to do something he likely didnt want to do whoever it was either had a stock of old envelopes or money coming out of his ears because the paper was uncommonly fine the only reason he did open it was the off chance it might be a fancy bill otherwise it would have gone straight into the recycling bin for paper he unfolded the crisp sheet inside it was stationery with the same address as the one on the envelope below that dear mr ferguson he read we are pleased to accept your story titled well why not for a future issue of new fictions a contract and a check for the appropriate payment at our standard rate of eight cents a wordare forthcoming i look forward to working with you on the story cordially and an editors scribbled signature below he read it again and then one more time by the end of the third goround he began to believe it holy shit he said softly then he started to giggle hed sent out the story because that was part of his assignment hell hed written it because that was his assignment if he hadnt been in professor bolgers class he never would have done it and now somebody wanted to pay him money for it how funny was that a moment later he said holy shit again on a different note this time if hed sold once chances were he could sell more than once having some cash coming in that wasnt straight out of his old mans wallet would be nice which was putting it mildly he didnt think you could get rich writing storieseight cents a word wasnt bad from everything hed heard but it would never make you a millionaire eitherbut that might set the stage for bigger and better which is to say more profitable things he went up to his place and sent bolger an email announcing the sale if that didnt do good things for his grade in there nothing ever would then he fished his phone out of his pocket and called his father what is it marshall came the familiar growl of course dad would know who it washe could see the number on his screen after alland of course hed be busy at the cop shop hed likely be surprised to get a call in the middle of the afternoon too sure enough the next thing he said was are you all right im fine marshall was just starting to realize how fine he was once the amazement wore off what replaced it was well more amazement guess what chicken butt dad answered as marshall had known he would that had cracked marshall up when he was little dad still did it though did he do it with other cops too marshall wouldnt have been surprised after a couple of seconds dad did add well what i sold a story marshall couldnt remember the last time hed sounded so proud of himself sold dad pronounced the word with care as if he wasnt sure hed heard it right as in for money as in three hundred and twentyseven dollars of money marshall was sure hed remember the size of his first check as long as he lived even if he hadnt seen it yet how about that his father saidone of the few phrases as dad himself noted you could use almost anywhere then his voice warmed congratulations son thats something all right whats the story called whats it about its called well why not i never know what to call things marshall hated titles he had no idea how anybody ever came up with a good one its about a guy going to college while his folks get a divorce oh dad chewed on that for a little while they do say youre supposed to write about things you know dont they yeah they say that they say the opposite too the way it looks tme is you can get away with anything when youre writing as long as you do it well enough huh that didnt sit well with dad marshall had known it wouldnt dad believed in rules with a capital r he wasnt a cop by accident as if to prove as much he went on just remember it doesnt work that way in real life if i can get them to keep paying me maybe writing will turn into real life marshall said maybe it will his father sounded surprised at the idea but getting paid resonated with him heres hopingand congratulations again sorry but ive got to get back to it i know youre working i did want to call and tell you though marshall checked his email he had an answer from bolger wtg the message said i hoped somebody in the class would make a sale now youve given the others something to shoot for yeah marshall said how jealous would the rest of the class be bigtime jealous that was how theyd have to compete against a real live published well to be published author and the girls in there would think anyone who could sell was freaking awesome he could hope they would anyhow in the meantime in the meantime marshall rolled himself a doobie about the size of pittsburgh even triumph went better with weed he was happily wasted when the sun went down towards another ridiculous gaudy overthetop beautiful sunset did dope improve that too he smoked some more to find out xvii camp constitution vanessa wondered what dumbshit adman or bureaucrat got himself a bonus for coming up with the name whoever the bastard was she would have bet her life he not only didnt live here but had never got within a thousand miles of the place camp hole in the ground would have come a lot closer to the truth truth you cant handle the truth what movie was that from she couldnt remember back a long time agoshe couldnt think of exactly when eitherswarms of people trying to get away from the dust bowl packed up whatever they had and headed for california some places in the state being of okie blood still mattered well the supervolcano had made a bigger more horrible dust bowl now the only reason even more people hadnt washed up in these camps was that a hell of a lot of wouldbe refugees ended up corpses instead as things were tens of thousands more likely hundreds of thousands maybe millions of people from at least half a dozen states wound up in camp constitution and others like it on the eastern fringe of the supervolcano eruption and more streamed in every day and there were more refugee centers in the west the biggestimaginatively tagged camp independencewas somewhere near pasco washington people whod gone west young man instead of east to flee the ash and dust wound up in them again those camps would have been larger if a lot of the folks who tried to get away from the supervolcano hadnt gone west for good fewer refugees squatted in the western camps because the population in those parts hadnt been much to begin with vanessa wondered if they could possibly be anywhere near as fucked up as camp constitution and the others around here the fema functionaries and national guard officers with the power to bind and loose in these parts swore they were doing their level best the really ry thing was vanessa believed them a welsh corgi that ran yapping at a rhinoceros was doing its level best too that wouldnt stop it from winding up smeary goop on the bottom of the rhinos big foot though the federal government and the sovereign states of oklahoma and arkansas and texas and missouri were fighting just as much out of their weight no one had looked for cities to spring up out of nowhere around here there wasnt enough of well anything to take care of the swarms whod got out of the ash clouds the supervolcano dropped all up and down the usas midsection and canadas too fema had caught and deserved holy hell for the shitty job the organization did when katrina drowned new orleans next to this new orleans looked like a stroll through the park most of the evacuees there had had homes to go back to those homes were wrecked yes and needed repair and rebuilding but what were you supposed to do when whole states were wrecked it wasnt a question of when people could start rebuilding in wyoming the question at the moment was did anything bigger than a microbe or possibly a windblown bug or two survive in wyoming vanessa had no idea how many people from the denver metropolitan area had died neither did anyone else not to the nearest hundred thousand she did know she was damn lucky not to be one of them fema had housed some of the people whod lived through katrina in trailers that stank of formaldehyde and had swarms of other things wrong with them too some of those trailersor some kind of trailers anyway trailers that looked old enough and ratty enough to have gone through the aftermath of katrinawere here at camp constitution vanessa had seen them she didnt get to stay in one they counted for luxury housing in these parts there werent enough to go around there wasnt enough of anything to go around to rate a trailer you had to be a family with a bunch of little kids and there werent enough for all of them either instead she was under canvas back in the day shed gone camping a few times shed done all the dumb things you do looked for moss on the north side of a tree toasted marshmallows over an open fire slept in a sleeping bag in a dayglo nylon tent that would have horrified every claustrophobe ever hatched this wasnt like that vanessa hadnt dreamt even the circus had tents the size of the one she lived in hell didnt the circus mostly play in the same arenas that hosted basketball teams and jowly metal bands these days she thought so but since her interest in the circus was only slightly higher than her interest in suicide she wasnt sure somebody had run up fourdecker bunks inside the tent probably somebody from the national guard her respect for the competence of the guys in the camo unis had gone up by leaps and bounds since she landed here fema people seemed more interested in explaining why you couldnt have what you wanted the guard got it for you if they possibly could she had two inches of foam rubber over a sheet of plywood for a mattress she bitched about that but not for long if she had no shoes the refugees who came in after her had no feet try as the guardsmen would they didnt have enough tents for everyone they couldnt build bunks fast enough they ran out of the mattress pads even sooner than they ran low on tents yes the mantra of fema and the guard was were doing the best we can the guard meant it fema went through the motions morton mined salt somewhere far undrground ran endless tunnels and columns that glistened white when electric light shone on them and were altogether black when it didnt wasnt that in kansas if it was the salt biz had as much trouble as everybody else vanessa had started to suspect that they mined mres the same way people swapped them around trying to get the varieties they found least obnoxious vanessa played the game but more to make the time go by than because she really cared about the relative demerits of mres making time go by was as big a challenge here as it had been back at good old garden city high and for the same reason no electricity there were charging stations for cell phones powered by chugging generators the line for them was never shorter than two hours vanessa braved it anyhow im alive she greeted her father when he answered her call you would have had a harder time phoning if you werent he agreed dad she might have known he would come out with something like that especially when she handed him such a juicy straight line all the same its good to hear from you he said im sure your mother will think so too call her next that meant vanessa was less than thrilled for one thing mom still treated her like a baby and no doubt would till the end of time for another vanessa blamed mom for breaking up her folks marriage but if blood was even slightly thicker than water it needed doing otherwise dad would have to take care of it himself he would too and then probably get plowed to wash it out of his system so she sighed and said right then she added the essentials im in camp constitution the refugee camps are all over the news i bet yup dad said how bad is it camp concentration would be a better name she dished it sucks he wasnt impressed she might have known he wouldnt be theyre swamped he said he wasnt here either or he wouldnt have added im sure theyre trying as hard as they can my ass vanessa said and then quickly listen im gonna go and save my battery you wouldnt believe what a hassle recharging is and thats almost the only electricity here he might have said goodbye but she didnt wait to hear mom said oh thank god and burst into tears when vanessa called vanessa kept the call even shorter than the one to her father again hanging up was a relief after that rob she got his voicemail hed updated it to include gigs in maine so she figured he was up there denver winter was bad enough maine was bound to be worse she left a message and called marshall yankee stadium second base yeah that was him hey kid bro believe it or else im alive vanessa waited for him to do the same kind of number on her as dad had a few minutes earlier good kind of way to be was as far as marshall went he asked the next reasonable question like where are you alive camp constitution wheres that about five miles southeast of the middle of nowhere dont you ever watch the news huh no by the way marshall said it that was one of your basic dumb questions he was probably sitting there in santa barbara totally wasted without a clue about how lucky he was then he said guess what i did i dont know are you out on bail because of it vanessa was thinking about getting busted for dope although these days that wasnt easy in california the acid bite of malice felt good any which way it would have felt even better if marshall had noticed it as if she hadnt spoken he went on i sold a story to new fictions theyre gonna pay me real money for it you did what no way that was more seagreen envy than disbelief like any good editor vanessa was sure she would make a good writer as soon as she found the time as with a lot of good editors somehow she never did that marshall could have appalled her way he said and she couldnt doubt the smugness in his voice however much she wanted to i bet i never would have done it if i wasnt taking that writing class that made me submit rrr vanessa wasnt grinding her teeth just making a noise as if she were how many times had she told herself that quitting school and making a real living instead was a good idea werent taking its contrary to fact she said automatically whatever he not only didnt know he didnt care and he was in santa barbara with electricity and hot water and food that didnt come out of cardboard boxes and taste like cardboard and hed sold a fucking story as a matter of fact yes where was the justice in that ill talk with you more later im going to save my battery vanessa trotted out her builtin excuse once more right take care yknow how baked was marshall short of calling the santa barbara pd and having them bust him vanessa had no way of doing thing one about that and since it was santa barbara half the cops probably got lit when they were off duty shit she said loudly people were walking by her through the mud nobody even looked up you heard plenty worse than that in camp constitution vanessa heard plenty worse in her own tent from the trailertrash single mom whose eleven eight and sixyearold girls were going out of their tree because they couldnt watch tv or play video games or get on facebookand from the little darlings too she looked up to the uncaring heavens the uncaring heavens started raining on her well where else would the mud have come from by the look and feel of things it was liable to start snowing pretty damn soon wouldnt that be fun when she was living under canvas and speaking of shit the wind blew harder from out of the west it brought the stink of row upon row of outhouses running water a sewage system it was to laugh how long since cholera last broke out in the land of the free and the home of the brave how long till it did again the only thing vanessa could do about it was hope she didnt get sick wow rob said and then oh wow justin nachman nodded this is white like white on rice theyd both seen snow before on squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles earlier winter forays into the cold parts of the country only this wasnt winter and rob didnt think anyone this side of an eskimo had ever seen snow like his justins thoughts ran along different though related lines he was driving and had his nose about six inches from the windshieldit looked that way to rob anyhowto try to see out better he said i keep expecting to spot a st bernard by the side of the road i wouldnt mind either a slug of brandy right now would go down nice uhhuh rob nodded the suvs heater was doing its brave best but how long would that stay good enough he had no idea what the outside temperature was but he would have bet dollars to dill pickles hed never been anywhere colder you might want to be careful if you do see a st bernard he added this is maine remember stephen king country it could be cujo you know how to cheer a guy up dont you justin said the wipers on the suv went back and forth back and forth so far they were staying pretty much even with the swirling snow rob just hoped they could keep doing it justin had the lights on but sensibly kept them on low beam all the blowing white would have reflected brights straight back into his face making it even harder for him to see where he was going hey there are worse things than giant rabid dogs rob was determined to be helpfulor something like that maybe some vampires from salems lot still flitting around its daytime justin pointed out oh yeah thats really gonna bother em in weather like this rob said besides nowadays they probably wear shades and smear themselves with spf sunscreen using technology to solve problems thats what engineerings all about thank you albert speer justin gave a straightarmed salute truncated by the suvs roof rob had only a vague notion who albert speer was a nazi what more did you need to know that wasnt him he said that was professor dinwiddie explaining why engineering majors should be proud of what they were doing and are you proud im so fucking proud i play bass in squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles so i never have to worry about another circuit board as long as i live sounds about right justin agreed now where the hell are we rob grabbed the trusty road atlas we got off i at newport right right justins head bobbed up and down maine roads suck you know now that you mention it yes rob said once you got off the interstate you fell back in time probably back to the days before beaver cleaver was even a glint in wards eye twolane winding blacktop roads too many of which hadnt been resurfaced for a long long time california it wasnt and were heading north up beyootiful route justin went on roger rob said with a little luck biff and charlie are too or what would be beautiful route if i could see through this goddamn snow any farther than i can piss justin said and we passed through the grand metropolis of corinna otherwise known as a wide spot in the road we sure did rob started singing corina corina the way he sang showed why he played bass then he looked at the map again and wet are coming up on lovely romantic dexter dexter is a bigger dot than corinna not a big dot mind you but a bigger one might even be big enough for a traffic light or two wowww the way justin brought it out he might have been stoned he might have been but he wasnt or rob didnt think he was driving while loaded was more trouble than it was worth being a cops kid rob had impressed that on the band the amount of dope he smoked when he wasnt driving also impressed if in a different way but the wowww wasnt undeserved a maine town big enough for stoplights was well on its way to cityhood or more likely had been the same size for the past seventyfive years this part of the country wasnt into cancerous growth like california they drove past a roadside traffic sign it was a yellow diamond there and gone again in the snow you might have seen the like back home but no traffic sign in california bore the silhouette of a big old deer with honking antlers bullwinkle crossing rob said it wasnt the first moose sign theyd spotted there you go justin nodded enough signs though i want to see some more real moose supposed to be bunches of em over by greenville they do tours rob said the mooses do now justin sounded surprisedand with reason he slowed down some more and he hadnt been going real fast to begin with um no rob pondered antecedents well thats a relief anyhow justin said i think the snows getting worse i didnt think it could rob said not wanting to admit he was right yeah well justin took a hand off the wheel for a vague gesture not like well have to worry about global warming for a while we shouldve torched more dinosaurs while we had the chance at the moment what they had to worry about was staying on the road and not drifting onto the shoulderwhen there was a shoulder some of the yellow signs that didnt warn about moose did let you know when there wasnt what happened when you went off the road there rob had no trouble finding an answer you flipped over and burst into flames that was what stick to the paving he urged yes mommy im working on it believe me justin answered rob shut up they finally made it into dexter it was indeed a town of some stature two or three traffic lights two gas stations a sure sign it was no dipshit village a church with a tall white steeple a graveyard now blanketed in snow and along with the subway that seemed to be far and away the most common fastfood joint in this part of maine a momandpop chinese restaurant i wonder what chinese food tastes like in the middle of moose country rob remarked i dunno but an hour after you eat some youre curious again justin said ive had some shit do that to me but never the goddamn beef chow mein rob said which of course made justin break into werewolves of london warren zevon wasnt exactly a spiritual father to squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles but he was no further removed than spiritual uncle and the kind of almostfame hed won was at the top end of what they could hop rob hadr even if dexter was a fairsized place by the standards of maine away from the interstate rolling through it took only a few minutes then they were out in the country again with snowcovered meadows and fields going back from the increasingly snowcovered road to the snowdraped pines sometimes for varietys sake the snowcovered pines came right up to the edge of the road no need for the no shoulder signs on those stretches it was pretty obvious theyd switched to route halfway through dexter it offered a more direct path to greenville than did it was also even narrower which hadnt shown on the map rob started wondering if the switch was smart he wondered even more when justin hit the brakescarefully to keep from skidding and he didnt skid either for a guy from california he was doing okay with the funky white stuff whats up rob asked accident ahead justin said flashing lights and stuff and damned if there werent rob hadnt noticed them through gods blowing dandruff good thing justin was keeping an eye peeled thats why we pay him the big bucks rob thought vaguely an accident it was with two cars and an suv one of the cars lay on its side next to the road unpleasantly reminding rob of his fretting before they got to dexter there was a big dent in the sheet metal above the rear wheel on its other side the second car and the suv were both upright but pretty well crunched a couple of the people milling around were bleeding a cop was tending to one of them red and yellow and blue lights flashed on top of his cruiser glass crunched under justins tires as he steered around the wreck only a couple of cars skirted it ahead of him on any road in la it would have tied things up for an hour on the at four in the afternoon it would have screwed traffic for the rest of the night well la county all by itself had more people than fortytwo statesor was it fortythree rob couldnt remember maine was definitely one of them charlie and biff are still with us justin said as he picked up a little more speed i could get used to a heated sideview mirror i wouldnt be able to see squat without it okay great but how often would you need it in california rob asked depends on how cold it gets right if california turns into like washington state itll freeze sometimes huh rob said thoughtfully that hadnt occurred to him and it should have then something else did if los angeles is the new seattle like fifty is the new thirty justin interrupted helpfully my ass rob said they both laughedeasy enough when neither of them had seen the old thirty yet he went on like i was saying if las the new seattle what does that make maine the new north pole nah wont be that bad justin said more like the new labrador happy day rob said in distinctly unhappy tones ten months of winter and two months of bad skiing you think youre kidding dont you i wish rob rolled his eyes the next interesting question is how the hell do we ever get out of here if the snowdrifts are as high as an elephants eye and they stay that way nobody goes in or out near enough youve got something im afraid justin said and when they start running out of food and heating oil his voice trailed off if you wanted to you could imagine this whole statehell you could imagine everything north of bostonfading away like that remind me again why we took that gig in greenville rob said its called money justin explained bringing some in every once in a while instead of spending it all the goddamn time is supposed to be good i think i remember that anyway its been a while hasnt it rob sighed i still wish like hell wed been going down to key west or something when the supervolcano blew new england its over with here uhhuh and you knew ahead of time that yellowstone was going to go kablooie like hamster hughie justin was as big a calvin and hobbes fan as rob was that sensibilityif you wanted to call it a sensibilityalso rubbed off on the band the bitch of it was rob had known or known as much as anybody not a geologist could it wasnt as if dad hadnt gone on about the supervolcano whenever they talked rob had tuned out most of it what were you going to do when your father went on and on about stuff he got from his new girlfriend especially when she wasnt a whole lot older than you were too late to worry about it now he said with another sigh you got that right justin clicked the wipers from regular to high it did less good than he must have hoped it would he slowed down some more the snow on the road was getting thicker i wonder if were going to make it to greenville this thing is the size of an armored personnel carrier its got fourwheel drive and snow tires rob said you gonna let mother nature dick around with us i may not have a choice you fight with mother nature youre fighting one big mother justin answered rob looked out the window not much to see but blowing white and through it alreadyfallen white he wondered if he ought to be looking for gigantic rabid st bernards or maybe vampires for real no sunshine to slow em down and none likely any time soon dexter was a big enough deal that the next village up instead of enjoying its own name went by north dexter up the road a ways from it was an italianmexican restaurant rob saw the neon sign in spite of the snow the restaurant itself set back from the road was barely visible mexican food in maine justin mused you think the chinesed be weird what about that youre not stopping are you rob said with mockperhaps not so mockanxiety nope greenville or bust justin said they chugged on a streak of red shot across the road it was there and then gone justin had time to take his foot off the gas but not enough to bring it down on the brake the fuck was that rob asked wondering if hed really seen it well im pretty sure it wasnt a moose brilliant deduction a lesser mind would be incapable of it yeah i know justin said smugly my best guess is it was a foxand not the kind that walks on two legs a fox cool there werent so many of them in california california had coyotes instead coyotes thought fourlegged foxes were tasty the map insisted there was a village called sangerville just before route ran into route rob saw another snowcovered graveyard off to the right which made him look out for vampires again other than that damn all suggested human beings had ever lived anywhere near here he flipped to the back of the road atlas it insisted that sangerville had people if the place did most of them in the classic phrase came disguised as empty seats when deadended at justin said i go left right rightleft rob agreed if you go right you head away from greenville and toward doverfoxcroft doverfoxcroft justin echoed bizarre man i mean i know a lot of people with hyphenated names these days who doesnt but a town i just work here rob said thats what the map says however they got married theyre a bigger place than dexter or even newport theyre in bigger type and the town sign is a white circle with a little black dot in it not just a black dot placell be boston before we know it justin dutifully swung the suv to the left next town ahead is guilford its a mile or two from here rob said still eyeing the rand mcnally the road forks there we stay on heading northwest next place after guilford is abbott village and then north abbott no north guilford justin asked as a matter of fact there is a north guilford but its not on its on some halfassed side road this road were on is halfassed justin said accurately well then the other ones quarterassed rob corrected himself as things turned out they were counting chickens they never got to see they didnt even make it quite as far as guilford it wasnt that the blizzard got worse though it did the accident down below north dexter hadnt closed down the whole damn road this one did a hummer had slammed into an eighteenwheeler headon rob didnt know how fast the guy in the hummer had been going fast seemed a pretty good guess a hummer was half again as big and twice as heavy as any other suv in captivity a hummer was a fucking bad joke was what a hummer was no wonder the market for them tanked le mot juste when gas prices took off at the end of the aughts this particular hummer was scrap metal with the whole front end stove in the windshield glass was starred and bulged outward on the drivers side what cops kid couldnt read that sign the jerk behind the wheelhey he was speeding in a hummer so of course he was a jerkhadnt been wearing his seat belt the only question now was whether he only needed a dentist and a plastic surgeon or a neurosurgeon that assumed he had any brains left at all which also wasnt obvious and hed done a number on the eighteenwheeler too hed rammed it hard enough to flip it over onto its side and jackknife it that would have shafted the santa ana freeway on a narrow twolane road in maine the brokennosed cab lay on the shoulder to one side diesel fuel dribbling out into the snow from the punctured fuel tank like blood from a cut jugular the trailer stretched all the way across the asphalt to the other shoulder fuck me up the asshole justin said and that about covered that he eased to a stop several other cars had already had to stop in front of them some people had got out to do what they could for the injured or else just to get a better look at the mess charlie and biff stopped two cars behind justin and rob more cars pulled up behind them nobody would be going anywhere around here any time soon justin found a question where are the cops maybe theyre on the guilford side and we cant see em rob answered or maybe theyre on their way from doverfoxcroft he would have bet on the latter doverfoxcroft was a good bit bigger than guilford in the meantime lets see if we can do anything useful he opened the door cold bit at him ll bean knew their business though as soon as he zipped up his anorak he stopped freezing hed never owned long johns before this trip to maine he was damn glad now that hed bought some his nose stayed cold but what the hell he figured that made him a nice healthy mutt an older guy whod already got out nodded at him i aint seen nothin like this since i was in eyeraq he said and pointed to a body lying behind the hummer someone had draped a coat over its head youre lucky hes covered up he aint pretty not even a little bit i believe it like anyone from la rob had seen road carnage now and then hed also seen some of the grisly photos in his fathers books when he was a kid hed used them to gross vanessa out he wasnt supposed to look at those books himself much less give his little sister nightmares with them hed got a spanking when vanessa ratted on him dad wasnt the kind to figure corporal punishment warped you for life his old man had licked him plenty and hed turned out all right so thinking about that was more pleasant than remembering what lay under the coat rob made himself ask anybody else in the suv ayuh the older man answered which meant he came from these parts and also meant yes there was a gal she had her belt on so she didnt go into the windshield but her leg got tore up pretty good and she maybe busted some ribs they done took her back to the clinic in guilford how about the trucker rob found the next logical question he aint bad cuts bruises somethin sprainedmaybe bustedin one foot he was up high like might notve got hurt at all hardly if the goddamn hummer didnt flip his rig youve got to be nuts to drive like that in this kind of weather rob said ayuh the older man repeated well some folks are and thats the long and short of it they figure their shit dont stink and nothin can go wrong with em no matter what kind of assholery they pull im here to tell you things dont work that way he jerked a thumb at the hummers late driver he aint gonna tell you nothin not no more how long will it take to clear this mess off the road rob wondered beats me the local didnt sound worried about it of course he didnt have a gig in greenville tonight almost cheerily he went on christ only knows where from theyll have to bring in a tow truck big enough to shift these fuckers guilford aint got onei know that for a fact i dont believe doverfoxcroft does either greenville mebbe or newport where the interstate goes through all this snow take forever to get here too might as well relax and set a spell know what i mean yeah rob was damned if hed make a noise like ayuh he unhappily mooched back to the waiting justin seeing him coming biff and charlie got out of the trailing suv to hear the news rob made it short and sweet were fucked theyve got no idea when theyre gonna be able to clear the road that like sucks biff wasnt long on words but he got the point we cant even turn around charlie said there were cars behind them and westbound cars in the eastbound lane some jackasses always figured they could dodge trouble if they broke the rules once in a while they did more often as now they screwed things up for themselves and everybody else i think id better call greenville and let em know we aint gonna make it rob reached into his pocket for his cell phone the promoter didnt sound brokenhearted well cancel all right he said we didnt get as much advance sale as we wanted and people sure wont be coming into town in weather like this which was all true but left squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles stranded in the middle of maine with not a gig in sight xviii when flights to los angeles finally resumed marcus wilson gave bryce a ride from lincoln to omaha thanks for everything bryce said when they pulled up in front of the terminal i dont know what i would have done without everybody from the department here hey man after what you went through i dont know if id ever have the nerve to get on another plane again as long as i live the other grad student answered if im gonna get home ive gotta fly bryce said that wasnt exactly true i was open and some ordinary travel was allowed on itbut not much it was the lifeline between socal and points east and most of the traffic was trucks passenger rail service had been cut off altogether it was all freight all the time as far as the railroads were concerned he got out and strapped on his backpack all his meager stuff fit in it no need to pay the thieving airlines for the great privilege of checking a bag since he had a boarding pass he headed straight for security getting through was a breezeall the more so when you were used to dealing with lax and ohare close to people lived in omaha which made it a city of decent size but youd never mistake it for chicago his gate had a big tv screen hanging down from the ceiling like most airport tvs it was tuned to cnn headline news bryce usually turned his back on the goddamn thingswas there no place you could escape them but the headline below the pretty girl who read the teleprompter made his eyes snap back even if she didnt nuclear strikes on tel aviv tehran oh fuck he said and then looked around to see if anybodyd heard him no one was giving him an offended look anyhow he would have bet he wasnt the only one here whod come out with something like that when you saw a headline with nuclear strikes in it what else could you say the screen cut away from the pretty announcer to show slagged ruins loss of life in the israeli coastal city is believed to be extremely heavy said acorrespondent with an english accent the prime minister has vowed an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth bryce expected footage of devastated tehran to follow hard on the heels of that biblical threat instead the attractive newsreader came back on this just in she said breathlessly a flash of quote sunlike light unquote has appeared over the iranian holy city of qom and communications with qom seem to have been lost it is not known whether the grand ayatollahthe real powerholder in iranwas in qom when it was struck the woman whod stopped next to bryce to watch the news crossed herself that was more elegant and restrained than cussing whether the sentiment it expressed was so very different might be another question with us now is retired marine lieutenant colonel randolph cullenbine our military analyst the pretty newswoman said colonel cullenbine what is americas likely response to this double tragedy in the middle east randolph cullenbine wasnt pretty he looked like well a retired marine officer shorthaired bluntfeatured wideshouldered tough he talked like a tv guy though it seems probable that iran was trying to take advantage of the usas perceived weakness weve had the middle of the country badly degraded and the launch sites of many of our landbased icbms are currently unusable due to ash and lava laid down by the supervolcano huh bryce said and he wasnt the only one in the boarding area to make some kind of surprised noise he hadnt worried about where uncle sam parked his missiles uncle sam hadnt either maybe he should have but we still have our missilecarrying submarines and our manned bombers right the newswoman asked oh absolutely cullenbine nodded we arent defenseless no matter what the ayatollahs may believe and neither are the israelis these were their strikes not ours i have multiple sources confirming that whats likely to come next the newswoman asked the question as if she feared the answerand well she might i dont know kathleen right now the only people who do know are whoevers in charge in iran and the israeli prime minister the military analyst sounded thoroughly grim which made more sense than most of what you saw on tv these days it depends on how many missiles the iranians have left and on whether they feel like using them and it depends on how massive a retaliation the israelis intend to take they have enough bombs to destroy most if not all of irans major cities that would put the death toll in the millions if not the tens of millions thank you the pretty newswoman said in about the tone youd use to thank a dentist after a root canal do you think this would have happened if the supervolcano hadnt erupted not a chance lieutenant colonel cullenbine replied at once the perceived weaknesshe liked that phraseof the united states after the disaster had to be what galvanized the iranians into motion he bared his teeth in what wasnt quite a smile they forgot that israel was plenty able to take care of itself but we may have to look for other trouble spots coming to the boil too and we wont be able to do as much about them as we might have before we landed in so much trouble of our own they started boarding then when his group got called bryce turned away from the tv and walked to the jetway along with the rest of the paying sheep he filed aboard the airliner he tried not to think about what had happened the last time he flew trying not to think of a green monkey after somebody talked about one would have been easier he didnt expect to end up in a lake again ending up dead that he worried about takeoff was smooth enough the pilot came on the intercom to say well be using a southerly route to get to los angeles today theres no report of any unusual activity from the supervolcano caldera but well give it an extrawide berth anyhow we expect to arrive at lax on timemaybe even fifteen minutes early if the headwinds cooperate so relax and enjoy the flight bryce wondered if hed ever enjoy a flight again right this minute he would have bet against it he had a window seat before long he started seeing signs of the eruption despite rain and snow gray volcanic ash still dulled broad swaths of landscape things wouldnt have been very green at this season in any year less so now and that got truer as they flew farther west even the rockies looked like gray ghosts of their old selves not nearly so rocky as they should have up right by the eruption where lava and ash and sludge or whatever the hell they called it lay hundreds of feet thick they would given enough centuries turn into more rock down here they just made a godawful mess of hundreds of thousands of square miles a southerly route the pilot had said presumably that took the plane well south of whatever was left of denver buildingsnot a lot of people not any more vanessa had made it out of town before things got as bad as they could get bryce had heard that from susan whod heard it from colin for quite a while susan had been weirded out because bryce stayed friends with his exs dad for all bryce knew she still was but shed decided it didnt threaten her so she didnt worry about it out loud any more bryce was glad he knew vanessa was alive that shed dropped him like a live grenade wasnt enough to wish on her the kind of end those yearold rhinos on display in lincoln had got maries disease bryces mouth twisted before the supervolcano not one person in a million had ever heard of it he knew damn well he hadnt since the eruption though everybody knew its name it was on the news all the time sometimes called hpo because no one but a medical specialist wanted to come out with hypertrophic pulmonary osteodystrophy if he could help it it had sickened and killed thousands in denver and salt lake city and topeka and pocatello and saskatoon and all the places in between so far as anybody knew it was incurable there were cries for research for treatment in normal times the feds and private foundations would have thrown money at it till it yielded up its secrets bryce supposed some research on it was going on but with untold millions of refugees with the countrys economy shot to hell with hideous crop failures with the prospect of years if not decades or centuries of frigid weather even maries disease had to stand in line and wait flight attendants came down the aisle flogging their overpriced boxes of what was allegedly good bryce hadnt bought anything in the airport the way he usually did he hated giving the airlines money for stuff that shouldnt have rated a fee he didnt pay them this time rubbery cheese on what the stewardess kept calling artisan bread why did they grind artisans into flour was less than appealing hed be hungry when he got back to la but he wouldnt starve then he said urk the guy in the aisle seat gave him a funny look bryce didnt care urk was exactly what he meant his car had been sitting in one of the satellite parking lots at lax since he headed for chicago before the supervolcano blew the battery was bound to be dead by now and at twelve bucks a day hed have to come up with several hundred dollars to get it out of hock in a rational reasonable world he would have been able to talk to some parking honcho explain how he was lucky to be alive and even luckier to be back in california and let people know he hadnt meant to leave his car in the lot so long the honcho would have nodded and forgiven his fee except for the part he would have paid had he come home on time the words rational and reasonable did not go along with the acronym lax they never had odds were they never would the airport was as dedicated to separating the people who used it from their cash as the airlines were themselves that was saying somethingsomething filthy bryce resigned himself to forking over the dough he wouldnt even try to take care of that today all he wanted to do was get back to his apartmentoh and jump on susan once he did the car would wait another day or two the bill would get correspondingly bigger but wtf everything the airliner flew over now seemed to be the same shade of grayish browneverything for hundreds and hundreds of miles no doubt the depth of the ash varied but jesus god there was a lot of it and the sunlight that shone on it seemed weak almost consumptive bryce had wondered if getting seven miles up in the air would make the light look more the way it had in preeruption days nope a nice thought but no and that made sense when you worked it through if the supervolcano had blasted particulate matter twenty or twentyfive miles up into the stratosphere a mere seven wouldnt make much difference when the engines roar changed pitch bryce tensed he feared hed be a nervous flier the rest of his days were beginning our descent into the los angeles metropolitan area the pilot announced and he relaxed some we will be landing about ten minutes ahead of schedule coming in to lax from the east you flew over builtup country for about fifteen minutes at jetliner speeds that translated into a lot of miles and a hell of a lot of metropolitan area bryce didnt know of any other flying approach even remotely like it lawns here were green that jolted him with its novelty for one thing the ashfall in southern california hadnt been bad enough to kill off the grass before rain could wash the ash away for another they hadnt had any freezes from what susan told him the weather was colder than usual but not that much colder not yet the last thing an airliner did before touching down on the runway was to fly low across the almost low enough to look out the window and read the cars licenseplate numbers as they zoomed by if they zoomed by if the san diego freeway had coagulated as it so often did you could probably tell whether a drivers fingerprints were whorls or loops a bumpnot a very big oneand they were down bryce let out a long slow sigh hed spent a lot of time wondering if hed ever make it back a few minutes of that had been sheer terror wondering whether hed stay alive longer than those few minutes the rest was on a rather lower key but no less sincere even so please remain seated with your seat belts securely fastened a flight attendant droned you may now use your cell phones and other approved electronic devices passengers were already doing it did the airlines really believe people didnt know the ropes bryce didnt think it was about controlling the occasional moron more on the order of dotting is and crossing ts this way if anything did go wrong some corporate lawyer could truthfully testify it hadnt gone wrong because the airline failed to make the proper offerings to the godsuh failed to deliver the appropriate warnings since they were early he made his own call to be sure susan had got there hi sweetie she said yeah im down in baggage claim cant wait to see you boy does that work both ways he answered were coming to the gate now so itll only be a few more minutes it took longer than that his seat was well back of the wing everybody in front of him seemed to need to wrestle a carryon the size of a wellfed nebraska porker out of the overstrained overhead luggage bins airlines hadnt intended that to happen when they started charging for checked baggage but it did at last he escaped the plane a stewardess insincere thank you seemed a fitting sendoff for what got more unpleasant every time he did it but the whole crew had worked wonders when his last flight had to go into branch oak lake remembering how nasty air travel was these days he also needed to remember that he trudged past shops and restaurants and other gates they gave you every chance to part with your money all right bryce bought a musketeers and inhaled chocolate and nougat his steps got bouncier as soon as he did blood sugar was a good thing yes indeed now hed last till he could get outside of some real food down the escalator past one baggage carousel after another some still others spinning all of them made from articulated bits of armor plate as elaborate as henry viiis steel suit there was his flight number up in glowing red above a carousel that had just started to move there was susan she saw him at the same time as he spotted her jesus she looked good he hurried toward her then he saw his mother standing behind susan barbara miller was easy not to notice she was short and plain with mousebrown hair going gray these past few years she had on her usual outfit trainers she still called them tennis shoes trackpants and a polyester top shed taken off a cotton sweater and draped it over her arm bryce hugged her too hi mom he said then he said it again when he saw her eyes on his mouth her hearing was starting to go though she was too vain to admit it he loved her without taking her seriously hed outgrown her by the time he turned sixteen what could you do susan sent me an email and asked if i wanted to come along to pick you up so i said sure she told him thats great mom he lied without worrying about it good to see you good to see you she said after he repeated himself again i was so worried such a terrible thing she was inventing emotions after the fact she couldnt have known he was airborne while the supervolcano erupted till after it happened well people did such things all the time then she added your father would have been proud of you for being so brave his father had died when he was twelve maybe colin ferguson filled some of the hole that left in his life maybe that was why bryce had stayed close to him after vanessa said byebye he could worry about such things later though if he bothered for now brave there wasnt any time to be brave we got out as fast as we could and we floated in the lake till the boats got us youre too modest youre always too modest listen i made a chicken last night the prices these days its robbery i tell you but ive got almost a whole bird left over if you and susan want to stop in when you drop me off you could have something to eat theres potatoes too and a black forest cake from ralphs bryce raised an eyebrow at susan she threw the ball right back to him whatever you want is fine with me thanks a bunch he thought should he make like a dutiful son or go back to his place screw himself silly and then sleep for about a week he knew what he wanted to do he also knew hed hurt his mothers feelings if he did it mom wouldnt say anything but shed find plenty of other ways to rub his nose in what was going on she always did with a sigh he couldnt quite swallow he said chicken sounds good i havent eaten much home cooking lately that had the added virtue of being true he appealed to susan one more time if its okay with you its fine i already told you she said quickly she wasnt going to play the villain whisking bryce away from barbara so she could work her carnal wiles on him damn i sure wish she would he thought as they started off toward the parking structure squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles still hadnt seen greenville and the haunting romantic shores of moosehead lake by now rob was as near certain as made no difference that the band never would get there he wasnt nearly so sure about whether they would ever get out of guilford it wasnt where hed expected to end up which meant as close to nothing as didnt matter by the time the locals finally cleared the smashed hummer and the flipped and jackknifed eighteenwheeler from route he and justin and biff and charlieand a lot of other people trapped by the wreckwere glad to get into guilford that was definitely preferable to freezing to death in the snow the other main choice the longer he stayed the odder and more interesting guilford seemed for a town of just over people it had a lot going on the piscataquis river ran through it once upon a time every maine town with a stream had had waterpowered mills and factories guilford still did no one seemed to have bothered to tell the locals water mills were hopelessly outdated this nineteenthcentury anachronism remained a going concern a lifetime after most of the others had closed down and there was the trebor mansion inn where the band currently resided you took a diagonal rightnot a straight right or youd end up somewhere elseby the shell station near the eastern end of town went past the slough and the high school on the other side of the street climbed a hill hung a left into a long driveway whose outlet you barely noticed from the street and there you were the trebor by god mansion inn charlie stared at it in something approaching awe when he and his bandmates got out of their suvs wow he saidnot the usual stoners slurred wow but one that showed he really meant it he proceeded to explain why if this place doesnt have an h p lovecraft slept here plaque somedy dropped the ball somewhere of course old hp spent most of his time down in providence but he shouldve made a side trip for this no dude biff shook his head h p lovecraft started in chicago but they were working out of san francisco when they made their records confusion and argument followed charlie had never heard of h p lovecraft the band biff didnt know about the writer from whom the band took its name rob vaguely knew about both justin by all appearance knew neither how come you know about this band he demanded of biff theyre way older than you are and they never got big that was an understatement and a healthy one too my dad got me into them believe it or else biff answered suitably shamefaced at the admission he told me he lost his cherry with white ship on the stereo youd remember that all right rob agreed he didnt think of creepy horror writers or san francisco psychedelia when he looked at the trebor mansion inn he remembered a couple of enormous pseudovictorian office buildings hed seen in the san fernando valley the last time the band played there steep roofs funky shingles a tower or two yeah this place had the look all right but there was a difference la had buildings that looked like anything and everything that had ever been under the sun and they were all phonies run up by modernday realestate guys and construction crews to make some client happy or at least willing to spend money roman spanish victorian halftimbered tudor the odd hot dog or donut you name it socal imitated it whatever the trebor mansion inn was rob was convinced it was no imitation it had been sitting here since sometime in the s it was older than someall of the snowcovered pines around it that steeply pitched roof was no architects whimsy it helped keep snow from piling up there a cat gave the newcomers a onceover it was very large and very furry both assets in weather like this there was a name for that breed a name rob was still groping for when justin said thats a maine coon rob thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand doh he said as if hed escaped from a simpsons episode and magically acquired a third dimension if you were in maine and met a big fuzzy feline what else would it be rob had a bad habit of answering his own rhetorical questions even when he didnt ask them out loud if you met a big fuzzy feline around here it was liable to be a lynx a man came out of the inn he was a generation older than the guys from squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles with a full head of graying brown hair he wore a thick wool sweater over a shirt whose collar protected his neck from the scratchy stuff and a pair of black jeans the sweater looked warm but not warm enough for this weather but rob knew he was a wuss about cold hello gentlemen the fellow said if one of you is about to give birth i may be able to offer you a manger a pregnant pause followed after a couple of beats justin said somebody at the gas station told us you might be able to put us up for a while um thats what he just said justin rob pointed out justin worked it through he looked comically astonished when he finished youre right he exclaimed he made as if to tug his curly forelock to the innkeeper sorry about that i not to be stupid all the time an admirable ambition the older man said fog gusting from his mouth at every word about as much as anyone can hope for too the world being what it is im dick barber at your service he stuck out his hand one by one the guys in the band shook it and gave their names rob who was last added put us all together and were squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles are you the name didnt faze barber and here i thought that was a plastic band even without an ono not plastic us biff said proudly when the word was made flesh two thousand years ago they started a religion about it in our capitalist times we incarnate the sale catalogue instead barber said wow charlie repeated in the same tone hed used when he got his first good look at the trebor mansion inn who wouldve thought wed run into a dude who was crazy the right way here you just washed up on these shores i got here not too long after you were born barber said sure as hell he didnt talk as if hed lived in maine his whole life ayuh might never have crossed his lips he went on you will have to bear in mind that this isnt exactly our high season no huh rob did his best to sound like a dry martini that was the best way to deal with his father he suspected it was the right approach with this guy too dick barber smiled fractionally not so youd notice but we will do our best to accommodate youassuming the snow lets up sooner or later if it doesnt well welcome to guilford he did remind rob of dad enough to make him ask were you ever a cop before you got the uh mansion inn a cop no barber shook his head but i did spend twelve years in the navy maybe thats what youre noticing i bet it is rob said my father was in the navy and hes a police officer now thats right charlie broke in did h p lovecraft ever visit this place hes in the tower barber pointed up to it bob and his bandmates all goggled at him that small smile came and went again the older man condescended to explain in paperback ive got a few shelves of books for guests who stay up there dibs rob said before any of the other californians could beat him to the punch you do need to know the tower has no plumbing fixtures dick barber said those are off the room below you should probably be on good terms with whoevers staying down there me did justin sound pleased or just resigned what he added didnt tell rob much on that score weve been putting up with each other for a long time so have biff and i charlie said is there another room on that floor there is right across the hall from the one below the tower barber said if you need anything holler and bribe the help theyre my grandchildren and they can use the cash rob started to laugh then he realized tlder man meant it this was an interesting place all kinds of ways he wondered if the tab would be similarly interesting how much more bad news could the bands plastic stand considering the rates places in bar harbor gouged out of customers he couldnt begin to guess what barber would charge figuring it was better to know what they were getting into before they got in too deep he took a deep breath and asked the obvious question you can stay on the house for a while barber answered we dont cook for you unless you bring in the food unless you pay off the laundry fairy you wont get clean linenbut i already told you that didnt i youre not costing us much technically weve been closed since labor day thats when the season ends here pretty much but its okay you dont want to be sleeping in your cars in this delightful weather for nothing rob could hardly believe his ears are you sure man justins look told him he was an idiot for checking a gift horses teeth rob didnt need the look hed already realized that for himself now hed given barber another chance to shaft them i said it i meant it barber replied i usually mean what i say these days that means im hideously out of place in about ninetyeight percent of the country in guilford i fit in fine thats one of the reasons i like it here dad would fit here too rob thought his father sure didnt fit in la no matter how long hed lived there la turned the lie into an art form but that was beside the point thank you very much mr barber rob said his bandmates chorused agreement youre welcomeand im dick you may as well get used to it the innkeeper said you talked about bringing food in biff said where do we get it to bring in weve got a little grocery and a meat market supermarkets in doverfoxcroft ten fifteen minutes east closest place to buy a meal is calvins kitchen down on water street they make a decent breakfast and a halfway decent burger they do dinner too but i wouldnt a couple of blocks farther west theres a subway barber said rob found himself nodding if there was going to be anything in a little place like this in maine odds were itd be a subway dick barber added theres a rite aid close to the subway too you can find almost anything theremaybe not the exact style or brand you want but you can yup rob nodded if you spent a lot of time on the road that was one of the things you learned drugstores werent always deep but they were very wide anyway if youre looking for something that isnt a breakfast joint or subway try doverfoxcroft barber said there youve got the golden arches not exactly an improvement on subway but not the same anyhow and theres a chinese place cantonese but its sort of half hong kong and half maine if you know what i mean sounds like that mexican place we ate at in where the hell was it justin looked to rob rob couldnt remember hed eaten in too many mexican places in too many towns but charlie said i know the one you mean wasnt that madison madison rob echoed once charlie put a finger on it it came back to him too it wasnt bad but it wasnt what youd call mexican eierehat cheese was so wisconsinoh my god they brought their gear out of the suvs and into the trebor mansion inn there was a family area which seemed overrun by cats and a guest area not much warmer than the snowstorm outside barber hadnt been kidding when he said they werent looking for business this time of year youve got radiators in your rooms he told them theyll warm things upeventually and youve got plenty of blankets genuine wool too we havent sheared any acrylics or skinned any naugas the tower room had a trapdoor and a ladder you could pull up after you this is awesome rob exclaimed when he saw the arrangements when i was twelve years old you never would have got me out of here well maybe when you had to take a leak justin was more pragmatic if you werent twelve years old the tower wasnt perfect you couldnt stand up straight in it except right in the middle the bed wasnt exactly a bed it was a mattress and box spring on the floor if you were sixone like rob your feet hung out over the trapdoor space when you lay down on it but there was plenty to read the shelves set into the wall over the mattress held history books mysteries bestsellers from about the time rob was born and some science fiction he always checked out the books when he walked into a furniture store or a restaurant that used them as part of the decor hed got the habit from his father now he had his own odd assortment justin grabbed a fat book about tank battles on the russian front in world war ii this should either keep me awake all night or knock me out better than valium he said which would you rather rob asked he had a panoramic view up here at the moment he had a view of snow swirling this way that way and now and then the other way too through it he could dimly make out the back sides of some of the buildings on water street that tall stack did it belong to the water mill closer was snowcovered ground with pines of assorted sizes sticking up out of it at random something prowled across it another maine coon the critter peered up into one of the pines a red squirrel stared down at it bushy tail lashing as the squirrel chewed out the cat from a safe distance justin answered him but he was so busy watching the little drama outside that he had to ask the lead singer to repeat himself with a snooty sniff justin did i said it probably doesnt matter much one way or the other it sure looks like we arent going anywhere for a while winter in lovely charming guilford maine a new reality show coming soon to a cable network near you the other title is say hello to the new ice age hello new ice age justin said obediently rob laughed then he looked out at the blowing snow again i was just kidding he said oh sure justin agreed but was god well the blames gotta stick to somebody why not to him rob answered justin said not a word outside the snow kept falling xix the computer in colins study had a twentyfiveinch monitora good size even these days all the same he had trouble taking in the scale of the photoshe flash drive kelly stuck into one of his usb ports i see red and black could be just about anything maybe a volcano or maybe a bunch of shots from somebodys colonoscopy kelly gave him a severe look back when we first met in yellowstone you said the country didnt get its enemas there it gotem in providence he kissed her migawdyou were listening to me im not used to that any more nobody whos raised children is she laughed he only wished he were joking one of these days she might find out for herself that was part of the reason hed asked her down to la not all of it but part she said youre looking down at yellowstonefor all i know the part of it where the west thumb used to befrom about forty thousand feet no telephoto no zoom this is pretty much what i saw when i looked out the learjets window you were dumb to go i knew youd say that her look got more severe she was an adult she expected to be treated as one colin only sighed he couldnt do anything about it especially after the fact he studied the picture again so its miles from one side here to the other he thought about it for a little while and whistled softly thatssomething isnt it reminds me of the spaceprobe photos from which moon of jupiter is it that looks like a sausageandanchovy pizza io kelly dropped severity and laughed again it does look like a pizza doesnt it you come out with the strangest stuff sometimes but youre right about that wish i could take credit for it but i read it somewhere colin replied and speaking of coming out with strange stuff he stopped muttering to himself this wasnt how hed wanted to do things dammit open mouth jam in foot the story of my life he thought why what other strange stuff was on your mind kelly asked he sent her a sharp look but couldnt read the one she gave back that he couldnt read it threw gasoline on his everactive suspicions did she already know or at least have suspicions of her own theyd been going together for two and a half years now probably something wrong with her if she didnt have suspicions by now or maybe something was wrong with him for not getting to this point a hell of a lot sooner only one way to find out he took a deep breath even so it was a good thing they were sitting side by side because when he asked dyou want to marry me kelly she couldnt have heard him if shed been on the far side of the room sure she said he blinked hed been expecting and hoping for yes and braced against no anything but one of those or the other screwed up his mental iff for a few seconds then he processed the meaning in the unexpected response is that anything like yes he said wanting to leave no possible doubt sure she said again this time with mischief in her voice you he pulled a small velvet box out of the trouser pocket where his keys usually lived well since it is kind of like yes you may want to have a look at this too kelly opened the box the spring hinge clicked when she did even the compact fluorescent in the ceiling fixture was plenty to make the diamonds in the ring sparkle her eidened ooh she said softly pretty try it on colin urged okay she slipped it onto her finger then she smiled i like the way it looks and it fits too i wont need to get it sized or anything how did you do that i hired a guy who used to work for the kgb back when there was a kgb and a ussr and a bunch of other initials running around loose these days he smuggles blintzes and borscht in from brooklyn he went through your creditcard records and your cellphone bills till he found your ring size in there and he only needed to start working on it a year and a half before i met you he spoke with such assurance he might have been convincing a jury that no one else could possibly have pulled off this homeinvasion robbery when you talk like that i start believing you no matter how much bs you come out with kelly said its a good thing i love you or youd really be in trouble its a good thing you love me or id really be in trouble colin echoed by his tone he meant something different with the same words he went on good thing i love you too darn good thingbest thing thats happened to me since i dont know when i like that kelly nodded and if we both say it the same way thirty years from now well have done something right heres hoping colin said hed thought the same thing or close enough when he said i do with louise and they did and then they didnt not thirty years worth anyhow i would drink to that here but id rather go out to dinner and do it there how does miyamoto sound too funky for words kelly answered hed taken her there before lets go she added pulling the flash drive out of the computer then she spread her fingers the way women do when they flash a new ring the diamonds did some more flashing of their own miyamoto was a san atanasio institution of sorts despite the japanese name it was a polynesian place one of the last survivors of what had been a common breed of restaurant in southern california around the time colin was born it had easter island heads and tiki torches out front the appetizers featured things like rumaki and foilwrapped chicken things you just didnt see in other places any more the surfandturf was lobster and teriyaki steak the waitresses wore leis the bartender made rum drinks you normally wouldnt find anywhere this side of honolulu two scorpions colin told the waitress as they sat down in their bambooframed booth hey what am i gonna drink kelly said colin probably gaped the waitress cracked upshe hadnt heard that one before and it caught her by surprise one scorpion for each of us colin said carefully still chuckling the gal in the lei went back to pass along the order colin wondered how many times hed come here with louise over the years a lot but he liked the place too much to cede it to her after they broke up hed never seen her here since that might have been coincidence or maybe teo was too organic to want to pollute his system with the highcholesterol goodies miyamoto dished out more for me if he is coin thought less happily hed also come back once since the split to investigate a robbery the waitress brought back a couple of scorpions each almost big enough to swim in they spelled er k with a u here even they wouldnt serve you more than two zombies that made sense because you werent just drunk after two of those you were fucking embalmed are you ready to order yet she asked she scribbled what they wanted and went away again before the food came the owner wandered over to say hello stan miyamoto was short and stocky he was about colins age his son had graduated from san atanasio high in vanessas class i want to say one more time what a good cop you are he was talking more to kelly than to colin the way you caught those guys who held us up the way you sent them to prison part of the job colin didnt want to tell miyamoto the only way the crooks could have been dumber was to wear bust me signs to change the subject he went on stan this is my fiancee kelly birnbaum the owner of course had come over to say hello when colin visited with louise too you never would have guessed by his smile congratulations you are a lucky lady ms birnbaum i think so i hope so kelly said miyamoto turned back to colin so you celebrate tonight do you we sure do he agreed and you choose to do it here dinner on the house it was kindly meant colin knew that back when he was starting out he would have thanked stan and enjoyed it but the world had changed for better for worse for different anyhow stan i cant he said id like to but i just cant too darn many regulations about police officers and gratuities youre gonna have to take my money whether you like it or not now there was a sentence you didnt get to trot out every day i am not doing this for lieutenant ferguson the owner said stiffly i am doing this for colin ferguson who is my friend i hope he is my friend i hope so too but if you want to put your friends behind in a sling youll feed him a free dinner the city council and the accountants would land on me like a ton of bricks they should get in an uproar about things that need uproar heaven knows there are enough of them in this town by the way stan miyamoto said it he could think of three or four himself but he didnt try to insist any more shaking his head he went back to the kitchens quietly kelly said i bet a lot of cops would have taken him up on that i bet they would have got away with it too i bet youre right colin shrugged if it doesnt bother them it doesnt thats all it bothers me if i keep my nose clean all the time i never need to worry about remembering which lies i told to which people and if i dont give an inch i dont have to worry about giving a mile either makes sense to me she quirked an eyebrow at him though if i get a ticket i guess you wont fix it for me good guess colin had never fixed any for louise or the kids nobody in his family was a bad driver so he hadnt had to worry about it much once or twice a cop might have decided not to write them up when he realized who they were but that was something he didnt officially have to know about he found a more interesting topic here comes dinner s all it was enough food for at least half a dozen people leftovers in styrofoam boxes would make lunches and dinners for days stan miyamoto had his own kind of stubbornness he was going to be generous by god whether colin liked it or not sensibly colin decided he might as well like it louise ferguson yawned shed been doing that all morning and she couldnt figure out why shed had a good nights sleep the night before but she kept wanting to nod off anyhow mr nobashi started to yawn too it wasnt the first time hed done it today either yawns were as contagious as the common cold this time he caught himself in the middle and almost dislocated his jaw trying to stop he frowned at louise as if that were her fault you okay mrs ferguson he asked in his heavily accented english what he did to her last name was a caution but shed been deciphering japanese accents for as long as shed lived in san atanasiothe town had always had a sizable asian population the ramen company hadnt put its american headquarters here by accident im fine mr nobashi thanks i really am louise answered and then made a liar of herself by yawning again you need more coffee he declared he ran on the stuff the way a car ran on gasoline if louise guzzled it the way he did she didnt think shed ever go to bed he poured himself a fresh cup now he also poured one for her and set it on her desk thank you very much mr nobashi she said in amazement subordinates took care of small things for superiors here it rarely worked the other way around with him watching her she took a sip she smiled and nodded and thanked him again she didnt yawn even if she wanted to he nodded back and took his own refill into his sanctum he got on the phone there and started barking at someone in japanese laced with english profanity louise yawned yet again she started to drink some more coffee but set the cup down it didnt taste right somehow it seemed harsh and metallic the trouble wasnt in the brew she was sure of that shed made it herself neither mr nobashi nor anyone else noticed anything out of the ordinary if it wasnt the coffee it was her she wondered if she needed to go to the doctor she hoped like hell she didnt she had medical coverage because she worked here but it wasnt nearly as good as what shed got through colin you didnt think about such things when youd just fallen in love unfortunately they didnt go away just because you werent thinking about them deductibles copays seeing dr divicenzo would cost her more than it had in the old days dammit what could make her sleepy all the timeand tired too because she had been the past few daysand make coffee taste lousy too whatever it was it seemed unfair coffee was the best legal weapon when you got worn out she couldnt remember the last time shed felt like this and then all of a sudden she could she let out a startled squawk of laughter she hadnt even thought about that in twentyodd years yes her period was a few days late but so what her cycle was getting erratic anyway pretty soon it would stop she wouldnt miss tampons and pads and cramps not even a little bit its nutso she said out loud had she worn her diaphragm every single time shed gone to bed with teo she knew damn well she hadnt when you started making love pausing to go into the john and smear the contraption colin had called it a manhole coverthe kind of thing he thought was funny with contraceptive goop was a great way to break the mood she hadnt thought she was taking a chance or much of one she still couldnt believe it the rabbit diedlaughing that was what the gal on the s tv show said when she found out she was going to have a changeoflife baby she hadnt wanted her life to change that way so she got an abortion instead ridiculous louise said this had to be something anything else dr divicenzo would tell her shed come down with a virus or hed tell her it was all her imagination his fee would be real though not long before the lunch break louise did nod off it was only for a couple of minutes and she was sure she woke up again before anybody saw her but even so sometimes you felt refreshed after a little nap louise felt she needed another little nap a big one would be even better in lieu of coffee she went into the ladies room and splashed cold water on her face that did help some she had to repair her makeup afterwards no one walked in on her sometimes lucky was better than good one more notion shed heard from her ex you could wash a man right out of your hair but washing him out of your brain was a hell of a lot harder she gulped her brownbag sandwich swiss and turkey ham on rye and apple at her desk then she drove to the walgreens a few blocks from the ramen works half a dozen brands to choose from the supervolcano hadnt kept them from getting here or maybe they were made locally when she went to the register she started to pull out her visa then thought better of it and paid cash instead you didnt have to kill a rabbit nowadays or mess around with frogs or anything icky like that louise went back into the ladies room in the privacy of a stall she peed on the clearblue test strip she supposed shed bought that one because this whole thing came out of the clearblue sky she didnt wear a watch any more she used the clock in her cell phone to count off the minutes till the result that showed was reliable she didnt she wouldnt she flatout refused to look at the strip till then time ready or not here i come she muttered as if at hideandseek she looked pregnant the letters were bright red it didnt feel like a redletter day it felt like she didnt know what it felt like the end of the world as we know it she heard the bouncy song in her head she didnt feel fine though she feltsleepy dammit no one else had come in while she sat on the pot waiting out the test no one was in there when she chucked the clearblue box and the test strip she covered them with paper towels even so afterwards she scrubbed her hands like lady macbeth germs wouldnt trouble her like exes other things were harder to wash away you better now mr nobashi asked her in his telegraphic english as she tried to settle herself at her desk i think so she lied the rabbit might have died laughing what would teo say she didnt suppose hed be so amused she didnt think things were very funny herself for that matter what am i going to do she wondered have it get rid of it both prospects seemed equally appalling she checked some inventories for mr nobashi he waed to figure out why shrimp ramen was selling better in seattle than anywhere else in the usa they hated beef ramen there but it outsold shrimp twotoone in chattanooga again he wanted to know why louise couldnt have cared less but she could scare up numbers for him to plug into his spreadsheets her cell rang she fished it out of her purse hello colin growled in her ear hi louise what is it she snapped of all the people in the world she wanted to hear from right this minute he couldnt have rated higher than next to last he paused for a moment then said thought for a second there i called vanessa by mistake sorry again louise lied look whatever it is make it snappy will you im pretty busy here one more fib wellhe breathed out hard a sure sign shed pissed him offall i wanted to tell you was that i asked kelly to marry me and she said yes if you dont care about that ill go off and eat worms i guess sorry this time louise sounded more like someone who meant it congratulations or do i say good luck to the groom i never remember you congratulate me and wish her luck sounds about right colin still sounded very much like colin he went on how are things with you not bad im going to have a baby louise didnt say it the only thing she was sure of was that colin hadnt had thing one to do with it sooner or later if she decided to keep it shed have to let him know later not sooner im tired she answered a tiny fragment of the truth with none of the reason behind it you sound like it he said was that a dig something on the order of you sound like an old lady louise wouldnt have been surprised you always had to look twicesometimes three timesat things that came out of colins mouth youd be sorry if you didnt well he could dig and jab as much as he pleased she wasnt an old lady by the most fundamental way to judge that her biological clock wasnt just ticking the alarm on the damn thing had gone off she was alarmed all right you there louise colin asked when she didnt say anything right away im here she replied are you okay is teo treating you the way he ought to anything like that you let me know you hear ill take care of it teo is treating me fine dont do anything dumb because youve got a case of the imaginariesdo you hear me she said sharply he treats me better than you ever did louise didnt come out with it vanessa would have she knew that but living most of her adult life with colin left her convinced hed done his best at least when he thought of it trouble was his best didnt come close to being good enough okay he said so long louise take care he hung up teo was treating her so fine hed gone and knocked her up and what would he say when she told him that whatever it was she expected she could take it at face value unlike colin he didnt think sarcasm was a spectator sport at about half past three mr nobashi came over to her and said you want to go home early not much going on and you maybe could use some rest neh he was she supposed doing his best to be tactful in a language not his own what could that mean but you look like something the cat dragged in its okay mr nobashi ill make it till quitting time thank you though louise got paid by the hour she didnt want her check dockedand it wasnt as if she were actually sick she managed a smile adding arigato so hed know she was picking things up on the job he grinned in surprise and bobbed his head in what was almost a bow you go he said we not worry about clock okay the thanks in japanese must have done it that wasnt a corporate thing for him to say but maybe a nice guy lurked under the salaryman after all louise wouldnt look a gift horse in the mouth thank you very much mr nobashi she said and then arigato one more time she was out of there before he had the chance to change his mind when she got back to the condo she lay down on the couch for a little while and closed her eyes just to rest them she told herself next thing she knew teo was unlocking the door he laughed when he saw her confusion hello sleepyhead he said hurrying over to kiss her you must have had a tough day if you sacked out as soon as you came in mr nobashi let me off a couple of hours early she said on the companys dime if you can believe it the way he blinked said it wasnt easy whyd he do that he asked louise explained about arigato teo was still puzzled when she finished wondering okay but why did he want to let you off early to begin with i was all tired and i guess i looked kind of green around the gills too louise said she hoped the morning sickness wouldnt be too awful this time around colin had dubbed her the duchess of york for the way she kept tossing her cookies when she was pregnant with rob shed hardly been sick at all with vanessa and kind of inbetween carrying marshall you look fine now teo said you always look good to me love that made her smile teo had a knack for making her smile she wasnt surprised to hear she looked all right now shed been asleep forwhat close to two and a half hours she wondered if shed be able to sleep later on tonight from what she remembered she wouldnt have any trouble at all teo went on but what made you so out of it at work it mustve been bad or he wouldntve turned you loose like that you need to go to the doc or something she would need to see her gynecologist soon frank russell whod delivered her babies had long since retired last shed heard he was living in palm springs painting watercolors of the desert and selling some of them for pretty good money she didnt like dr suzuki so much but she thought he knew his business i think i know whats cooking with me she said yeah tell love tell you couldnt be a little bit pregnant you couldnt break the news by easy stages either louise wished you could her life was about to get more complicated no her life had already got more complicated now she had to announce the fact she wanted a drinkbut that wouldnt be good for her passenger she took a deep breath instead as inadequate a substitute as you could find im going to have a baby teo he giggled thats the funniest thing ive heard in i dont know when i didnt know you could do a straight face like that either oh my god he was practically holding his sides im not kidding louise said im pregnant im sleepy like you wouldnt believe my coffee tastes weirdtastes lousy that stuff doesnt mean squat teo broke in he didnt want to believe it well how could she blame him when she didnt want to believe it herself i wasnt done she said my periods late i know its getting erratic i know im getting old lay behind thatbut still and today at lunch i got a pregnancy test at the drugstore and i peed on it in the head at work im pregnant all right he stared at her for the very first time since theyd been together his dark eyes seemed opaque she couldnt tell what was going on behind them you mean it he said slowly and his voice was as guarded as his expression i sure do louise nodded youre going to be a daddy teo well if he was pleased he did a mighty good job of not showing it he licked his lips hed never been a father before and he hadnt looked to be a father now shed already been through pregnancy three times not out of wedlock though she thought maybe this would make him do something about that louise hadnt worried about a piece of paper but it mattered when a child was involved he pulled in a deep breath of his own then expelled it in a sigh its still real early right you could um dispose of it like yes i could louise didnt know why she was so disappointed it wasnt as if she hadnt had the same thought but she hadnt looked for it to be the first thing she heard from him i dont know that i want to though its something we made together after all something wonderful its an oops we didnt intend to do it teo said no we didnt she agreed and if that didnt win next years oscar for best understatement whoever did take the statuette home was bound to have cheated but it happened and weve got to deal with it getting rid of it is dealing with it teo said then we dont have to worry about it any more im not sure i want to do that louise repeated you shouldnt make up your mind right away either we dont have to decide anything tonight weve got some time to think about it whats to think about it just messes everything up you ought to know that better than i do teo said kids did mess up your life louise sometimes thought that was their sole function in life they didnt stop when they got to be selfwinding either the way you thought they would even so they give back more than they take away louise said ask your folks what do they know teo said his father was a carpenter his mother a housewife they werent educated people but they were plenty nice enough they went crazy trying to keep us all fed and in shoes and like that who needs the hassle if you dont have to put up with it lets talk about it later louise had never seen teo like this plainly he needed some time to get used to the idea he didnt want to look at it yet much less to like it she could see him outside jogging with a little boy who looked just like him she could see the little boy staring up proudly at the great big man who was his daddy how sad teo couldnt picture it too later didnt happen the rest of the evening they slept together the way they always did but it didnt feel as warm and loving as usual to louise teo might have been on the far side of the country or on the far side of the moon louise tried to tell herself she was having the vapors but she had trouble convincing herself she also didnt have long to do the telling she fell asleep as if someone had slipped a mickey finn into the water she drank after she brushed her teeth next morning was no better she staggered around like a zombie awake but not alive she made coffee but she couldnt get more than a third of the cup down it tasted nasty so nasty she wondered if shed give it back and teo was out the door in nothing flat he did remember to kiss her goodbye she didnt think hed missed a day since they got together but if ever anyone was going through the motions he was then again louise tried to think she was seeing things that werent there or it was nothing but her hormones running wild which they were and would be oranything again she had trouble believing it mr nobashi greeted her at ramen central with you better today i sure hope so louise answered thanks again for giving me some time off yesterday it helped a lot good he said gruffly and went back into his inner office which was a good thing because not thirty seconds later louise yawned almost wide enough to make the top of her head fall off wondering how shed ever make it till half past five she sat down and started messing around with the inventory spreadsheets she wondered what would happen if she just entered numbers at random would ramenscarfers all over the country start pining for their favorite flavors or else find themselves swamped with them would she get fired and find herself unemployed as well as knocked up or would nobody notice or care mr nobashi bawled for coffee then he bawled for sweet rolls then he hollered for sweet rolls and coffee hopping up to bring him goodies every so often kept louise from sacking out at her desk nice to think mr nobashi was good for something when she carried in the sweet rolls and coffee he was just getting off the phone after a conversation with headquarters in hiroshima weather very bad in japan he said very cold hiroshima is warm like los angeles warm only sticky they have snow there thirty centimeters snow he paused a foot you say wow thats a lot of snow she said it hadnt snowed here but it was the rainiest winter she remembered only get worse too supervolcano numberone bad mr nobashi said she couldnt very well argue with that patty came by her desk to yak for a bit after a little while she asked you feelin okay sweetie ill live louise said as dryly as if she were colin well okay you seem a little peaked thats all patty was gossiphungry shed have something to gab about when louises belly started swelling for now though louise didnt feel like sharing the news patty eventuay went away somehow louise staggered through the day she was fixing dinner when teo came in he was bright and cheerfulin a superficial way he talked about how his day at the exercise studio had gone he told a dumb joke hed heard he didnt say word one about the elephant in the room after dinner louise tried to bring it up teo changed the subject he hardly even seemed to have heard her if he kept on doing that louise knew she would get mad at him if shed had a little more energy she might have got mad then and there or she might not have hed built up a lot of capital with her a couple of days of acting like a jerkeven if it was about something importantdidnt come close to burning through it she wondered if making love would help but even though she did everything except send up a flare he didnt take the hint he just went to sleep earlier than usual disappointed so did she disappointed or not she zoned out as if knocked over the head shed always thought you slept a lot while you were pregnant because you sure as hell wouldnt afterwards he was gone the next morning before she got up that was funny they usually woke up together maybe hed told her why the night before but she was too sleepy to recall the condo felt strange with her fixing breakfast alone another day at the ramen mill she survived it she didnt doze off or do anything to give patty more ideas than she had already it was raining again when she went out at half past five on the way home somebody rearended the vw in the lane next to hers no one got hurt but neither car would be going anywhere without making a body shop happy when she walked into the condo her first thought was that a burglar had hit it then she realized the only stuff missing was teos favorite chair clothes dvds cds computer tv gone a note lay on the bed i am sorry louise read but i am not made to be a father if you can make the payments keep the place i wont give you no trouble about it it was fun while it lasted wasnt it but nothing lasts forever hed scribbled a signature under the last four words no forwarding address she could try his cell but what were the odds hed answer she tore the note into little pieces before she started to cry xx been a while since the strangler did anybody gabe sanchez remarked not since the supervolcano went maybe he was at yellowstone when it blew too much to hope for colin said all the same he imagined the son of a bitch watching old faithful when everything for miles around fell down onto the magma yes he knew that was ridiculous the area around old faithful had been offlimits for months before the big eruption all the same less than he deserves too you know oh yeah lethal injection gabe snorted contempt if we ever do drop on him heres hoping some of the big musclebound studs at san quentin get some action with him let him find out about some of what he gave the old ladies thatd be nice colin agreed before he could go on his phone rang he picked it up lieutenant ferguson hello colin his former wife had been calling this number since before either of them had a cell phone no doubt she did it now from force of habit whats up louise he asked whatever if was it wasnt good she sounded as if shed just watched a cement mixer run over her puppy i dont want to talk about it on the phone she said could you pick me up here at the ramen office for lunch okay he tried to hide his astonishment since she left him shed made a point of not wanting to see him what time twelve straight up all right ill be there yes of course i know where it is bye your ex gabe knew the variations on this theme tooprobably better than colin did his kids were young enough to live with their mother most of the time so he had to keep dealing with her however painful it was colins break was clean or it had been till now yeah that was her somethings wrong i dont know what yet but ill find out at lunch colin said lucky you sanchez rolled his eyes whatll you do to help damfino colin shook his head have to see what it is first i dont aim to buy a pig in a poke things arent the way they were right after she trotted out the door nope you found somebody else gabe didnt soundveryjealous hed dated a double handful of women since his breakup nothing lasted long uhhuh if she thinks she can walk back in the same way she walked out colin shook his head again if louise had wanted to do that a few months after she left chances were he would have dumped kelly to get his old life back now the train had rolled on he thought it had anyhow luck gabe told him thanks a lot for the rest of the morning colin went through the motions at his desk he went through the emotions inside his head when the time came he drove north up hesperus avenue to braxton bragg then hung a right to the ramen place he shook his head when he turned in to the lot he hadnt remembered how heavily fortified the perimeter was one more sign of san atanasios changesnot for the better louise came out at twelve on the dot a couple of minutes after he got there she looked the way she always lookedwhich is to say she looked good to him but no not quite the way she always looked she was pale and shed been crying thanks she said as she got into the taurus its okay where do you want to go how about that carrows on reynoso drive you got it colin nodded want to tell me about it now or after we get there colin pulled back onto the street he noted the way the armed guard kept an eye on him till he did if that guy wasnt a vet and likely a combat vet hed eat his shoes teo left me yesterday louise said he skipped hes gone he took his things and he bailed i have no idea where he is okay colin didnt say anything more until he got into the leftturn lane that would put him back on hesperus then he asked did he hurt you before he left am i looking at a domesticviolence case last time i talked to you you said everything was fine with you guys the last time we talked everything was fine louise laughto the sttterly a moment later she yawned and covered her mouth with her hand i keep doing that she said as if annoyed at herself no he didnt hurt me not the way you mean not so you could bust him for it then what do you want from me he tried to sound patient not pissed off if you need a shoulder to cry on im not your numberone candidate any more im sorry but im not when i called you you know it was to tell you im gonna marry kelly louise was the kind of person who could forget things like that when forgetting them looked convenient colin im going to have a baby thats why he ran out on me it was a good thing traffic on hesperus was light with no cars anywhere close to his the taurus jerked out of its lane for a split second he had to haul it back over the yellow stripes he hadnt been so surprised sincesince the day she walked out on him he started to ask if she was kidding but he swallowed that question she wasnt shed never hurt him for the sake of hurting himif anybody in the family enjoyed pulling wings off flies it was vanessa he asked something else instead are you sure oh you betcha louise said the home pregnancy tests they have nowadays are just about as good as the ones doctors use it says i am and i feel like i am i know what its like even if its been a while you dont forget if you say so colin hung a right on reynoso drive do you ah know what youre going to do about it no teo wanted me to get rid of it right away i may but im not going to do it like that she snapped her fingers i didnt mean to get pregnant but i may have it anyway the carrows was on the south side of the street he waited in the center lane till he could turn left against the eastbound traffic without getting creamed most of the shops and eateries in the little center catered to japanese the lot was crowded he finally found a space and slid in he and louise walked to the restaurant a few inches farther apart than they would have before they broke up he didnt say anything till they were seated at a table that gave them a fine view of the cars going back and forth on reynoso beach what exactly do you want me to do about all this he asked then picking his words with great care are you ready to order the waitress couldnt have been more than twenty and sounded as if she had not a care in the world that was what twenty was for too goddamn bad it didnt last ill have the blt louise said colin ordered a cheeseburger the waitress went away he repeated the question i heard you the first time louise said sharply can you find out where hes gone phone records or his plastic or whatever his parents dont know or they wont sayive already tried them maybe colin said if hes left the county i dont have so many contacts if hes out of state it gets a good bit harder i can try i guess where does he have relatives some down in san diego some in mexico too louise looked rueful if hes south of the border its impossible isnt it pretty close colin agreed nobody down there would get excited about that kind of case not many people up here would either although he might be able to call in some favors on the other hand he might not the supervolcano and its disruptions made small stuff too small to worry about and if teo felt like disappearing into a refugee camp he might not surface for years if he ever did the food came then interrupting his gloomy thoughts the cheeseburger was a cheeseburger better than fast food or dennys nothing to jump up and down about even so the way louise demolished her sandwich said morning sickness hadnt kicked in yet why did he just split like that colin asked you two haveuh hadbeen together a while now wasnt it something you could have worked out between you i thought so but he freaked he didnt want to be a daddyno way nohow louises mouth twisted sometimes you dont find out what somebodys really like till its crunch time i got crunched all right yeah you did sorry about that what am i going to do her eyes filled with tears either youll have the baby or youll decide you dont want to have it and youll take care of that colin was no enormous fan of abortion he could see though that a woman might not want to bear the child of a man whod abandoned herespecially if she was a woman with some gray in her hair unless she touched it up raising a kid on your own was never easy it got harder as you got older and tireder through the tears his ex looked indignant she eyed him as if this were somehow his faultor at any rate anyones but hers i can figure that much out for myself thank you very much she said tartly what i wanted to know was how much help from you i could count on huh what kind of help im not made of money especially when im putting marshall through school and he never seems to graduate but he sold that story to a magazine for money isnt that wonderful well its pretty good but what he got is not quite a weeks rent on his place and thats before you chop taxes out of it besides you pretty much cleaned out my bank account when you left hed kept the house shed taken just about everything else theyd built up over all the years they were married the lawyers called it a fair split colin hadnt loved lawyers before the divorce he was even less fond of them now youre being mean louise exclaimed he exhaled through his nose to try to hide how angry he was louise you walked out on me you were in love with teo and he was in love with you and the two of you were going to live happily ever after you got your half of the community property except for that you didnt want thing one to do with me any more months could go by without us talking but now mr happily ever after finds out youve got a bun in the oven so he takes off and all of a sudden i look a lot better by comparison huh is that where were at or did i miss something youre not going to help me if the mask of tragedy had a voice it would have been hers then you were the one who didnt want me darkening your towels any more you called me every name in the book we are divorced remember why should i care about the bastard of the guy you left me for never mind the baby she said impatiently didnt you love me yeah i did past tense i loved you longer than you loved me as a matter of fact i was a mess after you dumped me colin bit back several other things he might have said this was more than bad enough without looking for ways to make it worse the waitress chose that moment to bring the check too after she hurried away he went on now ive found somebody else too ill do the best i can with kelly i think weve got a decent chance thats about as much as anybody can hope for these days and so youll throw me under the bus louise would have been a star in victorian melodrama you did that to yourself one more thing colin swallowed look he said if i have a little extra maybe i can chip in something but if you think im going to go one inch further than that im here to tell you it aint gonna happen its over louise im sorrychrist knows im sorrybut it is she glared at him you are a cruel hard man your kelly doesnt have the faintest idea what shes getting into poor thing for all i know youre right he answered but ill tell you one other thing what is it louise spat the words at him if id knocked you up i wouldntve run out on you and you know darn well thats so she did he could see it in her face he could also see that she would sooner have been dropped into the supervolcano than admit it maybe youd better take me back to work she said glacially okay he tossed a five on the table then paid the bill at the register rain started spattering down as they walked across the lot to his car he held the passengerside door open for her she got in with the air of marie antoinette heading for the guillotine neither one of them said much as he drove north to braxton bragg boulevard just before he turned in to the fortified lot louise murmured i wish i wish things could have been different a lot of people do colin agreed cops saw that every hour of every day but by the time they make the wish its already too late take care of yourself louise whatever you decide to do like it matters to you she flared it does he said we cant go back to square one though youve got your life to live and ive got mine and they arent on the same track any more she slid out and slammed the car door then she hurried inside the rain was coming down harder now and she didnt have an umbrella with her the guard nodded to colin as he left the lot he gave back a wave that was half a salute when he sat down at his desk again gabe asked do i want to know how that went colin thought for a moment even worse than i expected he said judiciously aii gabe winced they said it couldnt be done oh it could all right in a few bleak words as if he were summarizing a case on the witness stand colin explained how oh man oh wow man sanchez shook his head that happened to me i wouldntve come back here idve found somewhere quiet and got loaded im on city time now not on mine colin said and i did too much drinking right after we broke up its a bitch all right but shes just not my problem any more he packed the words with more emphasis than he usually used was he trying to convince himself as well as his friend he wouldnt have been surprised youre a better man than i am gunga din gabe told him now are you gonna give your new squeeze the good news that was a more interesting question than colin really liked reluctantly he nodded dont you think ive got to if were going to make some kind of life together she needs to know whats going on with me i guess gabe sounded anything but sure i dont know who itll be rougher on though you or her oh my god colin how totally awful for you kelly exclaimed when her fiance reached the end of his story here and there getting through it hed sounded more like a machine running on clockwork than a fleshandblood human being she had the feeling he couldnt have made it through without shutting down most of what he was feeling ive had lunches i enjoyed more he allowed hey ive had teeth pulled i enjoyed more i believe you i wish i could be down there to give you a hug kelly said thatd be good colin said so now ive got to set up a skip trace on this clown just what i want to do he couldnt get it out of his mind you could just tell her to forget it shes got a lot of nerve dropping that on you after she sashayed out the door kelly thought she needed to remind colin of that if louise wanted to sashay back into his life how interested would he be theyd had a lot of years together if she could work it so the ones that had passed since she left him somehow didnt count carrying her lovers baby made that harder but if she decided to visit a doctor she wouldnt have to carry it long then again colin had never struck kelly as being good at forgetting his electronically transmitted sigh in her ear did everything a real one would have except ruffle her hair hon if some guy ran out on a woman id never heard of before and left her pregnant id put out a skip trace on the soandso he sighed again i wish this were some gal i never heard of i wouldnt get all messed up inside dealing with her then i bet you wouldnt kelly exuded righteous indignation she gave you one in the eye and now she wants your help some nerve yeah well i pretty much told her the same thing colin hesitated then went on in case youre wondering like i wouldnt take her back on a silver platter thats all over now im better off and ive got the sense to see it just so you know the supervolcano had shot global warming right behind the ear the ice pack in the arctic ocean and the one around antarctica were both spreading and thickening kelly had some satellite data on her kitchen table somewhere she could dig it out thickening ice packs or no a glacier in the middle of her chest suddenly melted all at once glorious warmth spread from the spot where it had been i did know she said which was true and false at the same time in a way scientific data couldnt be shed been pretty sure of the one thing while still worried about the other happens i love you colin added as if hed been an innocent bystander when that somehow happened to him it works both ways kelly assured him she didnt like to get mawkish she had no intention of going bridezilla when they made things official she still marveled that hed got up the nerve to propose and that shed had the nerve to say yes or even sure the percentage of women who passed thirty single and stayed that way permanently was large and getting larger by the year she was bucking the odds okay good he sounded like someone who needed assurance or at least reminding then he said keeping that in mind makes it easier to cope with louise he chuckled harshly teo was always everything i wasnt he was sweet he was caring he listened to louise you listen kelly interrupted whenever we talk i always think how ive never known anybody who listens like you louise didnt think so she wanted out and teo was her way out another chuckle then he wanted out too he was everything you werent kelly said you never would have done anything like that even if you had got somebody pregnant you would have stuck around afterwards one more thing i told louise i do like to think so colin said but who knows sometimes you just cant cope so you run kelly snorted it was much easier to imagine colin sticking like glue even when that made him a goddamn nuisance than to picture him breaking and running she wouldnt have minded had he run from louisejust the opposite in fact but that wasnt his style and never would be anyway now you know he continued you needed to because ill have to give louise whatever copstyle help i can no he wouldnt run he said if she ends up having this kid though youve got to remember it aint mine that made her laugh in surprise i promise she said okay another pause from colin then he said son of a and broke off very abruptly indeed kelly had long since seen that he didnt like to cuss in front of her he must have bitten off something juicy and he must have had reason to bite it off what she asked he sounded thoroughly grim as he answered somebodys gonna have to tell the kids about this two guesses who draws the short straw wont they be thrilled to find out theyre gonna have a new half brother or half sister quite a few words for grown childrens reactions to news like that went through kellys mind thrilled didnt make the list dont say anything right away she urged maybe your ex will take care of it for you ha colin delivered a oneword editorial or maybe shell decide to get rid of the baby and in that case there wont be anything to tell kelly resolutely pretended he hadnt broken in no huh he said shell have to explainor ill have to explainhow come dear sweet wonderful loving teo isnt in the picture any more he just disappeared for no reason at all right if theres no baby you dont officially have to have any idea why he flew the coop maybe colin sounded dubious and proceeded to explain why way it looks to me is therell be a baby teo wanted her to get rid of it teo got rid of himself when she didnt go okeydoke fast enough to suit him shed have the kid now just to spite him even if she wasnt looking for any other reasons that made a crazy kind of sense to kelly just enough to worry her it wasnt something she would do herself but it was something she could see somebody else doing if louise thinks that way let her tell your children she said again i wont spill the beans right away colin said if i did that might look like i was gloating about it but if she decideschooses thats the word they always use these days isnt it if she chooses to have the baby the kids will need to know i guess so kelly said unwillingly and what have you been up to he asked i hope like anything you had a better day than i did im working on a paper about increased geyser activity as a warning sign of a supervolcano eruption she said whoevers in charge of yellowstone threequarters of a million years from now can dig it out of the archives if their geyser basins start getting frisky for a second there i thought you meant that colin remarked you never can tell but i wont hold my breath kelly said this lets me use some of the photos i took at the end of my first hike to coffee pot springs after things started heating up her eyes welled with tears all that stuff is gone forever no one will see yellowstone again im glad i got the chance id be glad even if i hadnt met you there but im especially glad now colin said good kelly answered me too by the time squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles could have got to greenville going there had lost its point the local promoter wasnt wrong to say that nobody in that part of maine could have got to their show people in maine understood snow and they understood how to keep roads passable but even they werent used to dealing with weather like this if they werent up for it the guys from california who were stranded in guilford were not to put too fine a point on it freaking out doesnt the iditarod start somewhere around here rob asked dick barber before the proprietor of the trebor mansion inn could answer justin started doing background vocals rod rod ditarod i ditarod ditarodrodrod i ditarod it was as if the beach boys had met a denizen of the state home for the terminally loopy would you please stick that in the deep freeze rob asked him in lieu of suggesting that he stick it up his ass he amplified the request go outside in other words cold out there justin observed accurately cold in here too rob said which was also accurate if to a lesser degree he quickly turned back to barber were not looking a gift horse in the mouth believe me i know its cold thats why god made long underwear barber answered ive been running the furnace as little as i thought i could get away with trying to stretch the fuel oil as far as i could itll run dry in the next few days no matter what i do though when does more fuel oil get to guilford rob asked he was used to gas or electric heat as far as he knew nobody in california used fuel oil good question barber said the way things are i have no idea i have no idea if any fuel oil is getting into the state it doesnt grow on trees you know quite a few people in town are already out rob believed that barber was one of the more stringently efficient people hed met his military background might have had something to do with it dad was the same way only not quite so much he tried a different question what if no more fuel oil gets here dick barber clicked his tongue between his teeth in that case things do get more interesting dont they the way it looks to me is we have two choices in that case either we freeze to death or we start cutting down trees that doesnt sound like two choices to me more like one justin said oh i agree with you barber replied but i promise there will be folks who dont some people in this stateinfluential people toofeel its not just wrong but evil to harm a tree for any reason they feel that way very strongly and theyre not shy about saying so there are people like that in california too rob said the proprietor of the trebor mansion inn let one eyebrow climb toward his shock of graying hair why am i not surprised i dont know why arent you rob had a crooked grin of his own im kind of a treehugger myself but that but suggests youre young enough to get over it barber said rob shrugged whenever you can take care of trees without hurting people thats a good thing to do i think but if people are going to freeze to death unless theyve got logs in the fireplace thats the time to break out the axes and the chainsaws sounds reasonable are you sure youre from california barber said the other thing is all the questions about fuel oil apply to gasoline too the shell stations closed in case you hadnt noticed so the chainsaws wont keep working forever or even through the winter assuming the winter does eventually end ive checked out the year without a summer online rob said snow in june that doesnt sound like a whole lot of fun no and the yellowstone supervolcano is a bigger nastier beast than the one in the nineteenth century barber agreed so it may come down to men working up a sweat even in our lovely winter weather chopping down pines the oldfashioned way but chances are they wont be leveling oldgrowth forest theres still quite a bit of that farther north but not around here a lot of the woods in these parts have grown up since the war people stopped trying to farm they gave up the land and moved to the citiesor else they pulled up stakes and headed for the sun belt there are more people in maine now than there were in but there arent three times as many or six times as many the way there are some places i believe that justin said youre more settled here than we are on the other coast and nobody moves here on account of the weather rob added nobody moved here on account of the weathr even before the supervolcano you forget the summer people barber reminded him i cant afford to do that no matter how tempting it is i make my living off them they come to maine to get away from boston and new york city and philadelphia if theres no summer next year there wont be any summer people i dont know what ill do then rob wondered how many times hed heard that since the supervolcano erupted more often than in all the years before then he suspected it was too big to plan around you just had to wait and see what happened next and try to roll with it as best you could suppose there isnt just a year without a summer justin said suppose there are five or six or ten years like that all in a row what does maine look like by the end of that time hell barber answered promptly dantes hell i mean the book is called the inferno but satans buried in ice at the end of ten years like that wed probably have enough ice to keep old scratch from getting loose for quite a while a cat wandered in a cat almost big enough to be a bobcat the barber family semiprofessionally bred maine coons they handled the weather in these parts as well as a critter was likely to and they were also uncommonly goodnatured vanessa would go gaga over them at least at first rob suspected shed get bored with them though they werent contrary enough to suit her this beast rubbed his leg it made motorboat noises when he bent down and stroked it i ought to keep one or two in the bedding the way the australian aborigines did with their dogs he said theyre like hotwater bottles with ears you know justin nodded a threedog night was really cold thats how that turkey of a band got its name once upon a time i liked them barber said i got over it thinking about warmth made rob think about electricity he rather wished he hadnt how long will the power stay on he wondered out loud wont storms start knocking the lines down and if even the utility companies cant get gas to send out repair crews in that case we welcome back the nineteenth century in all its glory barber made his tongueclicking noise again whether that level of technology can support this level of population well well all find out wont we wont be as much fun playing acoustic sets all the time justin said rob stabbed a forefinger at him i was just thinking the same thing you came out with it before i could you two might as well be married i was married once upon a time barber said i got over that too but it was expensive that only reminded rob of his own parents divorce and he didnt know what was up with teo suddenly running out on mom after such a long stretch of notquitewedded bliss he had the feeling more was going on than mom was telling if dad knew what and chances were he did he wasnt talking all he said about it was ask your mother he wanted to know what the chances were for robs coming back to california when he tied the knot with kelly rob feared those chances were anything but good getting from guilford to doverfoxcroft was a major undertaking these days getting from guilford to bangor or portland might not be impossible but it sure wldnt be easy rob would have liked to go to his fathers second wedding if he did though how would he make it back here he didnt want to run out on the band justin and charlie and biff and the polymorphously perverse thing that was squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles seemed more like family these days than did the people connected by arbitrary ties of flesh and blood justin said im getting hungry you want to go down to calvins kitchen for breakfast do i want to rob echoed not so youd notice but weve got to eat dont we are biff and charlie up yet as if to prove they were they chose that moment to thunder down the stairs off to the diner they all went it was only about a fiveminute walk the place just didnt cut it for dinner despite dick barbers opinion rob didnt think it was all that wonderful for breakfast either still you couldnt mess up eggs and sausages and bacon and hash browns too badly what got to rob more than the food was the isolation the waitress and the cook behind the counter were polite enough but they were serving strangers they knew the localsand vice versathe way rob and charlie and biff and justin knew one another a black baptist family moving onto a street full of chasidim could have felt no more cut off from the neighborhood he was almost done with his breakfast when it occurred to him that isolation could have more than one meaning if fuel oil and gasoline had trouble reaching rural maine north and west of the interstate how about food you could cut down trees and burn them and maybe you wouldnt freeze yeah but could you feed half a states worth of people on moose and ducks and whatever else you could shoot it didnt seem likely what were people going to do if the food ran low though all the ll bean gear in the world didnt help against hunger only eatables could but where would they come from xxi bryce miller dropped three copies of his dissertationthump on his chairpersons desk the physical copies were a formality left over from the days when theses were actually typed professor harvey harriman had had his finger in every chapter of the word file from which the diss was printed there seemed to be two kinds of chairpersons the ones who didnt do enough and the ones who did too much harvey harriman was of the second school he stuck out his hand now congratulations bryce he said in his soft precise voice he was heading towards emeritus status but looked twenty years younger than he was maybe like dorian gray he had a portrait somewhere that was taking a beating hed been at ucla since dissertations were typed on selectrics and since the university of california system had money hed probably had his plaid jacket about that long too his fathers translations of aeschylus and sophocles were classics among classicists hed never done anything so illustrious himself but he was more than capable thanks bryce said im only sorry it took so much longer than i thought it would they have a way of doing that professor harriman said and it may be agathe tykhe in disguise you know suppose youd finished when you expected to suppose youd taken a job at the university of wyoming or idaho state or some such place by the way he spoke all the colleges and universities in the mountain west interchangeable even if that was naive he had a point it was good luck not to have wound up somewhere like that bryce might not have got out if he had i had my brush with the supervolcano any which way he said yes so you did harriman agreed im glad you made it back in one piece and im glad to have one copy of the thesis for myself one for the department library and one for the university research library how often had bryce wrestled with doric verb forms in the classics library lots one whole bookcase was full of bound dissertations going back half a century and more did anybody ever look at them he knew he never had some eventually got turned into proper books the rest must have seemed important at the time at least to the shlubs cranking them out and was the world ready for a fat new study of theocritus and the other leading hellenistic poets would oxford and cambridge and harvard get into a ferocious bidding war over the publication rights if they did they might run the advance they paid him all the way up into three figures but they wouldnt or it sure wasnt likely as if to underscore that professor harriman asked what will you do now that youve finished look for work what else can i do now bryce said mm yes harriman didnt need to worry about it he might not have been tenured since the hellenistic age but he seemed as if he had he coughed delicately now the job situation is difficult at the moment in the present emergency classics departments find themselves under unprecedented pressure surely you are aware of this surely bryce said deadpan slots opened up only when the current holder dropped dead even then a university was at least as likely to cut a position as to fill it it wasnt just positions either whole classics departments were facing the axe so were french and italian departments and anything else that didnt immediately help people dig out from the supervolcano what kind of world theyd have once they dug outif they could dig outtheyd worry about later well then harvey harriman spread his wellmanicured hands oh ill take any kind of job i can get bryce said if somebody wants me to teach western civ at a community college ill do that if a catholic high school needs a latin teacher i can do that or if all i can come up with is a job job if you know what i mean ill do that too i do understand the wolf at the door is a harsh taskmaster harriman said as if he knew anything about the wolf at the door yeah as if his father might have grounded him if hed messed up too many declensions but that was about it sighing he went on it seems a shame to have to turn your back on what took so long and required so much work and study to accomplish bryce thought it seemed a shame too but starving seemed an even bigger shame you dont always get to do what you want to do he said sometimes you do what you have to do and pick up the pieces from there will you come back to ucla in june for the years commencement professor harriman asked i hope so bryce had blown off the ceremony after his ab and ma his mother would probably disown him if he did it again so would susan whose opinion mattered more to himand who was waiting for him right this minute he said his goodbyes to professor harriman he wondered when he would ever see the inside of the ucla classics department again once upon a time business weenies had infested the public policy building now they had a bigger newer spiffier one all their own the anderson school of management classics got some of their leftoversor their sloppy seconds if you were feeling uncommonly cynical susan called the north campus center maxims maybe that was a history department injoke bryce had never heard it before he started hanging out with her she sat at one of the big tables outside unusually in this winter of the earths discontent it wasnt raining she got up as he drew near are you official im done all rightlike a roast he answered hey you did something special she said how do you want to celebrate people would talk if we did that right here bryce said susan made a face at him how about coffee and a danish instead talk about second prizes he said mournfully she poked him in the ribs that didnt do muchshe was far more ticklish than he was they walked into maxims together susan did get coffee and a danish bryce got a danish and a coke instead susan bought you just turned in your diss she said how awesome is that i dont have a job i dont have much chance for a job i was just talking with my chairperson about what i was gonna do he didnt have any terrific ideas either how awesome is that one more reason for bryce to let susan buy something will turn up for you she said something will turn up for me when i finish too would you have put all that time and effort into it if you really thought youd never get the chance to use it they sat down at a couple of chairs facing the brickwork around a circular gas fire the warmth was welcome no doubt susan had meant the question rhetorically bryce gave it serious consideration all the same at last he said you know i think i would what else would i have been doing instead retail real estate i might have made more money in real estate the way the roller coaster goes you might not have too susan broke in youve got that right bryce said whatever i did i wouldnt have had much fun doing it here i am close to thirty and ive got away with not working for a living yet cant go on forever not unless you inherit or something but ive had a pretty good run one of the reasons hed got away with not working for a living was that vanessa had dropped out and did work add her real salary to the dribs and drabs he brought in and theyd done tolerably well hed had more trouble staying afloat since the breakup but he didnt want to remember vanessa now yourenot practical susan said vanessa had told him the same thing he seemed to have to remember her like it or not shed said it with intent to wound though if not with intent to condemn with susan it was just a statement of fact guilty he said it wasnt as if he didnt know it himself im afraid nobody who writes poems modeled after ancient pastorals will get a lot of ink in the wall street journal that nevot what i meant youve published them i think thats wonderful susan said bryce thought it was wonderful too of course hed made exactly no money from any of them and here out of the blue vanessas brother soldreally solda story if that made bryce jealous and it did he was sure it drove vanessa nuts he said but no one should hang out with me because she expects to get rich doing it or even eat necessarily im hanging out with you because i want to silly susan said one way or another well make ends meet who needs more than that plenty of people did or thought they did vanessa had always had filet mignon tastes even when the budget yelled for ground chuck she was never happy with what she had he sometimes thought especially toward the end that she couldnt be happy without something to be unhappy about susan wasnt like that for a while bryce had wondered if something was missing in his relationship with her before long hed figured out what it was tension once he realized that he quit missing it i wonder whats out there in the big wide world he said the big wide ugly world he thought but he didnt come out with that i dont have any excuses left now ive got to find out selling his story gave marshall fifteen mcluhan minutes of fame at ucsb because of paper shortages the campus rag was down to a weekly but it ran a story about him the photographer who snapped him holding up a printout of well why not was seriously cute she seemed impressed with him too impressed enough to let him have her cell number with the air of an aid worker handing out sacks of wheat to pipecleanerlegged famine victims in zimbabwe or somewhere like that but when he tried it it turned out to be bogus well you couldnt win em all professor bolger gave him an a in the course which he was glad to have and advice which he found as welcome as the phony phone number congratulations youve sold to a market idmm maybe not kill but commit armed robbery anywayto break into bolger said now you have to figure out where you go from here where marshall wanted to go was away from the profs journalcrowded office unfortunately that didnt seem practical for the next few minutes uhhuh he said and tried to keep looking interested while he tuned out if youve got anything else you like you should send it to the editor there right away bolger went on anybodywell lots of people anyhowcan get lucky once being able to do it over and over is what marks the difference between a writer and somebody who just writes if you know what i mean he waited expectantly thus prompted marshall nodded and went uhhuh again for all the world as if hed been listening the other side of the coin is you dont want to get a swelled head because somebody sent you a check bolger said twentyfive years ago when i was a senior in high school a friend of mine sold two stories to a magazine thats long since gone under he decided he knew everything there was to know the way you can when youre that age he dropped out of the university of washington halfway through his freshman year to become a writer and he sold a couple of novels too but hes made his living moving stuff from here to there at sears ever since another pregnant pause im not gonna drop out now waitid not with my degree right around the corner hed avoided it as long as he could but they were going to pitch him out into the real world no matter how little he liked it i should hope not professor bolger said politely horrified at the mere idea if you work hard at it and if you dont expect too much writing is a good trade in difficult times theres not much overheadhardly any and you can do it parttime to add to your income from a more ordinary job ive been doing that for a long time now right makes sense marshall said of course the prof was bound to have some fancy degree piled on top of his bachelors you didnt get to teach at a university without one marshall was sure of that one sold story or even several sold stories wouldnt win him possession of the office next door here students in my classes dont often place pieces it happens but not every quarter nowhere near bolger said you have a right to be proud of yourself he glanced at the clock on the wall across from his desk and do keep writing i always hate it when people who have the ability dont use it that had to be okay ive used up as much office time on you as im going to marshall said his goodbyes and got out it was late afternoon the sun was sinking in one of those ridiculously overthetop sunsets people had started taking for granted since the supervolcano erupted oranges reds purples sometimes greens the light show usually started a good hour and a half before actual sundown you didnt even have to be loaded to enjoy it though that sure didnt hurt as marshall walked to the bike rack somebody behind him said hey isnt that the guy who he walked a little taller a little straighter for a few steps after all he was the guy who he was right this minute anyhow before long somebody else would do something worth noticing then for a little while hed be the guy who marshall unlocked his bike and climbed aboard how did you keep it going once you werent the guy who any more how did you keep it going when you never got to be the guy who his brothers band had always had to deal with that more hype stuck to the third runnerup from american idol who was only almost the guy who than squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles had seen in their whole career one good way to keep it going was not to let the jerk in the lexus flip you over hisno herfender you dumb asshole marshall said the lexus driver went on her way with the lordly indifference of those who didnt need to use their own muscle power to get from hither to yon a moment later though marshall had his come the revolution moment as he pedaled past two gas stations on opposite sides of the street prices had been zooming up and up since the eruption one of the stations had topped six bucks a gallon the other dayand it wasnt a tourist trap by the either a sign in front of the other said sorryno gas today lots of the petroleum that got made into gasoline came from the middle east and other distant places israeli nukes on the iranian oil fields hadnt done that supply any good but some of it was homegrown the supervolcano hadnt done domestic production any good which was putting it mildly and some of the big refineries in texas and oklahoma were still out of action while transportation between the west coast and anything east of yellowstone remained totally screwed which meant high prices and shortages here were both of them pretty soon gas prices would get to the point where they pinched a bitch in a lexus or else even her majesty wouldnt be able to fill up at all then shed have to stick her rich ass on a bicycle like the peasants or damn well stay home come the revolution when marshall got back to his place he drank a coke they were plugging them as better than ever with real sugar because you couldnt get highfructose corn syrup when the corn crop lay under volcanic ash and fired up his computer he did his email first after that though he started working on a new story one about somebody who was rich enough to drive a lexus and live in santa barbara but who found that her money was buying her less and less and that it couldnt buy some things at all he knew a bit about failed relationships all he had to do was think of the one that had blown up on his folks he stopped after a couple of hours and a thousand words and went back to reread what hed written he cleaned up some clumsy phrasing and put in foreshadowing to show that ms lexus didnt have it as together as she thought she did then he nodded to himself it felt good he didnt know how to put it any better than that if he stayed at it and finished it he thought he had a chance to sell it somewhere so much he still didnt know not just about writing but about finding markets and everything else that had to do with the business he was at least as surprised as anyone else that somebodyd bought one piece could lightning really strike twice could he be or become a creativewriting major whod got lucky how could you know something like that the only answer that occurred to him was by writing and seeing if anything else stuck he was no more diligent than hed ever had to be you needed that stuff if you were going to go anywhere in this racket that seemed obvious did he have it in him that seemed much less so all he could do was give it his best shot whatever that turned out to be if he didnt decide to do something else in the meantime maybe hed find out the nurse took louise fergusons temperature with a gadget she stuck into her ear the old underthetongue thermometer was as antique as a victorian thundermug measuring blood pressure still involved a cuff around the upper arm and a stethoscope though after writing the data on louises chart the nurse said this all seems fine how are you feeling today the only way she could have made that more patronizing would have been to ask how are we feeling today but we was or were involved or louise wouldnt have been sitting impatiently in this patient room pregnant she answered her voice nothing but grim well yes nothing dented the nurses good cheer dr suzuki will see you in a few minutes she bustled out and almost closed the door behind her happy day louise said but not very loud travis suzuki was several years younger than she was he always seemed bright and selfassured shed rarely met a doctor short on selfconfidence by the way he swept into the examination room he expected her to genuflect how are you doing he asked im doing all right louise said he glanced at her chart your numbers look good none of the tests weve run show anything abnormal about the fetus if you proceed with the pregnancy chances are youll have a healthy baby if you dont well youre approaching the end of your first trimester if you wait longer than that to decide to terminate things get more complicated as im sure you know yes i do know that louise said im not thrilled about any of this im talking to lawyers again like i told you my boyfriend lit out for the tall timber when he found out hed knocked me up thats unfortunate dr suzuki said tell me about it louise exclaimed things mightve been okay if id said right away that id get rid of it when i didnt teosplit if i dispose of it now im still doing what hed want ill be damned if you know what i mean dr suzuki nodded i think i do he said and she was inclined to believe himhers wouldnt be anything close to the first tale of woe hed heard as if to prove as much he went on if you have the baby will you be able to keep from taking out your resentment about its father on it that was a shrewd question it was one shed asked herself more than once i hope so she said slowly its not the babys fault after all i understand that okay he said though that was more likely acknowledgment than agreement snap snap he donned a pair of thin rubber gloves let me call terri back into the room then and ill examine you terri that was the nurses name no matter how often louise had come in here she never remembered it she pulled down her panties and put her feet in the stirrups at the end of the table the underwear was cotton severely functional but comfortable for the first time since her early twenties shed worn little skimpy transparent nylon things while she was with teo he liked them well now she didnt have to worry about what teo likedor about wedgies either terri came in to preserve propriety couldnt have a male doctor prodding a womans private parts with no one around to make sure hankypanky didnt ensue no sir as dr suzuki started doing what he did louise asked him do you get sick and tired of staring at pussy all day he straightened up with a startled laugh nobody ever asked me that before he said you bet i do you do it for a while its a job like any other job and maybe that was true and maybe it wasnt more likely it was true and false at the same time he wouldnt care about a little old ladys twat any more than he cared about her elbow but if a cute young thing with a cute young thing came in louise guessed his interest might be more than strictly professional shed heard somewhere that gynecologists had one of the highest divorce rates of any kind of doctor she couldnt remember where and she didnt know for sure it was so but she wouldnt have been surprised his fingering of her was nothing but businesslike dr russell had been the same way even though she was younger then once when she was pregnant with rob colin had come in with her for an examination he hadnt liked watching another mans fingers probing her he understood it was in the line of duty he hadnt liked it anyway dr suzuki finished what he was doing you can put your pants on again he said as he peeled off the gloves and dropped them into the trash can louise got out of the stirrups and smoothed down her skirt before she reonned her underwear is everything okay she asked it certainly seems to be youve taken good care of yourself dr suzuki answered by which he could only mean youre no spring chicken sweetheart well that was nothing louise didnt already know suzuki went on if you decide to bring the baby to term i dont see any medical reason why you shouldnt have a successful delivery i dont see any reason now i should say if your blood pressure rises if you start showing protein in your urine thats a different story i understand louise said if i was going to end the pregnancy my reasons wouldnt be medical well yes the obgyn frowned a little im not so well equipped to advise you on uh personal choices i understand that too louises mouth twisted as if shed just tasted something bitter i loved that man you know i loved him like i hadnt loved anybody since i was a kid and he loved me back he didtill i got pregnant he couldnt handle that so he split and so here i am here you are dr suzuki agreed which brings us back to the question i asked you before i have been wondering about whether id take it out on the baby louise said slowly but i really dont think so id try to remember the good times with teo not the bad ones there were some there were quite a few till he bailed on me that seems like a commonsense attitude suzuki sounded cautious of course he did what else were doctors for he had his reasons too will you be able to keep it up at three in the morning when the babys got you up for the fourth time that night and you still have to go to work in the morning i dont know louise said but any mom alive is gonna want to punt her kid when something like that happens he smiled true she may want to but she wont do it i dont think i will either i know its not the babys faultthats what babies do and by then coffeell taste good to me again so thatll help me keep going okay i cant tell you what to do and i wont try but i do want to make sure you understand your options plainly dr suzuki believed she was off her rocker for even thinking about keeping the kid id better by now i havent done much but think about them since i found out i was pregnant louise didnt tell him she was one of those people who were more likely to do something because all their friends and relations thought they were crazy if they did leaving colin for teo for instance yeah and look how well that turned out her mind gibed but she remained convinced she was happier now in spite of everything than she would have been had she stayed staying would have meant slow death shed never felt more vital more alive than she had since she walked out of the house and now somebody else was alive inside her she hadnt expected that when she walked out the door did she really have the energy to raise another one more and more she leaned toward finding out colin ferguson sat in an uncomfortable chair in a windowless conference room at torrance pd headquarters torrance was the biggest south bay city and had the biggest police department said department boasted the biggest buil and said building boasted the biggest conference room in the region torrance was also centrally located it was the logical place for cops going after the south bay strangler to meet but colin had seen interrogation rooms with a warmer human touch beside him gabe sanchez fidgeted in his seat colin didnt figure that was on account of the chair nochances were gabe needed his nicotine fix hardly any town in california let you light up in a place like this any more colin had never got that particular vice he didnt miss the smokefilled meetings of his earlier days as a cop gabe had the jones though nels jensen sat at the head of the long table the torrance captain had a lacquered mat of silver hair and features that would have seemed distinguished if his eyes werent a little too close together he wore an expensive suit that looked expensive how he afforded it was none of colins business jensen glanced around the room everybody who should have been here was cops were mostly a punctual bunch as soon as the wall clock showed two straight up jensen got to his feet which naturally made everybody look his way he nodded heavily and pawed at some papers on the table in front of him well gentlemen i got the dna reports this morning he said its official im afraid we can chalk this latest one up to the south bay sonofabitch no big surprise lou ayers muttered the palos verdes lieutenant sat a few seats up from colin and he was right the murder of margot keller matched the stanglers mo too well to leave much doubt the bastard was back in business mrs kellershe was a widowwas seventythree she lived alone she was throttled and raped and there wasnt a fingerprint in her neat little tract home that didnt belong to her that little tract home was in torrance not far from the big shopping center at the corner of redondo beach boulevard and hawthorne boulevard one more reason for captain jensen to hold the meeting here he went on we have got to catch this guy weve got to every time he does another one the media take out their knives and start raking us over the coals block that metaphor colin thought he had no use for the new yorker s politics but appreciated the magazines wit the stranglers made all of us look bad for way too long now jensen said i dont know about the rest of you but i dont like it when the papers and the tv news callsuh callme a nogood stupid stumblebum i wont make chief if they keep calling me names like that at least not in any town around here those were the words behind the words colin heard them loud and clear he suspected the other officers in the conference room did too roy schurz was happy as a clam being the boss cop in orofino idaho colin was mighty glad that made roy happy otherwise kelly might still be stuck in missoula even before the supervolcano went off though he wouldnt have wanted to live in orofino himselfnot for all the plastic junk in china he wouldnt there if nowhere else he sympathized with nels jensen one of these days the assholes got to slip up jensen continued plaintively a sad song colinand everybody else herehad also sung someone will see something or hear something or hell pick a cops widow to go after and shell blow his head off with her husbands service revolver something that was what you called whistling in the dark none of the cops seemed to want to meet his colleagues eyes but it sparked a thought in colin he stuck up his hand the way he would have in school jensen nodded at him have we got any idea at all how the guy picks his victims colin said he doesnt cruise the streets till he sees a little old lady walking along no wayhe scopes things out before he breaks in and kills em so how does he find em churches senior centers facebook for cryin out loud if we can get a handle on that were a step closer to psyching out what makes him tick its something we havent tried up till now far as i know he waited to see what the other cops would think slow nods went up and down the table gives us something to do besides cussing at the bastard anyhow lieutenant ayers said more nods followed we can follow it up captain jensen sounded like the pope approving something a cardinal had said in an ecumenical council if he thinks im gonna kiss his ring he can kiss my ass colin thought no way to know if well get any leads from it but i cant see how itd hurt the first thing gabe did when they got outside after the meeting finally broke up was light a cigarette the next thing he did was say you had a good idea there mr high and mighty shoulda got more turned on about it nah colin shook his head the only ideas that turn him on are the ones he gets himself then a reporter bore down on himthe press knew the south bay strangler had struck again since the strangler had struck in torrance this time colin could convincingly plead ignorance he not only could he did he and gabe got to their car more or less unscathed he turned on the news while he was eating dinner after he got home there was nels jensen telling a tv reporter it seems like a good idea to me to see if we can determine how the perpetrator targets his victims does he search for them in houses of worship or at gatherings of senior citizens or perhaps even by utilizing socialnetworking technology we are actively pursuing several of these possibilities at this point in time colin didnt frisbee his dinner plate through the tv screen the damn set was expensive but he almost gagged at hearing jensen not only lift his notion but turn it into mindnumbing bureaucratese was it really true that no good idea went unpunished it sure seemed to be he was glad when kelly called half an hour later she let him vent about all the different kinds of chickenshit chicken thief captain jensen was she sympathized hes a lousy plagiarist is what he is lousy is right colin agreed it sounded a lot better when i said it i believe you she said you arent into bureaucratic bs that was true it was one more thing that went some way towards explaining why colin had probably come as far as he could in policework every once in a while he wished he could quit calling a spade a spade or even a goddamn shovel like kidney stones those moments soon passed kelly went on ive got news too oh yeah what is it bettern mine i hope whatever it is colin said well i think so i picked out my dress today she told him all right he said whats it look like her reply got more technical than he was ready for he d the dress was long and white and had a veil he could have guessed that much without fancy explanations he didnt worry about it this was kellys first marriage after all she was more excited about tying the knot than he was hed put on a tux march down the aisle and say yes or i do when that was called for then hed hope for the best with her he thoughtyes he hopedhe had a fighting chance of getting it if he didnt he wouldnt march down the aisle hey he said when she slowed down one thing im sure of whatever youre wearing youll look great and when you arent wearing anything youll look even better youre impossible kelly said or else youre just male im not sure which she didnt say im not sure which is worse but colin didnt need to be a practiced interrogator to hear it anyhow guilty on both counts he said i throw myself on the mercy of the courtsplat splat is right not even married yet and youre already henpecked kelly sounded proud of it worse things to worry about for colin that was nothing but the truth he could worry about margot keller her body used crumpled and discarded like a paper towel he could think about all the other old women killed before her and about the guy out there living what looked like a normal life till he got the urge to add one more to his list next to that imperfect married bliss was no big deal somehow or other well make it work what do the brits say well muddle throughthats it theres what i like confidence kelly said wont be long now mister good colin answered and she purred at him over the phone xxii the piscataquis chuckled through guilford in the western part of the little town it powered the mill farther east its northern bank turned into a park that would no doubt be pretty when the grass was green and the trees had leaves on them eyeing the bare branches of those trees and the snow that was burying the riverview benches rob ferguson wondered whether guilford would ever see days like that again a monument also splotched with snow listed guilfords war dead from a history longer than towns on the other coast knew the letters on one of those names were still bright and shiny and new sooner or later they would mellow to match the others by then though chances were newer names would have gone up on the monument rob was getting used to wearing too many clothes all the time and to being cold anyway what heat there was in the trebor mansion inn rose to his little tower roomwhere it leaked out through the walls and windows the glass in the windows was double with an insulating air space between the panes they routinely did such things here heat leaked out all the same kids in the park slid down slopes toward the river on sleds they flung snowballs at one another they thought a winter with all this snow in it was fun rob might have felt the same way if he hadnt wondered whenor whetherthe weather would let up one of the books in his tower room was a sort of informal history of maine it told him more about the year without a summer after mt tambora erupted than hed found out online quebec city had got a foot of snow in june ice stayed on the lakes and rivers th long as far south as pennsylvania crops were ruined in north america and europe ruined to the point of widespread hunger the haze was so thick you could look at the sun with your naked eye and see sunspots and mt tambora was just one of these kids banging on a toy drum next to charlies fancy amplified kit when you compared it to the yellowstone supervolcano shaking his head at such gloomy reflections rob trudged up library street toward the trebor mansion inn the library was another historic building books in there would no doubt have even more to say about that summer that wasnt he didnt stop in to go look for those books why bother reading about it when hed be living through itand then somebefore long both suvs from the band remained in front of the inn along with the barber familys cars nobody was going anywhere the shell station still hadnt got more gas all the stations in doverfoxcroft were dry too tankers werent even trying to come up here any more north and west of the interstate maine was on its own the big part of the state if not the populous part but something new had been added out there next to the nearly useless motor vehicles stood a onehorse open sleigh straight out of jingle bells in lieu of a hitching post or rail the horsea wellcurried baywas tied to a doorknob it munched contentedly from a feed bag when rob went inside he took off his hat and his overshoes and that was about it with even firewood in short supply the place stayed cold dick barber greeted him with come into the parlor why dont you someone here id like you to meet whoevers in charge of the sleigh there rob asked thats right your cohorts have already made his acquaintance barber sometimes had an oldfashioned turn of phrase he could use it or not as he chose which made rob classify it as a special effect he wasnt inclined to be fussy a fire burned in the parlor hearth perhaps in honor of the newcomer the man stood with his back to rob savoring the warmth he was talking to justin and charlie who listened in what was plainly fascination hearing rob and barber come up behind him the fellow broke off and turned toward them he was in his late sixties and looked like rob needed a moment to realize who he looked like if you took john madden down to about five feet eight that would do for a first approximation he was ruddy and fleshy and had a sharp nose bushy eyebrows and silver hair he didnt dress like john madden though john madden looked like an unmade bed even in a suit this guy could have been a s dandy a lot of his hair was hidden under a broadbrimmed black fedora his overcoat boasted fur trim when he shrugged it off he was wearing a doublebreasted pinstriped wool suit underneath with lapels sharp and upthrusting enough to cut yourself on jim this is rob ferguson also of squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles barber said rob here before you stands jim farrell recent unsuccessful republican candidate for congress in the second districtmost of maine even if its not the part with most of the people in it the ones who do live their chose in their wisdom the usual blowdried airhead over someone who actually had some idea of what he was talking about glad to meet you rob farrell said in a resonant baritone dick helped run my campaign such as it was he tends to forget that its over and that we got trounced ancient history now like any failed campaign speaking of ancient history jim taught it for years at suny albany barber said then he retired and came homeclaimed the good weather in albany was wearing him down albany and good weather didnt strike rob as a likely mix farrell raised those extravagant eyebrows ive got over that he rumbled the way things are these days so has albany barber went on as if the older man hadnt spoken he picked up a fair amount of fame notoriety farrell broke in not without pride it was definitely notoriety for his newsletters called to the smallendians they skewered pc academics the way they deserve skewered em hellscrewed em to the wall charlie jerked on the couch where he was sitting he startled a cat sleeping beside him oh my god those things he said my older brother picked up a couple of them at an sf convention i think hes still got em ive read em theyre wicked he eyed farrell with newfound regard farrell doffed the fedora showing off a hairline that hadnt surrendered even half an inch i finally quit doing them i gave up in short the real academic world proved madder and sadder than anything i could invent and hes known for his comparative study of the campaigns of alexander and julius caesar barber added i cant speak as a professori never even played one on tv but as a career military man it impressed the bejesus out of me rob justin and charlie eyed one another sometimes you got a song cue when you least expected one charlie started beating out a rhythm on his thighs and on the coffee table in front of the couch that was a long way from his usual industrialstrength noisemakers but it would do it was plenty to make the cat which had tentatively settled down again head for the hills with a tail bristling in indignation and justin and rob launched into came along too late not every band had a song about alexander the greatone that even mentioned julius caesar toobut squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles wasnt every band not even close the words were mostly charlies with some tweaks from marshall back when hed got into ancient history theyd done it before larger audiences but never before a more knowing one dozing before the idiot box when hoofbeats awakened me history channel three am socalled documentary swords and sandals maps and blood watching the conquests spread and spread darius name was mud came along too late to see alex the great mopping up the persian cavalry came along too late to see alex the great found his hellenistic monarchy now some will stand out from the mass in good times or in rage for king philips son by olympias greece was too small a stage had to spread out cross the world couldnt help himself i think everywhere his flags unfurled he won fantastic ink came along too late to see alex the great mopping up thery came along too late to see alex the great found his hellenistic monarchy i know i live in the hereandnow it cant be helpedthats true but thinking of longvanished days oh wow all the things he got to do lift a bottle with aristotle start alexandrias all over the place one got a library founded by his longtime friend good old ptolemy came along too late to see alex the great mopping up the persian cavalry came along too late to see alex the great outdoing julius caesars infantry came along too late to see alex the great found his hellenistic monarchy came along too late was supposed to end on a wild flourish of cymbals you couldnt do those on your person or a tabletop justin solved the problem by using a doowop shoutwoohooinstead jim farrell looked from one member of the band to the next biff was probably down at calvins kitchen hed fallen for a brunette who waitressed there whether shed fallen for him was a different question but he was in there pitching anyhow these are men of parts farrell said at last to dick barber i suspect some of the parts stand in desperate need of repair but he that is without sin let him first cast an aspersion at them ouch rob said a noise with more admiration in it than pain farrell gave him a tip of the fedora if not a doff but rob quickly turned serious again here was a real if unorthodox politico in front of him he hadnt expected to have a chance like that since he did he asked what do we dowhat can anybody doabout everything the supervolcanos doing to us well i cant say im completely sorry the government seems to have forgotten about this part of the country sometimes being forgotten by the government is the best thing that can happen to you farrell answered rob wasnt so sure he bought that he was a liberal more often than not and in most ways but he turned libertarian if not reactionary four times a year when his estimatedtax payments came due the band made raw money with not a dime withheld rendering what uncle sam and the state demanded hurt more than it would have were he working a ninetofive like most people farrell hadnt finished but it also seems as though everybody on the far side of the interstate has forgotten about us i thinki hopewe can get through one winter like that when things warm up if they ever do well have to see about stocking up for another long hard cold stretch next winter if we can stock up if theres anything left to stock up on its not just a guilford maine problem you know its worldwide its not so bad in a lot of other places rob said true enough but its worse in some farrell said how would you like to be in salt lake city or denver right now my sister was in denver shes one of the lucky onesshe got out quick i guess she was lucky now shes stuck in one of those camps in the middle of nowhere rob said she cant stand it but shes alive anyway vanessa ferguson commonly acted on the principle that the squeaky wheel got the grease she didnt believe in depriving herself of the pleasure ocomplaining the only trouble was there were a hell of a lot of squeaky wheels in camp constitution the miserable place had to have a couple of hundred thousand people in it by now and it was awful a saint would have hated it ordinary people vanessa had heard the suicide rate at the camp was ridiculously high and she believed it it was much too easy to decide that staying here was a fate worse than death the people who ran camp constitution were from the government and they were there to help you provided you did exactly what they told you to do if you didnt or if you were otherwise unhappy well they had procedures for that to get your problem settled or even noticed you lined up at the camp constitution administration building that only roused further resentment as far as vanessa knew it was the only building in the whole enormous goddamn camp it was flimsy and rickety and had been run up in a tearing hurry but still federal bureaucrats deserved no less that was what they and their paymasters in washington thought anyhow tents and fema trailers were for the rabble stuck in the camp you lined up regardless of what it was doing outside raining you lined up snowing same deal they did in their mercy and wisdom put up an awning that gave some modest protection from the elements but that was all it gave some modest protection the ground under your feet still got gloppy the weather still got beastly cold people said it was the worst winter in these parts in they couldnt remember how long everybody blamed it on the supervolcano everybody was likely to be right not that that did anybody any good if you didnt feel like shivering in the muck for however long you needed to see the people with the power to do something about your complaint if they happened to feel like it you could turn around and trudge back to your tent through even more of that same muck the bureaucrats inside the administration building wouldnt mind not one bit they wouldnt there werent nearly enough of them to handle all the people in the camp with problems that made the line start well before the awning did it inched forward with glacial slowness considering the weather the comparison struck vanessa as much too apt she had a hooded quilted anorak with a pinkandpurple nylon shell that was at least three sizes too big for her charity of a sort she had long johns too more charity she was cold anyhow she was also itchy there were bedbugs in her tent there were bedbugs all over camp constitution somebodyd brought them in and theyd thrived like mad bastards several eradicating campaigns had failed to eradicate the same was true for head lice though she didnt have thoseyet there was talk in washington of making ddt to fight the vermin at the refugee camps so far it was nothing but talk vanessa had always thought of herself as a pretty green person but she would cheerfully have shot a spotted owl to rid herself of her sixlegged companions a heavyset bearded man wearing a coat even uglier than hersand they said the age of miracles had passed gave up and stumped away he muttered a stream of obscenities as he went maybe they were what made his breath smoke more likely it was just the cold the queue moved up to fill the space hed occupied one more we dont got to wait for said the black woman behind vanessa one more the yahoos up ahead wont have to deal with vanessa said pointing to the still far too distant building ahead i hate lines you know jez honey who dont the black woman answered but what you gonna do vanessa still carried the in her purse a few people at the camp had gone postal one guy gunned down seven of his tentmates before somebody brained him from behind with a baseball bat for a nasty instant vanessa savored the brief scarlet joy of flipping out like that if the alternative was worming forward an inch at a time till you got to talk to some dumb fuck who couldnt have cared less sighing she wormed forward another inch maturity and sanity sucked sometimes they really did half an hour later she scraped the mud off the bottom of her nikes on the sharp edges of the aluminum steps leading up to the administration building those edges already had a lot of mud on them from others whod done the same thing before her the instinct not to track dirt inside remained strong even when there was next to no inside and what seemed like all the dirt in the world a sign on the glass doors said please keep closed the administration building had a real heating system not a halfassed propane heater in the middle of a tent nothing too good for the folks helping our refugees the building had power too and computers and phones and broadband internet and everything else vanessa was missing except when she got in the line even longer than this one to go to the charging station to give her cell more juice in due course she reached a counter behind which sat a thirtyish dweeb with glasses and a broken front tooth before she could get down to brass tacks he asked for her name her social security number only he called it her social which she wouldnt have understood if she hadnt already heard it from other penpushers and her tent number and the nature of your difficulty is its not just mine vanessa said its everybodys except for this one woman named loretta she has three horrible brats theyre going stircrazy theyve got no video games to play or tv to watch and they drive everybody nuts you cant even sleep at night cause they scream and fight for the fun of it if you dont do something about it somebodys going to pinch their little heads off he fiddled with a computer that would be loretta baker it seems what do you want me to do move her and the monsters out of there vanessa said at once if you cant do that get me the hell out you realize conditions may be no better in the tent to which you are reassigned he said her heart sank he wouldnt move loretta and the snotnoses which was what she really wanted sighing she said ill take my chances it might not be so easy to make the adjustment he eyed her over the tops of his specs an attitude of cooperation would be expected what does that mean vanessa figured she knew what it meant make nice for mr federal functionary and hell help you out too dont make nice and stay stuck where you are why what it says of course he answered primly the son of a bitch had practice at this he wouldnt come out and tell her fuck me or get lost that might land him in trouble but if you were that kind of bastard you had to have opportunities galore in a place like this chances were he got laid a lot vanessa got up from her uncomfortable folding chair forget about it she snarled thinking again of the revolver in her handbag the guy with the broken tooth only shrugged the choice is always yours ms ferguson if you change your mind consult with me again i promise you excellent service if you do and how did he mean that just the way it sounded no doubt vanessa stormed out of the administration building what really worried her was those little assholes of lorettas were so very appalling she feared she might come back and come across if somebody didnt murder them first shed worried about this kind of thing before now if push came to shove she swore louder than the bearded guy had when he gave up on the line its so wonderful miriam birnbaum gushed and reached out to straighten a lock of kellys hair that didnt need straightening mom kelly pulled away she wished more and more shed just gone through a simple civil ceremony with colin her folks had almost given up on the idea that shed ever get married now that they had the chance they were trying to turn the wedding into a production number well they were footing the bill that gave them a certain right to have things their way only to a point though it wasnt their wedding even if they were paying it was hers and colins im happier than i know how to tell you her mother said and either proved that or gave it the lie by crying dont do that kelly exclaimed youll mess up your makeup she dabbed at moms cheek with a kleenex it repaired most of the damage anyhow her fatherone of the best dentists in the south bay if he said so himself and he didput an arm around her mother its okay miriam leonard birnbaum said colins a good guy i wouldnt be crying if he wasnt mom said which might have made sense to her but left kelly mystified she was also gobsmacked that the lecturers slot at cal state dominguez hills fell into her lap right after her parents hired the hall here whether she was obsolete or not they wanted her she would have had second thoughts about taking the job most of the time if the university of california system was hurting the california state university system was on the critical list but csudh wasnt more than fifteen minutes away from san atanasio as long as any gas at all got into the la areaand as long as any money at all got into the cal state systemshe could go teach she wondered if geoff rheinburg knew the gal who ran the dominguez hills geology department that would explain a lot it would also be oddson the best wedding present she got one side of the hall was packed with her relatives and friends the other side was mostly cops square solid men in suits that had been stylish a while ago or maybe never how many of them had shoulder holsters under their jackets marshall was there of course im a stepmother kelly thought in bemusement as she went up the aisle on her fathers arm she hoped colins other two kids were doing all right next to marshall in the front row sat colins sister norma kellyd never set eyes on her before she and her husband earl both worked nights though and didnt show themselves when most people did kelly didnt think there were any hard feelings between her and colin but they werent exactly close either colin waited under the chuppah with a reform rabbi wes jones and kelys first cousin loreen samuels damned if wes didnt wink at her as she came near thered be never a dull moment living across the street from him he wore a yarmulke with as much ease as the rabbi did colins kind of stuck up on his head hed agreed to a jewish ceremony with good grace but nothing would ever make him look jewish some chanted hebrew prayers some marriage advice that was sensible but perfectly ordinary colins shoe coming down on a clothwrapped glass to remember the fall of the temple a ring a kiss it was official shed have to start getting used to her new last name well she wouldnt have to not these days but she intended to kelly ferguson for once it sounded as if her first and last names went together after champagne toasts at the reception colin said i saw a study that showed guys who marry younger wives live longer and are happier oh yeah wonder how come that is gabe sanchez said everybody laughed gabe struck kelly as a slightly rougher hispanic version of the guy shed just married he went on congratulations man looks like you got a real good one gives us all hope yknow his heavyfeatured face clouded kelly remembered colin saying gabe had gone through a divorce even uglier than his own evidently he hadnt found anyone new since they ate they drank some more they danced colin moved as gracefully as anyone with two left feet man i know white folks got no sense of rhythm but cant you at least try a black cop said softening the dart with a grin this aint the hood rodney you got to do the dozens on me at my wedding colin said any time at all rodney answered he was strutting his stuff with a latino womanhis wife kelly decided after checking for rings she still hadnt got used to rings on her own finger she expected she would at last they changed back into street clothes a limo laid on by kellys folks waited under an awning outside the hall a good thing the awning was there a nasty chilly rain came down it couldnt have been far above freezing it wouldnt be this cold if it wasnt for your dumb old supervolcano kellys mother said she was right but she made it sound as if the supervolcano wouldnt have erupted if kelly hadnt studied it the drivera samoan big enough to have played pro footballwhisked them up the harbor freeway to the bonaventure hotel downtown colin slipped him fifty bucks thanks a lot man the guy said touching a blunt forefinger to the brim of his cap happy wedding yknow their room was high up in one of the hotels round glassy towers colin lifted a squeaking kelly over the threshold a bottle of champagne with a card waited in an ice bucket in the room colin opened the card he grinned from gabe he said hes sweet kelly was looking at the city lights and at cars streaming by on the freeway just to the west in spite of gas shortages there were still lots of them she wondered if things would pick up or just keep going downhill yeah he is colin agreed from behind her and hed clout us one if we said so to his face a muffled pop announced hed opened the bottle carefully and neatly so as not to waste any on the nightstand stood two glass flutes not plastic like those at the reception he poured for them both and handed her one then he raised the other heres to us babe i love you i love youtoo she clinked flutes to us after they drank she said if i do too much more of this ill fall asleep on you some wedding night thatd be he mimed a leer id just have my way with your unconscious bodymwahaha kelly snorted its better when both people in the game want to play i wont argue colin shut the drapes sodo you want to play right this minute theres nothing i want more in the whole wide world kelly stepped into his arms things went on from there some considerable and very happy time later she said dont you ever let that rodney sass you about your sense of rhythm again you hear yes maam he answered from a distance of about three inches then he patted at his hair kelly made a questioning noise i was wondering if you took the top of my head off there he explained you she said fondly me he agreed is there anything left in that champagne bottle if there isnt we can always call room service she answered there wasnt and she did spending my money already colin said no way kelly told him dominguez will pay me a little something anyway they eventually went to sleep when kelly woke wan gray light was leaking past the drapes she put on sweats and a tshirt and went to look outside she must have made a noiseprobably a startled gruntbecause from behind her her new husband asked what is it babe come see was all she said he needed a moment to get decent too then he joined her at the window he let out a low whistle of astonishment snowflakes danced in the air it was white down below white in the middle of downtown la the harbor freeway was white too white and empty ghostly even any snow at all would screw traffic here from a to whatever came after z no sooner had that crossed her mind than a car on the surface street down below skidded sideways into a pickup truck neither luckily was going very fast both drivers got out and glumly eyed the damage colin turned on the tv a chipper local weatherman said be careful out there folks the last time we had snow all over the la basin was in january of i have to say we arent really equipped for it if you can possibly stay home youd sure be smart to do it kelly and colin exchanged stricken looks marshall had been planning to pick them up and take them back to the house from there they would have gone to the hotel coronado in san diego a honeymoon on a tank of gas now kelly had no idea what theyd do now colin did call room service again tell em to send up coffee and some breakfast and after thathey well just go on from there by the way his gaze roamed her she didnt need to have bothered dressing sounds good to me she said and padded over to the phone outside the snow kept coming down along with gabe sanchez colin spooned up ramenfancy ramen not the packaged stuff college kids ate and louise dealt within a little place on reynoso drive it was in the mostly japanese shopping center that also held the carrows where hed had that lacerating lunch with his ex if he looked out the window he could see the other place as long as he kept slurping up soup and noodles and chopped pork he didnt have to look out the window so you and kelly were stuck there huh gabe said thats funny man worse places to be than snowed in with your brandnew wife colin answered in the two and a half days before enough snow melted to let traffic start moving again hed done more than hed figured a man his age could do and hed managed all right once they finally got to san diego too yeah i guess gabe didnt sound completely convinced no he hadnt had much luck with his love life since his marriage hit a mine and exploded its good to have you back in the saddle though good to be back colin allowed no matter what kind of carnal excesses hed managed at the bonaventure and the coronado a man his age couldnt do that all the time not unless he wanted to roll up like a window shade thwup thwup thwup you figure well ever drop on the goddamn strangler gabe asked it wasnt out of the blue thered been a fresh killing over in manhattan beach while colin and kelly were on their abbreviated visit to san diego colin hadnt heard about it till he came home watching the news hadnt been his biggest worry while he was there as long as no more snow came down he hadnt cared what happened in the outside world now he did now he had to and now he said what cops all over the south bay had been saying all along hes bound to goof sooner or later trip over something in the dark and break his ankle maybe something some bad guys got away with things for a long time either through fool luck or because they were the uncommon smart people who turned to crime very few went to their graves uncaught colin was sure of it he had to be if he wanted to keep thinking he was doing something that mattered this ones not in our jurisdiction same as the last one wasnt gabe said let the guys in manhattan beach take the heat see how they like news vans lined up outside the department all the time and the clowns with the expensive haircuts asking dumbass questions im sure they enjoy it as much as we do colin said gabe laughed harshly colin went on what i want to be is i want to be the one who busts the son of a bitch i dont know if i can be that lucky twice but i sure want to twice now gabe sounded puzzled colin had been a solid steady capable cop for a hell of a long time now hed caught a lot of perps some smart ones and even more of the jerks and losers who went wrong but hed never pulled a coup that even came close to what arresting the south bay strangler would mean he wasnt thinking of policework though lucky uhhuh he said only reason i ever went to yellowstone was to get away from everything after louise walked out on me me i went to vegas when things hit the fan sanchez said i bet you got away cheaperill tell you that i bet youre right colin agreed so there i was walking around in this cold miserable drizzle still kind of hungover looking at the hot pools in the west thumb basin and i reamed out this gal for going off the boardwalk gabe chuckled once a cop always a cop tell me about it so kelly showed me she had every right to be where she was cause she was doing her research and i felt two inches tall and covered in dogshit but then i got lucky one more time this earthquake hit and it gave us something to talk about besides what a moron i was i ended up getting her email and i gave her mine and we just went on from there fool luck all the way nothing else but instead of answering right away gabe concentrated on getting to the bottom of his bowl then he said if you tell me the same thing ten fifteen years from now ill be more impressed mm i know what you mean colin admitted people went into first marriages sure theirs was a passion for the ages and just as sure love would last forever they went into second marriages hoping things worked out even that might have been the triumph of hope over experience but it also might have been a more realistic attitude sometimes even ten fifteen years arent enough look at us our first ones both lasted longern that but when they died they fuckin died man gabe said i know sometimes you grow together sometimes you grow apart colin said he worked at his own ramen the broth was salty and porky and delicious his doctor would probably scream that it was a sodium bomband a fat bomb to bootbut sometimes he just didnt care you know what im really jealous about gabe asked what colin worked to keep his voice neutral how could his buddy help being jealous of his happiness gabe didnt have a hell of a lot of his own these days but the sergeants answer blindsided him im jealous you got to see yellowstone see it while it was still there to see i mean nobodys ever gonna be able to do that again but you did youre right colin said in surprise kelly goes on about so much stuff being gone but i hadnt thought about it that way hell of a lot of stuff nobodyll see again you were there gabe paused wasnt that the name of a tv show a million years ago i think it was something like that anyway colin finished his lunch before the eruption this place had served its ramen in big old styrofoam cups you could wash bowls and use them over and over the only time you needed a new one was when you dropped an old one once these people ran out of styrofoam they fell back on plan b plan b plan c a lot of the time these days it seemed as if the country was on about plan q nobody had any good ideas to pull it out of its mess or more likely the mess was simply too goddamn big for anything so trivial as some humans good idea to make much difference and as kelly kept pointing out this was only the beginning the eruption was over but the aftereffects lingered on how long would it be before the midwest was the worlds breadbasket again not buried under ash and dust how many people would go hungry on account of that would the midwest be the worlds breadbasket again with the weather getting so much colder how long would the chill last years decades centuries nobody knew for sure but everybody was going to find out things probably wouldnt be anywhere close to the same for the rest of his life what were you supposed to do gabe put money on the table here mister just back from his honeymoon this ones on methanks colin stood up so did gabe as they walked out to their car he asked so you got your ducks in a row to testify at the ellis trial the kid from the projects was up for three counts of armed robbery and one of firstdegree murder the case looked openandshut to colin but nothing was openandshut if you messed it up im getting there he answered still reviewing the videotapes and the reports and all how about you pretty much the same gabe said if they dont stick a needle in his arm they need to make damn sure he doesnt get out again yup colin nodded maybe this was what you were supposed to do what youd always done as well as you could for as long as you could what else could any one person do he unlocked the car and slid into the drivers seat gabe got in on the other side they drove back to the cop shop under a sundogged sun in an aguecheeked sky
