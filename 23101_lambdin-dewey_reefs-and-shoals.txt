dewey lambdin reefs and shoals lewry this one is for a dear longtime friend bob enrione february th june th we never actually met facetoface but back in the misty mids he called me one night to talk about the series as a fan first which turned into hours long almost weekly chats about everything the great age of sail naval history in general social customs and scandals of the times food he cooked lobscouse spotted dog and seapies and the eccentricities of the british and the characters of the royal navy bob was a us navy diver and vietnam veteran who ended up traveling the world with cbs news knew a bit about anything that caught his mind so he had a wealth of stories about world leaders hed met and the gossip about our media celebrities was priceless too he retired in early and was looking forward to a lot of things including a novel of his own and a compendium of his historical naval essays i his wife jackie his family and friends will miss him most sorely and that voice on the phone now let open justice hear come with killing sword to smite one who knows no law no right the bacchae euripides prologue i wish i were the bosun aboard a man o war i wish i were the captain aboard a man o war sams gone away aboard a man o war pretty work brave boys pretty work i say sams gone away aboard a man o war short haul or drag shanty anonymous chapter one to captain alan lewries lights no place was better on such a cold day than to be snug in a warm soft bed with a toastywarm woman a wellstoked fireplace ablaze with a heap of seacoal and a brass reflector plate at the back to radiate its heat outward a brace of candles aglow on the nightstand to create an intimate amber aura a pot of tea atop a candlewarming stand and a squat bottle of brandy near to hand well all those were fine in their own way but they ran a poor secondbest to snuggling close in the afterglow of feverish lovemaking lewrie shifted a bit digging his shoulder deeper into a pile of pillows and tugged the blankets thick feather quilt and coverlet up to his ears then let out a very pleased mmmm he lay facing the lone window in the suite of rooms and the sight of the rime of frost on the inside of the panes the swirling flakes of snow stark white against the low grey clouds outside brought forth a shiver in spite of the beds warmth early january winds now and then moaned round the corners of the venerable george inn almost whistled cross the fireplace chimney like a badly made clock there even came the irregular tick of tiny hard bits of sleet against the glass whod be a sailor on such a day he whispered i do imagine the smart ones find a warm inn lydia told him with a wee chuckle and a grin that scrunched her nose rather cutely lewrie thought lydia stangbourne might not possess the bowed and beestung mouth that society preferred nor the high brow or the plumpness of form that made gentlemen turn their heads in silent admiration but lewrie had thought her oddly fetching from their first encounter at st jamess palace the day hed been knighted and had grown even more entranced since she was willow slim and wiry with dark emerald green eyes and hair the colour of old honey hair which she allowed to curl naturally and scoffed impatiently at the idea of elegant coiffures or wigs that nose fullon it seemed too wide and large though in profile it looked much shorter almost pugirish and she was disarmingly strong for a daughter of the aristocracy and a sister of a viscount that came from vigourous daily rides fox hunting in season steeplechasing when not from brisk walks hunting with her brother percy on their estates with her own rifled musket or fowling piecenot when lord percys male compatriots were there thougheven dabbling at swordplay shed gleefully admitted hiring a swordmaster in for very private lessons when at their main country house near henleyonthames her slim upper arms bore more lean muscle than any lady of her age or class might sport all of that suppleness and strength sheathed in smooth and blemishless flesh as soft and fragrant as talc the feel of which quite made lewries head swim such good timing lydia cooed as she pressed closer to him had i come before christmas as wed planned youd have been off with that popham fellow but now i pray most earnestly that the weather stays like this for the next fortnight and i thought i was shot of those damned catamaran torpedoes lewrie replied with a groan god made women just hellishfine he thought sleepin or just layin close like this theyre better than a warmin pan the summer before his frigate hms reliant had been tasked to experiment with a variety of infernal engines designed to drift in on the tides and blow up some of the thousands of french invasion craft there had been a real attack with them against the port of boulogne but the results had been extremely disappointing lewrie had thought that would be an end to them but no captain sir home riggs popham the clever fellow who had invented the navys new flag code had staged an assault on fort rouge a pilebuilt battery outside the port of calais and since lewrie knew so much about torpedoes he had been roped in despite what he thought of them sure enough of the two launched one went far off course and blew up harmlessly and the second did a disappearing act the lone fireship sent in exploded too soon too and the whole thing had been a dead bust after that admiralty had given up on torpedoes in general and since the middle of december lewrie and reliant had been anchored here in portsmouth awaiting new orders and the foul weather had penned them in fresh orders or no for which he was this moment damned thankful this was simply a splendid way to welcome in the new year of when wakened at am at eight bells in his greatcabins aboard ship anchored far out in st helens road it had taken a long look and a hard try to leave his hanging bedcot all his blankets and his coverlet a quilt or two and the furs hed bought to brave the cold of the baltic before the battle of copenhagen and he had still been cold his cats toulon and chalky had found it too nippy for them too and had burrowed under for a rare once and would not be turfed out either and the long gusty sail to fetch alongside the kings stairs in a whistledup bumboat had left him chilled to the bone with his teeth chattering halfway through breakfast and a whole pot of scalding hot coffee comfortable he asked her blissfully lydia murmured back warm enough delightfully so she assured him then lifted her lips to his for a soft and gentle kiss he stroked the length of her back and her flanks her thigh thrown over his slid higher but except for your feet it seems lewrie said grimacing i could say the same of yours lydia replied giggling as she slid her foot down next to his wriggling her toes as if to grasp or play at toewrestling alan i hate to ask but might you mind pouring me a cup of tea with a dollop of brandy he let out a theatrical groan and a weary well if i must outside the bed covers the room was merely cool not frozen solid but lewrie made a quick chore of it pouring tea adding sugar and a splash of spirits you are a dear lydia vowed quite prettily as he handed her the cup and saucer and hopped back into bed she slid up to prop herself against the thick piilows and drew the blankets up to her neck damned right i am and ill thankee tremember it lewrie hooted which brought forth a laugh that was another point in her favour in lewries books at least that in private she allowed herself to be raw open and genuine and to laugh out loud when amused in public well that was another matter as lewrie had seen early on in london as late as breakfast here at the george inn not two hours before the difference between the private lydia and the one which wore her publick face was as stark as night from day shed been homely as a child and still thought herself so in her late teens her first exposure to the marriage market of a london season had been cruelly disappointing even for a viscounts daughter with a dowry of per annum and a future beaus access to more land and property than most people had hot dinners the beautiful the giddy and silly whod only fetch had ruled the rounds of all the balls salons routs and drums years later at her lovely mothers harsh insistence shed been placed on the block again this time with for her dot and lydia had been kneedeep in slavering swains most with the twinkle of golden guineas in their eyes which had disgusted her to the point that she had treated them all most rudely which only made the greediest declare her modern and delightfully outspoken and when shed finally wed quite late her choice had been a man most vile so secretly depraved that shed run for her life and had pressed her brother now the third viscount stangbourne to seek a bill of divorcement in the house of commons two years or more of charge and countercharge made a scarlet hussy and a scandal in the papers before winning her suit and she was still pointed out as that stangbourne mort no wonder lydia was so guarded so icily aloof and imperious in publick and preferred the safety of the country and a very small circle of friends where she could shed her armour she was now thirtytwo ten years younger than lewrie and most firmly determined never to place herself under another mans control definitely not as a wifewhat man could she trust no matter his promisesor so lewrie suspected allow her heart to be won by a lovers blandishments once bitten twice shy she was yet lydia found lewries company enjoyable right from the first he was a widower since his two sons were on their own bottoms and his daughter charlotte was with his former inlaws in the village of anglesgreen in surrey lewrie also suspected that the reason that lydia found him acceptable was the fact that he was in the navy and unless the war with napoleon bonaparte and france ended suddenly he would be gone and far away for a year or more between rencontres or maybe its cause im nigh as scandalous as she is lewrie wryly told himself as he watched her sip her tea with a grin on his face his fathers family the willoughbys had always ridden their own way roughshod headstrong and damn the devil his father sir hugo st george willoughby had been a charter member of the hellfire club for gods sake and lewrie was his bastard like the old adage acorns dont fall far from the oak tree he could boast of two byblows of his own did one dare boast of such things his nickname gained early in his lieutenancy was the ramcat and that was not for his choice of shipboard pets what lydia asked of a sudden peering at him i was just enjoying watching you enjoying your tea lewrie told her a little thing but a niceun i am pleased that you are pleased she said with a chuckle and a fond smile though its no great skill or social art what if i slurped or smacked my lips might you find that enjoyable i might draw the line did you belch lewrie japed but did you im certain youd do it kittenish he leaned over to kiss the point of her bared shoulder oh kittenish lydia laughed again like a proper ladys sneeze with a wee mew in punctuation you are easily pleased well damme yes i am lewrie told her with a laugh and a grope under the covers she finished her tea handed it to him so he could set it on the nightstand then slid back down into his embrace once more giving out a long pleased sigh after several long and lingering kisses lydia settled down with her head under his chin i suppose its too cold to even think of going out to that inn you told me of she murmured wouldnt wish that on a hound lewrie assured her dinner at the george here will more than do when you feel famished all those senior captains and admirals and their wives she hesitantly replied making a moue in distaste as dear as i wish the pleasure of your company im surely bad for your repute in the navy didnt know i had one lewrie quipped and if i do its as bad as its goin tget personal repute anyways theres none that can fault me when it comes to fighting and thats what counts he sat up to look down at her your reputations more at risk for bein seen with me than i for bein with you he told her and i dont give a damn for others opinions on that head bugger em feed em thin cold gruel she drew him down close pleased by his statement lewrie feared though that lydia didnt much care for how the other diners would stare point with their chins cut their eyes and whisper behind their hands and napkins the matronly proper wivesd be the worst they were respectable she was not and they would find a way to make that tacitly clear we could order in lewrie suggested and give the inn servants gossip to pass on lydia said with a sour grimace and an impatient shrug they probably have ties to the london papers the many daily publications in london all had one or two snoops to gather spice for their reportage of court doings or the appearances of the famous and infamous the morning after lydia had dined out with him thered been a snarky item about them in several papers no names were printed but anyone who had kept up with society reporting could make an educated guess about a recently divorced lady often featured in our pages the last two years running and the distinguished naval person shed been seen with ending with a smirky will the lady in question teach her seadog new tricks or has our jason found himself a fresh sheetanchor which infamous divorcee was seen dining clad in nothing but her shift with a dashing naval hero similarly sans his small clothes at an inn in portsmouth dye mean lewrie scoffed exactly so lydia snapped then well dress and dine publicly lewrie decided much as id admire tsee you gnaw a chicken leg nude he drew her back into a snug embrace and stroked her hair to mollify her do i live to eighty theyll still find something delicious to write about me lydia groused in a small voice nonsense lewrie hooted theyve nelson and emma hamilton twrite about or the doings of all those damned bohemian poets well lewrie yawned and slowly stretched against her lady caroline lamb he added theres a road smash and good for daily scandals he yawned again louder and longer now youll get me started lydia said covering her mouth as she snuggled closer and lower down the bed lets try something novel lewrie suggested ye know weve never she stiffened and slid away from him a few inches bracing herself on an elbow something novel something unnatural bind me to the headboard posts just what perversion do you desire sir do you drop your pretense at last like the beast i foolishly wed lydia lydia i mean nothing at all like that he gently insisted reliant s in channel fleet and no officer is allowed to sleep out of his ship weve never had the time before to just cuddle up nod off and sleep together take a long snuggly nap rumour had it that her exhusband had been driven by scandal to his country estates wore a bell round his neck like a leper to warn off objects of his beastly desires and would bugger ducks geese and stray sheep if he couldnt run down anything bipedal male or female young or old just sleep lydia mused with her head cocked over and a wry look on her face she screwed her lips to one side as if biting her cheek for a moment then with a rush she was back close beside him snuggling under the heavy covers im sorry i mistook after that bastard youd be right tsuspect lewrie allowed said it yourself though im so easily pleased he japed itll be like bein married to a parsons daughter he thought with a wellstifled groan and goodbye to fellatio forever for all the innuendos and charges laid during lydias two years of waiting for parliament to grant her divorce and what a scandalous bawd shed been painted she was surprisingly shy and conventional he could only caress stroke and kiss so low down her belly then no further she might slide atop him and ride st georges lance now and again but anything more outre was right out it was not that lewrie was a devotee of the outre but now and then some rare variety some surprise was pleasing hed found thats why men keep mistresses or go to brothels he thought with a secret grin yes lets what do sailors call a nap lydia agreed they caulk off take a caulk lewrie softly whispered do two sailors board a coach onell ask the other does he prefer to caulk or yarn nap or trade stories caulk or yarn sir lydia asked with an impish tone caulk lewrie said with a chuckle dodged another bullet lewrie congratulated himself after some minutes when her breath against his chest became slow and regular right at the edge of sleep himself ye cheated death again chapter two the old george inn did set the best table that lewrie knew of in portsmouth which made it the favourite destination for those navy officers who could afford to dine or lodge there and their midday meal was no exception after a good twohour nap a slow and languourous awakening with much snuggling caressing fond mutual regardingsand a delightful if conventional bout of lovemakinglewrie and lydia had risen dressed and come down to the dining rooms he with his sash and star of a knight of the bath at her insistence to dine hopes for a good salad in midwinter were moot but there was a hearty and hot tarragon chicken soup followed by servings of haddock in lemon and drawn butter then a course of sliced roast beef all with roast potatoes and peas sloshed down with glasses of rhenish and one shared bottle of claret lewrie went for pound cake with cream and raspberry jam whilst lydia settled for sweet biscuits and coffee she was a light diner lewrie had noted before always leaving portions of her dishes uneaten and ordering only a few items not the usual ritual of fishfowlswineroast beef or beefsteak that could take hours to put away but ive always had a light appetite she had explained once and to lewries cocked brow when shed passed on cheese and nuts this time she leaned over to put her head close to his and said you must know alan that i am so easily pleased which made the both of them laugh no matter who else dined with them or what they thought of their intimate moment more coffee sir a servant asked aye lewrie agreed there was a bustle in the entrance hall as someone new arrived accompanied by a blast of cold air it was a navy officer a lieutenant in his early thirties and a pleasantenough looking young woman with him both swaddled in travelling cloaks behind them came a civilian servant bearing the womans luggage and a sailor loaded down with the lieutenants once the door was shut against the snow they shucked their cloaks and embraced a fond reunion do you imagine lydia asked him seems so lewrie agreed hells bells do you know him lydia asked him no but his man lewrie told her plucking his napkin from his lap and dabbing his mouth ready to rise hes off aeneas my sons ship he quickly explained atop the sailors head was a widebrimmed and lowcrowned flat tarred hat with a long black ribbon band trailing down his coat collar painted in white lettering on the front of the hat was his ships name excuse me for a moment lewrie pled getting to his feet and going to the opened double doors from the dining room to the entrance hall the lieutenant and his ladyrevealed to be husband and wife once their gloves were off and their wedding bands in plain sightwere lost in joy to be reunited oblivious my pardons sir lewrie began ahem the young wife spotted him and inclined her head to direct her husbands attention from rapt adoration captain alan lewrie sir hope youll forgive me for intruding on your moment but you are off the aeneas seventyfour captain benjamin rodgers aye i am sir allow me to name myself to you captain i am robert stiles my wife judith the officer replied she dropped a passable curtsy we came in just yesterday afternoon from the brest blockade do you know captain rodgers sir happy tmake your acquaintance mister stiles mistress stiles captain rodgers and i are old friends but more to the point is the fact that my son sewallis is one of your midshipmen oh mister lewrie aye lt stiles said in a gush laughing forgive me for not making the connexion at once sir hes one of ours right enough right carter he said to the sailor whod borne his shoregoing traps an a fine gennulman e be sir is mister lewrie the sailor assured him as smart as paint he added with a grin and wink glad thear it lewrie said a bit relieved ill attempt to get in touch with captain rodgers at once treat him to a shore supper perhaps go aboard to see sewallis thankee mister stiles and i apologise again for interrupting you and your wife my very best wishes for a long and joyous stay in port the officer is from your sons ship lydia asked once he was seated with her again and getting a warmup of his coffee aye he is lewrie happily told her god i havent seen sewallis since may of and damned few letters from him in the meantime havent seen benjamin rodgers his captain in a dogs age either the adriatic in i must buy him at least one supper with lashings of champagne and hang the cost hes mad for the stuff wont sail without a dozen dozen bottles in his lazarette store ha ha and treat your son to something better than salt meats too lydia asked looking a touch sombre of course lewrie declared his head full of plans captain rodgers knew you early on i think you said when when your wife was alive lydia continued fiddling nervously with a coffee spoon perhaps i should not be present when if theyve kept up with the papers i might bring bad feelings he peered at her gravely taking a long breath then reached to take her free hand lydia i dont give a damn what theyve read or what theyve heard im done with mourning carolines passing and im fortunate enough to have met someone new whos become dear to me im not the sort tsneak about or shove you into an armoire til companys gone either weve nothing tbe ashamed of well in certain circumstances i have he remembered mostly the sneakin about bit youve become very dear to me as well alan lydia told him with a fond almost shy smile if you wish me to meet them and be with you then i shall gladly such a grand lass lewrie congratulated her know who that was lt stiles was telling his wife once they had gone above stairs to their temporary lodgings black alan lewrie the one who was tried for stealing slaves to crew his ship and got away with it a real fighting frigate captain knighted and made baronet last year the ramcat some call him oh hes made a name for himself the ramcat his wife asked puzzled for the scrapping way he goes after englands enemies or for keeping pet cats since his first command lt stiles breezed off well which is it mrs styles asked im pretty sure its the scrapping her husband answered ill write a quick note lewrie was planning two really and find a bumboat tbear em out to aeneas or long as im there i might as well go out to her and see em both first if benjamin has any fresh stores aboard or the pedlars get to him quick enough i might even get dined aboard so you may be gone til dusk lydia speculated and not be back til tomorrow morning since you cannot be out of your ship at night oh well there is that lewrie said back deflating you would be twiddlin yer thumbs with the weather too foul for shopping not that shopping in portsmouths got a jot on london hey surely there are art gallerys that feature nautical paintings lydia mused something realistic depicting a frigate to remind me of you when youre gone and realistic enough to allow me to lecture percy on every detail she added with a mischievous grin and another impish wrinkle of her nose hes bored me to tears with the details of cavalry saddlery fodder and army drill manuals youd go out in this raw chill youd catch your death he objected and you wont risk the same lydia scoffed go then and ill see you on the morrow ill dine in alone this evening and i will tuck myself in with a good novel and sleep by myself she said as she leaned closer her lips curled in secret amusement though i will confess that that will not be as warm or as blissful as that nap of ours i wish i could kiss you this instant lewrie told her in a hoarse mutter after a quick peek round the dining rooms one to warm you just before you go out into the cold lydia promised with expectations of more tomorrow lewrie wished aloud most assuredly she vowed chapter three well damme captain benjamin rodgers boomed as he barrelled up to the starboard gangway and entryport of his twodecker third rate to greet an unlookedfor arrival will ya look at who turns up i havent clapped eyes on ya in ages and here ya are hallo alan and how the devil do ya keep he hoorawed taking hands with his old compatriot from the bahamas between the wars and the adriatic mainwell all considered benjamin and how the devil are you it has been too bloody long lewrie beamed back youre lookin prosperous and fit as a hound the word youre looking for is substantial ha rodgers said slapping his girth even as a young upandcoming commander in at nassau new providence benjamin rodgers had been a stoutish fellow and even years of sea duty had not managed to lean his physique hed been as darkcomplexioned as a welshman with thick and curly ebon hair hair which now was salted at the temples beneath his cocked hat a sight for sore eyes no matter lewrie assured him lets go aft and get out of this bloody raw wind rodgers insisted what say ya to a glass or three of hot punch i say lead on soonest lewrie laughed once out of boatcloaks hats swords and mittens and warming their hands and backsides near a franklinpattern iron stove rodgers let out a slow whistle knight of the bath he said jutting his chin at lewries sash and star i may have to bang my head on the deck in kowtow when did that happen last spring lewrie said with a grimace sposed tbe for a squadrontosquadron fight off the coast of louisiana but its my belief that it was for caroline some cynical bastards used her murder tstir up war fever this is the reward i dont like wearin it then why do you rodgers asked cocking his head over a ladys insistence lewrie told him heading for a leathercovered chair by the settee grouping life does go on rodgers said joining him punch dugan he called to his cabin servant truly im sorry i couldnt come to anglesgreen and attend her funeral but i was too far off when i got word of it god i can picture the two of you to the life newlyweds at nassau what a grand house she made of that gatehouse cottage off east bay she was a grand girl and damn the french for killing her your letter was most comforting all the same lewrie replied did you ever marry aye i finally did rodgers boasted pointing to an oil portrait that was hung above the sideboard in his greatcabins dining coach lewrie turned to peer at it discovering an image of a pertfaced and blueeyed woman with masses of dark brown hair susannah and i met in reading just after i paid off my last ship after the peace of amiens and hit it right off imagine a scaly fish like me well into my fourties turned calfeyed cully over a lady of twentyseven but its been grand we even have a boy hes two now ive even had to relearn dancing can you feature it haw im glad for ye benjamin lewrie was quick to say though its hard tbe a father in our trade or a husband either miss her and little ben something sinful rodgers confessed in a soft voice ah the punch scalding hot i trust or ill have ya at the gratings dugan scaldin ot sir his servant said with an easy grin and i doubt ya got yourself rowed out this far in the bloody blizzard just tsee me rodgers laughed its your son too id wager right in one lewrie agreed is he aboard sent him off with the purser and a workingparty about three hours ago so he should be back soon rodgers said blowing on his tall china tankard cupping its warmth against his hands hows he doing lewrie asked doing much the same as rodgers with his own tankard shapin well is he oh hes settled in satisfactorily rodgers told him once he found his sealegs about in the middle of the pack some older some younger than he is a dabhand at mathematics sun sights celestial navigation he can reef hand and steer as well as any bags sharper than me mostlike lewrie japed thinking that his old friends assessment of his sons nautical prowess and progress was grudging at best as he had feared sewallis might not be suited to the roughandtumble of the royal navy best way to describe himd be earnest rodgers went on between tentative sips of hot punch earnest and diligent attentive to duty as smart as paint all told has a mind like a snare trap and learns quickly once hes learned something hell not forget it either a bit sobersided he always was lewrie said reticent sometimes shy well if my mids pulled a prank hed be the last id suspect of it rodgers hooted the one that schemed it more like he aint a skylarker like most of the lads his age he strikes me as a lad closer to one ready to stand for his oral exams a passed midshipman bless me he aint idle nor possessed of your sense of humour but hes the dependable sort give him charge of something and it gets done and the ships people respect him and obey him chearly that goes a long way in my book and damn the likable ones sounds like hes prosperin then lewrie concluded the ladll mostlike never tell a good joke but prospering rodgers said with a chuckle aye right nicely id say im glad thear it lewrie said smiling at last and from a man i trust ttell it straight too a lady made ya wear your baubles rodgers prompted itd be about time ya dipped back into life after ya know met her at saint jamess palace the day it happened lewrie told him rather complicated really and he made a grand tale of meeting eudoxia durschenko and her oneeyed father off daniel wigmores circus ship how viscount lord percy stangbourne had met her in london and had decided to woo her how eudoxia had spoken so highly of how hed saved their bacon on a return convoy from cape town and how lord percy had dashed up to meet the fellow whod saved his intended dragging his sister along to greet the new knight and baronet shit on a bisquit rodgers exclaimed youre a baronet too king george was havin a bad day lewrie explained there were a couple o baronets made before me hed picked up someone elses glasses or it stuck in his head and out it popped i thought it would be corrected but the senior palace flunkies said that the crown dont make mistakes so there swear to christ alan but you could fall into a lake of shit and come up with a chest full o guineas rodgers whooped so the lady lydia insists ya wear your honours all the way from london ehm she coached down to portsmouth a few days ago lewrie confessed we were dinin at the george when i saw your lieutenant stiles and his wife and a sailor with them with the ships name on his hat and here i am going to wed again rodgers asked looking happily expectant hed found wedded bliss after all his years as a bachelor andlike all who had and as a good friend to bootwas eager to rope others in like a slum missionary lewrie cynically thought hes found salvation and wont let ye go til yeve enlisted too early days lewrie hedged busying himself with his tankard lydia ah was married once before so she may be shy of touchin a hot skillet a second time ah a widow is she any children rodgers asked divorced lewrie had to admit uhm ah rodgers replied his face becoming a puzzle no children lewrie offered with a hopeful note well ha rodgers flummoxed shifting in his chair so hard it squeaked most alarmingly clearly torn between joy for an old comrade and his sense of the conventions if lewrie had announced that lydia was a hindoo nautch dancer hed picked up in bombay a swarthy hottentot maiden from the kalahari or a poxraddled whore hed tripped over in a portsmouth alley benjamin rodgers could not have been more stunned should i have called her an actress or a circus trickrider lewrie asked himself theres a lotta that goin round these days you mightve read about it in the papers two or three years ago lewrie went on to fill the awkward silence her husband was an utter beast with the morals of a drunk monkey but he could wear a good face in publick and fooled everyone shes well shot o him oh i dont keep up with all the scandalmongering newspapers rodgers scoffed gossip rumours and slurs dont signify to me unfortunately lydia suffered at their hands even though her suit was righteous lewrie further admitted hes ruined for all time and shes free and didnt deserve a jot of it more innocent than me bout that trial o mine for stealin slaves oh that black alan thing rodgers snickered the worst was saint alan the liberator lewrie said with a long sigh even though wilberforce hannah more and their abolitionist crowd are done with me ill mostlike never live that down ehm i told lydia i owe you a hearty shore supper with magnums of champagne if youd care to meet her damme if i havent earned one after four months off brest rodgers exclaimed and im down tmy last four bottles o bubbly to boot good god stick with frigates alan long as ya can once ya get a ship of the line youll die o boredom if the shoals and rocks and the bay of biscay dont get ya first youre offering and im accepting gladly and id be happy to meet your lady i probably owe ye more than one just t make up for old times and a toolong absence lewrie told him glad that benjamin seemed open to meeting lydia and waiting to form a firsthand opinion the marine sentry outside the door to the quarterdeck rapped his musket on the oakplanked deck midshipman lewrie sah the sentry added with a stamp of his boots aha captain benjamin rodgers said rising from his chair about time too enter he called out the door opened admitting a gust of icy wind and a swirl of snow mr midshipman sewallis lewrie stepped in hat under his arm and his boatcloak dripping moisture captain sir i beg to report look whos come calling mister lewrie rodgers boomed out hallo son lewrie said rising from his chair ha hallo father sewallis managed to say his eyes as blared in surprise as a firstsaddled colt chapter four sewallis was certainly surprised but so was his father at their last supper at the george inn in the spring of as lewrie had been fitting out reliant sewallis had just turned sixteen and had been dressed in his usual dark and sombre style welltailored and neat with his hair brushed and combed in close order and his complexion had been the sort sported by those who lived mostly indoors in libraries and schoolrooms now he looked he looks like the poorest mid ever born lewrie told himself his errant eldest sons uniform looked as if it had been plucked from a discard pile or off the used rack and had not been made from the best broadcloth to begin with his white waistcoat and breeches were streaked with tar and slush stains hed done some growing too for his wrists showed below his coat cuffs and the kneebuttons of his breeches were undone so his longer legs could bend without popping them off plain white cotton stockings clunky and cracked shoes with dull pewter buckles a linen shirt that was going pale tan boy always was tight with his money lewrie thought for an awkward moment groping for a way to begin well lad how dye keep lewrie said at last stepping up to shake his sons free hand mainwell father sir sewallis replied with only a faint smile on his face as if unsure that one was allowed its good tsee ye alive and well im bound lewrie went on he went so far as to embrace him in a brief hug and clap him on the back christ though idve thought captain rodgersd feed ye more victuals buyin millers from the breadroom are you tmake ends meet the captain feeds us quite well sewallis replied grinning ive tasted breadroom rat but im not partial id just promised your captain a grand shore supper and i intended tsport you to one too but you look in more need of one first lewrie declared and a spell at a good tailors to boot he added stepping back to give his son a headtotoe examination the wearandtear o blockade dutys not done your kit any good i i did not imagine that continual seaduty would require grand rig sir father sewallis flummoxed weve seen no need of silk shirts and such no port calls didnt know he could dissemble or dance round the truth quite so well either lewrie thought he cant claim that i kitted him out so poorly or that he did it on his own told ye that ye needed better lewrie lied to help him out the lad looks like deathsheadonamopstick hey sir he asked as he turned to grin at rodgers ehm i wonder if there was somewhere we could ah well benjamin rodgers said considering the matter his greatcabins were his not to be usurped even by an old friend no matter well go on deck lewrie offered i wont keep him from his duties long youll dine aboard with me alan rodgers asked my own cookd be heartbroken if i let his efforts spoil lewrie said declining and youre short of champagne let me dine you out tomorrow afternoon then ill be glad to accept your invitation once your stores are replenished hey he added with a wink most suitable rodgers agreed shall we go get snowed on lewrie bade sewallis the most exposed place to the raw weather was atop rodgerss greatcabins on the poop deck aft of the mizen mast trunk it would also be the last place aeneas s crew would be found at that hour what in the world got into your head lad lewrie demanded damme dont ye know the penalty for uttering a forgery they hang people for it had ye been discovered youd have sunk your brothers repute in the navy along with yours lied to your captain lied to admiralty a legal document your so youve come to snatch me back is that it father sewallis interrupted looking pinchfaced and miserable lewrie glared at him locking eyes with his son for a long bit sewallis must have gained some gumption in the fleet for the longer his father frowned the firmer and more determined the sons face became no lewrie relented after another long moment its much too late for that if i dragged you ashore by your ears it would all come out and youd be in the quag up to your neck you could pass it off as a lark back at your school but i doubt the authorities would think so least said soonest mended or as your granther says youve made your bed and now must lie in it sewallis did not say his thanks aloud but his countenance brightened and he nodded his head as he took in and released a long breath why the devil did you do it lewrie asked the one letter ye wrote me never explained for mother sewallis baldly stated i told you why i wished to serve at that last supper we all had the night before you sent hugh aboard his ship the navy the army in a line regiment or the yeomanry militia for a bit i even considered finding a recruiting sergeants party and going as a volunteer or signing aboard for the first ship that would have me oh for gods sake lewrie blurted as a bloody soldier or a landsman lubber were ye completely daft even my father wasnt that cruel tme i went to sea as a midshipman lewrie recalled his pressing into the fleet in so his grandmother lewries expected inheritance could be used to pay off sir hugos creditors with him thousands of miles away and unknowing i told you all i wished to avenge mothers murder i wanted to fight the french and make them pay sewallis said with some heat and have you so far lewrie skeptically asked well not so far sewallis admitted with a shrug and a shy grin the cowards sit at anchor in brest and wont come out to face us do they assemble in the outer road we stand in within sight and they slink back to the inner letting a good slant of wind go to waste then the westerly gales come and we have to stand off windward he talks like a sailor at least lewrie considered are you disappointed by life in the orlop cockpit he asked his eldest as they paced from the taffrail lanthorns to the railings and ladders that led down to the quarterdeck and back its much like school really sewallis told him opening up now that he was sure that he would not be exposed as a forger and sent ashore as a fraud he even sounded chirpy and amused i was john newcome but ive been that before ive learned to shrug off all the japes or find ways to get my own back dye see sir i paid heed to the cautions you told hugh to ready him for sea so he heaved off a shrug and another brief smile like any dormitory there will be dullards clever ones spiteful ones bullies and victims i get by that dont sound rosy lewrie thought frowning to imagine that sewallis was too mildmannered and reticent to stand up for himself any real problems anyone who gives ye special grief we have made our accommodations sewallis cryptically replied returning to his usually grave self call it a truce if you will sir theres only the onei name no namesbut he is beastly to one and all to the ships people as well and the captain has his eyes upon him hes failed two postcaptains boards already so he may not be long in the navy sewallis said with a wink that or the oldest mid going lewrie replied with a laugh ive met a man fourty or more years old and still a midshipman stood your ground faced him down did ye lewrie asked something like that aye sir his son said rather proudly damn my eyes sewallis lewrie said with a sigh coming to a stop in the backandforth stroll when my father wrote and told me youd run away to sea i didnt think youd be up to it you always struck me more suited to the law or something suitable for the eldest son and the heir to whatever i leave i didnt want this for you a second son like your brother hugh aye but thats what hes always wanted i thought youd be happier ashore in your books or i know sir sewallis glumly agreed ive known for a long time that im not as rambunctious as hugh not as suited to be like you that you never quite knew what to do with me when you were back from the sea and damme dye think i loved ye less than your brother lewrie exclaimed aghast that sewallis felt that way aghast too to confess that sometimes yes he had hugh had been so much all boy that he had been so much easier to understand and to relate to sewallis said nothing to that he just stood erect shivering in the cold snow and frowning hell if i did hell if i do son lewrie declared flinging his arms round his eldest and pulling him close i love both of you and im proud of both of you i cant say that i understand you now and again or approve of evrything you do he stepped back still gripping sewallis by his upper arms no father wants thear his childrenve gone and done something daft sewallis knowin how hard life at sea is dye think i wished both my boys tbe at risk dye think i dont worry and fret over all that could harm either of you when you see your first horse to the gallop you went off to your first school thank you father sewallis said at last looking happy and relieved thank you for that i can stay aboard benjamin rodgers thinks youre shapin well and i trust his judgement so aye youre on your own bottom and when he gives ye leave tcome ashore with me for a day youll come back aboard much better dressed we cant let ye continue on so ragtagandbobtail i must admit i look forward to a larger coat sewallis said with an outright laugh let you stuff yourself at the george inn again and fill up your seachest with goodies too lewrie promised have scones and tea or a huge breakfast before with me and uhm with mistress stangbourne with whom sir sewallis asked checking his pace lady i met in london last spring at the palace when i was presented to the king and got knighted lewrie said though he winced to have blabbed her existence sister of viscount percy stangbourne and quite nice id saved lord percys intended aboard one of the ships in that convoy in the south atlantic years ago when i had proteus and we took the luranie frigate didnt know either of em from adam but up they popped at the levee and damme how much o that can ye tell without mentionin that eudoxia durschenko the circus and how she made cowseyes at me lewrie thought that part of his life was terra incognita to his children so far they might even still believe that he had been a faithful husband to their late mother they reside here in portsmouth sewallis queried uh no their country seats near reading and henley lewrie tried to breeze off but they have a grand house in grosvenor street youd like percy he raised a cavalry regiment all on his own and got it taken onto army list last summer and posted to the kent coast damned fine horseman it goes without sayin her too huntin and steeplechasin god only knows how many acres they own or where stop babblin he silently chid himself you are seeing her sir sewallis asked looking stricken weve become friends lewrie cautiously allowed oh i see sewallis replied it has been three years now since mother even so id not wish thide her under a bushel basket but if you dont care to we wont well ehm id sewallis said groping to express his true feelings after another deep pent breath he very gravely added this comes as most surprising sir had you written about her the ladys existence first to prepare the ground as it were its still early days and til lately there wasnt much to write about lewrie lied a bit rankled that one of his sons would even think to dictate his personal life or enforce the lack of one perhaps a brief hour over tea after weve had you at a tailor shop of course cant have the heir of a knight and baronet showin up in rags now can we no sir i suppose not sewallis answered if you wish then i would be pleased to meet your mistress stangbourne no you bloody arent lewrie scoffed to himself fine then he said instead damme but theres a tale to amuse ye the how of gettin a title tboot i look forward to hearing it sir sewallis replied seemingly in better takings damme but its cold up here do i keep you any longer after all your boatwork in this foul weather youll catch your death and i should be going back aboard reliant anyway thaw yourself out in the fug of your midshipmens cockpit your fellow midsll have a bowl of hot punch surely i expect so sir father sewallis said grinning at last and in port at least captain rodgers allows us the use of a franklin stove for a few hours each day oh dont get me started on bloody franklin stoves lewrie cried theres another long sad tale that ended up costin me dear well then til i make arrangements with captain rodgers for a shore liberty for ye ill take my leave til then father sir sewallis said doffing his hat in a formal salute with a slight bow from the waist lewrie doffed his own cocked hat to his son as well a grave exchange from one naval officer to another even if lewrie still thought his son had made a bad decision one that he might come to regret chapter five the hour over tea with sewallis lewrie and lydia had become a late second breakfast that had lasted a bit longer than two hours not that it could be described as a resounding success for sewallis had had his grave face on like a wary investor offered a failsafe stock hed been polite and had seemed to thaw when lydia had shown interest in his seafaring life so far but the wheels had come off when lydia had ventured into talk of her brother and his engagement to a circus person eudoxia durschenko you saw her sewallis when we all attended daniel wigmores circus lewrie had breezily reminded him met her facetoface when they paraded through portsmouth too eudoxia rode her white stallion right up to us remember oh that was she sir sewallis had said rather racily and scantily clad hed been purselipped and disapproving of that she is fearless ive come to learn lydia had chimed in and a crack shot when percy brought her up to the country in the fall we all went birding and she outshot me every time quite sweet too you hunt maam sewallis had all but gasped though hed kept his tone level hed disapproved of women with guns too their long teatime had gotten chillier and stiffer from there on and it was with a shared sense of relief that lewrie had seen his son to the docks and back to his ship dear lord alan but i think youve reared a parson lydia had chuckled when hed returned a methodist dissenter at that so far i gather that hes a down on percys gambling eudoxia bawdy women and my having guns such a stiff young man supper with benjamin rodgers went much better at least he had kept an open mind and when lydia who had been studying and reading every book she could find on seamanship ships and their handling since being dined aboard reliant at sheerness the previous spring could converse somewhat knowledgeably with two senior naval officers rodgers had become the soul of geniality and jollity hed listened with glee to tales of percys amazing luck at gambling and the doings of the rich and titled hed almost sounded as if he did devour the tattler columns in the papers despite what hed said about them reading and henley rodgers had exclaimed why thats in my bailiwick my fathers an attorney in reading and i grew up there punting on the thames is what led me to the navy good lord yes now i recall your father too big tall rangy fellow your pardons mistress stangbourne but we children used to dread the viscount for how fearsomefeatured he was not the handsomest man in england he was alan splendid rider though and a grand sportsman we used to ride by stangbourne park quite often though on the way to a day of shooting at my uncles an estate he called the hermitage gabriel rodgers of course lydia had gushed quite animatedly i knew him well when i was a girl they were neighbourly knew the same people no matter their class and lydia had met rodgerss new wife too all in all theyd gotten on like a house afire quite like her alan rodgers had said on the long cold walk back to the boat landing and if the war ever ends id be delighted to have a chance to shoot over their fields matter of fact its good odds the house susannah and i bought in reading got run up with stangbourne money and labour the old viscount dabbled in rents and real estate in a huge way lewrie had been delighted that benjamin had sounded approving too if sewallis didnt and the seachange in lydias manner with rodgers had been a fine thing to see he knew how guarded and leery lydia was about how people took her and to have seen her at ease and open how chirpy and quick to laugh had been a marvel unless benjamin had put on a complete sham of course lewrie didnt think him capable of such duplicity but oh surely not lewrie had never detected a speck of guile in bluff hearty benjamin rodgers that next morning had dawned cold but clear the thermometer in the greatcabins stood at fourty degrees by the end of breakfast and the liquid barometers pale blue fluid had sunk down the long tube neck to indicate a coming highpressure spell one more cup of creamed and sugared coffee and lewrie would make an inspection of the ship in sloptrousers and his oldest coat then change to go ashore for another delightful dinner and a long afternoon with lydia in her lodgings at the george but midshipman warburton sah the marine sentry loudly cried enter lewrie bade pardon captain but there is a boat approaching warburton reported and there appears to be an official fellow aboard her admiralty pouch lewrie asked peering at the mid who had sprouted much like his son had in the two years hed been aboard the frigate warburton had been a cheeky sixteenyearold when fitting out in and was now a slyly cheeky eighteen i could not see one sir warburton replied but the fingers of his right hand were held up crossed for luck very well mister warburton show the visitor aft when hes come aboard lewrie ordered sailin orders at long last lewrie mused while he waited for the caller to show his face but orders for where midjanuary was a miserable time to be ordered to sea and if it was their fate to join the blockade of the french or spanish coasts and harbours even the mostsutherly latitudes would make little difference gales and storms off cadiz or ferrol would be as fierce as those found off brest lewrie found that hed involuntarily crossed his own fingers for luck of a different kind of hope than warburtons he fought the urge to gulp down his coffee and rush to the deck with impatient curiosity but there were times to act like a captain in the royal navy he forced himself to sit and sip slowly admiralty messenger sah his marine sentry cried enter lewrie answered striving for a bored drawl and wont that perk up the ships peoples ears he thought captain lewrie sir the newcomer a youngish and illfeatured fellow in dark blue ditto suitings began daniel gower from admiralty with orders for you and the reliant frigate thank you mister gower lewrie said rising to accept them in a sealed envelope are they eyes only or to be opened upon attaining a particular latitude lewrie japed rolling his eyes why no sir quite straightforward i assume the man said with one brow up in puzzlement hmph was lewries comment weve had our share of cloak and dagger he explained thank you mister gower may i offer you anything coffee or tea no thank you sir but ive others to see the clerk said tapping the large leather pouch slung at his side very well sir good day captain lewrie spose i can rip it open right here and now lewrie thought and did so he sat back down at his dining table to read them over just as soon as that gower fellow had left his cabins good god lewrie muttered privateers no profit in that making the best of your way you are to take hms reliant sailing under independent orders to the bahamas and bermuda there to conduct operations against spanish and french privateers engaged in predations upon convoys bound from the west indies to home waters specifically directing your efforts upon the eastern coasts of spanish florida where said privateers are believed to base themselves since the declaration of a state of war by the kingdom of spain on december th of last year upon arrival at bermuda and the bahamas you are further authorised to take under your command any and all naval vessels below the rates which you deem suitable for such operations and for this purpose you are granted the right to display the inferior broad pendant for the duration of the expedition pick and choose lead me own little squadron whew lewrie muttered louder this time and wondering what sort of minor warships could be had at bermuda or in the bahamas he would not be promoted to commodore nor would he be assigned a flagcaptain to run reliant for him whilst he mused schemed and plotted the ruin of frogs and dons his red broad pendant would bear the large white ball in the centre which would mark his frigate as a squadron flagship but to cover the spanish port of st augustine along with the many smaller settlements from the st marys river the northern boundary of spanish florida to the great tamiami bay and the keys to the south lewrie rather doubted that the little vessels of his putative squadron would ever be sailing in formal trail formation behind him and that flying broad pendant would be more a sop to his ego did he bother to look up and gawk in the course of your operations you will not consider yourself strictly limited to spanish florida you will also make a diligent effort to ascertain whether privateers of those nations now at war with great britain exploit the neutrality of the united states of america and whether the authorities of the several states and the authorities of the ports of savannah beaufort and port royal charleston and georgetown wilmington and the cape fear river and the ports of new bern and beaufort round cape lookout shelter privateers or may succour and support them in violation of neutrality laws christ i dont need a squadron i need a fleet he gawped there was also some blather about calling upon the consular officials who represented great britain to get their informations to use their good offices to make the acquaintance of local american officials responsible for the enforcement of strict neutrality regarding the visits of belligerents the frequency of said visits and how long they could remain at anchor before being shooed out to sea in this regard you will do your very best to diplomatically impress upon said american officials the importance of a strict observance of neutrality laws between two nations now in amity now i know theyve lost their wits in london lewrie said with a long sigh and a wee yap of disbelief diplomatic me do they even know the first thing about me bull in a bloody china shop finally there was a paragraph or two about taking soundings and updating the charts of the approaches to bermuda and marking the entrance channels to st georges harbour castle harbour the navigable limits of the great sound and grassy bay and the approaches to the settlement of hamilton so long as he had nothing else going to aid him in his diplomatic endeavours and to snag himself a few small warships enclosed was a thick packet of letters of introduction to the various british consuls and orders directed to whom it may concern and if he did discover gross violations of american neutrality included was the name and address of his britannic majestys ambassador in washington the district of columbia who upon receiving an information from lewrie would make the strongest remonstrances to the united states government on his majestys behalf at least hercules got ttake on his twelve labours one at a bloody time lewrie fumed sagging lower in his dining chair one bell was struck by a ships boy up forward at the belfry half past eight in the forenoon watch and the time that lewrie had appointed for his officers and senior mates to muster in the waist for his inspection he rose and placed the thick packet of orders in his daycabin desk then shrugged into a wellworn grogram overcoat to go out on deck good morning gentlemen he said to one and all good morning sir was returned in a rough chorus punctuated by yawns from some who had been up since the am change of watch which roused all hands to lash up and stow swab and sweep decks and partake in breakfast reliant s three lieutenants geoffrey westcott clarence spendlove and george merriman looked blearier than most officers stood no watches when anchored in port and theyd mostlike returned aboard the evening before just in time for their supper then shared a bowl of hot punch liberally laced with spirits before a late retiring sitting up in the dark after lights out at pm to fathom the bowls depths damn my eyes no ones curious lewrie teased well sir lt merriman said sharing a glace with the rest and making a speculative grin were bound for warmer weather lewrie told them if we survive the winter voyage to get there that is its the bahamas for us bermuda and the coast of spanish florida bermuda the sailing master mr caldwell said brr its in the midatlantic lt spendlove pointed out it cannot be a cold place can it ah but bermuda is surrounded by miles and miles of banks and shoals coral reefs and submerged rocks sir harold caldwell contradicted with a gloomy look theres been ships wrecked twenty miles or more from there in what they took for deep open water captain sir ill be needing the use of a boat to go ashore to obtain charts for i have none but the sketchiest and oldest at present in point of fact ive never been to bermuda but ive heard tales brr i say for good reason who at admiralty hates me that damned bad lewrie asked himself neither have i mister caldwell lewrie admitted when you do seek the latest charts pray obtain a set for me part of our new orders directs us to survey and make soundings while were there do we have time to spare for it they mention the principal harbours and a bay or two not the distant approaches but he ended with a shrug my mates nightingale and eldridge could stay aboard for your inspection sir caldwell said whilst i could go ashore now very well mister caldwell mister warburton lewrie called out to the senior mid on the quarterdeck above them a boat for the sailing master aye sir well shall we begin sirs lewrie posed to them and as we look things over lets make lists of anything needful before sailing start at the bows shall we aye sir the bosun mr sprague agreed with a firm nod i think youll find the ship in top form and wellstocked for sea so far as my department goes but not your private rum cache hey mister sprague lieutenant westcott the first officer japed dont know what youre talkin about mister westcott sir sprague replied with a twinkle in his eyes when evrybody knows its mister cooke what hides rum in his galley then well look over the galley damned close lewrie quipped and the nooks and crannies in the carpenters walks that made the bosun swallow hard and look a tad guilty chapter six the other side of the ocean lydia sadly mused once lewrie told her of his orders oh god we both knew it was bound tcome lewrie said taking her by the hands as they sat together on a settee in her lodgings id hoped she said looking down for a moment foolish me i did know youd have to sail away sooner or later but i hoped she shrugged and seemed to be biting the lining of her cheek for a second as she looked back up id hoped that youd be assigned to the blockade like your friend captain rodgers somewhere closer and come back every few months to what do you call it revictual i should have known better she sighed slumping i dont like it any more than you do believe me lewrie said putting an arm round her shoulders youve quite spoiled me have i lydia skeptically asked bracing back from him utterly and completely lewrie assured her i should have known better myself just as soon as i begin tfeel pleased old dame fortune will kick me up the arse she always has lydia relaxed her arms and sank into his comforting embrace you may not be the only one that dame fortune picks on alan here i finally meet a man whom i think i can trust and the navy will send him halfway round the world for years on end she mourned i will feel so alone again with you gone ive grown hellish fond of you too lewrie whispered in her sweetsmelling hair but twish me on the blockade after all that benjamin rodgers told us of it well it will be warmer where youre going she asked much warmer even in january lewrie told her the bahamas and bermuda i expect are vivid green and surrounded by bluegreen seas in the old days we sailed little alacrity over waters so ginclear or the palest blue and could see the bottom and fish swimming ten fathoms down as clear as day it sounds like the fabled land of the lotus eaters lydia commented chuckling isles of the deaddrunk rumpots more like lewrie japed even so they sound heavenly lydia said then looked up at him sharply take me with you what lewrie gawped ive learned enough of the navy and ships to know that some captains take their wives with them even in wartime lydia animatedly said god knows i brought half a years worth of gowns and such when i came down to portsmouth i could be packed and aboard by the end of the day lydia i cant lewrie told her though wishing he could did not your wife sail with you to the bahamas when you were first there she pointed out cocking her head to one side to be settled in a house ashore in peacetime lewrie said well be up against french and spanish privateers might even cross hawses with some of their frigates and i cant put you at such risk besides theres if i accept the risks then why not she pressed theres the matter of reliant s people lydia lewrie continued in a sombre but soothing tone they cant take their wives and sweethearts with them and for them to see their captain enjoying the privilege they cant rubbing it in their faces everytime you took the air on the quarterdeck the navy wont even give them shore liberty unless its a damned small island and theres an army garrison thelp round em up do they run take legbail the best we can do for em is to put the ship out of discipline for a few days in port and let the women of the town come aboard some of em might even really be wives but thats a rare ease you wouldnt wish to see it when you toured reliant last summer she was in full discipline whores do you mean lydia said with a scoffing smirk aye whores lewrie admitted and finally there are some captains whod take their wives to sea even in wartime but theyre wives not lovers admiralty has a down on that hmmm was lydias comment to that she put one brow up in quizzical thought eying him over quite carefully what lewrie asked wondering if she was contemplating what are you thinking well in the first instance i was wondering what poor percy would say did i dash off with you married or not lydia confessed a grin spreading secondly i was wondering if i were brazen enough to propose to you and lastly i asked myself what i might say did you propose to me oh shit here we go again lewrie told himself hoping that his phyz didnt mirror the stricken feeling inside him hed been in creampot love with his late wife caroline and had admitted theres a girl worth marrying someday perhaps maybe before circumstances anent her future had dragooned him into proposing to give her an out from the beastly attentions of her neighbour harry embleton or her only other options marry a much older tenant farmer or take a position as governess to someones children far from family and did you come to some conclusions lewrie whimsically asked wishing he could cross his fingers god the look on your face alan lydia said laughing out loud have i frightened you into next week astonished not frightened really lewrie breezed off you have a knack for that he added with a teasing smile as for percy and society i dont give a toss lydia said with a cynical jerk of her head im already scandalous so what else would they expect and no as fond as ive become of you i am not that unconventional at bottom the man must do the asking lastly hmm lewrie prompted fond as i am i would refuse lydia told him turning sombre mean tsay lewrie flummoxed not that he would be asking but it irked that she would have spurned him if he had after all ive been through alan my dear ive too many fears to be settled before i place myself and my heart at the mercy of any man again without knowing him so completely that i could overcome my trepidations i told you once remember she slowly explained at the cocoa tree wasnt it lewrie replied tea and scones in a quiet corner while percy was in the long rooms gambling you told me youd never willingly reenter such a slavish institution as marriage and what did i tell you to suit myself and enjoy my life lydia replied grinning pleased that he could recall do you enjoy your life lewrie asked her softly i began to that very night she answered and til now i must own that i have immensely but i would not marry you even for a sea voyage to the splendours of cathay not yet call it early days lewrie fondly teased early days lydia whispered back beaming at him though he discerned the rising moisture in her eyes before her tears came he scooped her to him and kissed her long and gently i will pack and coach back to london tomorrow she told him her face pressed to his giltlaced coat collar you will have many things to attend to and i would be in the way at the best quite ignored so ill settle your lodgings lewrie offered you will not she chuckled for a moment you as you said are comfortable but i am rich consider it my gift to you your being heres been the real gift lewrie assured her that night at the cocoa tree later that night lydia teased recall where we went your house in grosvenor street lewrie supplied promptly and what did i ask you there dear alan you said make love to me lewrie quite gladly recalled leaning back to look her in the eyes knowing that he was beaming like the hugest fool in the universe such a keen memory you have she praised him do please chapter seven whether hms reliant had received sailing orders or not all the business of provisioning and victualling for sea was continual spare spars and replacement sails huge bolts of cloth from which to fashion or repair the existing ones livestock for fresh meat issue in harbour and for the first week or so on passage captain alan lewrie was in sanguine takings that only a day or two more to take aboard lastminute items and he could take his frigate to sea just as soon as the winter winds swung round to a favourable quarter then currant jam of course sir his cook yeovill suggested as he went down a long list of necessities to be purchased for lewries comfort from a chandlery ive developed a taste for raspberry lewrie mused aloud with a grin those tarts and popovers o yours dried currants and raisins for duffs aye but midshipman houghton sah the marine sentry shouted with a crash of his musket butt and his boots on the deck planking beyond enter lewrie bade good morning sir midshipman houghton said right cheerily as he stood before lewries desk in the daycabin hat under his arm and all but rocking on the balls of his feet i fear i must depart the ship sir my lieutenancys come through good god lewrie gawped well congratulatons of course when lewrie had fitted reliant out for sea in may of when the war with imperial napoleonic france had broken out again midshipman houghton had been his senior and most experienced at twentyone and had already faced one board of harsh postcaptains grilling for promotion houghton was very competent in a stolidly quiet way but not the sharpest nail in the keg hed always struck lewrie as rather dull whilst reliant had been at sheerness the previous spring hed finally become a passed midshipman but no immediate commission the secret nature of their work with catamaran torpedoes that summer might have been the factor where are ye bound and how soon mister houghton im to be fifth officer aboard the victorious a third rate sir just in with a spanish prize sloop and her first was promoted to commander so theres an opening and well my uncles one of the civilians on the board of admiralty so id known that idve cultivated the fart a lot hotter lewrie told himself immediate is it well if you must lewrie said rising to shake houghtons hand and offer him a parting stirrup cup of brandy though pondering how hed fill houghtons experienced but dull shoes could he advance one of the masters mates eldridge and nightingale were in their midtolate twenties and were good at their trade but might he be able to cultivate a little interest from stuffy old admiral lord gardner port admiral of portsmouth or from admiral the honourable cornwallis head of channel fleet of which reliant was yet a part til sailing sorry to place you a fellow short sir but houghton said oh tosh lewrie quickly assured him thats the navys way never can be sure of anything one year to the next and when a man gets a shot at promotion hed be a fool tturn it down outta sentiment well send you off in my gig with my boat crew to make a good show for your new captain a brandy with you lieutenant houghton ehm thank you most kindly for the offer sir but id not wish to report myself aboard my new ship with spirits on my breath if you see my point sir houghton hedged coffee then twarm yer long row lewrie decided pettus a coffee for lieutnenant houghton and a topup for me he bade his cabin steward accepted most gladly sir houghton brightened and might i say that the last two years aboard reliant have not only been most instructive but delightfully exciting captain lewrie sir i shall consider serving under you one of the hoy ware came a shout from on deck followed by a loud series of thuds and bangs as if a large sack of potatoes had slipped from someones grasp and was tumbling down a steep ladderway oh ow gottverdamt came a painful howl and then a curse or two sheisse meine arm meine beins sheisse mister rahl lewrie said there were very few dutchies in reliant s company and the raspy voice of the master gunner mister johan rahl was easily recognised by one and all passing word for mister mainwaring a muffled shout demanded from the gundeck forward and below lets go lewrie urged dashing for the forward door master gunner johan rahl had fallen down the main companionway hatch and lay sprawled on his back grimacing and growling bearlike to keep from howling in pain and unmanning himself before his shipmates even as lewrie knelt beside him the ships surgeon richard mainwaring arrived with his kitbag closely followed by several loblolly boys from the forward sickbay with a carrying board what happened mister rahl mainwaring asked i

ordered stand back and give the surgeon room twork lads id take a tumble for a tot patrick furfy whispered to his mate liam desmond lewries coxn oh hesh yerself desmond hissed back is it bad sor lewrie shrugged his answer looking into mainwarings face as he glanced up from his work it seems youve broken your left arm mister rahl mainwaring said at long last it seems a clean break and its good odds that it will heal but your legs hmm the right one feels like a clean break as well but the left you cut it off sir rahl asked almost incredulous i vill not be der einlegged cook nein we must get

board you lads easy now dont jostle him too much der doctor heff to take meine leg captain lewrie do not make me a cook rahl insisted rasping gasping and spitting his words as the loblolly boys gently shifted the carrying board under him causing him sheer agony i swear i wont mister rahl lewrie told him shaking his hand for a moment served with ye before and i never saw a sign ye could even toast bread ja dose were gut times sir rahl replied sheisse you are trying to kill me you bastards slowly and gently there mainwaring snapped before his hands started the carrying board down the length of the gundeck between the messtables stools and seachests and the horde of curious onlookers desmond mister houghtonll need a boat so he can report aboard his new ship lewrie told his coxn best turnout and see him to the victorious in my gig arrah youre a commission officer now mister houghton liam desmond exclaimed he is lewrie assured him and the rest of the nearby people huzzah fer mister houghton a sailor cried raising a cheer from the rest when youre ready to debark mister houghton pray do inform me and well see you off proper lewrie promised thank you sir well i should go pack my traps houghton said can i have your secondbest silk shirt midshipman warburton one of reliant s cheekiest asked tongueincheek razzing him uhm pass word for the gunners mate there lewrie said i will be in my cabins acres youre now master gunner lewrie told that worthy when he reported to him thankee sir though tis not the way id o liked tget it the burly gunners mate replied fidgetting with the wide brim of his hat that he held before him poor old rahl th surgeon think its bad for im sir no word yet mister acres lewrie said shrugging his lack of information his left leg looked damned bad though old rahl well lord he was old rahl when we served together years ago an stiffz th guards at saint jamess palace sir acres said chuckling or one o those prussian grenadiers where he came from in the kaisers artillery does kemp look likely to take your place lewrie enquired the current yeoman of the powder was fairly young in his position up from a guncaptain of short service before reliant commissioned well sir id prefer thorn the senior quartergunner hes older and more experienced acres said shift kemp tbe a quartergunner and bring a good guncaptain on as powder yeoman your choice then lewrie allowed and well see how they work out congratulations mister acres thankee sir and ill see ye right when it comes to gunnery half an hour later and it was the sailing master mr caldwell who stood before lewries desk to settle who might be promoted into midshipman houghtons position are either of your masters mates promotable or should i send ashore to the port admiral mister caldwell lewrie began sit and have some coffee do sir thank you sir caldwell said in his usually cautious manner even giving the collapsible leathercovered chair a good lookingover before entrusting himself to it i expect either of them would leap at the chance to be made a midshipman but ah thank you pettus very good coffee i must say he said to the cabin steward after one taste nightingales a tarry tarpaulin man a bit rough about the edges but hes been in the navy eight years off and on and he can hand reef and steer and can lay a course as good as any ehm there is the problem that hes not what youd call gentlemanly he came out of the fisheries and that lifes coarser and rougher than where most mids come from you think he might not fit in lewrie asked frowning with houghton all but gone he had mr entwhistle now twenty the honourable mr entwhistle as the oldest and most experienced a lad to the manor born there was mr warburton now eighteen grainger who was now seventeen or so then munsell and rossyngton both about fifteen all like most mids were from the landed gentry the squirearchy he could not see any of them turning toplofty to a much older rougher john newcome but theres that sir caldwell said with a nod now eldridge hes younger and quicker and just as experienced as nightingale and i have noted that he might be a bit more aspiring though hes never mentioned becoming a midshipman eldridge comes from bristol son of a ship chandler so i expect he was raised better off than most before he volunteered back in bettermannered mr caldwell added with a shrug eldridges family could send him the funds hed need for new kit whilst nightingale might have to go deep in debt to cover the expense and whichd be more jealous of the other mister caldwell lewrie posed to the sailing master with one brow up it dont signify to me as to which is more polished and if it does in the mids cockpit then therell be some boys at the masthead but id not cause you and your department too much aggravation if promoting one and passing over the other wont serve then i might as well send for a younker from the port admiral and take whichever tomfool they have on the shelf some tenyearold ninnypate uhm perhaps itd be best did i ask them sir caldwell suggested shifting his bulk in the chair and crossing one leg over the other sound them out on their ambitions we dont have long mister caldwell lewrie pointed out a sudden shift of wind and well have to be off instanter crashbang from the marine sentry beyond the door first orfcer mister westcott sah stampbang enter lewrie shouted back good morning sir mister caldwell lt geoffrey westcott said once hed entered the greatcabins ive spoken to the surgeon sir about rahl and it dont look promising there had been but one brief flash of his teeth in greeting before westcotts darktanned and hatchet face went glummer mister mainwaring had to take off rahls left leg above the knee hes made it through the surgery and hes resting quietly but he needs to be gotten ashore to the naval hospital as soon as hes able to be moved christ that bad lewrie grimaced i saw how the bone was snapped and stickin through his skin but evidently sir his arm and right leg were clean breaks and didnt jut out but the left was not only broken but his knee joint was so badly wrenched that it couldnt be saved like a mangled turkey leg damn lewrie said with a long sigh drumming his fingers on his desk pardon my manners mister westcott take a pew and have a coffee twarm ye faulkes he called to his clerk and writer do up a discharge form for mister rahl and a petition for him to be sent to the pensioners home at greenwich hospital see the purser to get his pay and debts cleared would you of course sir poor old fellow james faulkes sadly agreed he pleaded that id not make him a cook lewrie mused now at the least hell have a good retirement in sight of deptford dockyard and traffic on the river with no kin that i ever heard tell of sir i suppose thatd be the best he could expect lt westcott agreed and the best we can do for the old fellow therell be dozens of old gunners to trade yarns with aye caldwell chimed in hell not be slung onto the beach to starve and beg on the streets and get his rum issue til eternity word has it were losing mister houghton sir lt westcott asked after pettus had gotten him his coffee with sugar and sweeter goats milk the way he liked it good for him aye we were just debating whod take his place nightingale or eldridge or should i request some admirals favourite idiot hah lewrie informed him with a sour bark of humour well theres your son over in aeneas sir westcott said your friend captain rodgers would surely oblige you uhmm perhaps not lewrie said making a gruesome face ive seen that before and i never cared for it no matter its so common in the fleet catercousins sons and nephews hell the cockerel frigate was the worst half the ships company was named braxton one could not dote sooner or later and make the rest of the mids grit their teeth sewallis is best off where he is among familiar faces and on his own bottom without me lookin over his shoulder id scare what little hes learned clear outta his head did i haul him aboard lewrie told himself fragile as i still think he is thatd be the ruin of him and hed not thank me and end up resentin it lewrie busied himself with creaming and sweetening a fresh cup of coffee to cover his dread that what really motivated him was fear that he would witness sewallis should he fail suggestions mister westcott lewrie asked nightingale eldridge or a sprat well sir id go with eldridge the first lieutenant said ive stood so many watches with both that one cant help but natter here and there nightingales ambition is to become sailing master someday hes told me mister eldridge joined as a landsman but hes shot up like a rocket ordinary then able quartermasters mate to quartermaster and now a masters mate and hes still young enough to hope for a sea officers commission nightingales married with a child and promoting him would mostlike sling him into debtors prison midshipmans pays not much improvement on what he earns now the cost of uniforms and suchd do him right in sir and hed not be the one tpick his nose at table or use the wrong fork lewrie joshed god they all do that sir westcott laughed out loud mids have the manners of so many pigs mister caldwell lewrie asked sound right to you aye sir the sailing master slowly intoned nodding solemnly ill advance quartermaster hook to eldridges place if i may good man he was aboard thermopylae with me lewrie said then move malin up as a quartermaster and ask about for one who wishes to strike for quartermasters mate sir caldwell agreed crashbang midshipman munsell sah slamcrash enter lewrie bade busy as a tavern door today aint it beg pardon sir but mister houghton is ready to depart and the surgeon sends his duty and a request for a boat to bear mister rahl ashore to hospital as well young munsell reported my hat and sword pettus lewrie asked lets give both of em a proper sendoff if you gentlemen will join me all hands was piped to summon the ships company on deck to see houghton off with three cheers raised a bit of a dullard that houghton was he was recognised by all as a competent officertobe and a firm but fair disciplinarian whod treated everyone the same the marines turned out with the sideparty to render honours the bosuns pipes blew and houghtons fellow mids and the officers shook hands with him and wished him well make us proud o bein a reliant lieutenant lewrie urged thank you for everything again sir and i shall houghton vowed before doffing his hat at the entryport and beginning to make a careful way down the boardingbattens to the waiting gig where the boat crew were turned out in sunday divisions best a few moments later though and it was a much sombrer sendoff for gunner johan rahl strapped to a carrying board and swaddled in blankets he came up from the forward companionway hatch rolling his head with his eyes halfglazed from doses of laudanum to smother his pain the ships people parted to let the loblolly boys through and many reached out to give him goodbye pats and reassurances though he was all but oblivious take care mate and bye ye old son of a gun and get well an back on yer pins soon were called out greenwich ospitalz goodz fiddlers green mister rahl ale an rum they flow like warter an niver a reckonin one hopeful older hand assured him music an fetchin girls visitin round th clock they say ye lucky ol devil it wasnt the entryport for rahl though bosun sprague had rigged a lift for the four handles of the carrying board the mainmast course yardarm was fitted for hoisting out with hands standing by at braces and clews to raise him up and outboard of the starboard gangway bulwarks then down into a waiting cutter rahls battered old seachest has hammock rolled up into a fat sausage with all of his bedding and spare clothing and a pale grey seabag sat amidships to be lowered down too meagre as it was that represented everything that rahl had amassed in decades of spartan navy life ive his discharge papers and pay chits sir mainwaring told lewrie who had come down from the gangway to shake rahls hand one last time ill see him ashore myself if thats alright perfectly fine mister mainwaring lewrie agreed will he make it through he asked the surgeon in a softer voice touch and go sir touch and go mainwaring said with a sigh hes old but hes a tough old bird assuming he gets good care and sepsis does not set in he stands a decent chance of surviving but at his age what life would be like well he wondered shrugging hoist away handsomely bosun sprague ordered and the course yard began to tip upwards bearing rahl aloft dont let your fellow pensioners talk you into cookin for em mister rahl lewrie shouted to the departing burden three cheers lads see your shipmate off with a cheer bosuns mate wheeler began a long call on his pipe the marine boydrummer rattled the long roll and a fiddler and fifer began a gay tune the bowld soldier boy the air that was played aboard reliant when the rum keg was fetched on deck that usually brought joy sway out easy bosun sprague directed and rahls slingload slowly swung outboard above the starboard gangway bulwarks aft a bit vast hauling as rahl hung above the open entryport just before sprague ordered the yardarm to dip the last that rahls shipmates saw of him was his right hand feebly raised above his blankets giving them all a goodbye wave and a thumbsup bit more a bit more midshipman entwhistle called standing in the open entryport looking down into the waiting cutter a foot of slack there we have him midshipman warburton in charge of the cutter reported carrying boards secure and the lines are free the cheers and the happy tune faded away as the surgeon left the ship to descend to the cutter and his patient with only the customary honours ships compny on hats and dismiss lt westcott ordered and the men fell silent drifting off in threes and fours or idling on deck despite the cold in eightman messes guncrews or masttender groups mostly looking very glum rather a lot of change of a sudden sir westcott muttered as he and lewrie mounted to the quarterdeck together perhaps too much for them in one morning promotion departure people discharged lewrie mused aloud happens all the time in the navy at least six of the people gettin promoted and more pay i should think therell be some celebrations by supper this evening might i suggest talking to them before supper sir westcott said leaning close and splice the mainbrace to give them cause to celebrate the people brood on it and they might take this morning as a bad omen right before the start of a winter sailing a bad omen mister westcott lewrie asked frowning heavily dye really think so they already know weve sailing orders sir westcott went on standing close with his hands in the small of his back and its sure to be a stormy passage thats gloommaking enough but now it aint like the ships ratsre leapin overboard lewrie said back with a disparaging laugh but then thought better of that they could take it as a bad omen he realised and damme if i aint feelin a bit fey myself now wheres a goodluck seal that i can whistle up hmmm you may be right mister westcott he told the first lieutenant aye we will splice the mainbrace at the second rum issue and see that the people get fresh roast meat and a figgydowdy for supper damned near a christmas feast ill speak to the cook and see to the arrangements so they can congratulate the newly promoted and see the upset as an opportunity aye sir westcott said baring his teeth in one of his nighsavage characteristic grins just so long as the officers dont mind making some minor contributions to said feast hey mister westcott lewrie japed cant be expected tfoot the bill all by myself hmm westcott looked close to a shiver whether it was the wintery wind that caused it or the loss of nearly a pound from his purse in pursuit of his aim touche sir touche hell mister westcott i barely grazed ye lewrie said with a satisfied smirk book i letter of marque a commission granted by the lords of the admiralty or by the viceadmiral on any distant province to the commander of a merchant ship or privateer to cruize against and make prize of the enemys ships and vessels either at sea or in their harbours falconersmarinedictionary e dition chapter eight the reliant frigate left portsmouth on the last monday in january after four days at anchor in the sutherlymost protection of st helens patch near the isle of wight waiting for a slant of wind and taking aboard the last necessities and luxuries for a long winter voyage an icy shift from the noreast came at last and she hoisted sail and raised her anchors severing her last slightest connexion to england and pounded out into the riotous chops of the channel the first day and night she could bowl along under reduced sail pushed by the forceful following winds her tophamper all her tgallants and royalsmasts sails yards and stayshad been brought down and stowed alongside the spare ones even before she left harbour in expectation of storm conditions that might prevail right across the entire atlantic the second day at sea the winds blew just as strongly shifting more easterly allowing a slanting course closer to the lizard and lands end than the french side of the channel and cape ushant letting them stand out further to the west with the winds fine on the starboard quarter with the frigate booming and thudding through the heaving churning waves by the third dawn though the fickle winds changed direction howling an arctic blast down upon them from the norwest pushing the seas slamming against reliant s starboard sides starting a sickening wallowing heave and roll that had even the saltiest hands gagging at the lee rails it was the roughest sort of beamsea and maintaining a beam reach required hands aloft to take reefs in the courses and topsls reduce the spanker and take in upper staysls completely the only good thing that could be said for that day was that reliant could still steer roughly west gaining even more of an offing from the dangerous lee shoal of the french bay of biscay coast lewrie could turn into his swaying bedcot that night a bit before midnight cautiously satisfied that they were making decent progress westrd when he rolled out at am on the fourth day though his hopes were dashed for the winds had veered ahead into west by north half north and lewrie had to lay his ship onto a closehauled beat to weather steering no closer to the wind than souwest by south heeled hard over onto her larboard shoulder with the bows rising and plunging and shipping great bursts and avalanches of cold white water over the forecastle to swirl and pool and slosh from bow to stern almost kneedeep before gurgling and gushing out the lee scrappers and every seam in the deck planking no matter how firmly packed with tarred oakum then paid over with more tar with iron loggerheads dripped chill misery onto the offwatch hands on the messdecks one would think that some damned fool was whistling mister caldwell the sailing master gruffly muttered as he peered at their pencilledin track in the chartspace in lewries cabins or someones snuck a woman aboard the westerly winds had churned up the sea nigh to a slow boil with vast greygreen rollers nearly as tall as the main course yard a sickly snotgreen sea that shed stinging blizzards of spray pellets from every wavecrest even foamy dollops that tumbled and flew from wave to wave like fleeing rabbits the smell of fresh fish was prominent the reek that came from stormwrack as if the sea below them was stirred right to the bottom bosun sprague didnt sneak his wife aboard did he lieutenant westcott asked striving for amusement though his lean harsh face and four days of stubble showed nought but grimness and a lack of real sleep especially so in the eerie swaying glare of the overhead lanthorn which cast long shadows over the chart i have it on good authority that the official mistress sprague resides in chatham and the bosun cant abide the harpy baggage caldwell told westcott with a nasty cackle so whoever that doxy was he had aboard as his wife in portsmouth she was young enough to be one of his daughters mistress spragues presented the bosun with nothing but girl children mister westcott lewrie stuck in half a dozen now or so i heard no wonder he stuck with the navy so long hmmm we are in need of a backin wind does the current one veer into due west well be on a good course for spain from the moment that their frigate had cleared the isle of wight into the channel while they still had clearly visible seamarks the chip log had been cast each halfhour and an officer of the watch had pencilled in the course and the rate of knots recorded the skies had been solidly overcast when they departed england and they hadnt seen even a brief glimpse of the sun since so their progress and position were prettymuch by guess and by god all by dead reckoning the recorded course was a staggering stuttering series of xs strung along a jagged line some close together some xs further off from each other where theyd had a good run and turn of speed not to borrow trouble sir westcott glumly said but does the wind veer close to a souwester we may have to wear even in this else we fetch up somewhere east of corunna and cape finisterre it could go souwesterly sir caldwell cautioned so long as this arctic gale rules another day or so with any luck were making ground westrd but does it blow out a souwesterlys not unknown in biscay if that happened reliant would have no choice but to wear a souwesterly would smack them right in the mouth and paying off would drive them even deeper into the sack between the long rightangled trap of the french and spanish coasts squarerigged ships could not sail closer than sixtysix degrees to the true wind were too far north at the moment to meet souwesterlies lewrie said after a long moment in which he used a ruler to measure from their latest cast of the log to the edge of the chart were still round the fourtyseventh latitude so weve bags of searoom but its longitude thats wanting now if their frigate smacked into yet another wave with a deep hollow boom and rolled back onto her larboard side then rose up shedding tons of seawater and wriggling a bit more upright with a sickening twist making them all cling to the flimsy chart table and shuffle their feet to keep upright i wont gag or spew lewrie commanded himself though he had a feeling that he was damned close to doing so he tried to recall when it was that he had been in such foul weather and in such a predicament and realised that it had been years im worried worried and scared he admitted to himself alone i wouldnt trust mine arse with a fart right now nor a gag either why didnt father shove me into the bloody army instead oh aye cause he was too cheap lewrie looked to his liquid barometer for inspiration but the bluedyed water in the fat lower flask was still rather high up the upper tube about as high as his last peek at it an hour before when he had made a chalkmark slash upon it the storms pressure was still low allowing the fluid to creep upwards no higher yet thank god about all we may do for now sir is ride this out and hope for the best mr caldwell concluded even with bare yards and storm trysls lt westcott added midshipman grainger sah the marine sentry outside the door to the greatcabins shouted his usual piercing cry almost swallowed by the din of wind rain and the working of the hull with luck he might have been allowed a tarred tarpaulin coat with which to tolerate the elements enter lewrie shouted back louder than usual too he and the others staggered out from the tiny chart space clinging to light dealandcanvas partitions grainger entered sopping wet and looking as miserable as a drowned rat mister merrimans duty sir and i am to report that several of the fore and mainmast shrouds are slackening grainger said well damn lewrie spat it seems we must wear after all there was no safe way to adjust the necessary tension of the mast shrouds unless the immense load was taken off them even on good days their weather shrouds must become lee shrouds if they wished to keep the masts standing aye sir lt westcott regretfully agreed my compliments to mister merriman mister grainger and hes to have all hands piped lewrie ordered with your able assistance of course mister westcott mister caldwell of course sir ill fetch your foulweather rig sir pettus his cabin steward offered staggering from one piece of furniture to the next and looking a tad green lewrie looked aft into the gloom of his cabins his cats toulon and chalky were curled up on his bedcots coverlet like two furry loaves of bread bristled up and moaning in misery to larboard his young cabin servant jessop was on his knees inside the quartergallery toilet with only his shoes and shins showing bent over the seat of ease and making offerings to neptune rather loudly carry on jessop lewrie called out ah aye sir the lad muttered back between gags once bundled into tarred canvas coat and hat lewrie staggered forward steeling himself for a second or two before opening the door to the weather deck when he did so it was like barging out into utter chaos the force and howl of the wind the sudden chill of it and the stinging volleys of sea spray that pinpricked his hands and face here too was the full sound of the storm and the hiss and thunder of the waves and the alarming groans of the hardpressed masts and the booming of the hull as the frigate fought the sea offwatch sailors were swarming up from the relative warmth and security of the gun deck where they berthed and messed adding to the sense of confusion as lewrie managed to clamber up to the quarterdeck sorry about this sir but we must wear lt merriman said his mouth close to lewries ear aye lewrie shouted back if you think the weather shrouds will hold til weve got her round on larboard tack i believe they will sir merriman hopefully replied at present their frigate laboured heavily even though the mizen topsl had been taken in as had the main course the fore course and fore and main topsls were closereefed and the jibs up forward had been replaced by the fore topmast staysl above the quarterdeck the spanker had been reduced and the mizen staysl had been rigged leave the topsls for now lewrie speculated theyre higher up than the wavetops and can still catch wind the fore coursell get us round the quicker send up the main topmast staysl again hmm oh god all these bloody years at sea and i still feel like a total fraud hed not wished to go to sea and be all tarryhanded but his father had seen to that crimping him into the navy at seventeen and years behind his peers in experiencefor gods sake he could not even swimand even the tenyearolds in his first mess had known bags more than he had and his bottom had paid the price for not knowing the ropes from expasperated officers and all his career he felt as if he had never quite caught up there had been a series of small ships where things were much simpler where little was expected of a lowly midshipman surely he had had no business at all becoming old lt lilycrops first officer in the shrike brig where his first few months had been an embarassing potmess of ignorance and relearning of his trade there had been a whole year of shore idleness between the end of the american revolution and his assignment aboard telesto and the jaunt to the far east and china in and when hed come back and gotten his first command the little alacrity in just enough time to forget almost everything by after paying alacrity off there had been years of bucolic peace ashore with wife and children on their rented farm at anglesgreen and once more all hed learned of the sea had sloughed away til and the war with france when hed reported aboard the cockerel frigate as her first lieutenant hed felt as overawed and unready as the rawest freshcaught landlubber unable to recall the proper names for things without long hours secretly poring over his frayed illustrated copy of falconers marine dictionary just as he had done when first aboard a warship in god help em all he thought lookin to me tkeep em safe all hands are on deck sir lt merriman reported very well mister merriman have bosun sprague pipe stations for wearing ship lewrie said after a deep breath and shrug into his foulweather rig lets be about it the men are getting cold if i may sir the sailing master mr caldwell intruded before lt merriman could raise his speakingtrumpet to his lips ive been studying the set of the waves and believe theyre coming in sevens with the seventh the most forceful once that one is past well have an easier go very well mister caldwell carry on mister merriman but do you wait to issue your first order til the seventh has passed as the sailing master directs lewrie said here it comes mister merriman caldwell warned stations to wear merriman bawled out the preparatory orders main clewgarnets and buntlines spanker brails weather main and mizen crojack braces haul taut and stand by reliant butted through a creaming humping wave at a slant with a thrum and groan surging upward toward its crest as the wave billowed under her keel hobbyhorsing upwards then pitching bowsdown into the trough with a roar this is the one sirs caldwell shouted excitedly as if he enjoyed heavyweather sailing his seventh wave marched down to the frigate humping higher like a steep hill its crest fuming white and its lee slope mottled with rippling circular eddies whoo up mainsl and spanker lt merriman screeched once the ship had staggered up over and down into that great waves trough clear away after bowlines up helm reliant fell off quickly shoved by wind and waves to lie abeam the sea for a bit slowly so very slowly falling alee and taking that howling force on her starboard quarter overhaul the weather lifts man the weather headbraces rise fore tack and sheet merriman cried further further off the wind til it was coming just about dead astern and clear away head bowlines merriman howled shift over the headsheets and lay the head yards square now the wind was clawing at their ships larboard quarter and she was coming round wallowing and rolling but on larboard tack man main tack and sheet clear away the rigging spanker outhaul clear away the brails haul aboard haul out mind yer helm there lewrie cautioned as she swung up closer to the wind and seas brace up head yards lt merriman ordered looking and sounding calmer than when he began the evolution now that reliant had crossed from one tack to the other overhaul weather lifts and haul aboard nicely done sir mr caldwell congratulated thankee sir merriman replied quite pleased and relieved then turned to deliver his last trimmingup orders steady out the bowlines haul taut weather trusses braces and lifts and here comes the bloody seventh wave again lewrie said just as the larger fiercer wall of water humped up before them the ship heaved up and over then down into the trough where she wallowed as the wave stole the wind from the topsls for a moment before bowling astern clear away on deck there lt merriman ordered mister westcott lewrie bade lets go forrud and see to the shrouds rhys hows her helm now he asked the quartermaster of the watch at the wheel can you hold westnorwest aye sir fair balanced she be not too crank nor griped very well lewrie said with a firm nod full and by and none to loord ready mister westcott aye sir westcott replied with a brief flash of teeth im as wet as ill ever be bosun sprague hands to the lee bulwarks the shrouds the main portion of the standing rigging ran from the outboard channel platforms down the sides of the ship the thick and stout oak anchors that jutted out to ease the steep angle of support to keep the masts standing and unmoving each thick rope shroud was further supported below the channel platforms by metal fittings bolted into the hull called the chains for each shroud there were two massive blocks the deadeyes with lanyards running between them in fourpart purchases to ease or tighten the deadeye lanyards sailors had to go oversidethe steeply angle lee sidewhere the heaving waves that creamed down reliant s flanks could surge up over the channels turning every handhold or precarious foothold iceslick with chill water even with the slackened starboard shrouds now eased by being on the lee side it would require gruelling manual labour to set the tension to rights for every man going over the side there were two to anchor a shipmate with safety lines handsomely now lads and have a care lewrie urged them as the first clambered over the gangway bulwarks to work on the foremast shrouds in better weather they might have seen to all three masts at once but not now lewrie was shivering with cold his clothing soaked with spray and his face felt like a bad shave with a dull razor as the icy droplets kept stinging despite a wool scarf cold water trickled under his tarred canvas coat too but he was determined to remain on deck as long as the work took if the ships people were miserable then he would be too at least he could comfort himself with the thought that he was on the gangway not on the weather deck below where the icy surging waters showered down each time the bows soughed deep into the sea and left shinhigh floods sluicing from beam to beam with each roll of the ship think thats got it sir lt westcott reported at last an hour later very well mister westcott dismiss the working party below lewrie replied let em thaw out and dry out as best they can aye sir lewrie went back forward from the mizen stays steeled himself and waited for the hull to roll upwards before making a dash for the hammock nettings and stanchions at the break of the quarterdeck then it was a slow ascent clinging to the nettings to the weather side where a captain was supposed to be he hooked an arm to the shrouds of the main mast to stay upright as reliant heeled far over to starboard with the next roll and stood there scowling at the fury of the sea and wishing for a cup of something boiling hot coffee tea or cocoa it made no difference even hot water would suit but with the ship pitching heaving and rolling so violently everyone was on cold rations for the galley fires could not be lit in such weather lewrie let out a long deprived sigh eight bells chimed in four doubledings from the focsle belfry up forward it was pm and the end of the day watch and the beginning of the first dog there were happy and relieved smiles upon every hands face for they could go below for two hours far glummer were the faces of the men of the fresh watch some of them the spare hands who had just gotten below for a few minutes and would face two more hours of misery before the second dog watch lieutenant spendlove was mounting to the quarterdeck to replace merriman so lewrie timed a fairly leveldeck dash down to the helm and the binnacle cabinet as those worthies exchanged salutes i relieve you sir spendlove was intoning i stand relieved sir merriman answered course full and by to westnorwest the last cast of the log showed five knots gentlemen lewrie intruded sir they chorused ill go below with you mister merriman and leave the watch to you mister spendlove lewrie told them should the wind shift a touch more sutherly alter course as near as youre able if the wind veers ahead summon me at once nicely done by the way mister merriman thank you sir lt merriman said grinning aye aye sir from spendlove once below and aft in the relative warmth of his greatcabins lewrie peeled off his hat and canvas coat both stiff and soaked with halffrozen spray and wound off the useless scarf he hugged himself and shivered blowing on his chilled fingers as he slid into the chart space to plot the last few hours progress and the change of course might you care for something warming sir pettus asked i could heat up some of your cold tea over the candle warmer god yes pettus and thank yer kind soul lewrie boomed out with a quick laugh hows jessop doin cropsick as a hound sir pettus said with a shrug lewrie looked aft and found jessop in prettymuch the same position hed been in when hed left to go on deck hours before aye some warmedup tea pettus with lots of milk and sugar lewrie returned to peering at the chart speculating with brass dividers and parallel ruler that if they could maintain at least five knots over the ground for so many hours going westnorwest the ship would have made pah he tossed the tools aside in frustration for that course would carry them further north into even colder seas and gained them nothing to the west as much as he detested the idea they would have to wear about once more right at the time that the second rum issue of the day was doled out in the midst of preparations for what meagre cold rations would be served before sunset would be best but it was better than standing on til they struck iceland lewrie managed to make his way aft to his hanging bedcot to check on the cats how ye copin lads he gently asked them he was answered by low moans and the flicks of bottled tails they had not moved far from where hed last seen them either teas almost ready sir pettus informed him a few minutes more and itll be nigh scalding thud came the marine sentrys musket butt on the deck without and the cry of midshipman munsell sah enter lewrie called out the fingers of his right hand most firmly crossed against more bad news mister spendloves duty sir and he says that the winds are veering ahead westnorwest to halfnorth in gusts munsell said his teeth chattering steadying on westnorwest or more northerly young sir lewrie asked ehm it seems to be shifting more and more norwesterly sir munsell speculated very well lewrie said with a sigh i will come up give my compliments to mister spendlove and inform him hes to summon all hands and be ready to wear about aye sir the tarpaulins pettus lewrie said looking for his sodden scarf once dressed again he took time to duck into the chartspace and stepped off six points of sail from their present course then suddenly smiled six points off the relative wind would be due west did they continue sailing full and by but did they fall off to a leading wind two more points to westsouwest he could ease the ship its tortuous twisting and pounding and not only make bags of westing but much more progress to the south as well where surely the weather might be a touch more moderate it might be a tad warmner too by god lewrie thought and we might not be blown ashore on cape finisterre either feeling more hopeful of their immediate prospects he headed for the door with but one longing look at the mug of tea on the warmer which was beginning to steam most nicely damn and bloody damn he mourned chapter nine the harsh norwesterly gales continued to blow fiercely for all that night after wearing and all through the next day allowing the frigate to trundle along two points free headed westsouwest and making a goodly westing as lewrie desired the force of the gales was too great to bear more canvas than they already had spread aloft and the great rolling of the troubled seas wavecrests still robbed wind each time that reliant sagged down into the deep troughs so it was still hard to exceed a snaillike five knots but it was still progress it couldnt last of course the norwesterly blew itself out the storm driving it spending its wrath on the french and spanish coasts as reliant reeled onwards to replace it came a fresh gale this one from the westnorwest at first requiring the tautening of sheets and braces a bit at a time til they were back on a beat to weather steering westsouwest then ceding one point then another to souwest by south if there was a moderation of the fierceness of wind and sea it was only a matter of degrees with only a slight rise in barometric pressure and a fresh chalk mark on the neck of the liquid barometer perhaps a quarterinch below the others there had still been no sun sights but the communal agreement on their dead reckoning had them near the rd line of latitude and a safe one hundred miles west of cape finisterre by that point the temperature had warmed a bit so that the spray droplets that got flung like birdshot stayed liquid and the seas shipped over the bows were no longer icy what sloshed or dripped below was no longer frigid misery but cool damp soggy misery nine days about nine hundred miles made good sir lt westcott commented as lewrie came to the quarterdeck for the second time at four bells of the morning watch at am lewrie grunted his acknowledgement as he looked at the chart which westcott had spread by the compass binnacle and its not raining for a wonder during the night the seas had abated a bit and the wind had backed more to the north and had lost some of its fierce strength when lewrie had first come up at am at the end of the middle watch there had been a steady rain driven by the wind at a slant to drum and hiss on every flat surface sometimes thickening in squalls then easing off to a sullen downpour its easing at last lewrie replied after a long lookabout the ship the sea state and a deep sniff of the wind our course back to southwest by south sir and the winds still backing we could be heading souwest by the start of the forenoon westcott said with a brief savage smile a rough guess below lewrie said nodding in agreement with his first officer i placed us about on the same latitude as lisbon or thereabouts we mightve made enough southing to pick up a hint of the noreast trades and if the weather continues to moderate sir we may even light the galley fires and have a hot meal westcott enthused keep yer fingers crossed mister westcott lewrie said as he paced over to the starboard side of the quarterdeck hooked an arm through the shrouds and leaned out for a better look at the sea he saw hopeful signs though it was still blustery the waves no longer towered over the ship they were still steep but spaced further apart in long rollers crossfretted and dappled with large white caps and white horses and in the predawn greyness no longer seemed quite as green as they had the day before the reek of stormwrack and the smell of fresh fish was not as noticeable either the raw wind was tinged with iodine and salt reliant battered along full and by but her motion was less tortured her decks less canted to leeward and her shoulder set more firmly without that sickening deep rolling or twisting aloft what remained of the commissioning pendant shivered and fluttered less frantically too damme its muggy lewrie realised taking off his tarpaulin hat and opening the tarred coat to let the wind in its becomin warmer at last he had not looked at the thermometer in his cabins but it felt like it might even be near sixty degrees or so dawn quarters sir lt westcott asked aye carry on mister westcott lewrie agreed it was a habit longengrained in him in emulation of former captains more cautious than most to go to quarters before the false dawn ended and the risen sun might reveal an enemy ship or a possible prize above the horizon a drummer began the long roll the bosuns calls started the pipe to quarters and the offwatch crew came scrambling up from the mess deck lewrie passed the keys to the arms chests to one of the midshipmen should muskets pistols boarding pikes and axes need to be issued the ondeck lookouts quit their posts to go aloft to the fighting tops and the crosstrees for the furthest view as the guns were cast loose and the ports opened the tompions in the muzzles removed the flintlock strikers fitted above the touchholes powder charges fetched up from the magazines and roundshot from the shot racks and rope shotgarlands selected by guncaptains sunrise should be when mister caldwell lewrie asked the sailing master once the bustle quieted my best guess would be twenty minutes past six am sir mr caldwell crisply answered though without a firm position of latitude and longitude all i may swear to will be soon lewrie smiled at him then pulled out his pocketwatch to see the minutes tick by eighteen minutes past then the estimated twenty then twentyfive the false dawn grew lighter revealing more of the ship from bow to stern the nightsoftness more stark the horizon that could be seen from the deck expanded from a mile or two to five or six miles and the sea began to take colour the white caps and white horses and the foaming wavecrests turned paler rather than a dishwater grey the sea became a steely bluegrey almost a normal hue for deep ocean and the line of the horizon was no longer the heaving rolling waves close aboard but a real faroff line damn my eyes someone whispered loud enough to be heard for there off the frigates larboard quarter in the east the sun burst like a bombshell above the horizon it was weak watery and hazed by clouds but the first upmost loom of the sun shone yellowish in promise of a clearing day everyone with a pocketwatch snatched it out quickly to note the minute of the suns rising mr caldwells ephemeris had tables which could give them a clearer idea of their position with much hemming hawing and throatclearing the sailing master played shaman for a bit consulting his ephemeris scribbling with chalk on a small slate uttering a damn or two when the damp slate and damp chalk refused to cooperate then ordained that they were a full fifteen minutes of a degree further west than they had initially reckoned now perhaps the discrepancy is due to being further south than our deadreckoning guesses sirs caldwell went on a decent shot at the sun at noon sights should reveal all he concluded as he made an x mark on the chart a tad west of their first estimate it was only a few miles but the rippling horizons were clear and the disturbed seas were empty of threat secure the hands from quarters mister westcott lewrie ordered at last have the galley fires be lit and pipe the hands below to breakfast i may dare to shave this morning aye sir westcott replied and i must say sir that you would decently resemble a pirate do you give the stubble another day or two more arrh lewrie shamgrowled returning to the starboard side daring also to smile for the first time in days conditions did not prove quite as hopeful as they might have wished though by the middle of the forenoon watch fresh banks of grey clouds loomed up from the noreast destroying any hope of a sunsight they were feeling the fringes of the benign the dependable noreast trade wind yet it only brought more gusts and a raw and chill rain the winds settled on reliant s starboard quarter as she was driven south by west ploughing and hobbyhorsing through the swells lewrie at least had enough rainwater with which to spongebathe for a rare once and a ship steady enough under him to lather up and shave chapter ten it was two more wary days of scudding south by west til the sky showed even a hint of blue still mostly lost in blankets of cloudsclouds paler and whiter than any they had seen since leaving portsmouth which at least were promising gradually ragged holes and clearsky streaks appeared in those clouds like ripped and torn curtains or an old blanket that the rats and moths had been feeding upon shadows appeared and here and there round the ship in large patches waves glittered in actual sunlight lewrie was aft in his greatcabins as the forenoon of the third day of their south by westing wore on pacing to peek out the transom sash windows then go forward to the door to the weather deck to stick his head out and scan the sky the ships drummer and fifers began to play the rum cask up at seven bells and it began to look promising at last his sextant and harrisons chronometer were safely stowed in their protective boxes in the chartspace and he gave them an intent look hoping for the best he clapped his hat on his head and picked the boxes up by their brass carrying handles capms on the marine sentry cried for the tenth time since lewries first peek turning his head to see if lewrie would appear for real this time capums on deck he cried in full lewrie trotted up the windward ladderway to the quarterdeck to discover that the sailing master his officers and mids had brought up their own sextants slates and paper scraps for reckoning damned nice lewrie said after a good look about and a sniff of the wind the trades no longer gusted but were steady and this late mornings temperature while still nippy was pleasant enough to be stood without shivering good lord whats that in the sky he japed what should we name it should we worship it dye wonder theres still thin clouds and haze sir but well soon see lt merriman said close enough for naval work lt westcott snickered they compared chronometers then waited for the last grains of sand to trickle through the hour halfhour and quarterhour glasses at the forecastle belfry bringing their sextants up to their eyes as ships boys turned those glasses and chimed the first stroke upon the ships bell then as lt spendlove relieved lt merriman they wrote down their sights and began their calculations a few minutes later the officers covened to compare results which caused smiles all round and a communal gathering by the nowragged chart twentyfive degrees twenty minutes west mr caldwell summed up with unaccustomed glee which places us about here five hundred miles souwest of cape saint vincent and only a few minutes north of the thirtythird latitude he said making a tentative x upon the chart do we stand on this course a few days more we could fetch the madeiras lt westcott pointed out anyone thirsty for some wine or we stand on westsouwest a bit longer til we strike the thirtysecond latitude then follow it the lubberly way right across the atlantic to bermuda lewrie countered perhaps thirtytwo degrees twenty minutes just in case he and the sailing master had pored over another chart of bermudan waters for hours the night before and both of them had gloomed in unison to note how quickly the atlantics abyssal depths shallowed and shoaled the nearer one got to shore even more fearful were the many and great expanses of rocks shoals flats and banks indicated all round the north northwest and west of the chain of islets that made up the wee archipelago and the ovals that marked the wrecks of ships that had gone down on those myriad underwater perils it was not a place to approach unwarily bermudas old name among sailormen was the isle of the devils now your results young gentlemen the sailing master asked of the midshipmen some showed blase calm one or two even beamed in confidence whilst the two youngest munsell and rossyngton displayed more trepidation uhmhmm very good mister eldridge mr caldwell droned on as he studied each slate or sheet of foolscap a few minutes out mister warburton but close uhmhmm mister entwhistle mister grainger well well mister rossyngton despite the first lieutenants jape we are not as close to the madeiras as you make us now then mister munsell caldwell said expecting the worst as usual with a grave phyz on and a demanding hand out for the lads slate well my word my word indeed the sailing master marvelled glancing quickly from munsell to his slate and back again so allaback that he looked as if he would inspect the backside of the slate or turn it upside down mister eldridge has been tutoring us sir munsell said with joy me in particular really the lad confessed not half a degree out either in longitude or latitude mr caldwell exclaimed holding munsells slate for all to see to prove it even lewrie who had struggled for ages with the formula and admittedly still not a dabhand navigator could see that munsell had worked it properly with very few sidescribbles and had not cribbed it from the others he was all but gapejawed in amazement too midshipman munsell could usually place them on the far side of the ocean from where they really were or somewhere in the jungles of the amazon when in west indies waters congratulations mister munsell lewrie said in praise well theres always tomorrow rossyngton teased perhaps mister eldridge should now concentrate upon tutoring you mister rossyngton lewrie suggested pulling a face its rare thave an experienced mid for the others to learn from but thats what a congenial and cooperative midshipmens mess should be hey very good mister eldridge uh thank you sir eldridge replied a tad embarrassed to be pointed out lewrie gave him a reassuring nod and a smile also taking note of eldridges kit and wondered how he was fitting in in the orlop cockpit eldridge normally wore sloptrousers did he have a pair of breeches lewrie wondered or a snugger pair of dark blue trousers linen or cotton shirts a waistcoat that had gone a light tan from age black neckstock and a plain uniform coat with dull brass buttons and the white collar patches of his rank if he had a cocked hat no one had seen it his headgear day in and day out was a black felt civilian topper with a narrow brim and a tapering crown his fellow mids ranged from fifteen to twentyone years of age whilst he was in his midtolate twenties when suddenly promoted into their compact little world with all its lame jests pranks and general ignorance shouldertoshoulder with entwhistle an honourable and the rest who had been reared in the comfort of the landed gentry and the squirearchy whilst eldridges father was a bristol chandler a man in trade a lot in life usually scorned by the better sorts lewrie had been too busy with the lastminute lading the alteration of muster lists the sailing from portsmouth and then the weeks of foul and threatening weather with not a minute to spare for thought over the matter have tget westcott tlook into it lewrie told himself thats what first officersre for aint it the weather relents start dinin officers and warrants in again with eldridge in the rotation one more thing young sirs lewrie said mister munsell do you know the longitude and latitude of bermuda ehm sixtyfour degrees fourty minutes west sir munsell piped up quickly before the others could open their mouths and saint georges harbour is at thirtytwo degrees twentythree minutes north the highest seamark visible from offshore lewrie posed to them that made them share quick looks of worry and took the wind from their sails there were several dumb shrugs the sailing master has the pertinent charts lewrie said with a wry moue over their lack of knowledge id suggest ye all take a good long gander at it and familarise yourselves with the island and its waters and all the cautions right mister caldwell aye sir caldwell replied back to gruffness and damned right so shall i lewrie vowed to himself the offwatch lads are dismissed lewrie ordered turning to secure his chronometer and sextant in their cases carry on mister spendlove aye sir chapter eleven hms reliant s landfall at bermuda was hardly an auspicious occasion the lookouts aloft and the watch officers spotted a few dim lights from far offshore in the wee hours near the end of the middle watch unfortunately those few lowonthehorizon lights were spread to either side of the bows a quick peek at the chart and a hidden gasp later and lewrie ordered an immediate turnabout to stand away soueast into deeper water there to stand offandon til daylight what i feared he told lt merriman and the sailing master that wed fetch the bloody place too far north of it and end up on the reefs and rocks once we can see where were going well come to anchor in five fathom hole assumin we can find it without rippin her bottom out the previous days noon sights had placed their position close to bermuda close enough for lewrie to order the tgallants to be reefed and gasketed the topss reduced to the second reefs and the fore and main courses shortened down to first reefs after a light supper a most informal one with lt westcott the sailing master and a chart spread over the dining table lewrie had taken a threehour nap then had gone on deck at the beginning of the middle watch at midnight to slouch in his collapsible canvas deck chair pace the deck and fret for the first cry of land ho hoping that their navigation was accurate enough their course correct so that they would fetch the islands to their soueast well clear of kitchen shoals mill breakers great breaker ledge flat the noreast breakers and sea venture shoals so named for the sea venture which had wrecked upon them setting the first english colonists on bermuda whether they wanted to be or not they had been bound for virginia but once succoured with fresh victuals most had stayed to make the best of a dangerous serendipity i daresay weve been bitten by the mysterious magnetic variations hereabouts sir mr caldwell said with a scowl bermudas infamous for them sometimes up to six degrees or so and no explaining why theyre not seasonal nor tied to the phases of the moon tides or weather caldwell shrugged and gloomed in perplexity sounds spooky lt merriman commented lets not let the ships people hear any of that hey lewrie muttered to merriman laying a finger upon his lips for a moment we have enough superstitions amongst em already carry on mister merriman now we believe were in deeper safer waters ill take a short caulk in my deck chair very good sir aye merriman replied the dawn did not bring an auspicious landfall either as the forenoon watch began at am the winds began to freshen once more and the inshore waters fretted and chopped in white caps and white horses with ruffling cats paws over the surface there was a heavy scudding overcast that made the early morning shadowless and gloomy and there was a strong smell of rain in the offing to boot oddly though bermuda could not have been a more welcome sight if they had stood in in bright daylight for as their frigate cautiously neared st davids head the shoal waters turned lighter and clearer blue the shores fringed in aqua green with pure white waves breaking upon almost pinkishtan beaches beneath the ruddy limestone headlands and the island was so brightly green there were trees some fronded or spiky like palms or palmettos flowering bushes and open grassy spaces perhaps lawns or croplands and all the flora lush and verdant in an entire palette of green quite unlike some islands in the west indies that could look brown and shrivelled in the sun and talced with dust bermuda appeared as if everything had been freshly watered and washed for their arrival the sailing master his mates and the trusted senior midshipmen busily plied their sextants to take the measurements of the known heights and prominent seamarks working out the distances from shore and the known dangers of the shallows and submerged reefs noted on the charts do we stand on as we are sir the sailing master said after a long grim musing over the chart pinned to the traverse board we will enter five fathom hole there is an anchorage area just north of there where we can find six or seven fathoms and firm sand and rock holding ground or so the chart promises right there lewrie asked pointing a finger at the chart the area that mr caldwell was recommending lay close to the infamous sea venture shoals uncomfortably close to his lights he took a long look about to judge the wind direction worrying that it might be foul for entering st georges harbour proper mister westcott best bower and stern kedge the kedge to be let go first as we crawl on unless a pilot takes pity on us aye sir the first officer replied speak of the devil sir mr caldwell said pointing towards town cut the very narrow entry channel into harbour theres one of the harbour pilots coming to us just now lewrie fetched his telescope and spotted a singledmasted boat coming out of the channel twixt st georges island tiny biggs island and st davids island which formed the southern shore of the harbour its jib and gaffheaded mainsail did an uncertain shiver as it left the cut a sure sign to lewrie that it would be a rightbastard set of swirls and backeddies in there too uncertain a wind to risk reliant this day at least once clear the boats sails cracked windfull and she began to bound over the choppy inshore waters like a running stag bound for his ship as she drew closer lewrie could espy three occupants a lad about twelve or so to handle the sheets one even younger at the tiller and an older man in the boats amidships i say that looks fun midshipman munsell tittered should we ever have the time we could stage boat races the pilot boatif that was what it waspassed ahead of reliant swung about in a wide turn and jibed about to swan close to the starboard main chains and the opened entryport hoy what ship there the older man shouted up using an old brass speakingtrumpet the reliant frigate captain alan lewrie mr caldwell called back for them you are a pilot sir warrick and i am the fellow replied beaming broadly under a widebrimmed straw planters hat shall i come up sir aye come alongside the lad at the tiller no older than ten deftly put the tiller over and brought the boat to within inches of the channel platform as the slightly older boy hooked on with a gaff a second later and mr warrick was scrambling up the boarding battens and the boat sheered off to stand alee good morning all warrick said doffing his hat to the officers gathered on the quarterdeck good morning mister warrick lewrie said stepping forward and doffing his own hat in salute your servant sir nay im more yours capm lewrie warrick replied if you wish to enter port though the winds not good for that today we can find you a good anchorage just off yonder til the morrow and guide you in then whats your draught sir about eighteen feet right aft lewrie supplied good long scope to a bower and kedge im thinking good warrick said noting that the hawsebucklers had been removed a kedge was already attached to a stern cable and the best larboard bower anchor was swinging free of cat and fish lashings theres many the cautious masters thatll anchor out anyway and send their boats in through the cut for provisions do you not have need of lading cargo or landing goods the anchoragell suit you fine mind sir my fees the same for either warrick said with a smug grin naming a goodly sum for his services one which made every officer and lewrie wince these are dangerous waters gentlemen more so than most without a pilot aboard youd be lost and wrecked in a twinkling carry on mister warrick lewrie said do you require cash a note of hand or an admiralty chit cash is topping fine capm lewrie warrick breezed off then turned his full attention to the sails the course and the seamarks hoy lads a half point loord if you will he said to the men on the helm bypassing the watch officers reliant was now wholly in his hands the frigate swung off to starboard a bit as she came level with little head standing out to avoid a shoal noted as the spit to the west was revealed a maze of islets paget and biggs the larger smiths island and behind that in the harbour proper little hen island all in clear green waters as shallow as six to nine feet and even the town cut entrance looked suspiciously shallow to lewrie damned right ill not move without a pilot aboard he vowed to himself no matter how much they charge me capm sir warrick said at last do you let go your kedge and let it pay out half a cable about here then youre good to swing up to windward go flat aback then drop the bower on a short scope for the nonce til youve balanced between them youll find good holding ground very well sir and thankee mister westcott let go the kedge half a cable scope aye aye sir do you wish to enter port proper tomorrow sir its good odds that the windll shift astern of you and you can trust your kedge to hold you at full scope whilst you take up the bower warrick suggested then its smooth sailing right up the cut holding sugarloaf hill fine on your bows you hoist a flag for a pilot and me and my boysll see you right id not try it on without you mister warrick lewrie said which seemed to please the man once were anchored might i offer you a glass of something and ask you a few questions about bermuda this is i believe the first time any of us have put in here thatd be right kindly of you sir warrick replied it lacked half an hour til clear decks and up spirits by the time reliant was safely anchored and all her sails at long last brailed up in harbour gaskets or handed and stowed the crew would get the rum issue a bit later but lewries wine cabinet was open and he kept a stone crock of rum for just such a purpose warricks boat had come alongside and the two lads his sons had scrambled aboard to peer about and josh munsell and rossyngton the ships youngest mids they were bronzed by the sun barelegged and shoeless in faded old breeches with the knee buttons long gone open and sleeveless linen shirts and straw hats much like their fathers ah but thats fine warrick said after a tentative sip from his glass of rum navy issues stronger than most strong enough to make a mans ears itch har we noted some compass variation lewrie began to probe and warrick let go with a plethora of local lore mistifying that there was no explaining the variations for one thing with a chart spread on the dining table warrick went over the string of islands some were so close to each other like north and south ireland boaz somerset and watford islands on the west end of the chain that if the crown ever thought to spend money on bridges the distances between could easily be spanned inside the shoals to the noreast there was a vast expanse of deep somewhat sheltered water murrays anchorage and there were at least two good deepwater channels that led to a very good sheltered anchorage in grassy bay and the great and little sounds out to the west during the peace of amiens the leavder anchored there sir warrick said shes an old twodecker fifty gunner and draws more than you but theres not much in the way of provisions or entertainment for your sailors from somerset or sandys parish either nor is there much joy in hamilton do you send your ships boats through two rocks passage into hamilton bay tis a sleepy little place you can send your people ashore with little fear of desertion though you will note theres several forts and a sizeable garrison on bermuda not that theres much call for them warrick went on holding out his glass for a topup keeping order and rounding up the drunken sailors mostly is leander still here lewrie asked is her captain senior officer present depends on whos in port sir warrick said with a laugh at that notion right now youre senior naval officer present does one of the brigsloops come in then itd be a commander in charge of the island for as long as hes at anchor if both brigsloops are out at sea then it might be one of the lieutenants on the small sloops theres no real dockyard no port admiral or much organisation how many warships are there then lewrie further asked like i said two brigsloops and two smaller sloops more like twomasted topsl schooners around eight or ten guns apiece warrick prosed on much like the bermuda or jamaica sloops that the old pirates like blackbeard and stede bonnet sailed in the long ago ever hear of stede bonnet no i havent lewrie replied pouring a tot of rum for himself to be companionable oh he was a fly fellow warrick happily related he was a gentleman an officer in the island army garrison married with two or more children respectable as anything came of a french protestant family what they call huguenots that were massacred or expelled long ago well upright as he seemed one day he up and boarded ship for nassau the old pirate haven and turned sea rover struth a total lubber id not imagine theres much future in that lewrie said chuckling now no one ever said he was anything close to a tarpaulin sailor warrick went on but he was a gentleman and a leader a man with some style about him so he ended up captain of a small ship faster than you can say jack ketch ran with blackbeard calico jack rackham mary read and anne bonny and so long as he could keep order and be backed up by experienced mates he did right well they caught him though in the end warrick added turning wistfulsomber as if telling of the end of a tragic hero got him at anchor in the mouth of the cape fear river over in the north carolina colony or so they took him down to charleston for his trial now heres the oddest bit were there women aboard a prize he took they took up with him husbands lovers and families bedamned and in all his captures there never was a single murder nor even all that much resistance so the judge says since bonnets hands are clean of killing hes of a mind to pardon him so long as he swears to give up piracy and return to his family know what he said pray do tell lewrie urged encouraging the pilot whether he really cared or not it sounded promising though for mr warrick was almost wheezing with impending wit bonnet says to the judge well my lord if thats my only option you might as well go on and hang me damned if he didnt heehee she mustve been a real shrew lewrie said laughing and damned if they didnt hang him that is warrick said they say stede bonnet went out with style pirate or not no piracy round here since i trust lewrie japed we dont get the great trade convoys to attract much of that warrick said with a shrug sounding as if he might wish that there was some piracy to liven a sleepy midatlantic islands days privateering lewrie asked ours mostly preying on the french and the dons but after the war began again two years ago not much of that either capm lewrie warrick admitted sounding as if that was a letdown too our two brigsloops prowl round the island an hundred or more miles off and stay out nigh three months before coming back in to provision the small sloops patrol closer in but its rare that any enemy ship turns up and theyre mostly bound for more important places cant commandeer the brigsloops just in case the french do turn up lewrie thought i need small ships tmake squadron itll have tbe one of the littleuns none of the small sloops are around at present lewrie asked making free with the crock of rum while rum was not his preferred aged american corn whiskey it was a decent substitute lewrie was one of the few officers in the navy who would even admit to liking a spirit issued to the common seamen well there might be lieutenant bury warrick told him a scowl on his face berry bury like a funeral bury warrick corrected him hes the lizard sloop though a fish named suit him more fellow might as well be covered in scales and fins an odd bird altogether is bury how so lewrie asked topping up both their glasses in vino veritas he thought he knows the truth and i dont he likes hydrog hydrography warrick carped perhaps it was the rum that was tangling his tongue swans about the shoals and reefs taking soundings and making charts burys got it into his head theres channels through the flats that nobodys found yet or wants found whichd cut into yer trade and yer earnings lewrie cynically speculated to himself and when hes not doing that hes out in a small boat with a bucket on his head warrick scoffed beg pardon a bucket lewrie gawped had himself a bucket made with a glasspane bottom warrick explained shaking his head in wonder like an old tavern tankard in the old days wants to see the bottoms watch the fishes study the coral and such and catch samples so he can gut them and pick them to pieces and draw pictures of them spends more time in the water upside down as a feeding duck hee hee last anyone saw of him and the lizard he was off for grassy bay dropping vickers one of the other pilots soon as he got out of the narrows and into the south channel cross murrays anchorage the silly sod warrick huffed up like an adder in revulsion and in defence of his guild as dangerous as bermudan waters were the pilots had been making a killing for years and anything that threatened their income was stealing food from the mouths of their children dont sound like the sort i need lewrie thought and the other small sloop and her captain he queried primrose lieutenant percys more sensible but hes been out the last two months entire and mostlike wont come back to harbour til the rum runs out another month or so warrick speculated damn lewrie thought i may be stuck with mister minnow after all not much choice really well then i intend to idle at anchor at least a whole day through tomorrow give the hands a wellearned rest after the voyage weve had allow the chandlers and bumboats alongside lewrie idly said after that the wind permitting id be much obliged to you did you pilot us up through the narrows and into grassy bay so that i may speak with bury you have it capm lewrie warrick quickly agreed now if youll be ready and if theres not a scramble over a new ship coming in theres no need to make a hoist asking for a pilot see the man actually winked at him ill come out to you and well be off that would be most agreeable mister warrick lewrie replied once warrick and his sons had tumbled down the battens into the boat and had set off for town cut lewrie returned to the quarterdeck well be entering port sir lt westcott asked i think not mister westcott sorry lewrie told him well hoist the easy pendant to whistle up the bumboats and let the purser go ashore for fresh victuals but saint georges doesnt look that promising did they send out all the doxies i doubt theyd make a corporals guard i see sir westcott said sounding a tad disappointed i doubt theres more than a halfdozen decentlookin girls on the whole island and the men of bermuda mostlike guard em like the bloody crown jewels anyway lewrie told him smiling and chuckling were ordered to visit all the major ports in america from cape fear to savannah mister westcott and nassau to boot so you will have your opportunities hmm take joy o that oh very good sir anything needful tsee to sir lewrie asked turning back to ships business over the last few days of decent weather sir weve rerove all the frayed or snapped rigging patched or replaced all the torn sails and replaced the odd broken spars in the topmasts so theres not that much to see to really westcott reported more crisply summon all hands if you will sir lewrie ordered bosun sprague plied his silver call piping the hands up from below summoning the ondeck watch to gather in the waist or on the sailtending gangways lewrie stepped to the top of the starboard ladderway to the waist to address them men weve reached the first stop of our voyage and its been a hellish chore tget here as well you all know hey lewrie began weve put the ship to rights as the first officer informs me and now its time to put your things to rights well not put the ship out of discipline but we will allow the bumboats alongside for fresh fruits and victuals he went on by tonights mess i hope to obtain fresh meat and shore bread for your suppers too right mister cadbury right sir the purser who was standing by to go ashore in one of the ships boats heartily agreed though how much it would cost him out of his slim profits he would not express even by a tiny frown or wince well have all night in tonight lewrie continued noting the smiles breaking out and the second rum issue for the day will be splice the mainbrace tomorrow lusty cheers interrupted him for half a minute and tomorrow will be makeandmend to dry out and repair your kits lewrie concluded mister westcott dismiss the hands aye aye sir and ill sleep the bloody clock round myself at long last lewrie promised himself chapter twelve ithink im beginnin to regret this lewrie thought in trepidation as the pilot mr warrick conned reliant across murrays anchorage towards grassy bay two days later after the winds had come fair the bermuda islands lay too far north of the tropics to own reliable trade winds and too far south of the north atlantic westerlies in the belt of the variables to trust from which quarter the wind would blow two days running likewise the islands weather the garrulous mr warrick imparted in the idle moments between dashes to either beam of the deck and many consultations of the ships binnaclemounted compass one could count on fairly mild weather even in high summer with temperatures rarely above the low eighties but only a few degrees of relief after sundown it could rain at least twice a week and blow up a stronger quartergale at least every ten days to a fortnight all that precipitation was welcome though for bermuda was not blessed with all that many springs and the rain was funnelled down into stone cisterns from the rooves which every private house possessed for later taking pity on a newcome warrick piloted reliant along the north channel which was deeper and more open rather than the south channel which even warrick admitted could be very tricky even so lewrie felt it quite enough unnerving to look overside and see just how clear the waters were and how close they were to the three hill shoals and how ginclear and kneedeep the flats to the north were near the chimneys shoal warrick directed the frigate into a turn to the souwest to stand well away from devils flats then into a welcome lake of deep water before threading a channel through the white flats a passage even narrower than the narrows which had been harrowing enough just thankee well west of the vast expanse of brackish pond flats and with north ireland island off the starboard bows warrick reckoned that they could round up into the wind and safely anchor just about anywhere they were in grassy bay there was only one other vessel in sight a twomasted sloop anchored off long shoal to the soueast with a rowing gig idling at the edge of the shoal they dont seem to be paying much attention to our arrival sir lt westcott said after a long look with a telescope upon his face there sprang one of his brief feral toothbearing grins in anticipation of somebody getting a strip torn off his arse perhaps we should fire a gun to wake them up bring my gig up from astern mister westcott lewrie decided and pass word for my boat crew i think i want tsee what this bury fellows like in his own element who knows he might offer me a fine fish someone had been awake aboard hms lizard for a small jolly boat had set out for the shoal and the gig a bit before lewries gig began to row over there was a flurry of activity a scramble of people into the faroff gig and a furious row back to lizard before lewries boat could arrive permission to come aboard lewrie shouted up to the deck as his boat crew hooked on to the sloops main chains and began to ship oars aye aye sir a flummoxed lieutenant a fellow in his early twenties quickly replied whilst hastily mustering a sideparty fit enough to receive a postcaptain feeling devilish lewrie did not stand on ceremony but scrambled up the battens and manropes before the sloops bosun could even begin a call captain alan lewrie the reliant frigate he said doffing his hat to the flag and the young officer llieutenant rainey sir welcome aboard the lizard the captain ehm lieutenant bury is aft at the moment sir if youll pardon the young fellow babbled we could be seen entering the bay from quite a way off lewrie casually commented harbour watch sir and a make and mend day and some of the people off with the captain and a thousand pardons for being so inattentive captain lewrie the lad replied all but wringing his hands normally we but heres the captain sir hms lizard s captain lt bury appeared from an after hatchway between the transom and the helm looking anxious and guilty he was also sopping wet dressed in faded and stained old breeches with the knee buttons open and no stockings on his lower legs he had not had time to don a fresh shirt tie a neckstock or find a waistcoat and had hurriedly donned a plain undress coat that had seen better days lt bury also sported a straw hat much like pilot warricks which he quickly doffed in salute i beg your pardon sir i have no excuse he baldly said alan lewrie the reliant frigate lewrie told him doffing his own hat in reply ive come to summon you from your duties here in bermudan waters mister bury i am to lead a small squadron able to go into shoal waters and hunt and harry french and spanish privateers off to the west and am in need of vessels such as yours lt bury looked at him most solemnly blinking his pale blue eyes a time or two as if stunned by that announcement or pondering whether such duty might cut into his soundings and fishing we would be delighted sir bury said at last beginning to display a slow equally solemn grin ehm might i offer you some refreshments captain lewrie lead me to it sir lewrie agreed down the steep ladderway through the square hatch they went with bury offering the usual caution to mind the overhead deck beams his quarters were tiny almost a cuddy there was a transom settee beneath the stern sash windows piled with books piles of foolscap notes and a woodandtwine fishing net there was an open chest of clothing a wee desk hooked to the larboard side to serve as his daycabin a slung hammock not a bedcot to starboard and a wee dining table right forward with only six wobbly old collapsible chairs the rest of the cabin was draped with things hung on pegs most of the deck was taken up by wooden tubs made from cutdown kegs they were full of fish pardon the mess sir but even were i expecting company there is only so much room bury said going to a wee winecabinet for two glasses then fetching a bottle of hock from out of one of the tubs where it was slightly cooled in water if you will take a seat ah there captain lewrie he added indicating a chair by the dining table lewrie sat down noting that the top of the table bore a few odd and wet things my viewing devices sir bury explained none of them all that effective so far but one hopes to discover a solution someday viewing devices lewrie asked picking one of them up it was an odd sort of spectacles with two round glass lenses set into a wood frame each lens as roundabout as a mug with tarred canvas attached much like an executioners hood with some light line so that it could be bound behind the head and knotted at first i thought it possible to slip the hood over my head and bind the spectacles snug enough to allow me to float facedown in the water and see the marine life lt bury slowly explained but i found that the salt water still gets into my eyes and the tarred canvas makes it hard to draw a breath whenever i turn my face up to the surface do you see now the other this one was a rectangular box with an eightinch piece of window glass set into it without the canvas hood lewrie picked it up eying it most dubiously the box frame cannot be bound snug enough to my face to keep out the salt water either sir though when i turn my head i am able to draw breath bury said with a shrug and a look of disappointment that his inventions had so far not been of much avail for now the bucket with the windowpane in the bottom works best though after a minute or so it fills with water and has to be emptied out else the view is no better than peering down from above the surface alas christ who still says alas lewrie sourly thought just no way to tar it waterproof lewrie idly asked just to see what else lt bury would say he was an odd bird indeed maybe an iron or brass coal scuttle would work better perhaps one might sir thank you bury said rising to the suggestion now the best solution might be to construct a glass ball much like the one that alexander the great was reputed to use to look at the seabottom though my readings of the classic histories shed no light on how to construct one bury looked sad that he could not conceive a way either as he took a morose sip of his wine have tbe a bigun lewrie commented else you run out of enough air is he daft as bats lewrie asked himself half appalled perhaps a helmet of some kind that could be strapped under the armpits to keep it in place with soldered and tarred glass panes set into it bury enthused a tad with a flexible canvas hose led to the surface to renew ones air sir ive sketches but bury broke off with a sigh and took another abstemious sip of his hock must live on his navy pay lewrie thought after a sip of his own for the hock was really the usual thin and slightly sour pursers issue white wine dismissed as miss taylor when youre not studying sealife lewrie posed what is lizard up to we patrol about fifty or so miles offshore sir bury said doing circumnavigations of the islands the brigsloops able to be on station longer usually scout an hundred or more miles beyond our range several laps if you will before putting back in to victual sounds dreadful boresome lewrie commented oh it is sir bury agreed lighting up in agreement we rarely see anything but for vessels bound to or from bermuda and with so little trade hereabouts theres not much to entice french or spanish attention and when not patrolling there are my secondary duties of hydrographytaking soundings updating the old charts and making new ones from scratch trying to mark the known channels but ive run into a lot of opposition to that sir the local pilots lewrie said nodding in understanding at any rate ive no funds for such and my letters to admiralty go unanswered on that head sir bury said looking miserable again ive tried using painted empty wine bottles bound with tarred line to stones for the most hazardous spots such as the narrows through the white flats which you just entered sir but damned if they dont disappear a day or two later completely i knew officers in the bahamas who tried to erect buoys and rangeline pilings lewrie said chuckling soon as they sailed away the local wreckers and salvagers tore em down so they could keep their livelihoods much of the same thing sir lt bury sadly agreed he seemed completely at ease to sit there and dry out in his wet clothing with his shins bare lewrie pegged bury as one inch taller than his own five feet nine inches very slimly and wirily built with his straw planters hat set aside bury wore his pale blond hair as short as a fellow who feared bugs in his wig snipped to within a quarterinch of his scalp he had a round head but a long lean horse face a prominent upper lip that dwarfed the lower and a receding weakish chin he didnt look like the sort to serve in the royal navy he was more the don or tutorial type more suited to the library could he count on him lewrie wondered a fish flopped in one of the tubs drawing their attention they dont live long poor things bury mourned and it is a pity but at least ive been able to dissect them once they pass and make coloured sketches of their anatomy ive amassed quite a lot of interior drawings as well as tothelife paintings of them as they would appear in the water would you like to see some of them sir hell no lewrie thought aye i would he lied instead steeling himself to display great interest and cautioning himself not to yawn or let his eyes glaze over damme mister bury they really are remarkable lewrie had to admit after a few minutes though burys explanations of what the fish were named both in local argot dry scientific latin classification and general terms went right past his ears heard and flown in an instant you should get together with my first officer mister westcott hes a dabhand artist and draughtsman the two of you could produce good updated charts to send to admiralty and copies for our use while here have you always been interested in marine life since i was a wee lad sir bury shyly confessed we lived near plymouth close enough to go down to the water and the beaches to fish almost daily there and the fishmarkets well i always was curious about what it was like under the sea and how they lived before being landed you eat em too you dont feel lewrie posed a good fish is more toothsome to me than roast beef sir bury said coming close to laughing in real amusement for the first time the crew think my interests odd sir but they eat well as a result might i send you over something for your table tonight sir grassy bays shallows abound in pompano my cook and i will be delighted thankee lewrie enthused he had not had more than two fresh suppers of anything since leaving portsmouth and those only in the last two days fresh fish had not been among them and the idea made him salivate so we shall be off soon sir bury enquired as soon as dammit lewrie told him and bound for nassau in the bahamas to beg borrow or scrounge up a few more shoaldraught vessels id suppose you must victual and take on firewood and water at saint georges before we can do so aye sir a few lastminute items bury said almost by rote gazing off at the middle distanceor his foulweather tarpaulins on a pegto muse upon their departure he then turned to face lewrie with a quirky expression on his face and said and he saith unto them follow me and i shall make you fishers of men and they straightaway left their nets and followed him matthew four nineteen and twenty ah something a bit like that mister bury aye lewrie managed to say wondering what to make of the biblical quotation and if it might be blasphemous to be compared to jesus an odd odd bird indeed he thought book ii privateer a vessel of war armed and equipped by particular merchants and furnished with a military commission by the admiralty or the officers who superintend the marine department of a country to cruize against the enemy and take sink or burn their shipping or otherwise annoy them as opportunity offers the sea vessels are generally governed on the same plan with his majestys ships although they are guilty of many scandalous depredations which are very rarely practised by the latter falconersmarinedictionary edition chapter thirteen reliant s first officer peered upwards at the mast tops to study the winds as the frigate ghosted into west bay of nassau harbour on new providence in the bahamas satisfied he turned to look at his captain and cocked a brow as he said you will not hoist your broad pendant sir bugger the broad pendant lewrie growled back though in good humour one sloop dont make a squadron he added jerking one arm out in the direction of lizard which preceded them by a full cable it would seem a suitable number to justify that fellows broad pendant though sir lt westcott pointed out indicating the bit of red bunting which lazily curled to the light winds atop the main mast of an older gun twodecker anchored between hog island and the towns main piers they were close enough for lewrie to make out as a faint gust spread the pendant that the officer allowed to fly it was much like him it displayed a large white ball indicating that whomsoever the officer was he was still a postcaptain without a flagcaptain or staff approaching admiralhood further east in east bay lewrie could espy at least two more royal navy vessels no bigger than lizard hmm seems at least two will suffice mister westcott lewrie japed give the man another pair and he might style himself a rearadmiral if he has twice that number out patrolling the down islands he might sign his letters as lord nelson do your orders name him sir westcott asked no lewrie replied just senior officer present in the bahamas dont think admiralty knew just who that was back in january he shrugged as if it really didnt matter the oldun tbe called home the newun not yet appointed no matter you may begin to fire the salute to captain thinggummy now sir and be ready to round up into the wind and let go the bower once done aye aye sir mister acres begin the salute the new master gunner who had replaced old rahl jutted an arm at the forrudmost pounders guncaptain who jerked the lanyard of the flintlock striker and the first shot of the gun salute boomed out creating a thick jet of yellowgrey smoke mr acres paced aft to all outward appearance mumbling to himself before halting and jutting an arm at the second pounder of the starboard battery for their second saluting shot acres was reciting the ancient ritual for timing under his breath if i werent a gunner i wouldnt be here ive left my wife and all thats dear numbertwo gun fire if i werent a gunner and on aft repeating himself til thirteen guns for a postcaptain with broad pendant had been delivered lee helm and flat her aback mister westcott lewrie ordered fourtoone scope on the cable should suit right in the middle of coasting to a stop letting go the anchor and the lowering of jibs and staysls the clewing and brailing up of the squaresls mr eldridge their newest midshipman announced the appearance of a signal hoist which had soared aloft on the twodecker it was captain repair on board impatient sort aint he mister eldridge lewrie said as he settled the fit of his waistcoat and shirt cuffs coxn desmond my gig dye please aye aye sor the gig was led round from towing astern and his longtime coxn liam desmond stroke oar patrick furfy and the other hands of his boat crew quickly went down the battens to take their places with oars held vertically aloft lewrie made his own slower way down to step from the mainmast channel to the gunnl of the gig then quickly staggered inboard and took a seat aft make for the flag desmond aye sor ship oars starbd shove off forrud make way starboard ship oars larboard and stroke tgither nattylookin tday sor furfy dared comment for this occasion lewrie had donned his bestdress uniform and had included the sash and star of the order of the bath as well as his medals for the battles of cape st vincent and camperdown for a rare once he had yet to accept the fact that he had been knighted by the king the past year lewrie knew hed earned the medals but still suspected that he had been knighted and made baronet in sympathy for his wifes murder by the french in and the outrage and increased patriotism which her death had engendered and not for his part in the brief but conclusive squadrontosquadron action off the chandeleur islands of louisiana in late to be called sir alan or my lord made him squirm in embarassment stuff and nonsense furfy lewrie told the fellow bestowing a brief grin and shrug damme that diplomatic shit in my orders lewrie thought all up and down the american coast ill have twear all this flummery show the flag show me gawd he turned to look aft over desmonds shoulder to see if reliant was safely anchored and if her sails were finally brailed up and put in harbour gaskets that the yards were tidily level and not a cockbill and disorderly when he turned back to look forward his gig was passing under the high jibboom and bowsprit of the twodecker bound for her starboard entryport and almost close enough to touch the gunners figurehead was a ubiquitous crowned lion giving not a clue to her name at least it was brightly gilded revealing a bit about her captains attention to detail and his relative wealth gilt work came from a captains pocket the admiralty wouldnt pay for such stroke larboard backwater starboard desmond snapped as he put the tiller hard over to swing the gig about almost in her own length before calling for a few strokes of both banks together just enough to glide her to the main channel and battens toss yer oars hook on forrud and the rowers hoisted their oars from the tholes using mens shoulders for bracing lewrie went to amidships of the gig stood teetering on the gunnl for a second then stepped onto the chain platform to swing to the battens and manropes he tucked his hundredguinea presentation sword behind his left leg and climbed up quickly as the dogs vane of his cocked hat peeked over the lip of the entryport the bosuns silver calls began to fweep a salute and once inboard on the starboard sailtending gangway there were marines in full kit and sailors in shoregoing rig presenting arms welcome aboard mersey sir a lieutenant with a plummy and toplofty oxonian drawl said in welcome his bicorne foreandaft hat doffed captain alan lewrie of the reliant frigate sir he replied introducing himself even as he doffed his own hat sir alan sir lieutenant hubbard your servant sir the fellow said second officer into mersey captain forrester is aft in his cabins if you will come this way sir francis forrester lewrie gawped the honourable francis forrester is he he is indeed sir alan lt hubbard told him do you already have the honour of his acquaintance sir christ that pigfaced bastard lewrie thought served together long ago lewrie said leaving it at that hed come down with the yellow jack and had been put ashore to mostlike die from the parrot schooner had spent some time on staff to rearadmiral sir onsley matthews at antigua then had finally won a seagoing berth aboard the hms desperate under that daft lunatick commander tobias treghues francis forrester had been catercousin and pet to treghues and had made life for the rest of desperate s mids a pluperfect hell forrester back during the american revolution had been a fubsy crusty round young fellow and an arrogant sneering pig to boot lewrie and the other mids had once gotten some of their own back by obtaining some royal blue lead paint and had given forrester a goatee a fat and curling mustachio and blue cheekbones as he slept snoring like a stoat treghues had been outraged and being good paint after drying in the overnight hours it had not come off for weeks no matter what forrester used to scrub at it i read in steeles that hed been made post lewrie told himself as they went aft but i never expected tsee him in the flesh of which he had very much the rest o this life lt hubbard spoke in the marine sentrys ear the marine private jerked his head in a short nod then stamped boots slammed the butt of his musket on the deck and bawled capm sir alan lewrie sah music to lewries ears it was for instead of the usual calm return cry of come or enter from within the greatcabins there could be heard a startled wha a long pause then an enter lt hubbard slightly raised one brow in surpise then opened the door for lewrie to step through he ducked his head to avoid the overhead deck beams then made his way aft past the dining coach the chart space into the spacious daycabin lives well francis does lewrie thought as he took in all the finery captain forresters furniture was exquisitely made and shining with beeswax polish and there was a faint tinge of lemon oil as if freshly buffed that morning the blackandwhite painted canvas deck chequer looked spanking new where one could see it past the edges of several colourful and expensive turkey or axminster carpets all the settee area furniture was of gleaming cherry wood upholstered in dark brown leather collapsible and stowable at short notice certainly but looked more substantial than most seagoing pieces all the interior bulkheads above the wainscotting were painted in a soothing mint green with mouldings added in cream and gilt there were satiny drapes for the windows in the transom in a cream colour pale green cushions and contrasting throw pillows for the transom settee and a satiny coverlet for forresters hanging bedcot and the flimsy deal and canvas collapsible partitions were done in that mint green with white louvred shutters in the upper halves forrester himself sat behind a long and wide daycabin desk of cherry one that rested on xshaped folding frames with lots of wellpolished brass accents forrester well by god we once said he was battenin like a hog ready for the fall slaughter lewrie gleefully thought and damned if he aint gone fubsier since captain francis forresters uniform was elegantly tailored of the finest broadcloth wool for the coat and waistcoat of the finest and softest cotton denim sailcloth for the breeches and the whitest cotton or linen for his shirt but he did put a strain on it lewrie walked up to the desk hat under his left arm and gave forrester a nod francis its been a long time how dye keep captain forrester did not at once reply he seemed dumbstruck as if poleaxed like a beef cow his face looked flush and his cheekbones were even redder putting lewrie into a fond bluetinged memory forresters eyes were glued to the medals the bright blue silk sash and the gleaming star on lewries chest at last he looked up with a faint scowl blossoming captain lewrie he gravelled you are come as reenforcement to my squadron forrester asked sorry no lewrie replied with a grin in point of fact i am come to borrow a few small sloops from you so i may break out my own broad pendant the devil you say forrester snapped turning tetchy come for some of my warships only a couple or three lewrie said trying to sound assuring he reached into the breast pocket of his uniform coat and drew out the orders this is addressed to the senior officer present in the bahamas perhaps your appointment here was only a few days after if you give it a looking over youll see what admiralty intends im to put together a small group of shoaldraught vessels able to go close inshore poke into inlets bays and rivers in spanish florida to hunt down french and spanish privateers the suppression of privateers is properly my duty lewrie forrester snapped turning a tad redder in the face if such was possible florida is not an hundred miles west of here and the vessels of my squadron few as they already are have their hands full patrolling the florida straits not to mention making regular rounds of the whole of the bahamas down to the turks and caicos and the inagua islands protecting the salt trade why these orders are impossible to fulfill ive nothing to spare not even that little sloop that just came in uhm the lizard sloop is with me actually lewrie told him striving for a mild tone and chiding himself not to gloat i drug him off from bermuda where he lieutenant bury was the senior officer present at the moment and damn yer bloody eyes but are ye ever going toffer me a seat or a glass o somethin lewrie inwardly fumed good god forrester spat like to shake himself to wake from a very bad dream he looked as miserable as a hanged spaniel if youll look over the orders sir lewrie prompted holding them out once more and might i sit down sir how remiss of me forrester said deadlevel in his tone of voice for it was nowhere near a sociable apology do sir sit he looked over at one of entourage of cabin servants and snapped his fingers some hock most welcome sir lewrie agreed reminding forrester that his postcaptaincy predated lewries and that he was higher up the navy list seemed to mollify him somewhat the wine arrived whilst forrester continued to read the orders over several times it seemed his piggy eyes darting and squinting as if in pain the cabin servant was tricked out in immaculate white shirt and sloptrousers wore a black neckstock round his collars and white gloves nigh as grand as a waiter in a london chop house the bottle stood in a shiny pewter bucket dripping water as it was removed and lewrie definitely heard the sound of ice chunks as the steward did so aye the wine was iced yankee doodles forrester disparagingly commented come to buy salt and sell lumber and new england winter ice pity for this lot may be the last til next november or december yes i recall the icehouses of nassau lewrie replied and how hard it is tpick all the straw and sawdust off before you could use it in a cold punch had the alacrity sloop in the bahamas from to ketchrigged sloop once a bomb vessel really but it was fine duty in those days the bahamas forrester scoffed looking up with the orders in one hand and a wine glass in the other well perhaps you would appreciate it but i find the islands a dreary boresome place lacking the basic rudiments of proper civilisation barely a cut above a cornish fishing village or a smugglers inlet he added best place tshop for the rudiments of civilised life the smugglers dens lewrie japed like calico jack finneys emporium that used tbe on bay street yes i heard of him forrester said im the one who chased him to charleston south carolina and killed him lewrie told forrester with a tight little grin and whatve you done since we were mids tgether lewrie asked himself all claret cruisin and bumkissin ahem as i said lewrie this request from admiralty is just impossible for me to fulfill forrester fussily announced redirecting the conversation ive but two brigsloops on station and eight small sloops given the fact that spain has been an enemy since the first of the year i cannot spare a one their colonies in florida and cuba just south of here on hispaniola on puerto rico the risk of invasion is too high to despatch even the smallest to you hmmm forrester pondered a sly smile blossoming on his face given that threat it might make more sense did you and your frigate come under my command then when i may spare you you may prowl round florida to your hearts content the presence of a twodecker sixtyfour and a fifth rate frigate would surely give ambitious dons pause hey hmm lewrie replied in kind taking his own sweet time with his wine glass as if really considering the proposal actually i fancy that our ships at antigua barbados trinidad and jamaica are keeping the dons awake at night so the risk of invasion from spain is negligible sir the spanish are at more risk secondly lewrie drolly went on quite enjoying himself admiralty did not request but ordered you to supply me with a few shoaldraught sloops or cutters thirdly lewrie said pausing to let that sink in a refusal on your part would hamper the fulfillment of my original orders and lastly stick it up his bumhole yes lewrie thought feeling like he could barely keep from chortling out loud and delighting in the puce colour of forresters full face here it comes ye gotchgut lastly am i shackled to the bahamas under your command id not be able to execute the rest of my duties of surveying bermudan waters or calling upon our consuls in neutral american ports to see if enemy privateers may be operating from them covertly as i recall you were made post in the spring of ninetyseven whilst i forrester shot back eyes as lidded as a cobra that dont signify lewrie quickly dismissed with a wave of one hand ive independent orders to form a punitive squadron and root out privateers from admiralty sir i will consider your requ the matter captain lewrie forrester sputtered as sulled up as a bullfrog and will send you my decision by letter when ive completed my deliberations upon it oh when you do lewrie quickly rejoined ye might add baronet tthe heading well i shall take my leave he added finishing his wine and rising he knew that would gall the man even worse francis forrester was an honourable but so were all his brothers and sisters as sons or daughters of a baron or viscount and he was not the eldest son due to inherit else hed not have gone to sea in the first place and made a career of the navy good day to you captain lewrie forrester was forced to say not rising from his seat behind his grand desk and not offering his hand most ungraciously and sulkily good day to you yer servant sir lewrie replied making a sketchy polite bow from the waist before departing damn my eyes but maybe bein a knight and baronet comes in handy now and again lewrie told himself as he gained the deck and the open air chapter fourteen lewrie was back aboard reliant just long enough to remove the sash and star warn his cook yeovill that hed take his dinner on shore and ordered the purser mr cadbury to take a ships boat to seek out fresh victuals then he was off in a whistledup bumboat for the docks of nassau captain francis forrester might not care for new providence island or the bahamas but lewrie still liked it somewhat nassau was a raw and rowdy place sleepier than grander ports hed visited and might lack the refinements of the symphonies opera houses or theatrical halls of london and yes its miniscule attempts at cultured society might be provincial and chawbacon but nassau had a bustle to it the shoreside streets teemed with pushcarts and waggons and vendors the piers were lined with merchant ships and thronged with stevedores landing and carting off cargoes or lading exports lewrie found a free black with a pushcart from which he sold ginger beer by the pint and halfpint right off and savoured the sweetness and the sprightliness along with the sharp bite of the ginger and there was the chophouse where he and caroline had dined so many years ago where hed first met his friend and fellow officer benjamin rodgers where they had politely declined the clumsy invitations of calico jack finney the ragseller turned privateer then local hero then rich entrepeneur and secretly pirate he popped into its coolness and dined on jerked pork and crispfried breaded grouper with white wine and a fresh salad finished with the very same keylime pudding hed relished in his early days on a tour of remembrance he later idly strolled bay street noting the new houses and stores that had sprung up over the years where hed first bearded finney in his massive sprawling emporium nigh a whole corner block once with all the various shops opened to each other and to the streets through grand doorways lewrie found it changed the interior passthroughs now walled back up and divided into at least a dozen new concerns he made a courtesy call on the island governor at government house spent about twenty minutes there then made his way back east towards the piers beyond fort fincastle that loomed above them and on a sudden whim hitched a ride on a passing empty waggon further to the east out towards fort montagu on east bay street he alit by the gate house to the old boudreau plantation that had been his and carolines shore residence once and from the first moment he was sorry that hed come it had had a tight cedar shingle roof once but that had gone to seed and was littered with reddishtan detritus blown off the many pines and palmettos their little cottage had been an ambitious stab at grandeur an unneeded stables or overseers cottage all of stone or coral tabby there had been the main section with two bedrooms a parlour and space for dining to one side then a breezewaycaroline had called it a dog run he sorrowfully recalledseparating the main house from the smaller kitchen pantries and storerooms the bathing facility and jakes his late wife had had the exterior painted a startling but cool mint green whilst he had been away on his first patrol down the island chain to the turks and caicos his teasing about the colour had lit their first real argument now though it had been painted and repainted then neglected for so long that it was hard to choose which pastel colour it was now the deep front and back porches and the dogrun breezeway held rickety tables and mismatched chairs occupied by offduty soldiers from fort montagu jaded doxies and scruffy illclad civilian topers all of whom peered cuttyeyed at him or found the presence of a naval officer amusing he looked past their old house up the drive towards the manse that had once been a sedate and solid home even if it had been painted the colour of boiled shrimp with glaring white trim it and the rental houses the wood salt boxes that the boudreaus had run up had gone to seed as badly as the gate house the wooden houses reduced to greying weathered tumbledown shacks the boudreaus had refugeed from charleston south carolina at the end of the american revolution low country planters and grandees whod upheld the loyalist cause like so many torys who had fled to the bahamas the west indies or canada they had faced sudden poverty and the wrenching shock that if they could afford to purchase land or slaves with which to work it the island colonies could not support them for long the sandy white lands were only good for truck gardening and the richer red lands further inland were deceptive without livestock and their manure the red lands gave out after two or three good crops and nassau could never have the grazing land large enough to support livestock herds the boudreaus had quickly given up the idea of a plantation and had gone into housing supporting themselves at a modicum of their old lifestyle from rents and the runningup of modest lodgings they had stayed in the bahamas whilst so many others heartbroken fled warily lewrie went to the front porch of his old home and ordered a pint of ale have you ever heard of the boudreau family he asked the tapster who looked very much like a retired pirate the who capm they owned all this once lewrie said i rented from them my wife and i back in the eighties ye lived up there ye did the old fellow marvelled no here this was our rented house the boudreaus lived in the house yonder lewrie corrected him he took a peek inside the tavern and was sorry that he did the gleaming white woodwork the pale tanpainted walls had gone as scabrous as a basement dive in the worst london stew never eard of em capm tis a boardin house now when it aint a whorehouse hee hee th doxies board there an all th soldiers foller the tapster supplied with goodly mirth ah well ye go away a few years theyll change things all round lewrie sighed with a sad philosophical shrug he finished his ale then went back to the road hed seen enough he was certain that the boudreaus were both dead and gone by now and as frenchborn huguenotsfrench protestants turned church of englandtheir graves could be found in some parishs churchyard but he felt by then a dispiriting langour and a desire to be away to make matters worse it was a long warm walk back to town and the docks and no wheeled traffic from which to hitch a ride by the time he was there he needed another ale to quench his thirst and cool him off he took a seat on a covered porch off the side of the public house fanned himself with his hat for a while and looked at the harbour and up bay street the flowers the flowering vines and bushes and all the planters all about him how could he have forgotten once more he felt a pang recalling how scrofulous and weedy the grounds about the old gate house and mansion were with help from mrs boudreau and her old black gardener caroline had created a new eden nigh a jungle their house had been awash in greenery and blossoms of the most vivid and exotic colours there had been tamarinds and flowering acacia treeoflife bush cascarilla and red jasmine bright yellow elder and bougainvillea vines growing up the trellises poinsettias and poincianas angel trumpets and flamingo flowers graceful bird of paradise and jumpupandkissmes in planter pots and beds to screen their front gallery from the road and the rear gallery from the main house they had had palmettos sapodillas soursops and guava saplings and their own lemon or keylime trees their candlewoods and sea grapes and caroline had been so very proud of her fragrant and colourful handiwork ghostlike there was a shift in the breeze that brought scents of flowers from the nearby gardens as sweet and intoxicating as the sunset breezes off potters cay and hog island had come to their old house so long ago forcing lewrie to recall the sweetness the contentment and lazy satisfaction of sitting with a young wife at the tailends of tropic days and he had to squint and grimace in pain to cover his public unmanning he pulled a handkerchief out to dab at his eyes before even slight tears of grief came thought i was beyond all that he chid himself he finished his ale quickly for he really needed to be back aboard his frigate in the privacy of his greatcabins where he could hide for a while chapter fifteen to captain sir alan lewrie bart aboard the reliant frigate sir after giving the matter due consideration and pursuant to admiralty orders received from your hand i deem myself able to second to you only two vessels to wit the hermaphrodite brig thorn lieutenant darling and the sloop firefly lieutenant lovett now lying at anchor in east bay orders to the officers commanding in regards to their transfer to your flag are issued and take those two and get the hell out o my sight hey lewrie chortled as he read the letter the sooner were gone the better forresterll sleep of course forrester made that conditional referring to the transfer of the two ships dependent upon whether the spanish threatened the bahamas or turks and caicos and he needed them back further claiming that if such occurred lewrie would simply have to ignore his original orders and place reliant under forresters command and if he lewrie stepped into the quag up to his neck over in florida waters and found himself overmatched by the spanish hed best place himself under forrester to in essence pull his chestnuts out of the fire i take it that your early days with this fellow were not all that jolly sir lt westcott asked once lewrie had read the orders aloud to him forrester and the desperate and commander treghues ah what splendid memories lewrie said the sarcasm dripping well its of no matter mister westcott weve a squadron dont know what sort yet but its a start i asked about when i was ashore yesterday sir lt westcott told him with a sly look people in the taverns civilians and navy sorts alike say that captain forresters mersey has been at anchor so long shes not aground on beef and pork bones but hed have to send people overside to chip her off the coral reef thats built up under her keel if he dont much care for nassau or its lacks yed think hed at least put to sea and sail round the islands lewrie supposed as he tossed the letter atop his desk but that might take him too far off from his fresh tucker hmm while you were ashore you didnt pick up anything about thorn and firefly or their commanding officers did you mister westcott no sir sorry westcott told him with a shrug didnt know wed be getting them so oh well i spose i should go call upon lieutenants darling and lovett and introduce myself before forrester changes his mind and snatches em back lewrie said with a short laugh you see to an hours drill on the great guns then the rest of the forenoon with cutlasses and boarding pikes and i should be back aboard by the start of the rum issue very good sir westcott replied preparing to rise and leave the greatcabins uhm not live firing sir he japed and wake all of nassaus drunks lord no sir lewrie had himself rowed over to hms thorn first assuming that a gun ship would rate the senior of the two as his gig came to a stop under her boarding battens he could see that thorn was alert and ready to greet him with the proper sideparty he had served in a schooner a ketch then threemasted ships but never aboard an hermaphrodite brig which was neither a real brigrigged vessel nor the usual foreandaftrigged schooner or cutter but a bit of both welcome aboard sir her captain said once the salutes and the bosuns calls were done lieutenant peter darling sir commanding my first officer the onlyun really lieutenant child your servant sir lt child said doffing his hat once more alan lewrie sir mister child lewrie said naming himself youve received captain forresters orders transferring you and your ship to my squadron i have sir darling replied might i ask if our transfer may involve some special duty you may and i will gladly reveal all to you over supper this evening say half past six lewrie offered ye never can tell who might blab in the meantime if allowed ashore nassaus bungfull of untrustworthy people so id feel more confident did your people see to lastminute victualling if they dont know much right now i see sir darling said looking a bit happier that his new duties might bode of some mystery and the prospect of action tell me a bit about your ship sir lewrie said and give me a brief tour if you would gladly sir darling said leading the way forward thorn was spanish a merchant ship taken as prize off mayaguana just after we learned of our declaration of war against spain the previous officer on station decided that shed make a useful cruiser we think she was built by an american yard for the split rigs rare back in europe so far quite handy though sir on almost every point of sail and howd you find favour enough thave her lewrie wondered suspecting that darling might be one of forresters proteges pets or catercousins they certainly resembled each other lt darling was two inches shorter than lewries five feet nine but outweighed him by at least two stone lt darling had a round cherubic face a stout upper body and short bandy legs he had an odd scissory strut when he walked about his decks lewrie looked aloft at thorn s masts her foremast was rigged with course topsl royal and tgallant yards and a large pair of gaff booms so she could set a foreandaft lugsl behind that mast or hoist a very large main topmast staysl in its place depending upon whether she was working to weather or sailing large offwind her main mast aft featured a very large spanker the equivalent of a schooners main sail but had no yards crossed above youve carronades lewrie asked noting the short stubby guns mounted on slides ranged down either beam of her deck weve two sixpounders for bow chasers but twelve eighteenpounder carronades sir lt darling said with a wry moue it will be quite the shock to anyone our size who closes with us and offers us a fight sir he hopefully declared unless he has ninepounder long guns hangs back and shoots you to pieces lewrie dryly replied pulling at an earlobe carronades were much lighter than long guns of the same calibre required smaller gun crews to man them and threw much heavier shot unfortunately not all that far anything over three hundred yards was iffy if hes one o forresters pets he didnt get all that much of a plum command lewrie thought still beggars cant be choosers and she mightve been the best forrester could offer him you came off mersey lewrie asked trying to make that sound mere idle curiosity oh no sir lt darling countered i was fifth lieutenant aboard our previous senior officers twodecker sixtyfour aquila mister child was her senior midshipman and we scrounged up a brace of lads off other ships for our mids lewrie took late note of the presence of two young midshipmen that meant that thorn had at least one hundred crew altogether one mid for each fifty hands was the norm whats your draught mister darling lewrie asked we draw ten feet sir darling said looking as if he hoped that would be useful shell go very close inshore if needed thatll be most satisfactory sir lewrie told him smiling with delight at that news his smile engendered one upon darlings face too she handles well quite well sir lt darling proudly said under foreandaft sails with staysl and jibs only shell go about quick as one can say jack ketch and shes tolerably fast to boot lewrie put his hands in the small of his back and went stoic and silent for a moment taking in thorn s material condition as if judging her in reality he was counting up supper guests me the sailing master mister westcott bury darling and his first officer that lovett fellow yonder on firefly that makes seven lewrie tallied up whoops theres lizard s other lieutenant rainey thatll make eight ill place him or child at the foot below the salt somebody juniors got tgive the kings toast id admire did you and lieutenant child both dine with me this evening mister darling lewrie said as if coming up from the depths of a serious musing delighted to accept sir lt oliver lovetts hms firefly would be the smallest of their squadron thorn was about ninety feet on the range of her deck lizard about eightyfive whilst firefly barely managed to attain seventy feet she was foreandaft rigged with only one crossed yard on each upper mast to spread square sails her armament was made up of eight old pounders with only pounder swivel guns on stanchion brackets for bow or stern chase guns unlike thorn or lizard which had a commission officer to assist their captains lt lovett had only one midshipman and was his own sailing master or purser none of them rated a marine complement either and all had but two small ships boats a gig and a jolly boat each that would have to be rectified somehow lewrie determined if they came across a privateer encampment though he did not know how to whistle up suitable boats at short notice right off he could not afford them out of his own purse might spend years explaining issuing admiralty chits and doubted if forrester would allow them a spare bailing bucket could he steal some he wondered lt oliver lovett was another odd bird though nowhere near as solemn as lt bury lovett was an inch taller than lewrie slimly built but leanly muscular he had a large beak as big and cranked as a cornishman dark brown hair that he wore long and curly on both sides of his head in an unmanageable mop over his forehead with the surplus bound at the nape of his neck in an oldtime sailors queue as thick as the tail of a border collie when lewrie went aboard lt lovett was dressed in stained breeches hessian boots and a weathertanned linen shirt with the collar open and the sleeves rolled up to his elbows give him a waist sash and an eyepatch and lovett could do a fair impersonation of a pirate the young fellow nighvibrated with pent up and boundless energy bless you captain lewrie sir for you bring deliverance from utter drudgery lovett loudly exclaimed with such eagerness that he seemed impatient that they would not be off instanter he would also be delighted to be dined aboard reliant this evening though he did make apologies for how shabby his turnout might appear and hoped he would not disappoint its more a working supper nothing grand mister lovett lewrie assured him come alongside a bit before half past six after a quick tour of firefly lewrie had himself rowed back cross the roadstead to the deeper anchorages in the west bay and his midday meal feeling quite satisfied so far he had two vessels of tenfoot draught and one firefly that only drew nine all of them able to prowl quite close inshore or into the many inlets and rivers too shallow for his frigate he had a slew of pounder guns available did they operate together and even if thorn s carronades could not reach out very far or aid in the bombardment of privateers shore camps when put up against the light wales of a privateer at the usual range lt darling and his stubby guns could shoot clean through them lewrie turned his attention back to his oarsmen instead of musing on the shore and noted that they seemed antsy constantly looking over their shoulders towards reliant anything wrong lads he asked oh no sir one replied well patrick furfy carefully spoke up if ye wouldnt moind sor might ye be tellin us th time lewrie pulled his watch from his pocket and opened it grinning as he twigged to their concern its twenty minutes past eleven and i do believe well all be back aboard in time for clear decks and up spirits if we get a goodly way on that is hear the capm lads his coxn liam desmond snapped git a way on ye lummoxes set a hot stroke pat pull furfy cried digging in with his oar and pull all in all a good mornings work lewrie happily told himself chapter sixteen with his cooks yeovills help lewrie aimed to make the supper a succulent and filling affair to introduce his new subordinates to each other and to himself though the various courses were toothsome he had promised a working supper so over the spicy shredded chicken broth soup the grilled shrimp and vegetable medley the midmeal vinaigrette salad and the requisite roast beef roast potatoes and peas he quizzed them on their backgrounds and past experiences darling was the most loquacious and amusing lovett gruffer and more modest and bury the most enigmatic but lewrie was secretly satisfied that all three younger men had come up from the orlop cockpit at slow paces with years as mids or passed mids before gaining their lieutenancies both of the lieutenants off thorn and lizard child and rainey mostly kept proper and deferent silence much like midshipmen allowed to dine aft with their superiors though they did tuck the victuals in heartily and knew enough to laugh or smile when past merriment was mentioned clear for the sweets sir yeovill asked taking note of the empty plates and crossed tableware tis a keylime jumble though i fear the meringues a failure yeovill gave pettus and jessop the nod to begin serving the light white wine to accompany dessert thankee yeovill aye lewrie agreed dabbing at the corners of his mouth with a napkin now weve come tknow a bit about each other gentlemen i think its time to fill you in on what were to do together one hopes yell find it more exciting than patrolling the bahamas anything would be sir lt lovett exclaimed come across many french or spanish privateers among the islands do you lewrie asked uhm hardly any sir lt darling said for theres not all that much to prey upon with the bulk of the shipping american or neutral not much in the way of really valuable cargoes either sir lovett added theres not much prizemoney in hunting privateers but somebodys got tdo it lewrie said after a sip of his wine head or gun money on crew and armament and perhaps if a vessels big enough and in good shape she might be bought in after surveying to do the sort of duties youre performing but theres little profit in it which explains why our navy doesnt put much effort into chasing them lewrie said with a faint grimace more glory in close broadsides frigate to frigate lt bury almost gloomily agreed with a slow nod why even stir out of port if theres not fame in the offing lt darling cynically asked and lewrie noted the secret grins shared between darling and lovett and their junior officers cant abide forrester either can you lewrie thought its no wonder unless one guards something precious lewrie posed tongueincheek protection being the greater duty than seeking battle and letting the foe come to you lt lovett could not hide a wry snicker yayss one never can tell when a mighty spanish armada comes up over the horizon lewrie derisively said dismissive of forresters dread of invasion but perhaps do we go nip at the invaders heels stir up a spot o bother the spanishd be too busy with us to try it on mister caldwell youve brought the chart i requested i did sir his sailing master said then soon as weve had seconds of this marvellous jumble we will spread it on the table top and get down to business lewrie said with a grin they had to stand to gather round the dining table and the seachart taking their sweet biscuits and shelled nuts from bowls on the sideboard and passing the port bottle handtohand for topups in a larboardly direction do we sail directly from nassau to spanish florida past the berry islands and bimini its good odds the gulf streamd sweep all of us as far north as saint augustine lewrie sketched out using a dessert fork for a pointer better we head south down the tongue of the ocean past andros and prowl our way down close to cuba to see what we can see before heading west up the old bahama channel into the florida straits where our large trade convoys pass ehm where spanish merchantmen pass too ive heard sir lt lovett stuck in with a wolfish expectant look then do we just happen to come across one id think that spanish trade wouldve dried up lewrie said with a frown we shall keep our eyes on the main chance of course mister lovett but the reason well be going the long way round is so we may scout the florida keys he went on tapping the tines of the fork on the string of cays i lost a prize to creole pirates out of new orleans a few years ago and it always struck me that the keysd be a capital place for pirates or privateers tlurk like blackbeard did behind topsail island in the carolinas waitin for passin ships well probe into the bays behind the keys from key west up to this un called islamorada then into this great bay the tamiami or something like that the chart shows a huge natural harbour have any of you ever been there or had a look inside to see if there were settlements none of them had once ordered to the bahamas their duties had leashed them to the island chains inner waters if i may be allowed to opine sir lt bury said in his usual solemn mien i was given to understand that the spanish settlement system of encomiendas the awarding of land grants to the original conquistadors required their farms mines or rancheros to be profitable and the native populations to be their slaves yet from what ive read of florida it does not appear theres anything worth settlement south of saint augustine no mines no riches no gold and silver as there are in new spain or mexico or whatever one may call it and no natives to enslave either hence no settlements lewrie asked damme we know that the dons are a lazy race but that lazy during the brief time i was allowed ashore sir lt westcott spoke up i asked the locals of what they knew of florida despite the strict rules the spanish have about trading only with spain only in spanish bottoms and very little intercolonial trade there was an illicit trade twixt bahamian merchants and florida so long as spain was neutral what i shouldve done lewrie chid himself but i was sunk deep in the bluedevils lookin up the past in the twenty years that we owned east and west florida after the seven years war lt westcott went on most of the aristocrats and wealthy landholders moved out to cuba or other spanish colonies leaving only the poor to remain and even after spain got it back at the end of the american revolution not all that many returned what remains are gathered round pensacola mobile perhaps a few in tampa bay and saint augustine and san marcos if you will note this great swamp on the chart sir theres a huge shallow lake the okeechobee westcott had to lean close to read the name then made a stab at its pronunciation below that is the everglades the local bahamians told me theres not ten spanish to the square mile above the lake and but one or two along the coast a catholic mission a pig farm and a few wild cattle or so and all of them as poor as church mice spanish trade monopoliesd support them did the system really work traders from here ship over shoddy goods and the spanish settlers in florida are glad to get them for theyve little else now down here along the coast sir behind the barrier isles and perhaps in the tamiami bay westcott continued running a finger down the soueast shore there are very small and incredibly poor fishing rancheros portuguese spanish runaway black slaves from up in american georgia even some halfbreed indians living daytoday off what they catch or truckgarden all they have to trade is fish and they cant do that without smoking them or curing them with bahamian salt the locals said some cubans have set up shop in the keys but they dont know if their settlements are permanent or just seasonal the sort of people whod leap at a chance to go privateering or turn outright pirate if they had decent vessels lt darling said with a laugh all the more reason to go have a look lewrie agreed and obtain ourselves a few more boats by hook or by crook between us weve only jolly boats gigs and a pair of launches last year in the channel i got some cutters and barges for work close inshore to france and the dockyards didnt get em all back but not enough to go round youll each need something larger to tow astern til needed if we have to land armed parties well keep an eye out for them now once weve done that my orders require me to sail on northwards and go into supposedly neutral american ports show the flag all that to the people who might be victualling enemy privateers or even arming them and buying their prizes on the sly once weve made our sweep up the coast as far as saint augustine which of you is senior he asked what are the dates of your commissions it turned out that lt darling of thorn predated lovett by seven months and bury by more than a year hope youre worth yer salt lewrie thought while putting on a gladsome face as he named lt darling to temporary command of the rest in his absence while wondering if the portly idlyaired fellow would prove suitable he still put lewrie too much in mind of forrester victualling and lastminute supplies tomorrow then weather permitting we sail the day after lewrie told them hopefully we are off on a grand and successful adventure amen sir lt lovett exclaimed port pass the port and topups all round lt darling cried a toast aye lt westcott eagerly proposed ahem if i may captain lewrie darling asked he held up his glass at lewries nodded assent confusion and death to the foes confusion and death they chorused before tossing back their drinks here ive another lt lovett insisted as the bottle made its way round again to close broadsides blood and prizemoney broadsides blood and prizemoney they roared and heres mine lewrie said he topped up his glass and let the bottle go past him then held his glass chinhigh as the others looked to him expectantly darling with his smug easy smile and his face flushed lovett with his dark eyes agleam and showing a crooked grin so piraticallooking that he might roar arrh and bury with a prim and grave expression heres to us none like us a band of bold british searovers lewrie intoned he would have said english but wasnt sure where his junior officers sprang from to us lewrie saw them off into their respective boats then took the night air on the quarterdeck they sound an eager lot sir westcott commented and hopefully a young but ferocious and canny lot mister westcott lewrie said with an easy smile though he did cross the fingers of his right hand along the seam of his breeches chapter seventeen once at sea onpassage towards the old bahama channel lewrie put his small squadron to exercises he placed reliant at the rear of a column inlineahead then signalled them to take stations in a column ahead and to windward or leeward of the frigate close aboard with only two cables separation as if they were entering an inlet or backoftheisland bay and expecting action with the ships with shallower draughts making the attack backed up by his heavier guns in the event that the squadron stumbled across a proper enemy warship they practiced sheering off from that formation on a bowandquarterline the lighter ships altering course together while reliant surged ahead to offer battle and thorn firefly and lizard could take the foe on from her unengaged side he made them practice wearing about in order of succession and letting reliant cover a withdrawal if the need arose to flee from a much stronger enemy squadron a special signal not in the popham code book could shake them out into a vee formation ahead of reliant s bows for general chase and they practiced that half of each morning besides the time for smallarms drill or exercising with the great guns was spent on manoeuvring before lewrie would allow yet another signal to be hoisted which would free them to dash ahead and to either beam out toward the horizons but still within decent signalling distance on the hunt im sure theyre gettin tired o this lewrie told westcott as the release soared aloft and he cocked his head back to watch as it was twoblockedbelow his broad pendant damme but that bit o bunting looks hellishfine he thought i could almost get used to it until spanish florida was scoured free of privateering or reliant was ordered to other duties he was his own man on his own bottom his next orders from admiralty might put him back under a real commodore or in some rearadmirals squadron or fleet and reliant would be chained to a column of third rates to plod along like a dutiful elephant calf i think not sir westcott assured him bestowing one of his savagely brief grins theyre doing something useful for once and acting like real man o warsmen id imagine theyre revelling in it getting a shot at serving under an officer with a reputation for fighting made knight and baronet for courage well hmm lewrie grudgingly allowed it was not the false modesty that he usually felt necessary but real for a rare once serving a man with a broad pendant other than their former commodore too hmm westcott slyly added now now mister westcott lewrie gently chid him we cannot disparage our seniors or fellow officers even if one of them is the laziest most useless sod in all creation with the wits of a flea and the manners of a boar hog it just aint on he laughed savouring the hour of sailing when he had at last hoisted his broad pendant and had wondered what francis forrester was spluttering at the sight had he gone puce in the face cursed and stamped his feet in rage lewrie certainly hoped that he had he strolled to the binnacle cabinet to fetch his own telescope and peered forward past the spread of the inner outer and flying jibs to watch his three small ships scuttling away now free of manoeuvring exercises and allowed free chase til sundown no wonder the pirates of old had prized the jamaican or bermudan sloops for they were fast and weatherly thorn firefly and lizard had spread more sail and were already more than a mile off in the short time since he had released them by noon sights they could be out on the horizon with only topsails showing ill be below for a bit before noon sights mister westcott lewrie told the first officer he barely made it to the bottom of the windward ladderway when he heard a series of yips and barks and spotted a shaggy tanandwhite dog dashing for him its longhaired tail whipping where did that come from lewrie snapped mister westcott dont know sir lt westcott answered looking down to the ships waist from the quarterdeck nettings the dog whined and circled round lewrie tongue lolling with what could be deemed a grin on its face bounding up on its hind legs as if to encourage petting well he wasnt aboard when we left england nor bermuda lewrie snapped the dog was sniffing at his boots and knee buttons it barked once more then sat on its haunches for a brief moment before leaping once more silly bastard lewrie growled where the devil did you spring from hey he was answered with a whiny yahyeow and another bound he put out a hand to pat it on its head and the next second the hound had both paws on his chest as high as it could reach grinning fit to bust and squirming with joy to be petted oh ah lewrie looked forward to the hatchway to the gundeck and saw midshipmen munsell and rossyngton looking extremely sheepish did you bring this dog aboard young sirs lewrie snapped sir hes ahh the mascot of our mess sir rossyngton answered after a gulp or two get down bisquit here boy the dog looked up adoringly at lewries face gave him a look as if to say see you later and bounded off to the midshipmen you two snuck this dog aboard lewrie asked putting on his stern face without permission found it starving on the streets of nassau did you and took pity oh no sir rossyngton corrected he came off the mersey sir it was her midshipmen that found him first but their captain and officers ordered him gone theyve a pack of hunting dogs aboard well half a dozen or so and didnt want a cur mounting their bitches when they came in heat put him back ashore twice sir but mersey s mids always found a way to sneak him back aboard munsell breathlessly added honest to god sir their captain was so angry theyd done so that he ordered bisquit drowned in a sack sir and it was take him as our mascot or see him killed that sounds like forrester lewrie thought in sudden anger he always was a cruel bastard he and his officers hunt on shore a lot do they lewrie asked it would seem so sir rossyngton told him petting the dog which was pressing and nuzzling at his free hand for attention well feed him from our rations sir hell be no bother midshipman munsell assured thatll be the day lewrie scoffed the midshipmens messd eat hay and kindling wood to get their fill even double rations are not enough for growing lads thats why you purchase millers from the jackinthebreadroom nothin more satisfyin than roast rat thats fed on bisquit oatmeal and flour lewrie recalled from his own younger days and just how much meat there was on one as good as squirrel any day once the hide dusted as white as a grist mill worker or baker was removed the purser nor the cook either will issue you a mouthful more than your proper due lewrie warned them you couldnt keep body and soul together for yourselves much less support him bisquit sir rossyngton reiterated we were going to name him bandit for his mask and muzzle sir but munsell stuck in was it possible that the dog somehow knew that its fate was being decided it came forward from the mids to sit at lewries feet and peer up its standandfall cocked ears perked lewrie could see why theyd almost named it bandit for its muzzle was much darker fur approaching black and there was a dark streak across its forehead and eyes with the eyes themselves outlined in white fur it whined and lifted one paw to touch lewries knee male is he not going to come in heat lewrie asked aye sir a male munsell replied sounding more hopeful theres worse creatures carried aboard ships i suppose we had a mongoose the marines had found aboard my old frigate proteus lewrie allowed captain speaks and his damned parrot hell need meat he cant live on porridge cheese and wormed bisquit lewrie looked about the deck in thought noting that his crew seemed to be hanging on his decision as well he was the victim of a pacific mutiny a friendly and playful dog would be the pet of the entire ship not just the midshipmens mess and they were all aware of its presence days before whats the harm lewrie asked himself til we can obtain more ive jerked meat and hard sausages for my cats aft lewrie said at last i can contribute to feeding him somewhat as im sure the ships people will be willing to hand over beef and pork bones stead of casting them over the side thank you sir munsell exclaimed god help ye ye flearidden mutt but i suppose youre ours lewrie decided leaning down to pet the dog which set off a frenzied and playful reaction it even rolled over to have its belly rubbed well take good care of him sir and he wont be in the way rossyngton vowed just keep him off the quarterdeck and away from my cats lewrie cautioned aye aye sir lewrie gave it one last patting then went aft to the door to his greatcabins no bisquit he heard munsell say lewrie turned back to see the dog squatting to take a shit in gratitude and clean all that up lewrie barked chapter eighteen days later reliant and her little squadron struck the coast of cuba and the old bahama channel near bahia de nuevitas and turned westnorwesterly to run up the deeps of the channel skirting close ashore of spanish cuba keeping an eye out for enemy shipping or privateers lewrie regretted that he didnt have enough bottoms to maintain a close blockade of the cuban coast for as columbus had discovered long before there were hundreds of places for privateers or warships to lurk behind the fringe cays and in the many pocket harbours and bays that stretched from nuevitas almost to havana there was bahia de jiguey fronted and shielded from the sea by cayo guajaba cayo cruz and cayo romano bahia de perros was also fronted by cayo coco to the west of cayo romano even further west lay bahia de buena vista and cayo santa maria and cayo fragoso to satisfy his curiosity and to assure that french and spanish privateers were not using those havens lewrie took his squadron west up the nicholas channel well south of cay sal bank along the long scattering of the archipielago de sabana which consisted of umpteen hundreds of cays with so many channels and inlets between them that a foe could dash from one end to the next and pick any he wished to make an escape and by the time that they had peeked into bahia de santa clara bahia de cardenas and cayo blanco lewrie was even further convinced that cubas north coast badly needed patrolling he had not seen another british warship in all that time not til they came level with the much larger and deeper bahia de matanzas and the approaches to havana did they come across a pair of sloops of war which stood off to form a weak blockading force letters to admiralty soonest lewrie determined my lords may i humbly submit and all that blather hmm fire one off to forrester too and if he dont act on it he just might end up appearin damned idle and dangerously remiss his shallowdraught ships had cruised as close to the coast as they could go and the biggest vessels they had reported had been two or three twomasted fishing boats no bigger than fifty feet or so overall and they had quickly scuttled through the nearest inlets to shelter behind the cays perhaps they were coastal traders from havana or matanzas that peddled needles and thread and such to the scattered and isolated coastal or island villages lewrie imagined that spain had never put much money back into her colonies after extracting so much wealth if there was one decent road the whole length of cubas north shore he would be mightily surprised plus it was a given that cartage by road in mule or oxdrawn waggons was much slower than carriage by sea and the tonnage of goods shipped was always greater aboard a merchantman what else had his sloops reported dozens and dozens of fishing boats everything from small jolly boatsized rowboats to onemasted launches all of them scrofulous in the extreme but capable of panicky speed on their dashes to shelter behind the cays some in so much fear that they had abandoned their buoyed nets though the squadron still was in need of more boats they had not been able to capture any the best they had done was to upset a few poor traders schedules and ruin a great many fishermens catches all in all perhaps prowling the coast of florida was the easier task lewrie concluded after comparing charts of the coasts while he was sure that someone would have to pay a closer watch on cuba lewrie was a bit relieved that that someone would not be him that would be a task worthy of hercules with eagleeyed argus thrown in for good measure it isnt well surveyed at all sir mr caldwell the sailing master glumly informed lewrie as the squadron stood in close to scout key west once behind the cay i doubt even firefly could find sufficient depth of water and the charts upon which we depend are copies made from spanish charts sir lt westcott added and god only knows how long ago the dons drew them up and whats changed in the meantime even without his telescope lewrie could see the changes in the colours of the waters there were steelblue patches indicating deep water surrounded by brighter aquamarine with the aquamarine shading to bright green or milky jadegreen nearer the shore of the key the waves that broke upon it that early morning seemed as lazy as a winddriven lakes waves there was no real beach unless one deemed rocks and pebbles and gravel a beach it was very pretty though which was about the best that could be said about it masthead lewrie yelled through a brass speakingtrumpet at the lookouts in the crosstrees any settlements ashore shacks sir midshipman munsell yelled back only a few shacks theres no one about no boats to be seen looks abandoned sir from the crosstrees high aloft lewrie expected that munsell could almost see clear across the island to the far shore for it was very lowlying its mean elevation only a few feet above the hightide mark god tis only the really poor and demented whod live here lewrie thought hmm lt westcott said with his mouth screwed to one corner its not even the first of april yet sir perhaps the itinerants dont winter over and theyre not ready to start their fishing season yet or theyve crossed back over to cuba for easter mr caldwell opined papist spaniards put a lot of stock in easter end of lent and all that fiestas dancing swilling and stuffing their faces with whatever they gave up in penance aye cleansed and free to sin all over again lt westcott scoffed beyond the shallows back of the island chain though lewrie speculated the florida bay is deep enough to admit vessels with moderate draught right mister caldwell aye sir caldwell cautiously agreed its broad enough here to allow privateers easy access to open seas and stays broad right up to key largo lewrie pointed out if a privateer captain wished he might be able to find a pass through these little isles to that deep water either end of key largo it seems he went on crossing to the chart pinned to the traverse board by the compass binnacle cabinet forward of the helm here at the west end of largo or the north end near isla morada or even take the pass into the bay that lies to the noreast of isla morada a privateer of very moderate draught sir caldwell warned perhaps sir westcott suggested were we to take reliant into the florida bay and scout up the inside of the island chain whilst our smaller ships each form a blocking force at the passes and inlets if theres anyone lurking back there wed be the beaters and thorn firefly and lizard could form the firing line like going after grouse or pheasant and do we flush a wild boar reliant gets the kill lewrie asked with a brow up something like that sir aye westcott agreed most slyly lewrie bent over to peer more closely at the chart the florida bay began deep enough for reliant deep enough for even a third rate ship of the line but it did turn shallow as one made way easterly up the chain of islets it was a tempting idea but there seemed to be no exit if need arose unless one put the ship about and returned to key west and round it out into the florida straits once more leaving the lighter ships on their own should they stumble over a wellarmed threat lewrie shared a look with the sailing master who gravely shook his head in an almost imperceptible no if we do spot someone hiding behind the islets well find a way tget at em mister westcott lewrie decided but id not wish tleave the rest of the squadron on their own for that long mister rossyngton signal to the squadron to alter course to the noreast aye sir am i goin tregret that decision lewrie asked himself but i cant abandon the little ships hands to the braces and sheets mister westcott and be ready to put about lewrie ordered as he paced forward to the full hammock stanchions and nets at the break of the quarterdeck aye sir lt westcott replied as crisply as if his suggestion had never been broached as the hands of the watch made ready to free the braces and the sheets to take the winds on a new point of sail lewrie caught sight of his cats making a beeline up the starboard ladderway to the quarterdeck in rather a hurry he noted with their tails bottled up and their bellies low to the oak planks for a brief second he reckoned that they were playing tailchase or were coming to see him but not a second later here came the damned dog yelping merrily in close pursuit spry chalky even slower and clumsier toulon gained the top of the hammock nettings canvas covers in a flash and dug their claws in so they could arch their backs turn sideways in threat and moan and hiss in anger bisquit loped up and began to bark his bushy tail wagging damn my eyes whatd i say about keepin him off the quarterdeck or scarin the cats lewrie snapped down you down and stop yer bloody gob bisquit stood on his hind legs front paws on the nettings to reach them safely just short of some tentative claw swipes down i said lewrie barked down and hush the dog sat down looking at lewrie then up at the cats his tongue lolling and damned if the silly thing didnt look like he was grinning he uttered a few encouraging woof s at the cats who would have none of it of course hissing moaning spitting and hunkering hands are at stations sir lt westcott reported very well sir lewrie said looking further afield make the execute mister rossyngton in succession thorn lizard and firefly put about to the noreast to continue skirting up the keys once they were all steady and their sails trimmed lewrie ordered reliant put about as well so that the three smaller ships formed a line ahead and to larboard with the frigate standing further out to sea of them mister rossyngton lewrie snapped sir right timid that now there are no signals to be made for the moment i wish you to see this lewrie began the dog made a last playful leap at the hammock nettings then turned to trot to lewrie nuzzling under a hand for attention ahem i wish you tsee this dog off the quarterdeck ask the bosun for a length of line to make a leash or tether for him so he cant romp up the ladderways again aye sir rossyngton replied the dog was licking his hand grinning upwards playfully and licking lewries hand despite the sternness hed intended lewrie found himself scratching him behind the ears which elicited another goofy tonguelolling grin go on now ye daft thing lewrie growled get below and stay there hear me midshipman rossyngton took the dog by the collar and led him to the top of the ladderway then down to the ships waist a whine or two of complaint and a longing look or two at the cats on top of the hammock nettings perhaps at lewrie or the denied expanse of the quarterdeck and bisquit suffered to be led forward his tail held low it appears he likes you sir lt westcott commented damn what he likes lewrie rejoined going to the nettings to placate his cats there there lads he cooed threats over and ye wont be eaten he reached out to stroke them but both chalky and toulon spat and hissed at him they would not settle down and flatten their tail fur til theyd seen the dog securely tethered to the bottom of the boarding pikes stored upright round the main mast only then did they allow lewrie to stroke them and pet them the cats seemed to gloat whilst the dog lay down with his head on his forepaws looking up at them one last hiss to get their message across and the cats sat up and began to groom themselves ill uh be below in my cabins for a bit mister westcott you have the watch lewrie said clearing his throat and hoping that his ears werent turning red in embarassment aye aye sir westcott answered sounding as if there was a slight smirk deeply hidden as lewrie reached the foot of the ladderway the dog perked up in hopes but bosun sprague was by his side kneeling down to stroke and knead an aint ye a fine dog now aint ye bisquit the bosun was cooing in a very uncharacteristic voice one which made sailors turn and gawp sprague was more used to bellowing at them than he was to speak softly christ now sprague s dotin on the silly beast lewrie thought this ships turnin into a schoolyard full o boys chapter nineteen a great many of the islets in the keys were little more than hammocks of dry land a few feet above the sea some as small as tennis courts and covered so thickly with mangroves that it was hard to tell where the sand ended and the sea began and birds were the only inhabitants they were easy for the little squadron to pass by on their slow jog up the archipelago the larger isles though despite the urge to rush on lewrie felt it necessary to land shore parties to inspect them if anything that resembled a settlement appeared a clearing the sight of farm crops or the presence of domestic animals near the beaches the landings pleased reliant s marine officer lt simcock right down to his toes since they gave him a splendid excuse to exercise his men away from the ship and relieve the boredom of the daily routine frankly the frigates sailors and the hands aboard the smaller ships relished it too for it was a change of pace with the prospect of discovering something useful or edible married with the hint of danger and action strange fruits came back aboard the ships now and then a small deer or wild hog or some domestic chickens abandoned at a tumbledown collection of shacks and they did find settlements of a sort from the few who did not flee in fear they found ragged remnants of the oncefeared calusa indians some spaniards frenchmen and englishmen gone native along with runaway black slaves even some few muskogee indians with itchy feet driven from georgia and alabama by hordes of american settlers the muskogee had a name for those who would not stay in one place for long they called them seminoliwanderers they lived on fish on squash and beans and maize corn and had chickens and pigs they had some muskets but were always short of lead and powder and depended on the bow and arrow their homes were little more than leantos or raised roofed sleeping platforms in the native style and their boats were hollowedout mahogany logs a few who could actually speak a little english said that they feared the spaniards who came up from cuba to fish for they were not above slavecatching privateers big boats none of them could say further up to the east perhaps there might be closer to what was left of the old mayami tribe they might know any luck ashore mister merriman lewrie asked as the third officer stepped through the entryport after a scramble up the boarding battens same song a different verse sir sorry to say merriman reported knuckling the brim of his hat in casual salute the few we saw are poor as churchmice their settlements on the bay side so it took a while to row round to it hello bisquit happy to see me back here boy i brought you a pig bone the dog seemingly adored every man jack in the crew whining in longing whenever the marine parties and boat crews some of the mids or one of the officers manned the boats and rowed off then went into paroxyms of joy at their return the settlement lewrie prompted a bit fancier than most sir merriman replied beaming at the sight of the dog trotting round the ships waist to show his bone off to everybody about a dozen huts but made from sawn planks for floors and walls roofed with palmetto though the flats were so shallow that we had some trouble finding a way to the bay side so by the time we arrived theyd all scampered into the bush but for a few of the oldest and not one of them knew a word of english or french or my poor spanish sir and the bay as far as we could see was empty good morning sir marine lieutenant simcock happily said as his boat came alongside and he made the climb to the deck simcock was turned out in sunday divisions best as if ready for inspection right down to the highly polished silver gorget hung on a chain high on his chest though his boots looked muddy and caked with sand good morning sir lewrie said answering his salute with a slight doff of his own hat anything that caught your eye ashore not all that much sir simcock said with a cocky grimace of dismissal unless you wished a new iron cook pot or a painted clay one whoever the poor people are who live there i pity them seems a shame really the natural beauty of these isles puts one in mind of the greek tales about the land of the lotus eaters yet theres nothing there to live on theres those little gardens merriman pointed out little bigger than irish lazy beds though and the soil is too thin and sandy lt simcock countered oh one thing that i did notice sir is the lack of water wells i cant recall seeing a one on any of the islands weve scouted aye come to think on it i cant say that i saw any wells at all either lt merriman quickly agreed brightening sir he said to lewrie weve found barrels and large clay pots round the houses with hollowedout halfround sluices to catch rainwater runoff from the planked rooves there are no freshwater springs or wells havent seen any yet sir lt simcock added thats not to say that there arent some on the larger isles closer to the mainland but he said heaving off a large shrug yes hello bisquit im back safely good fellow want a pig bone bisquit leaped wagged his tail and his hindquarters in rapture and pranced round the weather deck to show off his new one no wells no springs no privateerin lairs then lewrie speculated a decentsized ship could lurk round here for a time with full water casks but theyd have to go somewhere else to replenish the only thing they could find here would be firewood and a hog or two so searching the keys would be a waste of time sir merriman asked sounding a tad disappointed lt simcock looked downcast too as if the both of them had been having fun ashore and would hate to see their excursions end from what i saw during the revolution lewrie told them and what ive read of florida the mainland is rich with lakes rivers and streams privateers could base themselves on the far side of florida bay but thats too far from the straits for quick springs upon merchant ships and did french or spanish privateers base themselves on the mainland side of florida bay they would have a long passage out round key west and the marquesas keys to get to their cruising grounds and a long passage back with prizes lewrie realised damme i mightve been right the first time he congratulated himself florida bays a sack a place where a privateerd be trapped if a force like ours came along theyre a greedy lot but no one ever said privateers are stupid no well be thorough lewrie said at last to his officers a few days more and well reach the end of the keys and strike the mainland damme no springs or wells then what does the wildlife do for water the wild hogs deer birds and such even sea birds need to drink now and again wait for a downpour sir lt merriman posed so far weve seen goodly showers each afternoon and there would be shallow puddles left behind them for a while as for the wild people who dwell here i suppose they can dance for rain like the indians and catch them a barrel or two of runoff there are clouds gathering on the horizon even as we speak sir seems a horrid waste really lt simcock commented these wee isles appear idyllic but one would have to be pretty desperate to live here for long alluring and all but not worth a tuppenny shit for white men who knows though arnold merriman said did one dig a deep well and strike fresh water one could go as native as a tahitian in the great south seas though it dont look promising for barebreasted dancing girls in grass skirts simcock quipped fanning himself with his hat invite mister westcott to go native with you merriman chirped and hell turn them up in a dog watch it comes to women hes your boy carry on sirs lewrie said hiding a smirk and returning to the quarterdeck to fetch his telescope he peered at lizard firefly and thorn which lay to anchor close by their boats were also coming offshore emptyhanded it appeared well lt bury was studying something that might have been a horseshoe crab with a large magnifying glass no hed call it a trilobite lewrie thought lewrie lowered his telescope and turned to gaze out to sea a bank of darker clouds was gathering as the heat of the day grew threatening yet another afternoon shower or two four or five miles out from their anchorage a slim glasswhite waterspout was slowly snaking down to thrash the bright green waters to a froth yet another nighdaily occurrence since they had entered the florida straits and had begun their slow inspection of the keys mister grainger lewrie called after turning to note which lad was the midshipman of the watch on the quarterdeck hoist captains repair on board grand places tlurk but not to base lewrie thought unless ye fetch along all thats needful might as well be at sea he went to the compass binnacle cabinet afore the helm to roll open one of the sailing masters dubious charts of the area to look closely at the great bay at the north end of the keys yes it was as he remembered it from a first perusal there were rios feeding into the bay and rivers meant fresh water in abundance time for a conference lewrie determined and time for a change of plans some midnight boatwork to scout the bay out before we go barging in chapter twenty false dawn had broadened the circle of visibility from the decks and the mastheads revealing low shorelands and forests and the broad bay into which the squadron crept under reduced sail the winds were light but steady bringing the scents of sand flats and marsh of woods and growing things and the faintest hint of flowers ready to open to the first rays of the sun when the actual dawn came the waters of the great bay at the end of the keys were very calm with no chop or whitecaps and slackwater waves no more than one or two feet high so the bow waves and wakes of the four warships barely whitened to foam and they all rode upright with only a slight angle of heel to the winds the smaller three preceded reliant by only half a mile spread in lineabreast with thorn and her shortranged carronades closest to the larboard shore weaker gunned firefly in the centre and lizard on the starboard corner trust to the leadsmen in the chains reliant s sailing master mr caldwell said in a low voice as those sailors called back a depth of six fathoms if not completely in these ancient spanish charts i doubt the dons ever contemplated a proper settlement this far south of saint augustine sir so how meticulous the first perhaps the only surveyors were in such a malarial place right on the edge of a great swamp well neither did british surveyors in the twentyodd years we held florida mister caldwell lewrie pointed out the latest charts of the bay and the shallow passage between a string of long barrier islands and the mainland or the mouth of the river which fed into the bay were an amalgam of old spanish work and some sketchy surveys done between and though both doubted if much had been done to update them once the american revolution had begun in before there had been no urgency and once england was at war there had been no need to correct maps done of such a minor insignificant colony so far from the main scenes of action mayami tamiami lt westcott posed with a brow up in puzzlement i suppose we should call it something sir mayami perhaps for the local tribe lewrie speculated signal from lizard sir midshipman warburton called down to the deck from his perch at the top of the starboard mainmast shrouds almost to the futtocks of themain top two vessels to starboard and ahead anchored and theres the settlement dead ahead sir lt westcott pointed out the cookfires we saw last night are still burning right where the river joins the bay aye lewrie said just heave a net dip a bucket and theres your breakfast and teawater damme do they look as asleep as i think they look two signals mister eldridge he barked in rising excitement the first to thorn make her number and engage shore by the larboard halliards aye sir eldridge replied turning to the ratings of the afterguard who stood by the transom flag lockers and fumbling with his illustrated lists of signals to call out the right numerals might be hard to read in this light sir westcott warned but streamin to loord in plain sight lewrie countered and if darling kens the half of it he may get my intent for now crack on a bit more sail mister westcott and lets close up within hailing distance just in case let fall the fore course and hoist the foretopmast stays and outer flying jib lewrie turned to see eldridge and the signalmen just then bending on the last code flag to the halliard they were slow or eldridge was not yet familiar with the duty but he could not goad him to haste yet eldridge seemed to blush and sped his men to hoist away lewrie lifted his gaze to watch the signal soar aloft then took a few steps aft to tell eldridge once thorn shows the affirmative or the repeat strike thatun and the second signal will be to firefly and lizard their numbers general chase and engage the enemy more closely on the starboard halliards if ye please aye aye sir eldridge replied very formally as if expecting criticism damme weve finally something tshoot at lewrie chortled putting eldridge at ease and raising a smile the light winds were just abaft of abeam so the string of code flags to thorn stood out a bit limply to larboard legible if the sky brightened a bit more after a long moments wait from thorn sir warburton shouted the affirmative strike larboard for the execute eldridge ordered his signalmen new hoist ready to starboard ready hoist away smartly lt bury in lizard and lt lovett in firefly must have been expecting such an order perhaps longing for one for each rapidly put up the single flag for affirmative and began to spread more sail angling off to starboard to close the suspicious anchored ships almost before reliant s hoist had been twoblocked well fall in trail position aft of firefly mister westcott lewrie snapped mister spendlove he called down to the waist aye sir open the starboard gunports and run out lewrie gleefully told him and stand by to engage at close range the gun crews gave out a loud inarticulate growl of approval as the port lids were raised and the guncaptains summoned the boy powder monkeys from amidships with the first charges of propellant a minute or two later the sun burst above the eastern horizon and all that had been murky and illdefined stood out starkly forests and beachtrimmed shores the meagre clutch of shacks and large canvas tents ashore near the mouth of the river and the anchored ships now could be seen in detail no flags showing on the anchored ships yet sir lt westcott noted both of them were twomasted either topsail schooners or bermudan or jamaican sloops neither much longer than lizard or firefly with their jibbooms and bowsprits steeved closer to the horizontal than was the usual fashion in merchant ships or purposebuilt warships their hulls were so dark that they were almost black with narrow hull stripes on the nearest was a dark blue stripe and on the furthest an odd bluegrey their masts were raked aft a bit more than usual as if they followed the american shipbuilding fashion aha wakeywakey lewrie snickered after he lifted his telescope and spotted men popping up on their decks dashing about in confusion as if ordered to man their guns make sail and cut their anchor cables all at the same time but they had no time just bloody beautiful lewrie exulted them the bay everything the bay was an artists palette of dark greens aquas and jade sparkling in the dawn light like a field of gems and the trap hed sprung note in the log mister caldwell lewrie called over to the sailing master that lizard and firefly opened upon the near vessel at a quarter til six am damme thats well done lewrie appreciatively thought as lizard the slightly stronger ship in weight of metal stood up to the nearest sloop and wheeled to lay abeam of her at a range of a single cable before she opened fire off the sloops starboard bows sails reduced and making a slow steerage way so lt burys gunners might be able to get off a second or third broadside in passing firefly followed in her wake wheeling abeam in succession to add her four starboard pounders a bit later at such close range it was almost impossible to miss shotsplashes rose closeaboard the sloops waterline and roundshot punched holes below the sloops row of gunports and smashed chunks from her bulwarks staggering her masts a few of the first sloops gunports swung up and stubby gun muzzles appeared as some were run out but only two fired aimlessly before a scramble began to her unengaged side as her crew abandoned the fight leaping over the larboard rails for their boats or a long swim to the beach carry on bury carry on lewrie yelled as if his voice would reach that far hoping that the little twoship column could engage the second sloop before she could prepare herself for battle were almost at a cables range of the first sir westcott judged aloud my compliments to mister spendlove and hes to open upon her the instant he deems it feasible mister westcott lewrie ordered quite looking forward to the thunder and clouds of powder smoke aye aye sir westcott replied hoy mister spendlove the second sloop had managed to cut her single anchor cable and was paying off leeward as her crew got up a jib and her main foreandaft gaff sail very slowly sagging and swinging her bows towards the leading british ship lizard bad luck for her for all that was doing was presenting her weak bow scantlings to a rake and closing the range to her own mauling as you bear by broadside fire lt spendlove shouted waiting for the decks to pause on the faint scend and the uproll when it was level and still the range was about a quartermile to the first sloop when the first of reliant s broadsides lit off pounder bow chase gun all the starboard pounders the quarterdeck pounders even the pounder carronades with their elevating screws fully down and their muzzles lifted to the fullest safe elevation the pounders of the smaller ships had nipped and bitten the anchored sloop but reliant s broadside was an iron avalanche just before the thick bank of spent powder smoke blotted out their view lewrie got a quick glimpse of bulwarks and upper planking shattering in dusty clouds of splinters and chunks of large irregular holes blossoming in her sides and of both masts and topsl yards coming apart in darting zigzags of jagged ruin as the guns were swabbed and the recoil and runout tackle overhauled the light winds wafted the reeking powder smoke alee to larboard giving lewrie a clearer view with his dayglass i dont think shell be needin another broadside lewrie said chuckling the target was dismasted almost level with where the tops of her bulwarks had been if they hadnt been blown to kindling there were several holes in her upper and lower hull planking and a large one just by her waterline if anyone was still aboard her they were out of sight lizard and firefly were engaging the further sloop which by then was helplessly bowson to their fire bury and lovett had closed the range to the point that even their swivel guns were yapping like terriers that sloop was being sieved with shot whats thorn doing lewrie wondered stepping over to the lee rails to get a better look the smoke from his ships guns and the guns of the smaller ships had mingled and accumulated rapidly held together perhaps by the earlymorning humidity making a thick and drifting haze ahead and to larboard but he could make out thorn as she stood in close to the shore and the river mouth and that encampment beam onto reliant she was wreathed in smoke from her stubby but powerful carronades beyond her trees and bushes writhed the large tents and shelters were being whipped away and thorn must have hit something explosive for there was a burst of flame and a thick cloud of dark smoke and a shower of hot sparks that set even more of the camp afire ehm captain sir mr caldwell cautioned its getting a tad shallow for us perhaps aye mister caldwell lewrie replied mister westcott lay us two points alee into the deeper water to loord mister spendlove were falling off alee serve that second sloop as best you can quoins out a bit lt spendlove instructed his guncaptains and aim small lads ready the battery on the uproll by broadside fire the second sloop was almost bowson to reliant with firefly and lizard standing well clear beyond her by then the range would be closer to half a mile and the target narrow but the broadside roared out already damaged that sloop shivered like a stand of saplings to the weight and fury of the frigates hail of roundshot her jibboom bowsprit and foremast were scythed away and misses frothed the waters close aboard her drop it mister spendlove deadun lewrie shouted down to the waist jeering in the vernacular of the ratpit to urge a terrier to go kill another cease fire and secure beyond the shattered sloops there were several rowing boats all pulling madly for the far shore or the long strip of barrier islands like a gaggle of panicked ducks ye might have to spell this out mister eldridge but make to lizard and firefly their numbers and take prisoners oh eager lads he thought a moment later even as the signal was being assembled for lt bury in lizard was already leading her consort in pursuit sailing much faster than the boats could be rowed heading them off from escape belay mister eldridge it seems its bein done lewrie said turning to share a grin with lt westcott then crossing over to the other side of the deck to see what thorn was up to lt darling had taken his ship past the encampment almost to the mouth of the river before coming about to fire with her larboard battery near the eyes of the wind for a bit sails shivering or laid aback before paying off sutherly when she was done there was little sign that the camp had been there but for the burning smouldering ruin of the shacks and tents and a new clearing littered with felled trees and uprooted bushes mister westcott id admire did ye bring our head round into the wind and fetchto and have all the boats manned marines too to take possession of the prizes and scout the camp aye aye sir then well find out just who and what weve captured lewrie said with a broad grin chapter twentyone the engagement had been great fun but a short delight after came a myriad of details and reports questions and tasks to be seen to which took all the joy of it for lewrie lt simcock returned with half of his fortyman marine complement from the encampment to report that he his marines and sailors from thorn had tallied up the dead set fire to the last of the foodstuff and supplies ashore then come away before suffering any casualties of their own it looked as if there might have been fifty or sixty or so ashore when we attacked sir we found about fifteen dead but the rest ran off into the forests and it appeared that they did so under arms pistols and muskets and such we scavenged what weapons left behind but he ended with a shrug theres nothing left of any worth to the survivors sir lt darling proudly related i and my people saw to that theyll not have a single drop of rum wine or beer either we ah appropriated a few kegs and scuttled the rest sir you didnt find any american corn whisky did you lewrie took time to ask no pity then it was lt merriman midshipmen entwhistle and warburton and the bosun mr sprague and his mate mr wheeler who came back aboard from the captured prizes with their reports they are both spanish sir lt merriman told the assembled officers thatun yonder is the escorpion he said pointing to the first sloop and the second is named the santa doratea both are from havana each armed with ten guns most of the guns bear proof marks from cuba some from cadiz though there are some oddsandsods a few french dutch or even one british tell me theyre privateers lewrie urged with the fingers of his right hand crossed behind his thigh oh privateers right enough sir lt merriman said with a beamish grin we found their registries and their letters of marque and reprisal signed by the captaingeneral of cuba along with their muster books all told there were nigh an hundred and eighty men and officers though not all were aboard when we engaged them ive their papers and muster books sir lewries clerk mr james faulkes interrupted shall i stow them in your cabins sir aye atop the desk for now thankee faulkes lewrie said are they worth salvaging mister sprague he asked the bosun pish sir sprague scoffed begging pardon long enough to go to the nearest spitkid and hock up his wornout bite of chewtobacco theyre both hulled clean through aloft and alow dismasted and what little spare spars and such the dons had aboard are smashed to boot we got em reanchored so they dont drift ashore but sure as fate theyll both be on the bottom in a few hours and fotheringd be a waste o time sir and thatd be a cryin pity for one of em is made o cuban mahogany and do ye maintain her proper shed last for ages kept nigh bristolfashion abovedecks sir wheeler added but all donnish below all trash and filth damned idle spaniards mister mainwaring said to inform you sir that he counted four dead and two badly wounded aboard escorpion and six dead and five wounded aboard the santa doratea he and the surgeons mates are tending to them but he suspects that three of the wounded will pass before dusk he asks whether you wished the wounded be brought aboard reliant sir aye before both ships sink out from under them lewrie decided you lads row over to the prizes and help the surgeon and his mates fetch the wounded spaniards off he said to the mids if theyre not worth tuppence as prizes we might as well scuttle them mister sprague id admire did ye see to speeding their destruction along pile up flammables lay trains to their powder magazines all that how many hands will you need for that no more than the boats crews ttake us over sir the bosun reckoned we can start right away once their wounded are off the prizes see to it lewrie told him and ill let you know when to set them alight oh well sir lt darling of thorn said with a resigned sigh it seems all well reap will be head and gun money with nought from their condemnations and sales but that would have tbe done at the admiralty prize court at nassau sir lewrie countered grinning wryly where wed mostlike end up owing money to the proctors even if they were scrupulously honest which i very much doubt and besides do ye really wish to be back at nassau for any reason a point well taken captain lewrie sir lt darling smirked hoy the boat midshipman grainger hailed to a new arrival now bloody what lewrie grumbled to himself thinking that did victory have an hundred parents why was he the only one home to deal with the minutiae and clean up the mess he was missing breakfast permission to come aboard was the reply it was lt bury from lizard lewrie crossed to the starboard side to peer down at him and waved him a welcome good lord mister bury wherever did ye find that ugly barge lewrie gawped bury was not in his usual smartly painted gig but in a thirtyfoot something which by the fact that it floated could be loosely construed to be a boat slabsided without the sweet curves of a proper boatwright with a vertical stem post and bow no sweep to its sheerline or gunnls and appeared to be hardchined aft and shallowdraught perhaps even flatbottomed the stern was a vertical slab and all in all put lewrie in mind of a slice of wooden pie worst of all someone had once painted it skyblue but that paint had peeled and blistered and chalked to the point that its colour was dingy grey i shall not stand upon my dignity sir bury called up from the bottom of the boarding battens as his bow man hooked onto the main channel though you might extend honours to my prisoner he claims to be the captain of the escorpion all gilt and beshit compliments to the loser lewrie thought side party mister grainger lewrie ordered as he stared at the stranger beside bury a fellow with long and lank black hair tied back into a loose queue a swarthy complexion and a neatly trimmed mustachio and beard i do not claim i am the fellow snapped thank christ hes some english lewrie thought i doubt weve no more than five spanish speakers in the entire squadron there was a snag to the welcomeaboard rite though both the bosun and bosuns mate had already departed in the cutters and only marine lt simcock was wearing a sword and his boots were caked with sand and mud lewries coxn liam desmond who traditionally wore a silver call as his badge of office hastily stepped in to pipe their prisoner aboard that worthy ably scrambled up the battens to stand in the entryport and brusquely doff his widebrimmed straw hat with what seemed proud contempt welcome aboard his britannic majestys ship reliant sir and my condolences upon your loss lewrie said doffing his own hat with a bit more graciousness than the prisoner evinced sir may i name to you captain alexandro calderon captain of the privateer sloop le escorpion lt bury gravely intoned managing to make it alehandro with an iberian flourish to the ships name captain calderon the commanding officer of our squadron captain sir alan lewrie baronet and captain of the reliant frigate black eyes flashed at him and the spaniard tossed his head to jerk up his chin as if impatient with such honourable formalities eet ees my regret senor capitano loo looree that i am weethout a sword to offer to jou een surrender eef jou do not mind but eef i was at sea jou would never have catch me none of jour leetle sloops certainly not jour beeg frigata le escorpion ees as fast as the wind then i suppose i should be grateful that we caught you and your consort at anchor and asleep senor calderon lewrie drolly replied bestowing upon the spaniard his best shiteating grin irksome bastard he thought and can any bloody foreigner say my name right i see by your papers that your homeport is havana senor lewrie continued as was the santa doratea the name of her captain escapes me don juan emilio narvaez si calderon said looking as if he wished to spit on the deck to cleanse his mouth of foulness then may i assume that it was he who decided to anchor here in the bay lewrie asked that this narvaez was in charge si calderon snapped scowling jou say jou have my papers my letters of marque prove that we are legitimate corsarios so jou must respect that and treat us weeth the rules of war insist will ye lewrie griped to himself corsarios like corsairs is that not another word for pirates lewrie posed with one brow up no no senor corsario ees not pirata calderon countered sounding more impatient with a henheaded poor linguist than in fear of being hanged there are many corsarios who sail from havana from cuba but no pirata despite our blockade lewrie said sounding dubious blockade blockade ees joke jou ingleses do not rule the seas senor calderon sneered no matter what jou do merchants enter and leave cuba the west indies every day by the hundreds and jour navy do not take one een ten blockade hah so jou weel now accept our parole and take us to nassau calderon went on in much calmer but arrogant takings and allow us to bury our dead well not right off senor lewrie told him the very last thing he wanted was a return to nassau within reach of francis forrester for that matter he was also loath to delay the execution of the rest of his orders even by a day is captain narvaez one of our prisoners mister bury if he is sir he has not announced his presence bury said narvaez was ashore wheen jou attack us calderon sullenly said weeth hees woman hey lt westcott who had been idling nearby commented a woman did he say men of the afterguard some of the midshipmen and the other officers suppressed their snickers mostlike a trull mister westcott not worth your trouble lewrie japed no no she ees puta but muy hermosa calderon insisted all but lifting his fingers to his lips to kiss them in appreciation my pardons senor calderon but you must be as dry as dust lewrie said how remiss of me not to offer you any refreshment ive a some champagne in my boat sir lt darling piped up a tad sheepishly for such would have been looted from the encampment a whole case of bottles french to boot well fetch one up mister darling and ill send down to my cabins for glasses lewrie enthused clapping his hands in glee i expect the champagne will be senor narvaezs but in point of fact mister darling id admire a second bottle for a victory feast this evening ehm ill have the entire case fetched up sir there are two cases really darling confessed ready to wring his hands do so sir do so lewrie urged then turned to his captive once more had you been set up here in mayami bay for long senor calderon much better for your purposes than the waterless islands in the keys hey more game though i would have thought that you might have preferred any of the inlets closer to saint augustine and its fort and shore batteries thats where i thought to find you jou look for me for narvaez especialmente it was his turn to gawp in astonishment fearing betrayal by someone in havana no no nothing like that lewrie cajoled my orders sent me to look for french or spanish privateers in general the case of champagne in question arrived on deck and darling did the honours with the wire basket and cork pettus came up from the greatcabins with clean glasses and lewrie poured calderons full it was warm but calderon tossed half of the glass back at once gracias senor i was thirsty calderon admitted ah a very good french champagne lewrie commented once hed taken a deep sip himself your compatriot has good taste at least a refill sir here you go i suppose do so many of your merchant ships elude our blockade back in europe and here that cuba should be awash in champagne and fine french wines mean tsay senor you must get something in return for becoming a french ally damn the french calderon snarled well into his second glass and damn all the ateo traidores back een spain who take hands weeth france so een love weeth a republica they turn their backs on king on the holy church on god idiotas who think they so smart who geef part of our navy to france geef them millions in silver and gold on the sly damn all jou ingles heretics too calderon ranted on for declaring war on spain well given the aid that spain was handing over to our enemy on the sly as you admit england had no choice lewrie told him a great pity but there it is a refill sir calderon was very agreeable to a third glass the french are a rapacious race senor calderon lewrie told him striving for chummy and sympathetic a greedy lot indeed be the ruin of your home country and of your colonies in the indies in the end do your ministers like that godoy fellow not come to their senses and then the french have the gall to send their privateers into your waters your harbours to compete with men such as you are there many french privateers working out of cuba are a few si but the captaingeneral the reech men of power make things hard on them calderon admitted offhandedly such men the dons hidalgos and grandees weeth money to make syndicates for our corsarios keep the shot powder and stores for themselves so french bastardos have to beg in havana florida florida ees how jou say out of sight out of mind damn my eyes has he gotten that drunk this quickly lewrie wondered or did i just get hellishlucky ah but how much support could a french privateer expect from saint augustine lewrie hinted hard to send supplies from havana to there not from havana calderon said with a sly cockeyed grin as if he knew a secret warm champagne taken standing upright in the open on the quarterdeck with the morning progressing and the bays heat rising was doing wonders calderon jerked his chin northwards in a silent hint snickering from the americans aye lewrie said and calderons bitter laugh assured him that he and admiralty were on the right track a glass with you sir lewrie proposed being liberal with the champagne to his majesty the king of spain he wasnt quite sure who that was by name but viva la rey calderon cried clinking glasses with him and tossing back a goodly gulp i wish you better luck in future captain calderon lewrie offered though it might be best did you work out of the pocket harbours on cubas north coast or havana next time jou advise me how to cor privateer senor calderon said finding that highly amusing somebody should for yeve made a botch of thisun lewrie told himself hoy the ship you will excuse me for a moment captain calderon something i must see to lewrie explained then went to the starboard rails it was the ships surgeon and his mates returning aboard with the spanish wounded theres nought i can do for their dead sir but weve fetched their wounded and i took the liberty of bringing the prizes surgeons chests ready to hoist aboard sir their burly surgeon mr mainwaring reported from his boat captain calderon could you come join me for a moment lewrie asked si senor there are ten dead spanish sailors still aboard the prizes lewrie explained to him i was thinking that you might wish to bury them ashore instead of me conducting a protestant service im told that three of your wounded are in a very bad way as well and wont be with us much longer do you give me your parole so i may land them ashore too jou have eet senor capitano calderon firmly declared you have surgeons aboard your ships perhaps they could tend to the other wounded ashore as well lewrie further offered jou are the most gracious senor calderon said mister bury lewrie said turning to lizard s captain id be grateful did you use your boats to land all the prisoners ashore lewrie instructed crooking a finger to draw him closer and some distance from calderon certainly sir bury replied did any of them get away lewrie asked in a mutter two boats did manage to escape us sir into the channel between the mainland and the long narrow barrier island bury admitted they scampered off into the bushes but we did fetch the abandoned boats off we did plan to obtain bigger better ships boats sir very good mister bury excellent work lewrie said with a grin i swear you read my mind now i want you to take lieutenant simcock and a file of his marines with you for security tkeep the dons honest after all the prisoners are ashore though fetch off all the boats leave them nothing that will swim well keep the useful ones and scuttle the rest ehm would we not be marooning them sir bury asked as if he was being talked into a mortal sin not marooning exactly lewrie poohpoohed slyy grinning the last i heard that requires a barren desert island and theyll be on a mainland just teemin with game and wild hogs fish birds and oceans o fresh water spaniards ashore in a spanish possession what could be more humane well bury pondered senor calderon and the rest can have a nice stroll to get to saint augustine and theres sure tbe little spanish settlements and farms along the way lewrie schemed on and all sorts of fruit and edible berries tpluck we leave em even one boat mister bury and sure as fate some of the damned foolsd try to sail for havana to arrange a rescue and what with waterspouts sharks currents and the usual sea conditions in the florida straits it just wouldnt be christian theyd be overset swamped and drowned or eaten fore they got halfway well in that case sir lt bury said with the faintest hint of a smile on his face i and lieutenant lovett shall see to it directly capital lewrie encouraged him then went to the entryport to inform surgeon mainwaring of the change in plans then aft again to calderon who had been busy lowering the level of champagne in the bottle in his absence jou land us ashore senor calderon asked owleyed by then all of you sir lewrie told him hoping that calderon would take the gesture as magnanimous til the last moment i cannot find it in my heart to imprison such an affable fellow as yourself or leave you on parole in such an expensive place as nassau go with my very best wishes sir here take another bottle or two with you perhaps you can toast captain narvaezs brilliance with them what that idiota calderon gravelled hees family was hidalgo een spain conquistador een cuba family old and reech weeth the many connexions so the sindicato who back our voyage they put heem in command but he ees the marinero de agua dulce the ah complete and total lubber lewrie supplied si si the how jou say calderon eagerly agreed they shook hands calderon even went so far as to embrace him and bestow a grateful kiss on lewries cheek to the amusement of the others on the quarterdeck before stepping away uh senor jou geef back my papers my letters of marque sorry senor calderon but i must present them to the prize court at nassau as evidence that we took your ships and lay claim to the head and gun money for each man aboard at the time of capture and for each cannon taken lewrie explained like the red indians take scalps hmm ah i see calderon said with a deep sigh crestfallen he would be unemployable as a privateering captain whenever he got back to cuba and was probably out a goodly sum of his own money as an investment in the venture to boot hell need a good long vacation tget over this lewrie told himself the long march to saint augustine ought to do it lewrie saw him over the side doffing his hat in salute and coxn desmond made another effort at a departure call mister westcott lewrie said turning back inboard aye sir once all the spanish are ashore were going to fetch off all their boats lewrie informed him once thats done and weve gotten all our people back aboard were going to sink the ones we cant use and then i wish you to see to the destruction of the prizes scuttle them as well sir lt westcott asked no set fire to them and burn them to hell cleverly done sir lt darling dared comment getting the information from the spaniard and gulling him clever me lewrie scoffed to himself and all before breakfast mine arse on a bandbox chapter twentytwo the urge to host a celebratory supper aboard reliant was strong once the fourship squadron gained the open sea but there was still the coast above mayami bay to be scouted the uncertainties of their charts to be dealt with and searoom out towards the gulf stream to be made lewrie sent round bottles of champagne from his newly won casenone necessary to the crafty lt darling who had his ownand a bit of bad news for lt lovett someone had to return to nassau with the privateers papers and letters of marque lewrie urged the energetic and piratical lovett to make his stay at nassau as brief as possible then return to rejoin thorn and lizard off saint augustine to form a scoutingblockading force under no circumstances was he to be browbeaten back into captain francis forresters clutches to lt darling in thorn lewrie sent formal written orders for him to take temporary command of the squadron til reliant returned from her diplomatic mission and once lt lovett and hms firefly were back in the fold to scout harass and engage any spanish vessels they came across were there no merchantmen or light warships to fight lt darling was to make a nuisance along the coast as long as he did not take on anything too rash boats away mister westcott lewrie asked as he mounted to the quarterdeck both away and returning sir the first officer replied orders champagne and all safely delivered if the mids in charge or the oarsmen didnt drink them right up something to be said for a late breakfast or a very early dinner combined lewrie commented still savouring one of yeovills frenchstyle omelettes with cheese crumbled bacon and onion and a cup or three of strong coffee to slosh it down he let go a discreet belch of appreciation then turned to look aft and to larboard the smoke from the burning ships and boats they had left in mayami bay still stained the horizon even from ten miles offshore and twentyodd miles astern lewrie smiled in satisfaction as he strolled to the hammock stanchions and nettings at the forward edge of the quarterdeck whats with the damned dog mister westcott lewrie asked i saw him huddled under the ladderway as i came up whining sick is he it doesnt appear that the discharging of the guns agrees with him sir westcott told him as soon as we went to quarters and the guns were run in for loading he started cowering i had one of the powder monkeys take him by the collar and lead him below to the orlop with your cats sir your steward pettus will know more of what happened then well cannon fire or thunder dont agree with the livestock up forrud either lewrie said and dont get me started on what my eats do perhaps a warship isnt the right place for him might be a farmd suit him better then hed only have stormy weather tdeal with ye might mention that to the mids as to whether they think the poor thingd suffer less ashore midshipmen munsell and rossyngton the youngest of the cockpit mess at that moment strolled aft towards the base of the main mast and to their whistles and invitations bisquit darted out from his refuge and pranced about them tail wagging madly so much for being too fearful sir westcott said with one brow up and a quick savage grin on his face perhaps like any pressed lubber hell learn to cope he would damn him lewrie muttered hes good for the ships morale sir you will have to admit lt westcott pointed out everyone but your cats adores the beast et tu sir et tu lewrie said with a wry snicker lt westcotts answer to that was a laugh the last cast of the log mister westcott lewrie asked turning to more practical matters eight knots and a bit sir westcott said more formally does this wind hold then well be off saint augustine about sundown tomorrow lewrie speculated we could leave the others then or we could stay long enough for the dons to catch sight of us before breaking away a fifth rate frigate will make a greater impression than three smaller sloops by themselves after that we will stand out to enter the gulf stream and rush on for wilmington much of a place is it sir westcott asked not as large a port as charleston but busy enough so far as i remember from my times there in the revolution lewrie told him not that well see it exactly for the town propers thirty miles up the cape fear river from the mouth well have to come to anchor in the pratique ground near old brunswick town if its still there it was threequarters abandoned and fallin down in ill have to take one of the barges upriver well send a mid with the other for supplies firewood and water a pursers run and sausages suitable for bisquit and your cats sir westcott teased if you the mids and the other officers are so concerned with the dogs nourishment one does hope a contribution will be gathered hmmm mister westcott lewrie japed well westcott said wincing so long as its not too much mean tsay got you again sir lewrie snickered for a frigate like reliant which drew nigheighteen feet right aft even approaching wilmington and the mouth of the cape fear river was a nightmare entering the river through new inlet to the east was out of the question when the hurricane of had opened it it was half a mile wide and eighteen feet deep at high tide which could vary as much as six feet of ebb to low tide below the long sabreshaped peninsula that lay on the east bank of the river south of new inlet south of smith island or bald head depending upon which chart one used lay frying pan shoals that stretched out to sea for another eighteen miles with shifting swash channels between used mostly by fishermen and small coastal trading vessels so long as they could swim in six or seven feet of water much safer though by no means completely sure was to approach well westward of the shoals under reduced sail with leadsmen in the fore chains and anchors ready to let go to haul the ship off quickly should she take the ground a lot of the bottom was sand and shingle but the charts showed several coral formations and rocks from his time before at wilmington lewrie recalled how quickly one could find good deep water on one beam and oyster banks and ginclear water to the other close enough to touch with an oar and shallow enough for someone with a rake to stand kneedeep when the leadsmen called out that there were five fathoms off either bow the sailing master coughed into his fist and vowed that it might be time to fetchto and call for a pilot damned right mister caldwell lewrie told him letting out a whoosh of air were temptin fate as it is mister westcott fetch to hoist the request pilot signal and fire off a gun to wake em up it took some time before there was a cannon fired in reply and a small twomasted vessel appeared near the eastern tip of oak island bound out to them arnold dubden your servant sir the stout older pilot said once hed gained the decks doffing a widebrimmed nighshapeless hat youd not be meaning to enter the river now would you he asked looking incredulous as i recall mister dubden thatd be asking too much lewrie replied doffing his own cocked hat captain alan lewrie the reliant frigate and i am your servant sir in need of safe anchorage that i can manage captain lewrie dubden said with a laugh my word but the biggest ship to even try to enter the river was the old hector back before the revolution and she was only two hundred thirty tons and didnt draw twelve feet once anchored i suppose i can find passage upriver to wilmington at brunswick town lewrie asked lord sir there arent four buildings left o brunswick town and one o thems the tavern dubden further related in amusement smithvilles the main settlement now mostly for the pilots cross the sound from oak island and there isnt what youd call regular ferry service upriver catch as catch can really pursers stores lewrie asked firewood and water youll find some at smithville captain but the main chandlers are upriver you could send for some i suppose dubden told him and the british consul would also be upriver at wilmington lewrie pressed fraid so captain though he isnt british dubden related its a parcel o city lawyers who fill those posts well there is a frenchman who does for their consul duties but the rest are local hmmm sounds as if i should take one of my barges then lewrie mused aloud perhaps another for my purser no need to do all your carrying yourself captain dubden said just send your needs upriver and theres lighters aplenty that can fetch your purchases down i see you fly a broad pendant captain theres not a squadron offshore is there mean to say were not at war with you british again are we still completely at peace and in total amity sir lewrie assured him my squadron at present is off spanish florida looking for french and spanish privateers well then dubden brightened sounding somewhat relieved by that news if you will get your ship under way theres deep water and good holding ground about half a mile further on just off yonder when reliant was safely anchored fore and aft all the sails handed and gasketed dubden took his leave announcing his fee for his services theres also one dollar due for the gunpowder sir hey lewrie asked for the gunpowder we used to answer your shot captain the fellow explained state regulations for pilotage the rate of exchange would be ah the purser mr cadbury reckoned about five shillings sir five shillings for about ten pence of powder lewrie wondered these yankee doodles are nothing but a pack of skinflints and captain sharps when i get upriver id better go with a satchel or a keg o coin after consulting dubden about the local tides and winds lewrie decided to sail up the river early the next morning in one of the thirty foot barges taking the purser along to negotiate for the goods that mr cadbury could not purchase from the smithville traders that afternoon mr cooke the ships black cook was eager for cadbury to buy cape fear low country rice and corn meal along with as many pecks of berry fruits as possible lewries own cook yeovill popped up with a list of his own wants desmond lewrie called down to the waist come to the quarterdeck if ye please aye sor his coxn asked once there well take one of the barges upriver rig the bestun with two lugsls and a jib ill want you and furfy and only two more of my gigs crew men youre sure wont take legbail once were at wilmington lewrie directed itll be me the purser for passengers yell not be wishin yer steward tsee to ye sor desmond asked thinking it odd to not show the flag in proper style due the captain of a british frigate well be among staunch republicans almost as bad as the sansculottes french desmond lewrie explained with a grin and the memories of the revolution are still sharp the less pomp and show the better besides theres an old friend of mine in wilmington one we may find welcoming if the wind fails us ill take the tiller and well have four oars tmake steerageway best turnout mind and we will shove off round dawn aye sor the bargell be ready desmond assured him even do i haveta bribe the bosun for fresh paint and lets hope christopher cashmans not turned into an american jacobin himself lewrie thought chapter twentythree it was a very pleasant day to be boating even did it begin at first sparrow fart of a midapril morning brown spotted gulls and whiteheaded gulls swirled round the masttops and the blackheaded laughing gulls flirted and mewed in taunting darts near the gunnls of the freshlypainted barge further off dark cormorants hovered and gyred before twisting over to make their fishkilling dives and clutches of pelicans winged along cranknecked further off flocks of white egrets and great blue herons could be seen stalking on long legs on the nearest shoreline before the day warmed the air was fresh and cool redolent of marshes and fresh water even as the barge breasted the surge of the making tide leaving salt water for sweet the boat heeled only slightly to a steady beam wind churning a faint foamywhite bow wave and leaving only the faintest disturbance in the brown river in its wake looking upriver or to either hand as it widened the cape bear appeared a dark bluegreen but closer to it was rich with leaf mould and the colour of aged tobacco leaves all under the bluest morning sky the whitest and leastthreatening clouds and the banks of the river lined with pine and oak brilliant with the fresh green leaves of spring they passed a few landmarks that lewrie remembered like orton pond and the magnificent house at orton plantation to larboard the new inlet and federal point to starboard the other riverfront manses further upriver whose names he had never learned or forgotten and desmond furfy and the other hands marvelled and jested as they had a snack of freshbaked and buttered corn dodgers and small beer theres wilmington proper lewrie pointed out at last and thats the dram tree that big cypress on the right bank sailors take a toast for a safe arrival or at the beginning of an outward voyage for good luck lets steer for the nearest docks the ones in front of the livesey seabright and cashman chandlery desmond take a dram did ye say capm sor patrick furfy piped up an ant it a foine tradition might be we for our departure furfy sorry lewrie had to tell him but if the chandlery has a keg of ale handy well take a wet hand the jib hartnett pat your and thomas see to lowerin the lugsls desmond directed they were far above the reach of the making tide in fresh water which made wilmington a welcome harbour where saltwater marine growth would die whilst at anchor but a goodly current was running lewrie tapped mr cadbury on the shoulder and they both fetched a pair of oars from the barges sole ready to be put into the tholes to maintain steerageway while the sailors saw to wrapping the lugsls round their gaff booms and lashing the sheets and halliards over the canvas when it appeared that the barge would pay off and begin to be taken by the river current lewrie stood and took hold of the two sternmost oars in their tholes and began to row himself just to keep them in place it was not a task at which he could claim even modest expertise but that stopped their drift ship oars desmond ordered take th tiller sor bowson between those two twomasters if theres not room to land starboard sideto lewrie suggested trading places their arrival with a british union jack slanted over the transom on a short gaffa rare sight in an american port and the sight of a royal navy officer plying not one oar but two seemed to have drawn a gapjawed crowd on the piers of dock and water streets shouldve brought one or two more hands lewrie chid himself as he put the tiller over once all four oarsmen were stroking hard this could look damned awkward and lubberly toss oar hartnett desmond snapped an be ready with th bow line should i do something sir mr cadbury asked why aye mister cadbury lewrie exclaimed stop sittin on the starbd dock line and be ready ttoss it to the nearest helpful soul on the pier mind that the bitter ends still bound to the boat now thered been an embarassing mistake lewrie had made the first time hed been given charge of a ships boat not a week into his naval career hed been sitting on the dock line too and had almost put the bow man arseovertit into portsmouth harbour trying to come alongside a stone quay at the victuallers claw the line from under his arse and steer at the same time the grizzled old wildhaired seamans words came back to him thalt never make a sailorman making him blush anew toss oar pat desmond whispered to his longtime mate there were men on the pier who took their lines and whipped them expertly round bollards or posts and they were safely at rest wahl hoy th boat thar a stout man on the pier drawled has admrl nelson hissef come callin looking for an old friend with a pot of ale lewrie said grinning back despite the mans derision will i do christopher kit cashman interrupted coming from the front doors of the establishment which partially bore his name hallo alan old son welcome to america they went back a long way to a failed expedition to carry then escort a diplomatic mission to woo the muskogee the lower creek indians to side with england and make war against rebel settlers in when lewrie was a lieutenant and cashman a captain of a light company of an undistinguished regiment the both of them expendable a few years later when british forces had invaded haiti then the french colony of saintdomingue they had met on jamaica when lewrie was captain of the proteus frigate and cashman had become a plantation owner then the lt colonel of an islandraised volunteer regiment hired on in essence by the rich beauman family the bane of both lewries and cashmans existence lewrie had been cashmans second in a duel with the unfortunate younger son ledyard beauman who had been the colonel of the regiment who had lost his nerve in battle in the hills outside portauprince shrilling for the regiment to retreat then galloping off with his cronies in terror and laying the entire blame for what could have been a rout and massacre on kit it had been cashman whod arranged lewries theft or liberation of a dozen prime black slaves from a neighboring beauman plantation before hed sold up and removed to the united states and the one whod sent a supporting frankly lying affidavit to england which had gone a long way in getting lewrie off at his trial years later for that theft once the beaumans had figured out who had done it christopher cashman had not changed much in the years since his hair had thinned a bit and civilian living and the accumulation of wealth had thickened his waist but it only took a few minutes to remake their friendship as cozy as an old pair of shoes now what in the world brings you to wilmington cashman asked in amusement over glass mugs of cool beer admiralty orders to look for french and spanish privateers fitting out in neutral ports lewrie told him show the flag consult with our consuls be tactful and diplomatic tactful and diplomatic cashman gawped you a bull in the china shops more your style as i recall the smithville pilot said our consul here is a local fellow lewrie asked who is he mister osgoode moore junior cashman told him esquire an attorney like his father osgoode moore senior who was a noted patriot during the revolution joined the corresponding society in the early days the sons of liberty got slung into the prison under the old burgwyn house by the kings agents fanning and cunningham and got treated rather cruelly lucky to have survived it unlike a few others the father took arms when the local militia marched on governor tryons house down at brunswick to rebel against the stamp act he was said to have been one of the rebels who went aboard hms viper seized the chests of stamps and took back the papers of the ships held from trading for refusing to use them just like the boston tea party as they say this side of the atlantic but years before massachusetts revolted hes a goodenough fellow is young moore but perhaps not all that enamoured of the post it pays a tidy annual sum without too much work to do since wilmingtons not a major trader with england any more hmmm just a paid agent lewrie gloomed his heart aint in it enough tturn a blind eye oh hes a stickler or would be if anyone laid an information of someone aiding the french or the spanish cashman countered the interests of britain and the strict neutrality of the united states are the same thing to him im certain besides alan cashman continued ive my ears to the ground and my own eyes on the chandleries and the port i cant give you a guarantee that the french or spanish might put into one of the many inlets for wood and water but from lockwoods folly to topsl island im pretty sure that theres no collusion going on the pilot told me theres a frenchman here as their consul lewrie asked could he be up to something monsieur jeanmarie fleury cashman scoffed rising to go to the keg of beer at the back of his office for a refill im certain hed love to anything for la belle france and the emperor napoleon just so long as it doesnt drag him from his bed too early in the morning involve a long secretive horseback ride or cost him a single dollar im not sure why the french waste the money to keep a consul here at all there havent been more than a dozen of their merchant ships calling here since the war began again two years ago though the americans still think the french hung the moon lewrie posed damned nice beer i think ill have a topup too oh theres many who still adore them no matter how bloody the french revolution was compared to theirs cashman scoffed as he refilled lewries mug too our good president jeffersons in love with them and so are all the newspapers you came upriver with but four sailors and nothing but your sword and their knives quite the risk for a bloody brit after dark when the patriotic drunks spill out of the taverns on a hooraw youre a bloody brit lewrie exclaimed in good humor youre not dead yet ah but im an eccentric brit and a harmless civilian trader to boot no threat to anyone these days cashman hooted with mirth as he came back to his desk i doubt i could stand for public office and win but i care nothing for such other than joining the local militia my army background is welcome by most even if i am once more back to the rank of lieutenant and the juniormost at that the militias more social than professional cashman explained with a shrug when i bought into an old established prerevolutionary firm founded by patriots that went a long way towards acceptance hewing strictly to business and avoiding politics has gone a long way too matthew livesey when it was livesey and son the old man moved the family trade from philadelphia long ago cashman expounded dead and gone now but his grandsons still a partner old livesey was part of the corresponding society with new englanders early on and joined the sons of liberty the seabright part phillip seabright was a royal artillery officer who came to survey old fort johnston down near brunswick town horrid folly ive heard every time the guns were fired it like to shook itself to pieces anyway he ended up buying land and going into business with livesey when the stamp act was enacted wilmington and north carolina almost seceded from great britain seabright and livesey were part of the thousand men of the militia from new hanover brunswick and surrounding counties who rebelled he married liveseys daughter bess before the war and when it came seabright marched off with a couple of popguns to fight the highlander loyalists at widow moores creek bridge then served in the continental army against cornwallis and tarleton seabrights in his sixties now but his eldest son is with the firm and theres the fact that i married well cashman admitted somewhat sheepishly you married again kit at last lewrie hooted mine arse on a bandbox that is capital a good local family i take it the ramseurs cashman told him before the revolution the old patriarch was prince dickrichard ramseurin comparison to king roger moore the grandest of the settlers who came up from goose creek south carolina to found the borough theyre still not sure of me ill tell you theyre nowhere near as welloff as they were in the old days but the ramseurs still farm rice tobacco cotton they own nigh an hundred slaves yet here i am kin to them despite my vow against owning another slave as long as i live after my experiences on jamaica makes for testy suppers at their place or mine my wife sarah well we have house servants as few as possible in bondage and pay wages to the rest round here you are eccentric lewrie said shaking his head in wonder i doubt there arent a round dozen gentlemen in the whole state of north carolina of a mind with you when you sent that affidavit about my theft of those dozen beauman slaves that got me off did that hurt you hereabouts i swore it to osgoode moore junior before he became the british consul cashman told him looking grave as my attorney he is required to keep mum about the matter and as i said moore is a stickler and as highminded a gentleman as his father no one knows of it and pray god no one ever will so should i get in my cups whilst im in wilmington id best not mention all that lewrie asked especially over supper tonight cashman replied grinning i hope to dine you in at my house and invite osgoode moore and his wife you should also lodge with us for a few days much cleaner and safer than taking public lodgings the other officer who came with you my purser mister cadbury lewrie said only the one night kit i expect hes with your clerks purchasing fresh stores i told him to use no other chandlery my and my partners thanks alan cashman laughed well have your mister cadbury to dine as well weve two spare rooms he can eat with a knife and fork lewrie japed though i dont know if he snores or walks in his sleep your sailors wont mind dossing down in the coach house and stables cashman asked so long as theyve eat well and had some rum no lewrie replied though theyd not make good supper conversation i dont know if cadburys all that much a conversationalist either but one can never tell cashman mused aloud america is full of surprises planter grandees tradesmen and commoners mudsills from the back country as some say round here one never knows where a good yarn can be had quite unlike british society hey with industry even a mudsill can become a grandee and do his sons and daughters get polished theres no limit on how far they can go i am continually amazed by the open egality and aspirations of americans well so long as ones white lewrie wryly countered well there is that cashman ruefully admitted now let me get the invitations written and send my wife a note that well have guests this evening moore will need a formal invitation anything to impress him a medal or two hey cashman teased battles of cape saint vincent and camperdown lewrie smiled as he ticked his honours off copenhagen but they didnt hand out any tin for that un i command a very small squadron of very small sloops but one cant see my broad pendant all the way downriver to smithville just say that captain sir alan lewrie baronet will wish to discuss a knightbood a baronetcy to boot cashman gawped pen poised above the sheet of paper when did that happen spring of lewrie grinned fought a frog squadron off new orleans and took all four of em so the french could not invest the city before napoleon sold it to the united states so your wife is now dame lewrie cashman beamed grand i never met her but she passed away three years ago lewrie sadly related in lord do forgive me alan i had no idea i didnt write you of it you didnt know so theres nought to beg forgiveness for kit lewrie assured him i shouldve written but things happened in the meantime and tell him how it happened lewrie wondered no americans adore the french i say napoleon killed her while trying thave me killed it wouldnt be diplomatic and diplomatics what they sent me to be aint it sarah will be delighted even so to dine in a baronet in his sash and star cashman breezily said returning to his letter no matter americas distaste for aristocracy you show them a lord and theyll dearly love him i left em aboard lewrie confessed i didnt know how all that might go down how touchy peoples feelings about england are even this long after the revolution diplomacy hey he added with a cynical shrug no mobs pantin tlynch a tory but you shouldve worn them alan cashman exclaimed youre going about this show the flag thing all wrong youll be calling along the coast to other port cities good when you sail into savannah or charleston be sure to wear them a sash and star will make the charlestonians gush over you cause in their hearts theyd wish to have one too you know what they say about south carolinians that theyre the most asiatic of all americans struth for they eat a lot of rice and worship their ancestors haw haw and savannah and georgia lewrie asked of much the same mind though nowhere near as polished in the main cashman quipped again people in both the carolinas are sure that all the rogues end up in georgia there was a knock at the office door and at cashmans bidding reliant s purser mr cadbury entered i believe weve found all our needs sir and on good terms as well mister cashmans clerks have been most helpful though the bulk and weight of the stores exceed our boat for a further modest fee well see your purchases downriver in one of the corncrackers alongside the piers cashman suggested all our lighters are tied up at the moment but im sure we can make an offer to one of the masters to make an extra run before he returns here to load his trade goods grains and such down the northwest or the northeast branch of the cape fear as far as campbelltown or cross creek and back again very fast and handy little vessels even for the coasting trade from beaufort and new bern does one of them get underway by midday next she could use the river current and the ebb of the tide and be off smithville waiting for you thatd be capital kit thankee lewrie said oh by the by youd not have some dried meats in stock would you sausages strips of jerky for the cats dye see and the midshipmen have adopted a stray mongrel dog so you still keep eats aboard cashman teased ive the very thing pemmican the lumbee tribe round lake waccamaw make it its god knows what sort of meat flour suet molasses and dried berries pounded together they bring it in by the bale along with all the deer and alligator hides want some about an hundredweight will do aye lewrie agreed sounds toothsome enough the beastsll have tfight me for it he thought mister cadbury ive invited my old friend captain lewrie to lodge and dine with me tonight cashman said as he quickly went over the tally his clerks had made and i trust that you will accept my invitation as well with pleasure mister cashman cadbury quickly replied once weve settled the reckoning ill see the both of you over to the house then cashman further offered the pemmican on your own account alan call it ten dollars thatd be two pounds at the current rate of exchange here you go lewrie said digging into his coin purse your boat will be safe enough here at our pier for the night cashman said once he had cadburys money and admiralty noteofhand bring your sailors along and well get them settled in as well with liam desmond patrick furfy and the other of the boats crew in tow cashman led the party along water street up dock street to round the uphill end of the actual dock cut into the river bank that gave the street its name then over to market street the main thoroughfare and uphill again towards st james church and fifth street which in lewries brief time in the city had been the outer limit of wilmington with nothing but pine forests beyond to the sea to the east but it had grown far beyond since where most homes and businesses had been wood plagued by almost annual fires there were now impressive stone or brick buildings and houses some as fine as anything in london where lewrie remembered sandy dirt streets and full of stray dogs geese chickens and goats there were now cobblestoned streets with sidewalks iron lampposts and very little livestock there were many more fine carriages than he remembered too and a lot more people strolling about in finer clothing than that worn at the tailend of a long war weve become a raree show lewrie asked himself noticing how people stopped in their tracks to gawk and stare he also noted that a parcel of gawkers young boys mostly had followed them from the chandlery as if word had spread of a second british invasion or bloody tarleton or lord cornwallis had come back uhoh cashman muttered under his breath uhoh lewrie parroted in query expecting trouble the french consul monsieur fleury cashman explained jutting his chin towards a foppish slim fellow at the corner by the church m jeanmarie fleury was bristling with indignation at the very sight of a despicable anglais his exotic thin mustachios quivering in loathing and his chin high he was the epitome of a dandy dressed in a longtailed waistlength doublebreasted green coat with lapels that ended near his shoulders a shortbrimmed thimble of a hat with a tricolour cockade dazzling white trousers of almost painfully skintight cut and browntopped riding boots grey suedegloved fingers flexed angrily on the gilt handle of his ebony walking stick as if he would like nothing more than to dash forward and cudgel lewrie to his knees faith but aint he a little terrier aint he furfy said snickering when they were within fifteen feet or so of that worthy fleury heaved a great sniff of disdain stamped his walking stick on the pavement and directed his gaze skyward and away in the cut sublime the derisive and insulting gesture made several people titter lewrie came to a stop staring directly at fleury he could not resist he heaved off a loud harumph of his own stamped one booted foot and turned his own head about so he could study the clouds and the view north down fifth street raising both hands to one eye like the tube of a telescope that raised another titter from the crowd then lewrie began to laugh with a broad grin on his face he looked back to fleury laughed some more then walked on past the man leaving the french consul stuck with his cut sublime and no chance of laughing it off turning coral pink in frustration well played alan old son cashman muttered restraining his own laughter by supper thatll be the talk of the town and every trick taken dye think theyd call that proper diplomacy lewrie asked chapter twentyfour they had gotten a late start from the wilmington docks the morning after supper with the cashmans but the barge was back alongside reliant and lewrie and the purser safely on deck just before dusk the bosun and bosuns mate trilled the welcoming call and the sideparty saluted as lewrie made it inboard of the entry port doffing his own hat in salute feeling much relieved to be back on his ship bisquit the dog exuberantly pranced about the shins of the sailors and marines yipping barking and whining with joy as if he had been cruelly separated from his master for over a year and was in paroxysms of rapture to be reunited which quite ruined the ceremony lewrie gave the dog a pat on the head reached into his pockets and offered bisquit a piece of pemmican to shut him up he sniffed wagged his tail and his hindquarters then chomped down and ran off with his heavenly new treat welcome back sir lt westcott said thankee mister westcott anything amiss occur while i was away lewrie asked anyone swim ashore and desert alls well sir westcott assured him it seems that this little smithvilles not much of a temptation i did allow the mids to go ashore along with mister spendlove and merriman for an hour or two just to stretch their legs but you did not sir lewrie asked as i said sir westcott said with a tight little grin it has no temptations beyond a wellstocked tavern no women ah well lewrie teased might i ask how your trip to wilmington fell out sir the first officer enquired as they fell into a sidebyside stroll towards the stern satisfyin in part unsatisfyin in another lewrie said and damned frustratin at the tailend put a mid and a workparty to heavin up the stores we have in the barge then join me in my cabins for a mug of ale and ill reveal all most grateful sir westcott said turning to whistle up men to assist mr cadbury in unloading the barge by the time westcott entered the greatcabins lewrie was down to shirtsleeves sitting on the starboardside settee and having more fuss made of him by his cats toulon and chalky who found pemmican a tasty treat as well an ale for the first officer if ye please pettus lewrie ordered right away sir sit mister westcott lewrie bade here try some of this pemmican i fetched back an hundredweight of it for our creatures but its really too good for them ten yankee dollars in all two pounds sterling you the officers and the mids make up one pound between you and ill call it quits damned decent price sir uhm tasty too westcott said in appreciation first off our consul in wilmington and the lower cape fear is a local attorney lewrie told him dont pull such a long face sir for i found him honourable and decent and quite diligent about representing englands interests and americas strict neutrality in equal measure between him and my old friend christopher cashman who knows the chandlery trade and the towns docks as well as any i think we can write off wilmington as a potential shelter for enemy privateers well have to look elsewhere to the south charleston georgetown beaufort and port royal in south carolina for starters more fun to be had in charleston than little smithville aye sir lt westcott said with a hopeful grin chalky abandoned lewries thigh leapt down and made his way to westcotts lap stretching his neck and pawing for the remaining morsel of pemmican much more business bein done for certain lewrie agreed in a way and a harbour much more accessible from the sea with sufficient depth for fullyladen indiamen more temptations for local businessmen to dabble in privateerin perhaps dont know about georgetown the winyah bay is rather shallow with a narrow safe channel and the town is mostly in the riceexportin trade i dont even know if we have a consul there and wont til we speak to our consul in charleston oh here you little pest westcott said surrendering to the cats manic intent to have the last bite you said the rest of your stay in wilmington was less than satisfying sir well cashmans wifelovely and gracious woman from one of the finest old cape fear families by the waylaid on a splendid supper party for us lewrie said making a wee wry grimace took it a step too far though it was cashman and his wife our local consul mister osgoode moore junior and his junior sir westcott asked looking askance the american way of tellin father from son i gathered so that made six of us countin me and mister cadbury lewrie went on but to dine in a knight and baronet she also had in one of the old partners in livesey seabright and cashman mister phillip seabright himself and his wife bess both of whom took active parts in the revolution in their younger days that made eight guests but apparently mistress cashman thought the balance twixt gentlemen and ladies was off so she whistled up one of her neighbours a widow and her spinster daughter and did you feel buttockbrokered sir westcott idly japed a knighted widower to be inspected no none of that lewrie said with a sardonic laugh the widow lady was in her late fifties if she was a day though the daughter was fetchin enough ah thankee pettus he said as his cabin servantsteward fetched him a fresh mug of ale no the problem was they were chiswicks ehm lt westcott posed in query not tumbling to it my late wifes surname was chiswick and she her parents and her brothers were from the cape fear lewrie explained with a wince loyalist tory supporters of king and country during the revolution whereas these chiswicks were the rebel side of the family well after all these years sir does it really matter any more westcott asked it dont tme but it surely still matters to them lewrie said enlightening his first lieutenant there i was sponged off cleanshaven fangs polished and my breath sweetened with a ginger pastille just fit tplease even had my mind primed tbe tactful witty an charmin for gods sake as we gathered in the parlour for sherry or rhenish the moores arrived and its a fine beam reach and smooth sailin couldnt be more congenial the seabrights arrive and it comes out that i was once in wilmington during the war after yorktown for the evacuation of the british garrison and stores lewrie went on and oh hasnt their city grown since and were you truly a witness to cornwalliss surrender at yorktown and i got off my tale of escapin the might beforetell ye thatun somedayand isnt it wonderful tbe back at peace these many years and then i asked about the grand old house that used to stand at the top of the hill on market street and mistress seabright says that that was the house her father matthew livesey had built once the firm was profitable before the war came and i made the mistake of sayin that id known some people who lodged there just before the evacuation and i felt the wind veer ahead to a close reach and turn a tad nippy the only people who lived there were tarletons officers and refugeed loyalists so mister seabright launched into a scheme by the local lights tdam up new inlet to deepen the channels of old inlet tlet in bigger ships the cat was still in the bag then and the change o topic was welcome this was before the angry mob with torches and pitchforks came to the door i take it sir westcott asked tongueincheek enjoying his captains discomforture lewrie gave him a scowl suitable to the occasion in sailed the chiswick ladies lewrie continued his tale of woe fusses ados bows and curtseys and the introductions first and the servants fetched round more wine now widow chiswick started out as a pleasant old chickabiddy all grand manners and sweet as your whitehaired granny married into the clan just after the revolution but she mustve swotted up on chiswick lore from her teens the spinster daughter was about nineteen blond blueeyed pertly fetchin i see sir westcott said rising to the description with an anticipatory grin a rather feral one young ladies did that to him as missish and coy as any ye ever did see just primed to thrill perhaps too much so cause i see no other reason she hasnt caught a beau yet or so i gathered lewrie described she even paid poor mister cadbury a fair share of attention the lucky bastard sir westcott commented with a brief scowl of envy to have not been there at last the majordomo or butler or whatever they call em in america says that supper is ready so off we trot two columns in lineabreast find our seats and i found myself cross from the seabrights with the widow lady abeam and the daughter two points off my starboard bows lewrie laid out and at first things go swimmingly til mistress seabright asks do i have family back in england and do i miss em sore and here it came cats out o the bag at last with the ends knotted wife passed away three years before sugary expressions o sympathy daughter farmed out with my brotherinlaw two sons in the navy well i had tname em didnt i and there went the chiswick nape hairs my eldest is named sewallis lewrie for my late fatherinlaw dye see mister westcott and my daughters named for my late motherinlaws charlotte chiswick lewrie painfully elaborated shifting uncomfortably on the thin settee cushions and shes stayin with brotherinlaw governour after that i didnt have to say the name chiswick cause the family lores just bungfull about em my fatherinlaw with some other prosperous planter gentlemen raised a singlebattalion loyalist regiment and armed em with ferguson rifles and governour and burgess chiswick were officers in that regiment the old lady put it to me and was your wife from the cape fear sir alan and ye cant lie about such a thing much as i wished so i says that caroline was aye and yedve thought id said that she was the bastard git of the devil himself a full gale smacked me fine on the bow leavin me all aback and inirons lt westcott had himself a serious wince in sympathy saying sounds rather awkward sir ouch your own kin of a sort aye one minute it was all gushin and makin coweyes over me like i was the prince of wales even if i am english cashman was right when he said that even jacobinsll go giddy over a lord lewrie said with a mirthless laugh and the next minute im a redeyed turk in a turban attila the hun and bloody banastre tarleton all rolled up in one i got lectured mister westcott on the barbarities of the british during the revolution and the atrocities committed by those who sided with the king and nothing that my host and hostess or the seabrights could do to dissuade em i had tsit and take it totally dismasted and all guns out of action lord how horrible sir lt westcott said after a silence and a sip or two of his ale though your predicament does have a certain bleak humour to it im glad somebody thinks so lewrie gravelled well both the widow granny and the spiteful young mort gave me close broadsides for a goodly time til they ran out of grievances or air one or the other lewrie said shaking his head with a bleak humour of his own christ what a litany every burned haystack stolen horse looted house butchered cow coinsilver punch bowl or broken teacup every torched house and barn every dead chiswick or their neighbours who was imprisoned whipped but when they did run out of wind i got my own back didnt give a tinkers dam for tactful or diplomatic by then how so sir westcott asked both rapt and darkly amused by the tale by then i told em that when i escaped yorktown got back aboard my own ship at new york we sailed to wilmington and how i found the chiswicks lewrie said lifting his chin with stubborn pride of the doing of how my future fatherinlaw was broken in body and spirit and how penniless they were the three of em and their one loyal old slave cook and maidofallwork and what little theyd managed tsalvage were living in one small room damned near at the edge of starvation and had it not been for my pleas to my old captain and his generosity and pity theyd not have been able to buy passage to charleston and temporary refuge cause their own chiswick kin the ones whod welcomed em with open arms tsettle in the cape fear country and my motherinlaws longsettled kinfolk burned them out murdered the youngest brother george when he tried to defend them stole their livestock and looted their possessions stole their lands and drove off their slaves lewrie fumed in a dark taking and damned if they think to pretend that they were the ones with clean hands or grievances good sir good well i didnt go that far lewrie confessed the recapitulations harsher than the original but lets say that the supper party did not end with music parlour games or ecarte the chiswick ladies had departed in a huff before the dessert and the seabrights soon after lewrie related poor mister cadbury had been relegated to an embarassed companion to mrs cashman and mrs moore for some moody threehanded cards whilst lewrie cashman and moore had remained attable with port and tobacco getting the kings business settled anent french or spanish privateers and an agreement that cashman and moore would keep their eyes peeled for any merchants who might be aiding them if discovered moore would lodge protests with the local courts with the state government and alert the british ambassador in washington city cashman and i sat up and downed a few lewrie said sighing and easing his position on the settee he had a crock o kentucky aged whisky thank god and i tottered up to bed quite late damme but its been a while since i slept in a soft feather bed a bed that doesnt sway back and forth like a hanging bedcot and i dont think i got three hours sleep cadbury snores by the way then to put the icing on the cake who accosts me on my way back to the piers ttake our leave but a scurrilous little pest from the town newspaper lewrie growled he took a deep sip of his ale before going on demandin mind when great britain was going to stop inspectin american ships for contraband making prize of those bound for enemy ports violations on free trade and uppermost when were we going to stop pressing americanborn sailors to man our ships wished i couldve strangled him on the spot wished i had strangled those two chiswick bitches now theres my kind of tactful diplomacy ever read machiavelli sir lt westcott asked who the hells he when hes up and dressed lewrie growled an italian writer of long ago sir wrote a book of instructions for rulers called the prince westcott said with a sly smile one of his pieces of advice was that a ruler should be more feared than loved since you obviously created little love in wilmington it might have been better for you to have spread a little fear hmm doubt itd do any good tgo back with guns run out and matches lit lewrie said sounding weary whats done is done lewrie sat up and finished his ale first thing in the morning mister westcott make stations for weighing fire a gun and make hoist for a pilot to see us safely out to sea all purchased supplies loaded i take it aye sir good lewrie replied sounding and looking more alert dine with me this evening mister westcott you mister cadbury who can contribute to the tale of my embarassment and some others ill have midshipman eldridge in as well i havent dined him in yet and will you tell us the tale of how you escaped yorktown sir westcott asked as he set his empty ale mug aside and stood well if i must lewrie promised grinning chapter twentyfive hms reliant swanned a leisurely way from wilmington to charleston on a steady but light topsl breeze twelve or fifteen miles offshore making no more than seven or eight knots slow enough to trawl a large net astern to see what sort of fresh fish would turn up when hauled in but for a brief rain squall in late afternoon the jaunt was all blue skies and fine white clouds over a steelblue sea that glittered with white caps for the benefit of any fishermen or passing american merchantmen lewrie had the crew exercised on the great guns all through the forenoon with live firing and ordered a fresh large union jack to be flown aft so that everyone who espied her even from shore would know that the royal navy was cruising american waters and perhaps not for any idle purpose as lt westcott had suggested to inspire more fear than love by midmorning of the next day she was off charleston bar and calling for a pilot there were several channels she could use through the bar the sullivans island channel to the north which ran close under the guns of fort moultrie the north channel below sullivans the swash channel which was only suitable for small vessels at high tide and the main ship channel which lay closest to the lighthouse and beacon lewrie was taking no chanceshe would use the main ship channel his old atlantic neptune still held true hold northwest place the spire of st michaels church square on the bows and the lighthouse square off the stern once past it into five fathom hole and there was deep water all the way to the battery at the foot of the city with good holding ground a bit west towards the mouth of the ashley river like goin to china mister westcott lewrie said rocking on the balls of his freshblacked boots as the pilot cutter approached south carolinians eat a lot of rice and worship their ancestors hell he hasnt heard it yet and its true enough tbe funny lewrie told himself from that one could construe that both the ships cook and yours are south carolinians sir when it comes to frequency with which rice accompanies our victuals westcott japed back after hed had a brief laugh at his captains jest three days a week on banyan days no meat was issued and the rations were oatmeal cheese ships bisquit with nary a morsel of saltmeat but with rice so cheap the exslave cook mr cooke and yeovill boiled up enough to make the ships people feel full even lewries cats had gotten used to some rice with their sausages pemmican and jerky or table scraps aye and after mister cadbury makes a purchasing run ashore therell be even more of it lewrie told him unless the officers of the wardroom wish to buy something else for their mess potatoes sir westcott idly said mashed baked hashed with cheese diced and fried ah an humble but regal dish in all its manifestations the pilot boat is coming alongside sir midshipman rossyngton warned very well sideparty mister westcott lewrie ordered the harbour pilot turned out to be a cheery fellow in his midthirties and once the introductions were done gaily announced welcome to charleston captain lewrie the very place where the ashley and the cooper rivers come together to form the atlantic i presume you wish a good anchorage not too close to shore to make it too hard for any of your sailors of a mind to run thatd be most welcome sir thankee lewrie replied the pilot pointed off the larboard bows to the open waters to the left of charlestons southernmost tip the battery more towards the ashley theres good ground there sir well clear of any ship bound for the piers along the cooper well clear of the middle ground and shutes folly bad for desertion but a short row to town there is a long tongue of shallows to starboard from the citys tip to the deeper channel of the cooper mr caldwell their sailing master said pointing to his chart pinned to the traverse board of the compass binnacle cabinet sure is and ill conn you well west of it sir the pilot vowed with your permission captain lewrie ill take charge of the deck proceed sir lewrie allowed with a smile the first officer lt westcott and mr caldwell stood close by the pilot as if ready to secondguess the fellow but not close enough to discomfort him topsls reefed spanker and the inner and outer jibs will be enough i think on this breeze the pilot said peering about at his own set of harbour marks the slant of the commissioning pendant high aloft and the rippling of the sails oh one thing sir hope you dont mind but would it kill your soul to be anchored within two or three cables of a french ship that laid them all aback producing grimaces on the faces of the quarterdeck officers some wide eyes on some or slitted eyes on the others what manner of french ship sir lewrie warily asked after his initial surprise dont rightly know sir the pilot breezily admitted shes schooner rigged might have come up from the antilles to trade he added with a shrug ah lets lay her head a point more to starboard if you please sirs steer direct for the tall church spire helmsman did you pilot her in sir lewrie asked not me no captain she came in almost two days ago when i was off the pilot went on pacing from one side of the front of the quarterdeck to the other and peering close overside when he returned to amidships and the helm he said i know the gentleman who did though he said shes fairly big for a schooner mightve been built in a new england yard he reckoned from her lines and the rake of her masts did he comment on her being armed lewrie further asked his excitement rising lord captain lewrie who aint the pilot cracked cocking his head back for a good laugh what with the war and all its common sense to be armed never can tell when a warship a privateer or an outright rogue pirate crosses your hawse no matter which flag youre flying war makes it parlous for merchant ships of any nation the guilty and the innocent he pointedly added having a dig at the british practice of stopping and inspecting any ship that they encountered on the suspicion that they might be trading with the foe brace up bosun lt westcott called out mind the luff of the headsls and fore topsl cast of the log mister grainger five knots and a bit sir they were past the lighthouse and the beacon now abreast of fort johnston on james island with the city beginning to spread out before their bows lewrie trusted that the pilot and his officers had the situation wellenough in hand to go forward to the break of the quarterdeck and lift his dayglass for a good look at the city and spy out the french schooner if shes not a privateer im a turk in a turban he thought noting the rake of her masts that the pilot had mentioned in down east new england yankee style which would make her fly like a tern and as weatherly as a witch there was a large bluewhitered french tricolour flag streaming over her stern one more suitable to a frigatesized warship as if to proudly flaunt her nationality after a sniff of disgust he swung his telescope to look over the city the few times hed put into charleston during the revolution after general clinton had conquered it and given how short his shore excursions had been hed always been impressed by the beauty of the town the impressive residences and how wide were the streets broad street which ran across from the ashley to the cooper was an hundred feet wide and to a lad used to the close meandering and reeky lanes of london the sense of open space had made quite an impression beyond that charleston was awash in palmettos white oaks festooned by wreaths of spanish moss in graceful weeping willows and all manner of brilliant flowering flora as exotic as any isle in the indies but richer grander and more civilised than even kingston jamaica ever been here captain lewrie the pilot took time to ask long long ago lewrie told him smiling in reverie when i was a midshipman back when saint michaels spire was painted black some said that was for mourning when the city surrendered to general clinton their pilot said actually the rebels had painted it black so the british could not use it as a seamark or rangemark but that had been fruitless just as extinguishing the lighthouse and the beacon had been always liked charleston lewrie went on though we never stayed long come in with despatches sail out the next day mostly i ate well when i was allowed ashore rutted well too at that mansioncumbrothel up the bank of the cooper lewrie told himself with a smug grin remembering how he and his fellow mid david avery had sought the place out to celebrate averys birthday and how theyd been set upon by rebel footpads on their way back to the docks a quick peek with his telescope up the cooper showed that the commercial piers and warehouses had grown past where that mansion had been another part of his past long gone he realised along with david avery who had fallen not a year later i was always inpressed by how open and wide the town is laid out lewrie commented thats to catch any cooling breeze in the summers captain the pilot said with a wry snicker nothing gets built too high or too close together if people dont want to melt like candle wax excuse me sir lt westcott intruded might you wish that we come in allstanding and anchor man o war fashion just to thumb our noses at the frogs hmm best not mister westcott lewrie decided were a bit out of practice at that evolution and if we mucked it up wed never hear the end of it lewrie thought when we come about into the wind well let go the kedge and stand on til we lose way then let go the best bower lewrie said the depth there sir he asked their pilot four fathom and a bit captain unless we get a full gale a rare thing this time of year a threetoone scope will suit the pilot informed him hms reliant ghosted on another quartermile or so before their pilot suggested that she should be put about that brought the ship within a cable of the anchored french schooner whose decks were now full of spectators smartly now mister westcott lewrie snapped helm hard down topmen aloft westcott shouted sailors scrambled up the shrouds to the topsl yards to haul up and brail up in harbour gaskets while hands on the gangways hauled at the clews to draw the topsls upwards spilling wind from them other men tended the spanker over the quarterdeck freed the staysls and jibs so they could fly over to the opposite tack and keep some drive going as the kedge was freed to splash into the harbour and the thick hawse cable to run free reliant paid off the wind a bit right on the edge of stays a while longer before the helm was put up and the ships bow faced the sea breeze directly which slowly brought her to a full stop at that moment the bower anchor was let go after that with the squaresls gasketed and the staysls and jibs and spanker handed it was a matter of tweaking on the capstans to take in on the kedge cable let out the bower cable to place the frigate equidistant from her anchors at equal strain nicely done mister west what the devil lewrie began to say the crew of the french schooner had burst into song shouting the words of the marseillaise to taunt them french sailors were in the shrouds atop the bulwarks and lowered gaff booms shaking their fists slapping their arses in derision and making insulting finger signs quite a lot of them lewrie pointed out with a wry smile on his face too many to be a merchantman do you wish to salute them sir lt westcott asked looking as if he wished that they would some of lewries officers and hands were scowling and cursing already bosun sprague lewrie bellowed hands to the larboard gangway sir the bosun asked looking up at the quarterdeck his face asquint twofingered salute mister sprague lewrie ordered a twofingered salute to those snaileatin sons of bitches by example he went to the larboard bulwarks and lifted his right hand his fore and middle finger jutted upward into a vee a very british insult and fuck diplomacy he angrily thought chapter twentysix according to the instructions from admiralty the british consul at charleston was one mr edward cotton an englishman not a local man who kept offices at the corner of east bay street and queen street conveniently near the city wharves lewrie wished to go ashore at once to see him but there was an host of things to see to beforehand the best he could do was to send midshipman entwhistle in a cutter with a quick introductory note and a request for an audience though lewrie halfway hoped that the rare appearance of a royal navy frigate would pique the fellows curiosity and lure him to boarding reliant first there could be no shore liberty for any of his hands for certain it was a risk to send too many of the ships boats ashore for firewood water and victuals for the chance to desert would be quite a temptation even to sailors who had been with the ship since she had been recommissioned and had pay and prizemoney due and certainly there would be many patriotic south carolinians who would encourage reliant s people to flee limey despots and become free americans with a french schooner mostlikely an enemy privateer present he could not let his guard down by putting the ship out of discipline for a carouse either marine lt simcock already had fully uniformed men posted as sentries at the bow stern and on each gangway fully armed with loaded and bayoneted muskets to prevent desertion too yet some of his people must go ashore mr cadbury was eager as were the officers who busily invented excuses to set foot ashore for a few hours surprisingly so did yeovill and the black ships cook mr cooke who accompanied cadbury to the foot of the starboard ladderway to the quarterdeck both men were turned out in their best buckled shoes canvas trousers clean shirts with neckerchiefs short blue sailors jackets and flat tarred hats as scrubbed up and freshshaven as they would be at sunday divisions lewrie could not recall cooke ever being turned out so well permission to go ashore with the purser sir yeovill said me too sah cooke spoke up looking puppydog eager dye think thatd be safe for you cooke lewrie asked south carolinas a slave state if a gang o bullybucks decide to snatch you up for a quick profit theres little we could do about it but complain beg ya pahdon sah but id be with mistah cadbury an yeovill heah cooke objected im in uniform an i don sound like no po field hand aint no slavuh gonna mess with me sah like all navy hands he wore a clasp knife in a leather sheath on his hip and he was big and strong hmm itd be best did i write you out a certificate just in case lewrie decided so you and yeovill can protect the purser if some people try to mess with him there may be some lingering resentment of anyone from england or jamaica lewrie added with a wry expression he didnt have to go to his greatcabins for his clerk faulkes was on deck scrubbed up and dressed in clean clothes hoping like all the others that he might get a few hours ashore too once the certificate had been dictated written out in faulkess excellent copperplate hand and given to lewrie to sign it was given to cooke who read it over nodded grinned and carefully folded it to stick into an inside pocket of his short jacket thankee capm sah cooke said knuckling his hat brim you can read and write cooke lewrie had to ask surprised de ol sailin master in proteus mistah winwood taught me sah cooke said with a broader grin how else i follah de recipes evahbody give me fo somethin special sah very well then carry on mister cadbury lewrie said anything special for you sir cadbury asked yeovill will see to my wants but thankee for asking sir lewrie told him with a quick grin oh just as there may be some hotblooded brother johnathons ashore who think the revolution hasnt ended keep a weather eye for any french sailors if that schooners a privateer as im sure she is its good odds that her crew will be allowed more liberty than a naval vessel we will walk wary sir cadbury promised him daunted not one whit and still eager to be off take what joy ye may lewrie said a faint scowl appearing on his face i will have to go below and change to impress best and heaviest broadcloth wool coat lewrie sourly thought silk shirt and all no matter how muggy it is and that damned sash and star instead of his gig lewrie took the other cutter with midshipman grainger and his usual boat crew with liam desmond his coxn strokeoar patrick furfy and seven other oarsman all turned out in sunday divisions best too with a boat jack flying from a short staff at the stern and of course his arrival at a landing stage a block or two short of queen street drew a fair number of gawkers making him feel as if he was the star attraction in a rareeshow the arrival of a british frigate midshipman entwhistles jaunt to bear his note to the consul then cadburys mission with a uniformed black sailor had brought out the idlers of all classes captain lewrie i presume a welldressed gentleman at the top of the landing stage called out to him thankfully in an english accent edward cotton his majestys consul to the port of charleston your servant sir good morning mister cotton and thank you very much for coming down to meet me lewrie replied as the bow man hooked onto the stage with his gaff the oars were tossed and stood vertically then boated smartly at desmonds commands lewrie stood made his way amidships of the cutter then stepped from the gunnl to the landing stage they doffed hats to each other then shook hands your note did not inform me that you were a knight of the bath captain lewrie cotton said with a probing brow up baronet tboot lewrie said with a shrug and a brief grimace too recent tsink in yet he tried to explain i see sir cotton replied seeming a tad disappointed that lewrie didnt take his honours as seriously as he and others of his social level might have reward for a gallant action may i ask for a battle off the chandeleur islands near new orleans lewrie informed him we stopped the french from landing a regiment and took four warships and a transport september two years ago no one told us the french would sell louisiana to the united states a few months later the news of american purchase was an eightday wonder to all here too sir alan cotton told him with a laugh a pity that we could not dine you out with the leading citizens of charleston on the strength of that how your actions guaranteed that bonaparte abandoned hopes of a french lodgement in new orleans and france in charge of the vast territories west of the mississippi everyone is simply thirsting for quick expansion of settlements in such a vast virgin land but your ship may only stay in charleston for three days before you must sail hey lewrie asked confused well sir alan with a french vessel in harbour the formalities must be strictly observed cotton said admiralty law and the neutrality of the united states might have allowed you a longer stay but for her presence cotton explained jutting his chin seaward at the french schooner just as your arrival will force captain mollien to sail he could have kept his ship here for some time yet but for that shes a privateer isnt she lewrie snapped his suspicions confirmed and his eyes going from bluegrey to a colder arctic colour i strongly suspect she is mr cotton agreed but here now you will not make any moves against her will you not right here in harbour mean tsay lewries intensity and those icy grey eyes made mr cotton fear that lewrie might be rash enough to attack the schooner outright in a neutral harbour lewrie scoffed not likely no sir cotton was immediately and visibly relieved let us go to my offices sir alan out of the moring sun so we may discover the reason for your port call mr cotton offered delighted sir lewrie said smiling again mister grainger return to the ship ill be ashore some time til supper at the your pardons sir alan cotton interrupted but i do hope you will allow me to offer you the hospitality of my house for the night and a shore supper even at short notice i could reserve a table at a public dining establishment and invite a few of charlestons prominent citizens show the flag all that what in that case i gladly accept your kind invitation mister cotton lewrie said thinking that a freshwater bath would be more than welcome after spongebathing aboard ship with a meagre allotment of daily issue if its possible there is a mister douglas mcgilliveray with whom i should very much like to make a reacquaintance i met him during the quasiwar when our navy and the united states worked together against the french a most excellent suggestion sir alan cotton enthused he of one of the oldest families and of a longestablished trading firm to boot ill send him and his wife an invitation at once ill sleep out of the ship for tonight mister grainger lewrie told the midshipman return for me tomorrow by four bells of the forenoon warn yeovill and pettus aye aye sir shall we go then sir alan cotton bade it is but a short stroll to my establishment you are to fulfill your orders with but one ship sir alan mr cotton said with a shake of his head after he had read the directives from london that lewrie had presented to him such a task is quite herculean i scraped up three smaller sloops to help lewrie told him between sips of hot tea theyre prowling round saint augustine at present weve made a small beginning putting a wee scare into spanish privateers on the coast of cuba scouted the florida keys and took on two schooners in mayami bay burned em spanish privateers i expect are as thick as fleas on a hound you havent seen any o them here at charleston have you mister cotton no spanish privateers no sir alan cotton informed him a rare spanish merchantman now and again but none have put in in the last few months american ships with goods from spanish colonies dominate the trade though theres little exported to the dons the spanish crown demands a strict mercantilism it must be imports from spain or another of their colonies carried in spanish bottoms or nothing there is a spanish consul here don diego de belemtwiddling his thumbs and attending parties poor fellow with nothing to do for his benighted country quite charming actually and the french lewrie asked now and then cotton said with a sly nod captain mollien has put in several times ostensibly on trade from the french west indies isles though theres never many goods landed or cargo taken aboard for export shes the otarie by the way sir alan seeing lewries brow go up in question he added it means sea lion are you able to determine what he does land and what he buys in exchange lewrie asked goods looted from prizes powder and shot for his guns thankfully since my posting here three years ago i have been able to cultivate good relations with the trading houses and the ship chandlers of charleston sir alan so i am able to be made conversant of any violations of american neutrality to aid on that head there is a small united states naval presence in charleston one or two gunboats and a cutter from the revenue service to enforce the customs house officials i can assure you that no french vessel that puts into charleston is able to purchase warlike materiel or lands suspect goods well good lewrie said a tad relieved to hear that that would be one more american port to scratch off his list what happens in stono inlet or edisto however is less sure cotton continued if an unscrupulous merchant could load up a small coasting vessel and meet a french privateer well i have no purview and few ways of learning of such dealings though as i said the us navy and revenue service do keep an eye on the possibility but not a constant watch and georgetown lewrie asked squirming in his chair i look out for our interests in georgetown as well sir cotton told him though i do not get up there more than once every two months or so i thought to look in on our way south from wilmington but wasnt sure if i could get my ship into winyah bay lewrie said are there any chandleries there that could handle the needs of privateers wood water and perhaps some salt meats cotton said with a cock of his head as if picturing the port and its waterfront in his mind building by building he then shook his head in the negative there is the rice trade which draws middlingsized ships in the coasting business river trade up the waccamaw black river the pee dee as far up as bucks port and commercial fishing sufficient to the local market some coastal ships serve the slave trade clothing food and such for the rice plantations as well as slaves themselves but most of that comes from charleston if it is not grown locally at bucks port there is a decent shipyard boatyard really and there is some construction and repair at georgetown itself up the sampit river is a vessel in need of cordage sails repair work or powder and shot theyd mostlike call in charleston but as ive said a close watch is kept by the us and south carolina governments perhaps savannah georgia then lewrie said with a sigh as he finished his cup of tea and wishing he could doff his coat and waistcoat and loosen his neckstock though it was only ten of the morning the spring day was getting warm and mr cottons offices were stifling more tea sir alan cotton asked inclining his head to summon a black servant in a dark suit perhaps in the side garden mr cottons establishment was a modest version of the grand mansions of charleston of only two storeys not three or four with his private study library dining room and parlour as well as his consular offices on the first floor the house was walled off from east bay street and queen street with brick walls topped with ornamental iron fences lewrie had noticed a small balcony above facing east bay street and the cooper river and the wharves and a larger balcony projecting from the left of the house perhaps we could substitute a cooler beverage than tea sir alan cotton further tempted he rose from his chair and followed the black house servant to a set of glazed double doors that led out to a side garden two or three steps down from the house and lewrie found himself on a brick patio beneath that projecting balcony where there was a small round table and four chairs a pair of woodslat benches and several large terracotta planters awash in azaleas and roses there were other flowering bushes and flower beds though lewrie could only be sure of the roses and the azaleas there was a large patch of lawn before one got to the rear of the property where the kitchens were to separate its heat from the house lewrie was amazed to feel a rush of coolness even a mild restoring breeze we will have the citrus tea amos cotton ordered from his manservant yassuh lemons and limes wild oranges in season cotton explained with an admixture of cool tea the physicians all say that drinking too much citrus juice in warm climates can ruin your health but ive done it for years here and have yet to suffer long ago i found that a pot of tea that had gone cold aboard ship was refreshing lewrie heartily agreed it was drink it or throw it out and with some lemon juice and sugar except in very cold weather i have a large pot brewed each day ashore i allow myself a whole gallon until the stored winter ice runs out i prefer it with a sliver or two mr cotton continued though by high summer ice is hard to come by in charleston anywhere in the low country sometimes i add a bit of sweet rhenish wine though that is also hard to come by the war do you see were you back in england though mister cotton thered be all the rhenish yed wish lewrie said sprawling at ease with his booted legs extended our illustrious smugglers could even fetch you arctic ice in august french wines brandies dutch gin napoleon bonaparte can claim hes shut europe off from great britain but nobody told the smugglers mr cotton smiled and nodded in agreement then turned soberer looking off into the middle distance for a long moment before speaking again you know of course sir alan that it took some time after the american revolution before british goods were acceptable again in the united states i doubt charleston has seen a british warship in port since their constitution was ratified no french goods were preferred and still are do you see i saw that in wilmington lewrie agreed as a large pitcher of the cool tea was brought out on a coinsilver tray and two tall glasses were poured for them especially so here in the low country cotton went on after a pleasing sip many of the settlers hereabouts were of french protestant emigre stock whose memories of being massacred by catholic kings and cardinals dimmed considerably france is elegance style and the epitome of gracious living to them as it is with everyone in america who aspires to grandeur and believe me sir alan no one aspires grander than south carolinians now when the peace of amiens was in force charleston was flooded with luxury french goods not seen since the first war with republican france in the wines the brandies and exotic spirits you mentioned as well as lace satins silks furniture chinawares and womens fashions from hats to slippers came in regularly and were snapped up practically the instant they were landed on the piers the shopkeepers bedamned yet now that trade is almost completely gone again the last two years entire you mentioned smugglers cotton coyly hinted meaning lewrie slowly said puzzling it out if there was a way to bring luxury goods in people might turn a blind eye to the trade and whats allowed in exchange too i gather that you suspect that this captain mollien is bringing in goods he doesnt declare to the customs house no lewrie said dropping that thought as implausible his schooners too small for a second secret cargo and if french luxuries are unavailable thonest traders then wheres he gettin em it dont make sense it is only a suspicion so far sir alan mr cotton mused perhaps from the cargoes of british ships hes taken who knows not from homewardbound west indies trades lewrie objected thats all rum molasses sugar and dye wood trades headed to the west indies dont feature french goods either where is he mistah cotton sah the house servant said returning to the side garden deys a gennulmun come tcall on ya sah he says he has ta speak with ya tell the fellow i am busy amos cotton gruffly said who is it by the way it be mistah gambon sah the french consul gambon damn mr cotton testily snapped of all the gall one thing the frogs have in plenty mister cotton is gaul lewrie japed gaul hey it didnt go down anywhere near how he wished it though for mr cotton was too upset amos tell msieur gambon that i cannot receive him now but if he wishes to cotton began to say bon matin edward good morning to you came a cheery heavily accented voice from within the house as the fellow in question barged right out through the double doors to the side garden an what a fine morning eet ees nestce pas oh my oui such clear skyes such a cool breeze allo to all cotton and lewrie shot to their feet mr cotton diplomatically struggling to hide his glower and lewrie with one brow up in wonder he beheld a dapper balding toad of a man not over five feet five in height gotchgutted and rotund with good living and dressed in the latest fashion msieur gambons shirt collar stood up in points to his double chins and splayed out as if to support his head which was as round as a melon and his fullmoon face gambons sideburns were brushed forward and what little hair remaining on his pate was slicked forward in a pomaded fringe his fashionably snug trousers were strapped under elegant light shoes yet they and his short doublebreasted waistcoat bulged at the waist like a pregnant woman you eentroduce me to your guest edward m gambon requested with a wide smile on his face as he handed his hat gloves and walking stick to the servant he and hees terrifying warship are ze reason i ave come to call upon you een such haste after all dear edward een ze name of emperor napoleon bonaparte and glorious france i come to lodge ze strongest formal protest against the frigates presence the devil you say msieur mr cotton spluttered irked to the edge of diplomacy and beyond this is beyond the pale it is simply not done in such fashion and might i remind you msieur gambon that a british vessel is free to call at any neutral american port from maine to edward edward pray do not distress yourself gambon goodnaturedly countered as if enjoying his little game such distress ees bad for your liver ze choler ze bile you do not introduce me ah me pauvre gambon msieur capitaine allow me to name myself albertlouis gambon hees majesty emperor napoleon bonapartes consul een charleston my carte de visite he said with a bow before reaching into a slitpocket of his strained waistcoat to draw forth a bit of pasteboard and snapping it out within lewries reach with the elegance and panache of a magician producing a coin an oui capitaine mon ami gambon added with a sly grin i am zee frog weeth a great deal of gall hawn hawn chapter twentyseven msieur gambon it is i who must protest your insistence upon entering my house in such an inapropriate manner mr cotton snapped tut tut edward we are simply conducting ze beezeness of diplomacy gambon told him most cherrymerry weel you name yourself to me eef edward ees reluctant to do so msieur capitaine an ees that your delectable citrus tea edward i do prefer eet best when ze peaches are een season but may i ave a glass ii must if only to get rid of you you boorish pest mr cotton sourly gravelled msieur i name to you captain sir alan lewrie baronet commanding his majestys frigate reliant for a gotchgut and a fellow who sounded so enthusiastic about the levelling glories of france gambon performed a very graceful and elegant bow with one foot extended en pointe and one hand swept low across his body like a lifelong aristocrat lewrie responded with a sketchier bow from the waist and a nod of his head msieur gambon he brusquely said such suspicion gambon replied with a little laugh such an aversion to the pleasantries as eef i am ze devil heemself ha no you just work for him lewrie coolly said eet ees as i thought zen gambon replied fazed not a whit and still the merry andrew or as i feared rather ze capitaine ees implacable een hees hatred for everything french so much so i fear he weel be unable to restrain heemself from making war upon innocent sailors right here een charleston arbour your otarie dye mean sir lewrie countered your privateer schooner ze onest merchant trader from ze french west indies who as come to trade gambon stated with another smile and a shrug with such a large crew and so wellarmed sir lewrie scoffed which island in the french west indies edward i am certain you ave amis een ze customs ouse een ze government who tell you of otarie s registry an er manifests gambon breezed off wheech isle i ave forgotten but edward knows e can tell you later oui no tea for me he plaintively begged not for those who ignore the protocols mr cotton told him id much admire you state your business quickly excuse though this call was to take sir alans measure tres bien gambon said with a putupon sigh as you expect edward capitaine looow you say eeti ave already lodged a formal protest weeth the american navy officer present weeth ze american governments senior representative ere and weeth ze mayor an ze council de la cite denouncing ze presence of a british warship ere expressing my fears that something untoward could occur eef eet stays one hour longer i ave also expressed zat such presence ees ze insult to american neutrality to ze united states ze state of south carolina an ze cite of charleston so much of an insult zat ze local citoyens may take to ze streets een anger oh please albert mr cotton spluttered in exasperation making lewrie feel that in private the two men got along a lot better than their publick personae allowed and did you also tell them that reliant is the vanguard of a british invasion that shes going to open fire on the city and land her marines to rape their mothers i take my duty to hees majesty ze emperor mos seriously gambon bristled up like a hedgehog in a grand flounce an i ave too much love and respect for ze people of america to see zem armed and how far did you get with that twaddle cotton scoffed ze matter ees being looked eento mos closely by ze officials to whom i spoke gambon assured them which is to say they didnt even give you the time of day mr cotton said with a wry chuckle is that all msieur gambon eet ees not msieur cotton gambon replied still on a formal high horse and in gravity i ask of ze distinguished capitaine what was the time zat your frigate came to anchor msieur its pronounced looree accent on the first syllable msieur lewrie told him in equal gravity secretly amused by the posturing wee toadman and his few streaks of pomaded hair we came to wind and let go the bower at three bells of the forenoon gambon twitched his mouth as if lewrie was speaking hindoo that is to say halfpast nine this morning lewrie went on grinning a bit zen i ardly ave to remind you capitaine looree zat ze admiralty law recognised by all civilised nations require you to sail from charleston before half pas nine of ze morning three days hence gambon slyly said further capitaine eet ees not permitted zat you be allowed to return to charleston or any ozzer port een ze state of south carolina weethout a reasonable time at sea beyond ze limit of three miles so you do not violate american neutrality by remaining een coastal waters nestce pas of a certainty sir lewrie replied beginning to get a sinking feeling in his innards that he was about to be had een point of fact capitaine an edward may bear me out on zis gambon happily went on since ze united states ees by zeir constitution a federalist republique not a confederation of sovereign and separate states weeth zeir own maritime laws it would be a gross violation of american sovereignty and neutrality eef you sailed into any ozzer american port until a reasonable time as passed i made zis point weeth ze american government representative and ze senior officer of ze american navy while e as but two small gunboats an cannot be expected to enforce hees nations laws against such a powerful frigate eet would be mos regrettable should e fin you loath to depart on time or ow you say break you passage at beaufort or port royal perhaps even at savannah or wilmington oui god rot the little shit lewrie silently fumed hes got me by the nutmegs just look at him enjoyin this i also mus point out to your excellent capitaine edward gambon continued turning to mr cotton and almost purring in triumph zat by admiralty law to avoid ze effusion of blood and ze introduction of la guerre mos horrible in neutral waters capitaine mollien of otarie an onest an umble merchantman of ze mos peaceful an innocent intent mus be given ze grace period of at least twelve ours between ze time e sails an ze time zat capitaine looree ees allowed to sail hawn hawn but of course gambon added turning to lewrie with the hugest shiteating grin on his phyz so esteemed an officer een ze royal navy ardly as to be reminded of ze laws of nations non ehm well of course not msieur gambon cotton said with a scowl and a darting glance at lewrie as if to wonder if he had known that beforehand shouldve read up on em first lewrie told himself steaming en fin edward i present you weeth copies of my protests to ze authorities gambon said i take my leave an fin my own way out my duty to ze emperor complete au revoir msieur cotton mon vieux au revoir capitaine looree i weesh you a bon voyage but not too soon hawn hawn gambon gave them both a sketchier bow from the waist and a dip of his head before turning to reenter the house to gather up his hat gloves and walking stick hmpf lewrie snorted once he was sure that gambon was out of earshot what an insufferable little toad insufferable at times yes mr cotton agreed after wheezing out a deep sigh of relief from between puffed lips when not on official business though he can be quite witty and amusing plays a fine game of chess and dances extremely well the ladies of charleston adore him and invite him to many of their balls and cotillions and napoleon bonaparte is kind to dogs and children lewrie scoffed what was that nonsense about stayin in port twelve hours after that frog schooner sails stuff and nonsense indeed cotton said with a snort sitting down to his tea once more my understanding of neutrality laws as the americans enforce them allows you to sail the same time as he does just so long as you do not engage him inside the three mile limit in international waters you may do as you please though it might not put our country in a good light if you did mr cotton cautioned a second later do please sit sir alan are you able to bring mollien to action it might be best did it happen fifteen or twenty miles offshore out of sight so that the patriotic citizens of charleston have no reason to sour relations between our country and theirs which are tetchy enough as it is and when did that bastard come to anchor sir lewrie asked beginning to suspect a very bad scenario a pitfall which he hadnt seen coming about two days ago mr cotton told him between sips of tea from his glass strictly speaking he must depart by tomorrow but that hinges upon captain molliens ship being deemed a national ship of the french navy or a privateer a naval auxiliary if no one will declare the schooner a man o war a merchantman may stay as long as he likes ill have tsail while he can sit at anchor and wave his bare arse at me lewrie gawped i could lurk five or six miles offshore and catch him when he comes out ehm that might put a strain on things sir alan cotton warned slowly shaking his head in the negative he can stay a week or two longer and id have tstay lewrie angrily thought and there goes lookin into savannah or rejoining the squadron off saint augustine lewrie sat though nowhere near at ease and took a sip or two of the cool tea he screwed up his face in thought realising that he was caught in a cleft stick the only thing to do was to have a wee laugh sir alan mr cotton enquired surprised by lewries humour i might as well have twait twelve hours mister cotton lewrie told him still with a sour grin on his face were i mollien id wait til within an hour or so of the peak of high tide and set sail for the main ship channel timing it so that im crossing the charleston bar at slackwater of that high tide imagine this sir as soon as i see him making up to a single bow anchor i send ashore for a pilot reliant draws almost eighteen feet whilst he draws much less perhaps only twelve now how quickly do ye think the frenchlovin local pilots guildd answer my request at least one hour or maybe two hours later you would be forced to wait for the next days high tide i see mr cotton said with a grimace of sad understanding hell take this trick lewrie gloomed but if he wants to keep his crew happy hell have to take prizes tkeep them in food and rum and put money in their pockets privateers are like whalers they sign on for a share a lay of the profits of a cruise if he wants prizes from our big sugar trades hell have tstay somewhere close to the florida straits and the straits between the bahamas and spanish florida my contacts in wilmington told me theres no privateers working out of north carolina that moore and cashman know of at any rate lewrie cautioned himself with an urge to cross the fingers of one hand as he said it theyre mostly schooners or twomasted sloops in the main lewrie continued his head cocked over in thought they cant remain at sea much more than two months before they run short of everything and once our convoys come level with charleston theyre catching a wind thatll carry them noreast further out in the open sea well to windward of cape hatteras and harder to find or chase after this mollien is mostlike working out of spanish florida or cuba where he can find shelter and sustenance with his allies the dons where he can sell his prizes in the open stead of sneakin em into an american port tsell em on the sly why yes sir alan mr cotton energetically agreed think of this aspect do enemy privateers work from american ports or inlets where unscrupulous traders sell them supplies and purchase their prizes mollien and his compatriots would be at the mercy of those traders and the muchinflated prices they would charge and the criminally low sums theyd pay to buy captured ships and their cargoes itd take a fair parcel of money to cobble up false papers for a prize aye lewrie said with a genuine laugh perhaps the value of the cargoes and the later sale of the ships somewhere else would pay for that but the risk of atracting attention with the customs or revenue services well too much risk to engage upon then this whole jaunt down the american coast is a goosechase lewrie thought dreamt up by penpushers at admiralty whove read too many bloody novels where would a criminal trader get the captains and crews for the captured ships would be my question mr cotton said topping up their glasses without summoning his black house servant thats too many people in on the secret and someones sure to blab now they could claim that they had sailed down to havana with money and extra crew so they could pick up condemned vessels and bring them back to america to register them along with cuban export goods which in the main are the same export goods one might find in the holds of a captured british shipsugar molasses rum and tobaccobut too many of such purchases would surely draw suspicions of the authorities register them in savannah or charleston say then hire on yet another captain and crew to sail them north to the chesapeake to philadelphia new york or boston i hardly think so it must all unravel sooner or later mr cotton declared quite sure of his logic hmm in the cold light of day it does seem rather implausible doesnt it lewrie admitted perhaps the most risk that some criminal chandlers might run would be to supply privateers in one of the inlets you mentioned in the dark of night and far out of sight of officials to extend their time at sea without a long unprofitabled voyage back to cuba or spanish florida to revictual that would be much more feasible sir alan cotton agreed hmpf lewrie said slouching in his chair at more ease than a minute before i spose i still must peek into savannah unless that twaddle about breaking my passage really is a violation of american neutrality i think that would only apply were you being pursued by the enemy in strength and meant to avoid combat sir alan mr cotton told him then laughed out loud and i very much doubt that such an intrepid officer as yourself would ever do so ha ha it would be an act more suitable to an enemy warship trying to avoid the inevitable yet unwilling to intern herself in that case the warship in question would be ordered out to sea within seventytwo hours or surrender herself to the care of the neutral country you have orders to speak with the consul in savannah mister hereford good go do so and gambons screechy objections bedamned excellent lewrie said with a sigh of relief mr cotton pulled a pocket watch from his waistcoat and opened the lid it is nigh noon sir alan he announced and i must own to a peckish feeling might you wish to dine on the town or will you trust that i have a very talented cook who by this hour is usually ready to serve a toothsome dinner i would be grateful for more of your kind hospitality mister cotton and dining in would suit admirably lewrie replied good good another thing i must own to is a most lazy habit sir alan happily one that is as prevalent in south carolinas low country as it is in spanish colonies cotton freely confessed i speak of siesta the afternoon nap barring official duties or a caller as upsetting as msieur gambon i usually put my head down for an hour or two after dinner later in the summer in charleston the afternoon nap is a necessity til late afternoon and its coolness you are welcome to a spare bedchamber one which like my own faces the prevailing breeze ill take you up on that too mister cotton most gladly lewrie assured him and perhaps a cool shore bath before supper it shall be done sir damn whether that frog sails lewrie thought ill have enough fresh water for a proper scrubdown for a rare once chapter twentyeight by half past six that evening lewrie was much refreshed by a good nap in a sinfully soft bed sprawled nude atop the coverlet and cooled by a gentle breeze he was also much cleaner after a brass tub full of cool water had been provided in the washhouse behind the house with enough soap for a thorough scrubbing behind his ears and between his toes hed sudsed his hair and used two whole buckets of water with which to rinse too he had shaved himself quite closely but had submitted to the house servants amoss ministrations when it came to dressing in his best shoregoing uniform that had been sponged and brushed free of catfur completely so for a rare once too with his neckstock tied just so the sprig of hair at the nape of his neck bound with black ribbon his goldtasseled hessian boots newly blacked and buffed his sash and star over his chest and his hundredguinea dress sword on his hip he could take time to stare at himself in the tall cheval mirror and deem himself one hell of a natty fellow and a man possessed of an athletic stature and slimness despite being fourtytwo years of age he still had a full head of midbrown hair turned lighter by the sun below the brim of his cocked hat thankfully closer to dark blond without a hint of grey that still showed no sign of receding his face was bronzed by constant exposure but it was not yet lined though he thought that the raccoon eye look of squint lines at each outer corner of his eyes normal flesh colour against the ruddiness did look a bit comical if people wished to laugh at those squint lines though there was the faint vertical scar upon his left cheek the mark of a longago duel on antigua in his midshipman days to belie them he flashed his teeth pleased that they looked whiter against his skin then puffed his breath into a hand one more of his ginger pastilles would not go amiss witty and charming lewrie thought i think im ready tplease charleston mr cotton laid on a twowheeled onehorse hack for the short trip from his house down to broad street and a hotel which he assured lewrie had a fine dining room it would be a small dinner party assembled at short notice but mr and mrs mcgilliveray would definitely attend as well as the us navy officer commanding the two gunboats which guarded charleston harbour and a few others as they alit by the doors to the hotel lewrie took a moment to savour the early evening broad street was awash in light from many large whaleoil lanthorns that bracketed the entrances of the shops taverns and houses as well as regularly spaced tall street lanthorns which were just being ignited the skies and the thin clouds overhead were shading off to dusk after a spectacular sunset and there was a welcome coolness to the breezes though the air still felt humid red skies at night sailors sleep tight hey sir alan mr cotton japed shall we go in and take a glass of rhenish to prompt our appetite certainly lewrie agreed and here are some of our guests sir mr cotton exclaimed ready to make the introductions lewrie turned with a smile plastered on his phyz recognizing mr douglas mcgilliveray who had captained a converted merchantman a us armed ship in the west indies during the quasiwar with france in there was a fellow in his thirties wearing the uniform of a navy officer still the darkblue coat with the red facings and lapels the red waistcoat and darkblue breeches that had been in style since the revolution at least they got rid o the tricorne hats and changed over to cocked hats they looked like seagoin farmers else ever the good host mr cotton did the introductions first to the mcgilliverays though mr douglas mcgilliveray eagerly offered his hand and introduced his wife himself youre coming up in the world captain lewrie mcgilliveray jovially said the last time we met you wore but one epaulet but now ha ha for bravery and success surely a squadron action off new orleans sir lewrie happily explained so good to see you again sir and in such fine health and mistress mcgilliveray your servant maam he said with a bow and a doff of his hat sir alan the older lady gushed as she dipped a brief curtsy evidently even egalitarian americans did dearly love a lord hmpf whats he doing here mr mcgilliveray muttered making them all turn to take note of three men slouching against the side of a carriage further up the street sir alan allow me to also introduce to you lieutenant israel gordon the officer commanding us naval forces in charleston mr cotton soldiered on after a nervous peek at the three men and his lady mistress susannah gordon lieutenant and mistress gordon allow me to name to you captain sir alan lewrie baronet of his britannic majestys frigate reliant delighted to make your acquaintance lieutenant gordon mistress gordon lewrie said making another bow your servant sir maam and to make your acquaintance captain lewrie lt gordon replied with equal gravity in a jarring new englanders accent his wife sounded like a down east yankee lady too when she spoke mrs gordon found need to use a silk and lace fan even after the days heat had dissipated but weel no one introduce me to such a grand anglais seadog one of the men who had been slouching by the coach requested forcing them all to turn to face him and you are sir mr cotton archly demanded screwing up his mouth over the mans impertinence i name myself the cheeky fellow said smirking capitaine georges mollien of ze otarie a votre service he snatched off a rather small cocked hat one whose ends had been pulled down nearly to his earlobes and laid it on his breast as he performed a sweeping grand mock of a bow bloody frogs lewrie furiously thought never more toplofty and arrogant than when ye cant shoot em on the spot this captain mollien was a short and wiry fellow two inches shorter than lewrie with a pinched foxy face on his hip he wore a smallsword and by the way his darkblue coat sagged there might be a brace of pistols in the side pockets behind him grinning just as scornfully stood two of his mates or crew both beef to the heel lewrie had been the recipient of many a scornful look in his time delivered by superior officers gawping nobility or st jamess palace courtiers whod caught him in pussers slops or shirt sleeves so he knew how to deliver one when given the chance with one brow up in disbelief and a wee lift of a corner of his mouth for amusement he slowly inspected mollien from the top of his head of loose lank and long dark hair to his open shirt collar and neckstock worn loose like a rag in the style of the sansculottes revolutionaries down an ecru linen shirt front to a garish red waist sash and scanned buffcoloured trousers crammed into a pair of topboots indifferently buffed and blacked to molliens scuffed boot toes and back again at the end he said how marvellous for you in a flattoned drawl and turned back to chat with his supper party guests well shall we go in and take seats at our table mr cotton quickly suggested i weeshed to see ze man oo as come to mak war on me the frenchman said a little louder as if wishing to attract witnesses to his bearding of an enemy officer to tak ees measure you are impertinent captain mollien lt gordon stiffly said a dog in a doublet mr mcgilliveray harumphed make war upon you lewrie purred after fighting down an urge to swing about and punch the man in the face i certainly will but not in charleston harbour itll come all in good time gunnl to gunnl he promised with a bright smile not in the middle of broad street either unless you desire a violation of the citys hospitality and american neutrality is that what you came for with your bullybucks to protect you but i am ze peaceful marchand man msieur le capitane mollien said wide eyed and with a hand upon his heart as if basely accused of wrongdoing shrugging and smiling i do not fear one such as you ze softanded anglais aristo he added with another smirk you should lewrie told him stepping a bit closer indeed you should ow much eet cos you to buy your star an sash mollien asked him peutetre i can afford eet too he was louder in his mocking now that he had gathered a halfdozen or so strollers several hundred dead frenchmen lewrie gravelled back think ye can afford that mollien pursed his lips to a slit and he got a wary look on his face his little bit of street theatre was not going the way he had thought the idle fop anglais hed expected was turning out to be anything but and had the anglais s eyes gone as grey as a sword blade from an inoffensive merry blue oh well said sir alan mr cotton crowed well said i say youve had your street raree show captain mollien mcgilliveray gruffly said you delay our supper if youre quite done un type laristo anglais pedale one of molliens sychophant sailors muttered under his breath elbowing his mate with a sneer he just call me a queer lewrie fumed to himself captain mollien the manners of your men sir lt gordon barked one hand flexing on the hilt of his sword such language in the presence of ladies are these the fine manners one usually expects from a frenchman fie his wife chimed in with an outraged hiss mollien had rounded on his sailors to shush them but it was too late to salvage the situation when he turned back to face lewrie his face writhed between hangdog apology and frustrated anger indeed sir begone with you mr mcgilliveray snapped and shifted his grip on his heavy walking stick from elegant cane to hard cudgel a tousan pardons msieurs madames eet was unforgivable and i weel be sure to puneesh eem as soon as mollien tried to say he cant help it mister mcgilliveray lieutenant gordon lewrie drawled again trying to recall the very words that that bloodthirsty old cutthroat and spy zachariah twigg had once said to that foul beast guillaume choundas to goad him at canton china so many years ago captain mollien was born under a threepenny hapenny planet never to be worth a groat a swaggerin gasconading frog whos but one step away from outright piracy mollien looked angry enough to draw his sword or one of his pocket pistols rowed beyond all temperance by lewries caustic slur he also looked utterly cowed and defeated mollien had not put his wee cocked hat back on his head he still held it in both hands as if deferring to his betters gripping it so hard that he was wringing it out of shape like a desperate beggar cant find a way tslink off lewrie gloated you weel nevair catch me capitaine mollien said chin up though looking a tad shaky and unsure as he took a step or two away as if ready to depart yes i will lewrie levelly promised him before the year is out run all ye wish it dont signify leave port this instant i and reliant will find you sooner or later if not me then itll be another of our ships the royal navy will be out there looking for you and the rest of your privateersmen we will always be there just over the horizon adieu captain mollien mollien seemed so frustrated that he didnt even deny that his ship was a privateer he performed a sketchy bow in conge realising that his hat was still in his hand and pinchfaced with his cheeks aflame stepped back and spun on his heels bumping into his sailors he shoved them back hissing threats and curses at their unfortunate comment that had cost him his dignity and had ruined his taunts ahem lt gordon said apologies captain lewrie for that fellow but he isnt an example of american manners and i hope you dont think less of us for his low behaviour or think less of our fair city of charleston sir alan mrs mcgilliveray said in a sweet low country accent she had pulled her own fan out and was fluttering away at molliens effrontery short of a street brawl mistress mcgilliveray nothing ever could diminish my appreciation of such a lovely city lewrie gallantly responded now thats over does anyone feel as peckish as i do indeed lets go in mr mcgilliveray seconded im fair famished quite the street raree mr cotton commented casting a last look down broad saint to assure himself that mollien and his sailors were indeed gone one that redounded to molliens loss ha ha at the end of a successful performance one usually rewards the juggler or singer with tuppence or five pence lewrie said in good takings now that the fellow was gone should i have tossed him something oh no more than a hapenny sir alan mr cotton snickered it wasnt all that good perhaps no more than ha ha a groat as they were led to their table and took their seats lewrie did wonder if mollien was cleverer at sea than he was at mockery or quickwitted repartee had he goaded the man perhaps a tad too raw and what would a clever frog do to get his own back chapter twentynine boat ahoy was the shout from reliant s quarterdeck aye aye the cutters bow man called back showing four fingers in sign that a postcaptain was aboard it was absurd really for the boat was one of reliant s cutters manned by lewries usual boats crew and had left the frigate not half an hour before and it would take a blind man not to see lewrie seated aft by coxn desmond in all his shoregoing finery the bow man hooked onto the main chain platform with his gaff and the oars were tossed vertically then boated lewrie carefully made his way to amidships stood on the gunnl briefly seized hold of the after most stays and stepped aboard by the chain platform then up the boarding battens bosun spragues silver call piped the crew on watch faced the entryport and removed their hats in deference a sideparty of seamen and marines greeted him and the ships dog bisquit went mad with joy barking yipping and dancing about daring to stand on his hind legs and put paws on lewries midriff his tail whipping like a flag in a full gale and his tongue lolling welcome back aboard sir lt westcott said doffing his hat in salute and trying not to laugh out loud thankee mister westcott lewrie said ruffling bisquit on his head and neck with his left hand and doffing with his right i would stand upon my dignity if i could find it now now get down sir and behave yourself my apologies for cutting your time ashore short sir but the french schooner began preparations to sail and westcott began to explain and youdve preferred to go after her instanter but thought leavin me behindd look bad lewrie interrupted grinning something like that sir westcott replied shrugging she made up to a single bower and hauled in to short stays beginning about an hour ago shes just taken a pilot aboard and looks ready to weigh sir you sent for a pilot sir lewrie asked removing a telescope from the compass binnacle cabinet and going to the larboard side for a closer look at the french vessel i did sir but so far westcott said but none have responded so far mister westcott lewrie posed sounding tongueincheek and more idly amused than upset and aint that just uncanny aye sir as i suspected lewrie told him over his shoulder his attention focussed on the activity aboard molliens schooner do we confer with the sailing master i believe well find that shell be crossin the charleston bar just at the peak of high tide right at slackwater and by the time a harbour pilot responds to our request the tidell be on the ebb we might squeak over the bar not that mollien needs that much depth under his keel but we do mores the point captain mollien will think himself a slyboots but he aint mollien sir is that the french captains name lt westcott asked aye lewrie told him shutting the tubes of the telescope and turning inboard to face his first officer met him last night him and a brace of his larger sailors he almost ruined a most pleasant and congenial supper party lewrie said with a laugh filling lieutenant westcott in on the confrontation and on how mollien had had to slink away with his tail between his legs fuming lieutenant gordon of the united states navy contingent and his wife accompanied mister cotton and me back to the consuls residence afterwards just in case mollien felt pettish enough twaylay me but nothing happened i had a good nights sleep after that damme whats the dog doin on the quarterdeck mister westcott lewrie demanded of a sudden noting that bisquit had slunk from the sailtending gangway to shelter by one of the pounder carronade slides well i expect he followed you sir westcott replied he adores everybody you included and has come to expect that anyone coming offshore has a treat for him well i do lewrie gruffly confessed but hell get it on the weather deck not up here mister munsell attend me if you please aye sir the midshipman perkily replied see that the dog gets this lewrie directed digging into his shoregoing duffel but not on the quarterdeck hmm aye sir too late the aroma of freshfried ham on freshbaked bisquits with gravy carefully wrapped up in a packet of tarred sailcloth got the dog to its feet instead of peeking longingly from the shelter of the carronade slide bisquit sprinted forward and began to prance and whine round lewrie midshipman munsell took him by the collar to tow him to the starboard ladderway and then to the main deck to feed him his treats the rest of your time ashore went well dare i ask sir lt westcott enquired mainwell indeed lewrie told him with a pleased expression further explaining that their consul mr cotton and his supper guest mr douglas mcgilliveray from one of the great trading houses in the state and a man who had his finger on the pulse of charleston commerce did not suspect that any aid and comfort was being provided to french or spanish privateers and that vessels such as captain molliens otarie rarely called at all no i think well have to search further south of here mister westcotthilton head inlet stono inlet port royal or savannah georgia beg pardon sirs midshipman rossyngton intruded but the french vessels anchor is free and shes hoisting sail calmly mister rossyngton lewrie cautioned him theres not a thing we can do to stop her i meant to ask mister westcott he went on turning to the first officer once more if theres anything out of the ordinary to report whilst i was ashore everything went well sir with nothing out of the ordinary westcott told him mister cadbury did say that he and the workingparty that went ashore with him did get some mild bother from some of the locals and from a couple of seamen whom he suspected of being off the french schooner sir but after getting a look at your coxn and seaman furfy it came to nothing some foul looks and a comment or two about mister cooke being black and all but mister cadbury said that there were many free blacks doing business who went about their trades unmolested free black sailors off american ships are one thing sir but a free black in navy uniform british uniform is quite another i do expect lewrie breezed off so if we have to wait til the next high tide what do ye suggest we do with the rest of this day sir uhm theres some minor painting sir touchups mostly westcott speculated minor sail repair some blocks aloft id desire to be greased and one or two lines in the running rigging that need reroving that sort of thing mister cadbury saw to it that we took extra fresh water aboard yesterday lewrie asked itching to get out of his finery and back to his usual seagoing rig aye sir westcott told him with more in the offing if we desire paint and mend the rest of the forenoon then let the ships people do their laundry and make and mend til the end of the first dog lewrie decided ill be below before he could quit the quarterdeck though there was mister cadbury the purser with his ledger book and a list of the victuals he had purchased ashore turnips mister cadbury lewrie enthused id suppose that its too much to ask if ye found swedes no swedes sir sorry to say the purser said with a moue of disappointment but your gardenvariety neeps garden variety hah lashings of rice of course and i obtained field peas in great quantity odd ones called blackeyed peas for the black spots on them along with sweet potatoes ehm mr cadbury said more softly as he leaned forward cooke tells me the reason they are in such quantity and available at such low prices is that they along with their rice are considered slave food sir im not sure if the hands need to know that might upset them that we feed them on such as they say in the bahamas though mister cadbury it eats good lewrie said with a chuckle with fresh butter baked sweet potatoes will be a treat and with ham hocks or salt pork the boiled peas will be hot and filling very good sir mr cadbury agreed the french schooners foreandaft sails were fully hoisted by then and she was beginning to make a slow way with some musicians aboard her skreaking or thumping out their revolutionary anthem once more and her crew roaring the words hurling the bellicose words at hms reliant onwatch or offwatch reliant s people would not stand for it and began to jeer and hold up their fingers aloft in insult shouting a cacophany of curses across the cable that separated their ships lewrie would not dignify her departure with the use of a telescope though he did stand and watch her go with his hands clasped in the small of his back au revoir sangliants came a shout from otarie amplified through a brass speakingtrumpet captain mollien was having the last word oh sir midshipman rossyngton gasped sangliant refers to womens ladies monthly the french are crude sir lewrie stiffly told him and im surprised ye know of such au revoir capitaine vous salaud mollien shouted pedale trumpet mister rossyngton lewrie snapped and one was fetched from the binnacle cabinet up forward lt spendlove and lt merriman were beginning to lead the crew in a lusty though not very musical rendition of rule britannia lewrie hoped that mollien could hear him over that din hoy mollien lewrie shouted to the schooner vous absurde petit bouffon vous ridicule petit merdeux va te faire foutre midshipman rossyngton burst into peals of laughter though his cheeks and ears turned red from shock it was not every day that one heard a dignified senior officer call someone an absurd little clown or a ridiculous little shit and certainly not telling anothereven a frenchmanto go fuck yourself ye see mister rossyngton lewrie said with a feral smile as he handed the speakingtrumpet back sometimes ye have tmatch crude with crude didnt know i could string that much french together lewrie congratulated himself and when we do run him down and take him im going to ram those insults of his down his goddamned throat thats enough lewrie ordered as the french schooner sailed beyond easy earshot thatll do mister westcott lets get people back to their duties very good sir lt westcott crisply responded though still grinning over the crews response and lewries surprising outburst lewrie went down the starboard ladderway to the main deck and turned aft to enter his cabins already tugging at the knot of his neckstock bisquit leaped to his feet his feast done looking for more for lewrie still had some sliced ham in his duffel for the cats he planted himself in front of the door tail thrashing and lewrie took time to pet his head and shoulders and ruffle his neck fur before reaching for the door the marine sentry presented his musket as lewrie opened it and the dog darted in in an eye blink oh no dog thats offlimits lewrie snapped pursuing him inside thats quite enough pettus catch him and shoo him out bisquit did a quick trot round the forbidden cabins sniffing at everything as if he knew his time was limited the carpets atop the chequered deck canvas the canvas itself the desk in the daycabin the hanging bedcot the upholstery on the transom settee and the starboardside settee and chairs then into the diningcoach where lewries cats had dashed in panic to take shelter atop the sideboard and hiss and spit when the dog paused long enough to put his paws on the sideboard and utter playful noises to entice the cats pettus caught him by the collar and led him only a bit unwillingly to the door damned if the silly beast wasnt grinning tugging towards lewrie and looking up at him with mischief and gratitude perhaps for his shore treat before pettus put him outside and shut the door he likes you sir pettus said with a lopsided grin he likes everybody lewrie growled the bosun the masteratarms the duck fucker of the manger even the pursers jackinthebreadroomanybody wholl give him the time oday es right clever sir jessop the young cabin servant shyly piped up been teachin im tricks i has not in here i trust lewrie said peeling off his neckstock and shucking his dress coat oh no sir never jessop swore cool tea sir pettus asked coffee lewrie decided removing his sash and unbuttoning his waistcoat do stow all this away and lay me out my comfortable old clothes pettus aye sir pettus said summoning jessop to assist him care for a bite of something sir our consul sent me off with a solid breakfast and his house servants washed and ironed most o my things lewrie told him all i care for is coffee ive a letter or two to write before dinner the supper party had gone past ten of the evening and lewrie and mr cotton had sat up past eleven in discussions over balloon snifters of brandy before retiring lewrie had slept extremely well but had risen early had rewarded himself with one last shore bath and had wolfed down fried ham scrambled eggs thick toast and pipinghot hominy grits with cinnamon sugar and butter if he didnt get started on his letters he feared he might nod off over his pen there would have to be one letter to admiralty to report upon what reliant had done so far and what he and their consuls had discovered a copy of that letter would have to be sent to the british ambassador in washington city once the official reports were done there would be time to write his father sir hugo his sons sewallis and hughthough if their respective ships were at sea it might be months before they received thema letter to his daughter charlotte who still lodged with his brotherinlaw in anglesgreen and a fond one to lydia stangbourne and one to his bastard son desmond mcgilliveray it had been hard to find even a brief moment of privacy with mr douglas mcgilliveray to ask about desmond and unsure whether even a guarded enquiry might upset mrs mcgilliveray who might or might not know that lewrie was young desmonds true father not her husbands late younger brother of the same name who had been the familys agent to the muskogees indians and guide to a fruitless expedition into the florida panhandle to bring the tribe into war against the americans an expedition of which lewrie was a part that desmond had claimed both the baby and his mother soft rabbit a cherokee slave to the white clan after lewrie had sailed away marrying her at the next green corn ceremony the next spring the elder desmond and soft rabbit had both died of a smallpox outbreak not long after and the baby had been sent to charleston to be with his white kin by the white clan elders it was bad enough for young desmond to be halfindian in haughty low country society for him to have a british father might have made things worse for him were it known hatred for england and all things british were still alive as lewrie had already seen best all round for the lad was for the people of charleston to believe that desmonds sire had been a daring and resourceful oxfordeducated fartrader and frontiersman one of their own kind and class and the inconvenience of his late mothers race could be dismissed thankfully mr douglas mcgilliveray had provided an opportunity to speak inviting lewrie to join him in the tavern side of the establishment so he could savour a cigarro grown and cured up state on the piedmont and rolled in charleston before lewrie could declare himself a nonsmoker mcgilliveray had tipped him a very broad wink you wish to know how desmond fares i expect mcgilliveray had begun hes gotten your last two letters but has been a tad busy to respond promptly hes at the north in the chesapeake young desmond was now a fullgrown young man of twentytwo years of age and had wangled a way to stay in the fledgling us navy after the short quasiwar twixt america and france had ended intending to make a career of it if he could mcgilliveray had proudly related how desmond had already stood his oral examinations and had passed on the first try making him a passed midshipman eligible to be commissioned a lieutenant in the future should there be an opening promotion may come soon mr mcgilliveray had said winking once more and blowing a cloud of smoke at the ceiling of the tavern president fool thomas jefferson just wont see that we need a seagoing navy soon as he took office he laid up all the good ships to rot away and had all these damned coastal and river gunboats put into service lieutenant gordons poor pair are lucky to live out past the bar on a gusty day and wouldnt be much of a deterrent to an enemy expedition what little we still have in commission worth a thing are over in the mediterranean confronting the damned barbary corsairs you know we lost the frigate philadelphia a shameful business stranded aground in tripoli harbour and captured oh we managed to board her and burn her but its pitiful how weak we are the idea of sailing gunboats to tripoli is laughable pressure is growing that we build newer bigger betterarmed frigates sloops of war and brigs to scour the barbary coast and stop their foul business once and for all all the poor murdered american sailors all those captured and enslaved forced to denounce christianity and turn muslim pah they cry out for freedom and vengeance so desmond could be posted to a new ship as a lieutenant lewrie had asked a very good possibility captain lewrie mcgilliveray had imparted with a pleased smile do you write him send your letters to the brig o war daring shes fitting out for the mediterranean at baltimore lewrie suspected that desmond wrote his charleston family more often than he wrote him and had pressed for more information on how he was truly doing gingerly asking how the young man was being accepted despite his antecedents mcgilliveray had turned sombre leaning closer charleston society would always look upon him as an exotic oddity no matter the backing and full acceptance of his kin his prospects of making a decent match someday would be bleak but up north desmonds indiandark hair and complexion could be mistaken for huguenot french for many of them had settled in charleston and the south carolina low country before the revolution and having lewries greyblue eyes was a plus his bastard son was strong and slim and finely moulded his manners impeccable his seeming sense of place and his confident air of competent gentlemanly leadership and his proven courage and skill with weapons actually made desmond a welcome guest in the states above virginia at any rate he could come back to charleston someday with a new england bride lewrie had gawped what would the city think o that mr mcgilliveray had at that juncture heaved a heavy sigh and had slowly shaken his head before saying i fear that desmond might never return to charleston at all unless the navy orders him here hes become more a citizen of our whole country than he is of south carolina despite his familys desires that he stay a part of us poor chub lewrie thought as he fetched out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his pen in the inkwell though it may turn out for the best for him and nothing that i could cure book iii pirate a searobber or an armed ship that roams the seas without any legal commi ss ion and seizes or plunders every vessel he meets indiscrimanatly whether friends or enemies falconersmarinedictionary edition chapter thirty this whole expedition is just bloody impossible lewrie sourly told himself as he pondered the newest charts he had purchased ashore in charleston reliant s sailing master mr caldwell had been highly dubious of their usefulness and would put no trust in them until he had compared them to his own sets and then only begrudgingly told lewrie that the yankee doodles had done a passably accurate job of surveying their own waters ive too big a damned ship for this work lewrie concluded to look into stono inlet hilton head inlet port royal sound or calibogue sound it had been necessary to fetchto five miles off the coast and send both twentyfivefoot cutters and one of the thirtytwofoot barges inshore under sail with a lieutenant in each to keep order on the pretense of fishing for sport with the hope that the locals did not get too curious or upset to see british boats poaching upon their fishing grounds there had been nothing in stono inlet larger than a ships boat but that proved little two nights later and an host of raiders or privateers could have put in to victual under the cover of the night the boats had returned with a few fresh fish and about one bushel basket of freshtrawled shrimp purchased from locals to keep them mellow the only discovery of note was made by lt merriman who had peeked behind hilton head island and came back swearing that the channel between the island and the mainland looked to be the birthing grounds for half the sharks in the atlantic swarming as thickly as a creek full of eels hed sent the purser with midshipman eldridge and his boat crew in the second barge as far as the sleepy towns of port royal and beaufort to see what their markets offered and mr cadbury had come back with very little to show for it and with the depressing information that what little shipping was present was small and pacific mr cadbury had asked about and if there was a british consul there a true briton or a hiredon local attorney no one on the docks or in the stores had ever heard of him have a nice afternoon did you mister westcott lewrie asked once the first officer had come through the entryport in his rolledup shirtsleeves and doffing a widebrimmed straw hat a lovely day for boating sir lt westcott said with delight though not a one for discovery im afraid the local fishermen we encountered were standoffish but once we bought some fish and gave them a few shillings for them they did turn chatty do you imagine that your cats savour fresh fish sir i expect they do lewrie said grinning back in like humour with westcott and looking at toulon and chalky who were sunning all asprawl atop the crossdeck hammock nets mad for it they are indeed they were for westcott had come aboard with a wet jute bag that positively reeked of fresh fish as soon as they were aware of it toulon and chalky sat up their tails quivering and their whiskers stiffly pointed forward craning their necks westcott reached into the bag and tossed two live shrimp to the planks of the quarterdeck they sprang at once chittering madly and sat by the shrimp lifting and patting them with one paw sure that they were something good to eat but unsure of how to go about it anything else of note sir lewrie prompted not really sir westcott told him i enquired as casually as i could about french or spanish vessels putting in here and they said they couldnt recall any in years they hadnt seen any french money either though spanish silver coins might as well be the legal tender in america i dont know if the us government actually has a mint of their own our shillings and halfcrowns were more than welcome they spoke a lot of barter sir toulon and chalky were making eager mrrs slapping their shrimp in playkill and leaping in alarm when the shrimp limply thrashed in return chalky finally nipped one and ran off a few feet with it but dropped it when its antennae wriggled just think of em as big cockroaches lads lewrie told them ye have no trouble with those one thing in our favour sir lt westcott pointed out the land round here is so marshy and flat and the coastal forests so low that any ship of decent size with her masts standing can be spotted quite easily unless theyre of shallowenough draught to make their way up the maze of rivers and round a bend or two where the trees are tall enough to hide them lewrie rejoined with a glum look back of the marshes theres white oak and live oak forests an hundred years old or better hmpf perhaps we ought to come back with barricoes of silver and buy prime shipbuilding oak from america weve scavenged our own forests and half of hamburgs exports just tkeep the navy in good repair much less keep up with new construction come sir take a look at this chart of the georgia coast round savannah it gives me a headache it wasnt that far south of where reliant lay fetchedto but it was rather daunting to contemplate how many inlets and sounds how many rivers feeding into the ocean into those sounds lay before them all of which could harbour enemy ships behind the myriad of fertile barrier islands the sea islands round the mouth of the savannah river there was turtle island and jones island on the north bank with broad streams leading round and behind them to the south bank there was big tybee island nearest the sea with cockspur island and mcqueens island between the mainland and tybee roads further south was wassaw sound below big tybee island with another snakes nest of tributaries and the mouth of the wilmington river which led deep inland south of wassaw island lay ossabow sound another deep gash with racoon key at its upper reach fed by the vernon river and the little and the big ogeechee rivers it gets worse lewrie said running a finger down the chart to st catherines sound sapelo sound doboy sound and altamaha sound at the mouth of yet another long inland river the charts showed a small port brunswick near kings bay and st simons sound further south of there then jekyll sound st andrews sound and cumberland sound past islands of the same names where the st marys river fed into cumberland sound and that river was the border between the state of georgia and spanish florida good lord but this could take til midcentury sir lieutenant westcott commented with his head cocked over in awe once weve recovered all our boats i wish us to get under way and come to anchor in tybee roads if theres enough daylight to see what were doing when we get there lewrie said stepping off the short distance with a brass divider and measuring the span against the mileage legend on the side of the chart come morning we will signal for a pilot assumin we can get upriver with our depth of keel that failing ill take one of the barges upriver to confer with our consul in savannah god another couple of days in flummery whilst i and the other officers can look forward to even more fishing and yachting sir lt westcott said with a snicker round the mouth of the river perhaps lewrie said tossing the brass dividers into the binnacle cabinet to probe all of these sounds youd need the rest of our wee squadron and all their boats weve been away too long as it is and god knows what theyve gotten into aye sir westcott replied i shall get way on the ship directly lord lord a whole bushel o shrimps mr cooke marvelled once hed clapped eyes upon them lookee heah mistah yeovill dey be enough fo de capms table and de whole wardroom they look like bugs midshipman entwhistle disparaged dey eat good sah cooke assured him oncet ya boil em up an peel em folks up in charleston aint high on em but back on jamaica we know how tdo em right nothing for the cockpit midshipman grainger asked sounding plaintive not even a morsel for our mess beg pahdon fo askin mistah grainger sah but whatd you bring back cooke asked the ships cook was a big and burly fellow with a rumbling and loud bass voice and could seem quite daunting to those who did not know his pleasant nature well a drum fish a sheepshead and some mullet grainger tallied up yah messman kin bake em for yah cooke told him i bought a decent lot of blue crab at port royal the purser piped up for a nominal sum i could provide a few to the cockpits mess shrimps and crab cooke barked in glee mistah yeovill i do blieve we could do up a boil fo de cockpit de wardroom and de capm ill add mine to that lt westcott eagerly offered waving his sack of shrimp he tossed it to cooke who emptied it into the bushel basket along with the rest of the shrimp beg pardon mister westcott but all our boats are secured bosun sprague reported squinting dubiously at the baskets contents people eat those things he muttered very well mister sprague westcott said after looking over to lewrie at his nod he further said pipe stations for getting under way if you please just a bit before a spectacular sundown hms reliant rounded up into wind took in sail and dropped her best bower to come to anchor in tybee roads once the hands of the afterguard had brailed up the spanker and mizen topsl and had coiled up and stowed away all of the running rigging lines lewrie could take a slow stroll round the quarterdeck and look outward to see what he could see and to savour the sunset the heat of the day was going and the light winds blowing from the soueast were pleasantly almost tropically warm and comforting reliant had not yet lit her taffrail lanthorns belfry lamp or deck lanthorns for the night though the other ships anchored in tybee roads already had he thought of fetching a telescope but the daylight was fading too quickly for close study even without one he could determine that most of the anchored ships were brigs or brigantines most moored further up the mouth of the river nearer turtle island and the few larger threemasted fullrigged ships were anchored below cockspur island in deeper water one of them had bargelike hoys and sailing lighters nestled alongside her as if her master was loath to sail all the way upriver to savannahs docks and was lading or discharging his cargo here perhaps savannahs exports and imports were handled in that way for ships which couldnt find enough depth as light as the sundown wind was it was sufficient to stream reliant s large union flag to advert her nationality to one and all all the other anchored ships both big and small displayed the blueandstarry canton and the red and white horizontal stripes of america lewrie heaved a small wary snort he had used the ruse of flying a false flag in the past to stride up within pistolshot of an enemy ship before whipping it down and hoisting true colours at the last instant what he or any other nation could do anyone else could do be they a merchantman or a privateer might one of the brigs or brigantines be a frenchman in disguise this very moment two bells were struck on the ships bell it was half past six and one halfhour into the short second dog watch marine lieutenant simcock was mustering and inspecting his sentries in the waist before posting them at the forecastle on the gangways and the taffrails to guard against hostile raiders or deserters willing to try a long swim to freedom time for a drink lewrie told himself for its been a long and depressin day i will be aft and below lewrie told the midshipman of the harbour watch mr warburton on his way to the starboard ladderway he stepped on something both squishy and crunchy he picked it up it was one of the shrimp that his cats had slapped about then abandoned uneaten toulons mostlike lewrie thought as he heaved it over the side im sure chalky managed his he looked round for the pestiferous ships dog but there was no sign of it bisquit was likely below on the mess deck or in the mids cockpit begging affection or in the warm galley with mr cooke awaiting his evening tucker it was safe for lewrie to open the door to his cabins evening sir pettus greeted him looking up from the dining table where he was laying a place for one care for a glass of something before supper sir a nice cool white wine pettus thankee lewrie said going to the starboardside settee to fling himself down on it and prop his booted legs atop the round brass hindoo tray table its seafood tonight so a whitell do mainwell here lads here cats right away sir pettus replied going to the winecabinet to rummage round til he found the right bottle yeovill said he was preparing something new for your sweets sir a pie that he and mister cooke discovered at charleston sold on the streets by black ladies he said and it took quite a lot to worm the receipt from them on how to prepare it he said what yeovill called pecan pie sir oh i had a slice o that when i dined ashore aye lewrie enthused sinful good it was and so sweet and gooey it could make your teeth hurt im lookin forward tthat pettus brought him a glass of rhenish though it was hard to take a sip once he got it for toulon and chalky had swarmed his lap stomach and chest purring and shoving their heads under his hands for longdelayed affection a hellish task ive been set tpeek into all these damned inlets and sounds lewrie told himself but at the end of the day at last theres pleasant rewards chapter thirtyone lewrie had heard of the beauty and elegance of savannah but at first impression the moment that his barge ghosted up to the teeming commercial docks it looked as dowdy as any seaport and so many miles inland from tybee roads and the reach of a fresh seawind the place had a reek about it add to that the fact that it was by then late may and the climate was warm humid and almost steamy and captain alan lewrie would have gladly avoided the place if he could he had brought along the ships purser mr cadbury of course to purchase fresh victuals though there was little the ship needed at present after their previous stops and in the course of that to spy out the commercial trade to see if any war materiel might be stocked for sale to privateers on the sly if cadbury could manage it he had also brought along mr midshipman the honourable albert entwhistle who was by then a seasoned and most presentable twentyyearold his barge was manned by his coxn liam desmond with stroke oar patrick furfy and the same hands whod accompanied him up the cape fear river to wilmington lewrie cadbury and entwhistle could possibly be lodged with their consuls residence and the hands in his coach house if not lewrie had come prepared with a full coin purse for food and lodging their consul though there had been no time to send an introductory letter upriver after anchoring the evening before so lewrie and his party arrived as a surprise once the boat was secured at a riverfront chandlery he and his men set out to find the consuls residence or his offices a clerk at the chandlery assured them where mr hereford could be found in an office behind the sprawling docks and warehouses not two blocks off though the clerk did not sound all that respectful lewrie discovered the reason for that disrespect when he got to the given address and found that mr hereford kept a small office in a brick building full of lawyers a prerevolution mansion that had seen better days and had been subdivided into a nasty warren of tiny suites an upperstorey door to one suite bore a painted wood plaque announcing mr r l e hereford esq hm consul and lewrie rapped on it several times with no response he tried the door knob and it opened easily so he swung the door fully open and stepped in excuse me anyone in he called out as he entered a small anteroom filled with bookcases a desk chair and a sitting area off to one side there was a settee there and from it sprang a liveried black servant his white periwig askew and his eyes as wide as saucers he emitted an eep gulped twice and looked as if he would run given the chance captain alan lewrie he told that quaking worthy im come to speak with the british consul is he in eep the servant reiterated twitching his clothing back to good order and fussing with his wig mistah mistah hereford hes in sah capm sah but announce me if you will theres a good fellow lewrie said yassuh yassuh right away the servant said going to the other door at the back of the anteroom and slipping inside closing it behind him damn odd way to maintain offices sir midshipman warburton said in a sidelong mutter must not do much business here lewrie thought much the same for the book cases were crammed with piles of loose correspondence angled anyoldhow legal books in piles on the floor on the small outeroffice desk and all filmed with a noticeable coating of dust as if nothing of import had taken place in a month of sundays from behind that second door lewrie could hear water being splashed some impatient mutters and then the sound of gargling and spitting the door was opened again and the liveried black servant stepped through to the anteroom shutting it at once softly his excellency mistuh hereford will be with ya shotly capm he then stood by the doorway waiting eyes halfshut his excellency mine arse lewrie scoffed to himself after a long wait the door to the inner office opened and a gentleman stepped through it mr herefords reaction to the sight of a royal navy officer was most unlike his servants the fellow scowled and squinted as if lewries presence was a bother richard hereford your servant sir the fellow announced as he performed a slight bow from the waist my man said you are captain uhm he prompted with a brow up and hand waved in the air alan lewrie captain of the reliant frigate mister hereford lewrie told him performing a deeper bow my pardons for not sending word of my arrival in tybee roads last evening sir but the lateness of the hour would not admit rapid delivery allow me to name to you one of my senior midshipman mister entwhistle i am come welcome to savannah captain lewrie mister entwhistle the consul said god help you he added with a sneer one supposes that your errand is of an official nature hmm if you will follow me to my office we may discover the nature of your visit will you take wine sir or might you prefer tea tea it is then he sounded a tad disappointed ulysses fetch the captain a pot of tea yassuh massa the servant said scuttling out into the hallway a servant or a slave mister hereford lewrie asked once he was seated in front of herefords desk with his hat in his lap bought him hereford answered the idle fool one cant do a thing in the american south without slaves even the poorest whites begging in the streets reject the notion of house service or body service gad to recall how close i came to a posting at the north philadelphia new york or boston which are at least civilised and cooler yet here i find myself croaking like a frog in a georgia marsh in a place as disagreeable as sweatypore in india now captain lewrie sir alan one would suppose hey what has brought you to savannah hereford asked as lewrie laid out his mission where he had been so far and upon whom he had called hereford made the proper ahems and ahas and i sees at the right places and even dragged out a sheet of paper and a lead pencil with which to make notes in the middle of all that the pot of tea arrived and the servant ulysses poured cups for all and offered cream and sugar mr hereford reached behind him to a sideboard and book case hutch for a decanter which he waved to them in invitation filling the office with the tang of rum as he pulled the stopper he shrugged at lewries and entwhistles refusal then openly poured himself a dollop into his tea and damned what they thought lewrie looked round mr herefords inner office it was bigger than the anteroom and featured a set of glasspaned double doors leading out to a wide railed balcony as if the entire suite had at one time been a spacious bedchamber music room or upper parlour it was just as dusty as crammed and disorganised as the anteroom office though and featured a suspiciously deep settee in one of the dark corners furthest from the glazed doors the cushions and the pillows still bore the impressions of its owners head and body it appeared that mr r l e hereford esq rarely saw visitors and took long naps through his idle mornings privateers do you say sir alan hereford mused aloud after a sip or two of his tea leaning far back in his leatherpadded chair to rest his cup and saucer on his upper chest i cant say when the last time was that a french or spanish vessel of any description put into savannah or even anchored at the mouth of the river i arrived at this posting during the peace of amiens and there were some ships from france spain and holland who came to trade but since the renewal of the war the trade has shrivelled up to nothing mores the pity one cannot imagine how dear a case of good wine or a simple bottle of champagne has become at least our american cousins do still trade with the spanish west indies and tobacco is available in quantity why were it not for the rare british ship it would be impossible to obtain decent clothing or fabrics to entrust to clumsy local tailors haw much good that does you lewrie sneeringly thought for his excellency mr herefords suitings expensive as they looked were illfitted rumpled from his naps and in need of a good sponging to remove some stains he wore a snuffbrown coat of broadcloth wool a pearlescent waistcoat of a light gold colour and a pair of buff trousers all worn so long that every joint in his body had creased them into permanent wrinkles his neckstock was pale blue badly indifferently bound too to top it off hereford was possessed of one of those clenchjawed and plummy oxonian accents natural to those born to the upper aristocracy or those who affected it that had always set lewries teeth on edge ill wager he drives savannahans mad too he told himself and imagined that was the reason the clerk at the chandlery had spoken so derisively of the british consul i dont think i like him very much i see that theres only the one wee port south of here the town of brunswick before the border with spanish florida sir lewrie posed do you happen to get down that way very often brunswick hereford scoffed pouring himself another dottle of rum into his tea a sleepy little place a bare cut above a hamlet is there any trade conducted there it is of little import and strictly a local affair conducted by vessels little larger than fishing smacks mostly to serve the sea island plantations would that his majestys government see their way to providing me a decent subsidy i would establish myself on tybee island for a summer residence the planters do you see sir alan hereford imparted with a smile the immensely wealthy ones and many with the pretensions maintain inland plantations and summer plantations on the sea islands which are so much healthier can they not get away from their active lands they will at least send their women and children to saint simons jekyll and cumberland islands to survive the heat and the humidity if not the sicknesses of the mainland if a plantation out there will not do they will at least have summer houses and truck gardens so you dont get down to brunswick often sir lewrie asked once more striving to not sound impatient with the fellow hardly ever a reason to do so sir alan hereford idly waved off and took a deep sip of his tea with a welcome sigh might it be possible then mister hereford lewrie went on shifting in his chair for foreign vessels to put in there for a day or two put into wassaw or ossabow sounds or one of the sounds below brunswick to take on firewood and water and perhaps meet with a local chandler or trader and revictual without your knowledge or the knowledge of american authorities hereford seemed stumped by the question laying his head over to one side to ponder his answer for a long moment i would imagine that anything is possible sir alan though hardly plausible dye see just how for instance could a foreign tradermost likely a smuggler wishing to avoid american import duties than a privateerinform a nefarious trader from savannah of his date of arrival or which sound or inlet he will use for that particular cargo on the other hand how might the aforesaid nefarious trader communicate his wishes to the smuggler what in any case such smuggling if such is being conducted would be of more concern to the united states revenue service than to great britain mr hereford jovially dismissed we of the consular branch do not interfere with the sovereign rights of our host nations neither do we presume to enmesh ourselves in the manner in which host nations enforce their customs fees or their laws except when those laws fees and regulations involve british ships calling at american seaports anything else beyond that limited brief is ultra vires a legal term for actions beyond ones legal authority or power hereford gave them a little concluding smile and simper then took another sip of his rumlaced tea as if it was all settled so you would only look into rumours of smuggling or supplying privateers if they involved british merchantmen or privateers sir lewrie summed up feeling a very strong urge to leap across the desk and seize the arrogant fools neck and squeeze hard well hereford flummoxed taken aback by the question if evidenceevidence mind not mere rumourswas brought to my attention that crown subjects were engaged in smuggling i would give the american authorities both local and federal my most strenuous support but such activities are most implausible i assure you sir alan upon what enemy trade might british privateers prey sir hey there may be some crumbs to be gleaned in the west indies and in european waters but not this side of the atlantic heh heh our merchant vessels calling at savannah come from the west indies in convoy where your own navy bonds them and their cargoes are mostly salt molasses rum dye wood and tobacco perhaps the most valuable commodity being refined sugar as well you might know had you ever served in the west indies yourself sir alan hereford simpered again condescendingly lewrie put a brow up and a scowl on at that remark but that didnt signify to mr hereford he would make his little jabs for the idle fun of them last spring i was part of an escorting squadron to a sugar trade mister hereford lewrie replied we lost three ships when level with georgia and south carolina to french privateers who took us from the landward side and hared off with their prizes to the west and souwest that makes me think that they based themselves somewhere along the american coast or had arrangements with americans to sell off their stolen cargoes and ships without going all the way to cuba or the spanish main dye see what im drivin at hereford might not have he sat perfectly content with his cup on his chest and stomach blinking beatifically if stolen ships were brought into savannah under pretense of false registries or sold here to unsuspecting buyers in need of new bottoms would you have any way of knowing mister hereford lewrie asked unless someone familiar with such a vessel saw her at anchor in the river under a new flag and brought that to my attention no sir alan hereford easily admitted only if a britishflagged ship were contracted to be sold to an american buyer would i become involved merely to note the transfer of ownership flag and registry and assist the crown subject selling her with my best advice as to the particular details of such a sale and perhaps suggest ways that he not be gulled by a low offer hmm you are on good terms with the chandlers the importexport trading firms here at savannah sir lewrie went on wondering just what hereford did do to earn his salt at crown expense reasonably so sir alan hereford told him as he snapped his fingers at ulysses to pour him a fresh cup of hot tea though they are in trade and for the most part are an avaricious and common lot the epitome of the fabled sharppracticed yankee trader even though one could expect that the heat and humidity of savannahs clime would engender a torpor which slows their frenetic greed haw haw a batch of chawbacons or chaw baccies more to the point i do not associate with them on a daily basis for which they surely thank the lord lewrie thought but have any of them struck you as more sharppracticed than most sir lewrie pressed wondering if he could extract a positive and informative answer from the toplofty idler before sundown do you keep your ear to the ground so to speak as to which might be engaged in smuggling or supplying enemy privateers on the sly should the opportunity fall in his lap keep tabs on them as i said earlier sir alan and must point out again criminal behaviour by american traders and chandlers is a matter for the american authorities hereford told him getting a bit testy as he shifted in his chair that would be beyond my purview and to probe into their doings well that would smack of spying on them sir an activity that no gentleman would conduct in ones host nation the very idea hereford harumphed and openly glowered as if lewrie had touched upon his honour and was impatiently waiting for an apology for making such a suggestion you aint worth a tuppenny shit lewrie fumed to himself trying to keep a level expression on his face i see lewrie said after a long blink and a sigh well i was ordered to come and make your acquaintance mister hereford and to discover to you admiraltys suspicions and that i believe i have done all foreign office can ask of you is that you keep your eyes open and advert to the american authorities and our ambassador at washington city any suspicious activities that aint spyin cause youd be helping brother johnathon enforce his touchy sense of neutrality and i trust ye wont think it so as soon as the tide in the river turns it might be best did i set off to rejoin my ship unless you think that a shore supper with some of the prominent citizens of savannah could be arranged on short notice in that case i would take lodgings for the night somewhere and set off tomorrow morning thats a hint ye thick turd lewrie thought i fear that the suddenness of your unanticipated arrival may not admit of such a supper gathering sir alan mr hereford quickly said sounding relieved that lewrie would toddle off and leave him to his rest once more now had you given me two or three days notice i could have accommodated you and shown the countryput locals what an english gentleman looks like ha ha they will raise cheers for the socalled common man but would dearly love knighthoods and titles of their own show them what they gave up with their damnfool rebellion and what little dignities they got from their independence what hereford gulped the last of his tea and stood beaming at one and all sure that the interview was over quite jolly once more any suggestions as to lodgings sir lewrie asked as he stood as well there was no way he could stomach the thought of sharing the consuls residence even for one night sure that theyd come to blows before midnight if he did but hereford should make the offer there are some few lodging houses though none that rise to the level of amenities that a gentleman such as yourself could abide sir alan hereford was quick to warn even the lone inn with aspirations to quality i found before obtaining a wee residence in town offers hard thin beds perfectly tawdry and squalid furnishings and your choice of lice fleas or bed bugs the food is insufferably bad to boot surely not that bad sir lewrie said as if bandying jovial words i would offer you and your midshipman the hospitality of my residence but for the fact that i am in the process of replastering and repainting at the moment hereford told him almost but not quite looking sorrowful that he could not dine them in and offer beds i came upriver with my purser and a party of five hands from my boat crew so lewrie said as they made their way to the outer office there would have been no room for them in any event mister hereford said with a shake of his head if you lodged them at one of the sailors inns well it seemed that mr cadbury a man engaged in business aboard a warship and lived and died on the slim profits earned twixt buying and selling was one of these abysmal people in trade too to herefords lofty lights no matter then lewrie said as they reached the door to the hallway which the slave ulysses held open for their departure and seemed as eager to see the back of them as his master perhaps he needed a longer nap before dinner as well never been to savannah lewrie lied he had been upriver with despatches once from tybee roads when british forces still held it perhaps mister entwhistle and i could hire a carriage for a brief tour before dinner i am told that the citys layout by governor oglethorpe is most impressive a most inventive and creative gentleman he was mr hereford agreed his plans for savannah were quite inspired though one does wish that he created his eden anywhere else but here hey good day to you mister hereford and thank you for receiving me on such short notice lewrie said in parting you have been most helpful sorry that i could not be more so in aid of your quest sir alan hereford said good day to you and may you have a safe and successful passage they bowed themselves away the door closed and lewrie could imagine long deep sighs of relief from both hereford and his slave before he and midshipman entwhistle trotted down the stairs and to the street might i ask sir entwhistle hesitantly said if you found him as useless as i did that i despise him for a pusgutted slovenly arrogant idle waste of the crowns money as ever i clapped eyes on sir lewrie hooted aye i do find him useless so useless and uninformative in point of fact that i could easily suspect him of bein handinglove with criminal traders and enemy privateers if anyone gave me a strong hint in that direction what a gooseberry bastard he is not that we should speak ill of our compatriots in foreign office mister entwhistle god forfend lewrie added with mock solemnity with a hand on his heart entwhistle was all but cackling out loud hold my coat for a bit mister entwhistle lewrie bade as he peeled it off and slipped the bright blue satin sash clear of his body then plucked the enamelled silver star from the coat stowing them in the sidepockets before donning his coat once more bloody silliness wasted on his sort mostlike wasted on the people of savannah too makes me feel like a monkey on a leash entwhistle looked a bit scandalised that his captain put little stock in the hardwon marks of distinction that every young officertobe desired but said nothing therere more picturesque public squares in savannah than you and i have had hot dinners mister entwhistle lewrie told him with a grin and all of em and the broad streets between lined with mansions as grand as grosvenor street in london lets go find the purser and our hands and have us a carriage tour chapter thirtytwo welcome back aboard sir lt westcott said once lewrie had taken the salute from the sideparty and the hands on deck and how was savannah just ever so jolly mister westcott and thankee for askin lewrie drawled in broad sarcasm in point of fact it was just too infuriatin by half didnt learn a blessed thing and our consul in savannah is as useless as teats on a bull oh mister cadbury found a few things on your and the bosuns list and therell be a barge to come alongside tomorrow just after noon if tide and current will serve i need an ale badly ill be aft and below very good sir westcott said looking a bit mystified ill fill you and the other officers in later sir after i get comfortable lewrie promised an informal conference in my cabins after supper i will inform them sir pettus and jessop were caught unawares by lewries quick return to the ship so there was no pitcher of cool tea brewed for him his cook yeovill had to scramble to whip up a supper too expecting that lewrie would spend the night in savannah he popped into the cabins just long enough to enquire if an omelet with hashed potatoes toast and a slice off a cured ham would suit then loped off for the galleys pettus drew him a tall mug of pale ale from a fivegallon barricoe stowed aft under the transom settee as lewrie shed his shoregoing uniform and flopped on the settee to accept his cats welcome ah thats good lewrie said after a deep quaff had some in the boat on the way back downriver and that made me thirsty for beer after gathering mr cadbury desmond and furfy and the boat crew from their prowl through the chandleries lewrie had hired two open carriages for that promised tour which had put everyone in jolly takings the tall houses with their ornamental ironrailed gardens in their fronts the raised foundation homes with their high stoops and the lushness of the gardens that were railed in had struck them all as simply grand as grand as anything in the west end of london indeed but that was nothing to the many squares each was a miniature park overshadowed by tall twisting twining live oaks draped with spanish moss planted flowering bushes in every colour palmettos rustling spiky leaves to the light wind to add a touch of the exotic set against the brick walks and welltended lawns there were even fountains in the middle of some and their sprays along with the shade provided by the oaks obliterated the heat of the day each time they reached one following that they had returned to the docks and loaded their barge with what goods that mr cadbury deemed essential then visited the street vendors for a midday meal getting hardboiled eggs fried chicken cheese bisquits and small sweet fruit turnovers to eat once they were under way downriver since the boat crew would miss their usual midday rum issue a disaster to navy sailors lewrie had to sport everyone to a small twogallon barricoe of beer and purchase enough wooden mugs for all once tapped it had been pronounced good beer stronger than the weak small beer served aboard ship which was little more than beerflavoured water which kept much longer in cask than water they shoved off and rowed out far enough from the docks until they could hoist both lugsls and a jib once all sheets were belayed desmond and furfy led the hands in the ancient game of who shall have thisun then to share out legs thighs and wings lewrie cadbury and midshipman entwhistle had had to settle for the dryer less desirable white meat breasts all in all even counting the rent of the carriages it cost lewrie less than board and lodging overnight with their boat under sail and the river current wafting them on there was little for the crew to do but admire the sights of the journey over the foreignness of the birds the salt marshes that seemed to stretch to the horizon in every direction rarely broken by small groves of trees on the islands or on higher dryer hammocks and the other river traffic if a barge or lighter coming upriver neared them and it had a woman aboard the sailors shouted greetings and catcalls no matter how old or ugly all was as calm and easy and pleasant as a slow drift on the upper thames in midsummer as a punt among the swans at henley that early in the season the vast windruffled seas of reeds and marsh grasses were newshoot green and pleasing to the eyes not the curedtobaccoleaf or oldparchment brown of late autumn two or three of the sailors had begun a soft crooning song the return journey was so close as any of them would get to the royal leisure of yachting that they could conjure that they were sailing to the legendary sailors eden fiddlers green where the beer and rum never ran out all the doxies were beautiful and the publicans never called on them for the reckoning and the landing to that paradise was just round the next bend in the river except for lewrie after eating a mug of beer and a dip of his hands into the river to wipe them and his mouth of grease he had turned quiet and sombre pondering upon all that he still did not know of enemy privateers activities or american involvement in support and upon how short a time he had remaining to smoak them out once reliant weighed anchor and set sail from tybee roads he could not linger off the coast of georgia to look into the sounds or put in to tiny brunswick without exciting the american authorities and provoking a diplomatic incident upon suspicion that he was blockading a neutral nation he could not play the innocent were just fishing ploy again so soon after employing that ruse off port royal or lying at anchor for two days in tybee roads which was just a hop skip and jump from the sea islands and their sounds from the mouth of the savannah river it was but half a days slow sail to cumberland sound and the mouth of the st marys river where spanish florida began the only thing he could do would be to admit failure and join lizard firefly and thorn off st augustine he had grimaced nighwinced as hed thought of how hed word a fresh report to admiralty the only slightly cheering idea that had come to him was his estimation of consul hereford which he would also send to the british ambassador in washington if he needed a good excuse his excellency r l e hereford would do quite nicely idly stroking the cats now they had calmed down from frantic welcome and lifting his mug now and again for a sip of beer lewrie tallied up what little he did know so far firstly he could safely rule out any privateering activity from north carolina their hired consul mr osgoode moore and his old friend kit cashman had an eye on things from topsail island to lockwood folly inlet what might transpire north of topsail island from beaufort or the albemarle or pamlico sounds was beyond their ken but most british convoys made sure that they were well out to sea and clear of any risk of being driven onto the hatteras banks the graveyard of the atlantic and his orders from admiralty had not mentioned any losses from those convoys that far up the american coast secondly mr cotton at charleston had established good relations with the trading firms and chandleries in south carolina waters and was fairly sure that georgetown and winyah bay where so many rivers joined dealt mostly in rice exports charleston had the ashley and the cooper rivers but the only traffic on them was barges and small boats and charleston was not so far upriver from the sea it was the most important seaport in the american south but it was open garrisoned by american troops with revenue cutters and navy gunboats and even if there were major shipyards and many chandleries and trading firms that could be in collusion with enemy privateers cotton had left lewrie with the impression that but for the presence of molliens privateer schooner the problem lay elsewere if there was indeed a problem lewrie felt that he could have been hunting leprechauns gold for all the good of it so far yet mollien had been there sure sign that he was hunting british ships somewhat close to spanish florida he might have put into charleston to flaunt his countrys flag or to call upon a decent tailor stono inlet had been a bust as had edisto too port royal and the other beaufort in north carolina it was bo in south carolina is was bew had seemed intriguing but had little in the way of ship chandlers or trading houses little shipbuilding beyond large fishing boats and no one they had encountered could recall french or spanish vessels of any description entering the sound in ages so lewrie might be able to rule them out toplofty bastard lewrie muttered to himself thinking about hereford sir pettus asked from the bedspace where he was sponging lewries bestdress coat just maunderin pettus lewrie assured him thinkin of a man i met in savannah oh sir pettus replied before lights out sir i think we need a pot of water boiled in the teapot your sash got all crumpled up in your coat pocket and it needs a good steaming before it goes back into its box aye boil away lewrie allowed have cooke heat up an iron in the galley if ye think its needful brr sir pettus commented with his mouth pursed got to be careful with silk or satin sir a toohot iron will scorch them something horrid whichever ye think best lewrie said bringing the mug to his mouth there was only a swallow left and he thought of ordering pettus to tap a second but forbore georgia bloody georgia he silently mused the worst maze o creeks inlets sounds and channels back o the islands of all ive seen so far worse than the bayous in louisiana if ever a place was made for pirates smugglers and privateers thatd be it i wish tgod i could linger long enough id be sure tfind something lewrie wondered if his suspicious feeling had more to do with his anger over herefords slothlike reaction to his suggestion and his haughty rejection of looking into even the most overt violations of american neutrality standing on his lofty and toofine sense of personal honour if hereford wouldnt look into things and lewrie couldnt stay long enough to do it himself then that left the coast of georgia and the port of savannah the last area that had not been absolved whatd they say that all the rogues went to georgia lewrie thought with a mirthless grin or gets sent there an crown expense to do nothing on their carriage tour their coachee a free black fellow had pointed out several of the sights naming each square and indicating the stately homes by their owners names assuring them that they were all prominent savannah residents of long standing he had seemed delighted to mention who the significant patriots of the revolution were and what roles they had played some homes had temporarily been used by british occupiers for headquarters officers residences barracks or stables the churches and their pewboxes being grand horse stalls and o course gennelmuns dat house on de right dar be yo consuls home dat mistah hereford dammit it had been grand not as large and imposing as its neighbours the other manses that lined the streets or fronted upon the green publicsquares but it had been impressive enough and it didnt look as if there were any plasterers or painters workin on it either lewrie fumed it was a lot finer than mister cottons at charleston and just how much does a consul get paid on a foreign station britains public services and government offices were rife with jobbery graft and interest there was good reason for families to wheedle a minor clerks job for their sons for aspiring men to spend as much as to gain a government post that paid no more than or a year once in place and assured a lifelong living the sky was the limit on how much they could earn on the sly in bribes christ they even knighted some of the bastards at the end of a long career lewrie wondered if herefords eagerness to see him off quickly was due to catching him asleep in his offices and most remiss in his duties overall or did hereford fear that he might learn something criminal about his dealings if he stayed a night or two hereford could be a haughty useless fool with a private income from his family in england or have umpteen thousands in the three percents and a slew of annual interest lewrie considered the british pound sterling was worth a lot more than any unit of currency that the united states could ever issue so an hundred pounds could go a very long way towards purchasing or running up a house a private income plus his annual pay and expenses for a residence and offices could be a morethantidy sum or he could be a shifty criminal in league with his countrys enemies at the very least making money on the side by looking away not looking at all from the dealings of a savannah businessman damme lewrie chid himself of a sudden if i hadnt been so angry i shouldve looked up what were their names during the quasiwar twixt france and the united states over highhanded french boarding and seizure of american merchants who were not trading with france there had been a hostilities only boughtin ship the us armed brig oglethorpe fitted out and armed by eager public subscription in savannah and crewed by merchant masters mates and sailors for the most part with a sprinkling of us navy officers who had no ships in which to serve she captain mcgilliverays thomas sumter and the us frigate hancock had formed a squadron in the west indies to protect their countrys shipping and seek out any french merchantmen they could find and most honourably fight and take any french warship or privateer they encountered too and oglethorpe s captain had been a savannahan gentleman seafarer named randolph lewrie recalled if i didnt have my nose outta joint i couldve looked him up and asked him a few questions too damned late now lewrie also glumly considered that randolph might have stayed in the sea trade and might have been halfway to canton china or he might have passed away of something a lot of people whom lewrie had known from his time round jamaica and at nassau as hed learned from his recent call there had joined the great majority toulon and chalky had abandoned his lap and thighs and gone to the middle of the settee to groom themselves before supper so lewrie could get to his feet and stroll aft to the larboard side to step into his quartergallery toilet to relieve himself of beer the upper sashwindows were open for the sundown breeze and reliant had swung on her single anchor to face her stern upriver so he could savour another fine sunset as he piddled i have trejoin the squadron off saint augustine he thought ive already been away too long but if darling lovett and bury say that blockadin the place aint worth a candle whats tstop me from bringin em back up here tprowl the georgia coast for a bit maybe poke into the st johns river in spanish florida on the way and do we use some o those boats we captured at mayami bay and keep well to the spanish side o the saint marys hmm as he did his breeches buttons up he stepped to the aft windows for a last peek at the sunset and a deep appreciative breath of cooler evening air the larger merchant ships that had been anchored off cockspur island the night before on the southern side of tybee roads were reduced in number there had been four but now there were only two surrounded as before with lighters nuzzled alongside like a pack of nursing piglets upriver nearer turtle island and jones island the night lanthorns had already been lit on the clutch of smaller brigs and snows also attended by lighters some of the lighters sat lower in the water than others evidently still full of exports or chandlers goods to be laded in the morning and coming downriver was a pair of those stout and dowdy cargo barges under two masted lugsl rigs with single jibs with the sun low on the western horizon almost lost in the trees the sails glowed amber against the red band of sunset and tiny glimlike lanthorns at their binnacles and sterns winked a cheery yellow quite pretty lewrie thought in all lewrie left the quartergallery and shut the door behind him and took seat upon the upholstered transom settee to continue watching the sunset through the transom sashwindows the lower halves of the windows were kept closed at all times so one or both of his cats on a romp or gambol in the night did not fall out and be lost at sea they needed a cleaning of saltair rime on the outside and smudges of paw prints on the inside he had to stand again to watch through the open upper halves the sailing barges stood on bound for the larger ships which lay off cockspur island almost passing out of view as they neared the starboard quarter but they werent reducing sail what the devil lewrie wondered going over to the starboard side of his cabins to open the door to the other quartergallery which was used for storage so he could follow the barges progress they werent stopping at the large ships anchorage they were bound out to sea where the bloody hell are they goin lewrie asked himself at this time o night pettus and jessop hadnt bothered to clean the window panes in the starboard quartergallery since it was not used as a lavatory so lewrie had to pull out his long shirttail to scrub himself a clear patch but all he accomplished was a worse smear his curiosity piqued he dashed for the door to the waist and ran up the ladderway to the quarterdeck in his shirt sleeves captains on deck midshipman warburton cautioned the idling quarteredeck watch and the officers who had come up before their own supper for a smoke or a breath of air glass mister warburton lewrie snapped something amiss sir lt westcott asked coming to the starboard bulwarks a step behind his captain those two sailin barges yonder sir lewrie said over his shoulder theyre not closin with those anchored ships theyre on their way to sea ladings done for the day so where are they goin i wonder why are they bound out just at sundown not thankee mister warburton he said as the requested telescope was fetched he couldnt see all that much even if the barges were only a mile or so off the telescope was a dayglass with little lightgathering strength a night glass would have shown more detail but its assortment of internal lenses resulted in an image that was upsidedown and backwards they look tbe about fourty or fifty feet or so twomasted and lewrie muttered do they look like the runofthemill barges youve seen mister westcott i suppose so sir the first lieutenant admitted sheepishly i fear ive not given any of them more than a passing glance just workboats he said with a shrug have any of you seen any o them goin to sea or entering the roads from seaward lewrie asked his sudden appearance on the quarterdeck had drawn the other two lieutenants and the marine officer from the idle gathering and to stand near him by the starboard bulwarks in a befuddled pack i cannot say that we have sir lt spendlove the most earnest of them confessed as mister westcott said sir just workboats lieutenant merriman seconded strings of them come downriver each morning and return to savannah in the afternoons mostly or they spend the night alongside the merchant ships then sail the next morning sir lt spendlove added is their going to sea suspicious though sir lt westcott asked there are plantations on almost every island along the coast i heard so they must get goods from savannah somehow after dark though lewrie pointed out itd make more sense to sail from the savannah docks at dawn and get to saint simons or jekyll island or brunswick port in late afternoon in safety and not risk the barges to the shoals and such in the dark even goods required instanter sir marine lt simoock asked instanter my foot lt merriman scoffed with a laugh it would take a whole day to send an order by boat from brunswick and a day to fill it then a third day weather permitting to ship it down to them instanters what you have at hand and snatch up quickly lt spendlove added well im no mariner i will admit simcock replied so i will trust to your seasoned judgement there is the possibility that those two barges are from one of the sea islands further south sir or belong to a brunswick merchant returning home westcott slowly speculated if their masters know the waters well enough and stand far enough offshore during the night they may not think a night passage all that much of a risk an everyday or weekly occurrence then sir lewrie asked lowering his telescope and wondering if he was grasping at straws in the need to discover something criminal to justify the days that he had so far wasted chasing after willothewisps possibly he allowed grudgingly wish i could send a cutter in chase of em lewrie thought or shadow em and see what theyre up to he closed the tubes of the telescope with a thump and heaved a deep sigh partly in disappointment and partly to calm his excitement and appear captainly to his officers and men he turned and handed it back to midshipman warburton with a polite thankee i send a cutter tboard em in the dark or lurk so baldfaced in american waters i could halfway start a war he told himself good evening gentlemen lewrie said to one and all on his way to the head of the starboard ladderway then paused at the top there will be some of those lighters alongside with the pursers goods tomorrow without appearin too curious lets take her measure and ask about the barge trade and keep a closer eye on the traffic in the roads hey bon appetit he bade them on his way to his supper chapter thirtythree the sailing barge from savannah came alongside reliant in the middle of the forenoon and lewrie made sure that he was on deck for her arrival as were his offwatch officers bosun sprague and his mate wheeler lines from her bow and stern were taken aboard to be bound to the frigates mizen and foremast chains and the barge crew heaved over great hairy mats of ravelled rope to cushion the contact between the hulls there were light articles of cargo on the barges deck containing live chickens and layer hens some squealing piglets and sides of freshslaughtered beef in jute sacks sacks of flour and cornmeal and casks of spirits along with wooden cases of goods for the officers wardroom the mids cockpit and the captains cabins lewrie stood idle by the mizen mast shrouds to look down into her the barge was closer to fifty feet on the range of the deck than his earlier estimate of fourty very widebeamed and flushdecked with a single cargo hatch between her masts and smaller crew hatches at bow and stern her master was white as was her helmsman though the rest of the small crew were black most likely slaves well have the light goods first bosun sprague bellowed to the barge crew lines comin down and well drag them up the loading skids is she about the same size as the barges you saw at savannah mister cadbury lewrie asked the purser as he stood on the quarterdeck with a ledger book and a pencil to cheek off each bought item as it came aboard about average sir cadbury told him there are some smaller thirty or thirtyfive feet or so cadbury told him i would say that this one is representative of the bulk of the barge trade many of them serve plantations and hamlets up the river as well as for the barges you noted leaving port last evening sir they may have been bound for the sea island plantations landings for the channels behind the islands out to sea just long enough to enter wassaw or ossabaw sounds then go up the other rivers lewrie asked leaning most lubberly on the bulwarks where the quarterdeck ended and the larboard sailtending gangway began with his arms crossed very likely sir mr cadbury agreed with a primly happy expression glad to be of assistance while i am not a scaly fish of experienced seamanship this barge does strike me that its upper rails are tall enough to weather a stiff beat to weather well heeled over long enough at least for a short sea journey from one sound to the next as beamy as a dutch lugger aye lewrie judged so shed be quick to make leeway and from here it doesnt look as if her hold is all that deep she might not draw much more than seven or eight feet mister rossyngton are you ready sir aye sir their slyest and cheekiest midshipman eagerly said then pray do go on and be all boyish curiosity lewrie told him rossyngton dodged a crate of chickens and several sacks of meal to the open larboard entryport and did a quick scramble down the manropes and battens to hop aboard the barge ostensibly to oversee the ships workingparty who would strap up the heavier items of cargo and prepare them to be hoisted aboard with the main course yard as a crane and when you were on the docks mister cadbury did you see or hear anything odd lewrie further asked turning to face the purser once more well not really sir cadbury replied half his attention on the goods coming up in a cargo net and eager to go down to the waist to check items off i saw no warlike goods beyond a few kegs of gunpowder in the chandleries a brass swivel gun or two but nothing in sufficient bulk to draw any suspicions of course even in peacetime merchant ships of any worth carry some armament for their protection how very true lewrie replied though thinking that it was a rare ships master who would put up much of a fight if he found that he could not outrun or outsail a pirate or privateer compared to the reception we got in charleston sir cadbury happily burbled on after checking off two more crates i found that savannahs merchants were much more agreeable no french ships anchored in port mostlikely lewrie said no one to show off to i gather that it has been a month of sundays since any royal navy ship has called here so i and my party were looked upon as something of a raree sir cadbury told him the gentleman with whom i arranged these goods sir a fellow named treadwell when he heard that a british navy shore party was in his establishment came out to speak with me personally and was hospitality itself even treating me to a glass of rhenish and when he heard that you had requested me to find you a crock of aged corn whisky he was that eager to turn up five gallons of what he assured me was the very best kentucky not too dear i trust lewrie said a most equitable price sir cadbury replied naming a sum that didnt make lewrie wince or suck his teeth a very striking man is mister treadwell most fashionably dressed in the latest new london style much as we saw back home before sailing and hes no older than you sir but has the most remarkable head of silverwhite hair i took it at first for a wig but upon closer inspection it proved to be his own very full and curly all the more striking given his deep tan well setup of a lean but muscular build almost six feet in height white hair lewrie asked with a puzzled frown did he get scared out of his wits once dye imagine mister cadbury when he noticed me looking mister treadwell explained that he had once been pale blond but spending so much time at sea or upon the rivers hereabouts bareheaded in the sun when he was making his fortune it gradually turned silverywhite and theres no one that could explain it for him uhmm how many o these barges does he own dye expect mister cadbury lewrie asked thinking that the only youngish people whose hair had turned white so early were pinkeyed albinos and most of those in the circuses a fair parcel i would expect sir cadbury answered for i think there were at least half a dozen lading or unlading at his wharf whilst i was there and on our way downriver i spotted several others all fly a white burgee with a blue star like a company house flag just as this one does sir the barging trade twixt tybee roads and the city lewrie mused aloud upriver to the inland towns perhaps out to sea for the island plantations very possibly sir cadbury agreed excuse me sir but if you will spare me i must see to the kegs as they come aboard very well mister cadbury carry on lewrie allowed pushing off the bulwarks and pacing down the gangway to look more closely into the barges hold which looked to be a tad deeper than his first estimation suitable for bulk cargoes such as rice or cotton or tobacco in loads large enough to make each barge able to carry several tons at a time so it would not take dozens of them to service one vessel and he surmised that to own too many barges to do the work would be too expensive to maintain with too many masters and crewmen to hire or slaves to clothe and feed to make the trade pay a workingparty of reliant s sailors were grouped round the entryport and the stout loading skids forward of that crowding the gangway impassable so lewrie stepped back out of their way and slowly paced to amidships of the quarterdeck where mr caldwell the sailing master was taking the air and using a wee pocketknife to sharpen a set of lead pencils seen their like mister caldwell the barges lewrie asked him in almost every port in the world sir caldwell jovially replied or something akin boats the size of the one alongside could fit into the coasting trade back home quite easily even serve as water or supply hoys to the channel fleet ships on the french blockade stout slow and clumsy but seakindly even in a good blow so one like this un could make a passage from here to the sounds or brunswick with no trouble lewrie posed i wouldnt think so unless they were caught on a lee shore in a full gale sir or a hurricane which are known to strike these shores caldwell said sure of his conviction and since the question had nothing to do with reliant s work on the open sea or guiding her up the savannah river did not draw upon his chief duties then he would be much more cautious in his conclusions the prospect of a whole day more at anchor was just gravy to mr caldwell with nothing to do and lots of idle time to catch up on his sleep i gather you suspect that savannah is the likeliest port youve seen so far sir it is lewrie said clasping his hands in the small of his back it has the most extensive barge traffic a lot more than wilmington charlestons wharves are so handy to the sea that theres no need for them and twixt here and charleston theres not enough big ships puttin in that need em either all the sounds inlets and rivers south of here though so many islands and back channels all the way to the saint marys and the saint johns rivers in spanish florida that if someone didnt mind takin french or spanish gold he could keep em supplied on the sly very easily well theres still the matter of what the privateers do with their prizes sir caldwell mused with his head cocked over in puzzlement slipping the frogs and dons supplies might pay well but the real moneys won at a prize court perhaps forged american registry papers would be safer to sell than taking them into savannah for sale as legitimately owned ships but which wouldnt be accepted by a prize court like havana and wouldnt fetch much from spaniards lookin tbuy a ship or two lewrie huffed fed up with the whole business he didnt know a blessed thing and it looked most unlikely that hed learn a whit more admiralty shouldve sent someone else he glumly thought in a handier ship for inshore work and a lot more wits and guile did i suit em cause i could flash my bloody star and sash and awe the yankee doodles into confessin well it all seems beyond me mister caldwell lewrie said as he shook his head wearily i think ill take myself below for a long ponder or a sulk whichever comes first well get to the bottom of it eventually sir no error the sailing master said with a hopeful note to his voice pettus and jessop were cleaning the sashwindows in the transom and both quartergalleries when lewrie entered his cabins with young jessop perched on a sill and the upper half of one window down onto his lap with his arse hanging over the stern lewrie thought to find some peace and quiet but with supplies coming aboard reliant was echoing to various thuds booms screaks and rumbles as the heavier items of cargo were swung up out of the barge and over the gangways and thumped to the deck in the waist and then lowered down to be stowed on the orlop deck some items lowered down steep ladderways a deck at a time with much stamping of feet and groans from sailors after about an hour of brooding over his desk with a sheet of blank paper an open inkwell and a steelnib pen in hand with nought to show for it the din finally ceased and the marine sentry banged his musket butt on the deck calling midshipman rossyngton sah enter lewrie gloomily answered beg to report sir rossyngton said with a happy grin go on sir lewrie bade him i struck up a conversation with the master of the barge and his mate sir the mate being a fellow not much older than me he was curious about our ship and what sailing round the world is like so i struck up a good conversation they work for a rich merchant in savannah by name of treadwell he does a lot of the barge traffic and owns more than a dozen or so all sizes as well as some small brigs in the coasting trade and a brace of bigger ones that sail as far as baltimore and philadelphia in season to garner a fair portion of northern imports to georgia the mate my age is looking forward to sailing in one of those someday sir i asked if he ever got out to sea even for a bit or was he limited to the river trade and he said that hed been down south as far as cumberland sound a time or two sir rossyngton went on nigh breathlessly hes put into brunswick and most of the sea islands when i asked if hed had trouble with shoals and such he told me that most barges like the one alongside only draw seven or eight feet if fully burthened and theyre built with very stout bottoms and quickwork so if they do touch a shoal they can usually work off without much damage but when i got round to asking about cumberland sound and the saint marys river the master rounded on us and ordered him to get back to work and went cuttyeyed on me sir rossyngton exclaimed glared daggers at me he did and asked me flatout what my interest was in where they went and how did you finesse that mister rossyngton lewrie said feeling a rising excitement but crossing the fingers of his right hand under the desk in hopes that young rossyngton had a deal more cleverness than he had well sir midshipman rossyngton replied with a sly grin i told him that id heard some of the older hands speak of seeing alligators as big as cutters white dolphins and sea cows that can walk out on land at night when they were on this coast and how i wanted to go and have a look round and meet the blueeyed red indians said to live in the woods and how their young women welcome sailors rossyngton had the good grace to blush a bit lewrie cocked his head to one side and chuckled he told me i was a damnfool younker sir and should not be listening to old sailors yarns or put any stock in them after that he wasnt talkative but i dont think he took my questions as prying but who knows sir rossyngton concluded with a hapless shrug loath to let on whether hes been in cumberland sound or up the saint marys was he lewrie responded with a hopeful smile on his employers secret business perhaps because he has and that business is to stay a guarded secret damn my eyes mister rossyngton but unless that master did tumble to your ploy that was well done on your part well done indeed lewrie thumped a fist on his desk thank you sir we might not yet know just what is goin on south of here but it sounds suspicious enough to warrant further inspection now we have a name this treadwell one shipping company to suspect and we mightve narrowed our area to search to something manageable he told rossyngton who was all but polishing his fingernails on his uniform coats lapels in selfcongratulation most happy to have been of service sir rossyngton said thank you sir and you may go lewrie said rising i have some scheming to do he went to the sideboard in the dining coach and poured himself a tall glass of cool tea then entered the wee chart space to peruse the americanmade chart that spanned from savannah to the st johns river in spanish florida looking for hideyholes off the channels into the sounds and places with sufficient depth where a privateer that drew tentofourteen feet could find shelter either a schooner or a small brig a raider and a prize or two that shed taken any merchant ship cut out of one of the big trade convoys might draw as much water as his own frigate fully laden so he had to widen his search and reject the shallow channels behind the many islands thank god for cheeky saucepot midshipmen lewrie thought humming to himself i can bring the squadron back here and stop that treadwells business is he the guilty one must be in league with that arse hereford damme but i wish this could be wrapped up and done by midsummer lewrie felt a sudden daunting moment though wryly recalling that whenever hed thought he had all the answers in the past dame fortune had always found a way to kick him in the fundament but what can go wrong with thisun this time he asked the aether or is that askin too damned much chapter thirtyfour his dreaded comedown that kick in the fundament came not a day later as hms reliant butted her way south against the currents of the gulf stream to meet with the small consorts of the squadron it came from the first officer lt westcott seems to me though sir that strongly suspecting where the privateers are being victualled by this treadwell fellow if indeed it is he who is in collusion with them and nabbing them in the act are two different things entirely sorry to say lt westcott mused as he and lewrie strolled the quarterdeck from the taffrails to the nettings at the fore end and back again with lewrie next to the windward rail and westcott inboard there is that lewrie gloomily agreed as they halted and turned to face each other before headed aft once more if we keep close watch on the area they wont ever show up like watchin a boilin pot which never does til ye leave it be and a close watch is sure traise the ire of our american cousins well it may be worse than that sir westcott went on we havent a single clue as to which barge or barges that leave savannah are sailing on innocent passages and which are engaged in dealing with privateers we cant be certain if the ones that put into cumberland sound or either of the river mouths are aiding enemy raiders or just making a tidy profit by selling neutral american goods to the dons in spanish florida which is perfectly legal bothersome to us but still legal since the united states and spain are not at war good god dye mean that this treadwell is makin money on the sly by landin goods with the dons who can sell it or give it later to privateers and theres nothing we could do about it lewrie exclaimed mine arse on a bandbox he hadnt thought of that and it irked to hear of it it would be a clever dodge sir westcott said with a brief sour grin with no real risk to his purse his hide or his repute in savannah society even if caught at it he could thumb his nose at us and just sail away im an idiot lewrie chid himself a cackhand droolin then there is the problem of how often and when the barges are to meet with a privateer sir lt westcott added a schooner or small brig with a crew large enough to man her and fight her and carry extra hands and mates for prizeparties might be able to keep the sea for two or three months whether they take any prizes or not is that the arrangement since communications twixt their source of supply and their ship are impossible every two or three months for a rondy sir or do the barges cache supplies for them on shore and sail away fairy stuff lewrie said with a sniff leave bisquits and milk on the stoop at night and find a purse of gold coins come daybreak like hell who knows who could pilfer the goods in the meantime or make off with the payment before the barges could return to pick it up just a thought sir westcott said with a shrug and a laugh no it would make more sense if they had arrangements for facetoface meetings but when or where and how often are the mysteries and do they vary i wonder i could learn to loathe him lewrie quietly fumed one could be in the saint johns river safe as houses even if caught in spanish territory westcott relentlessly schemed on and the next set for the saint marys the third behind cumberland island then back to the saint johns and etcetera and etcetera might be a tad too complicated lewrie countered true sir westcott allowed nodding his head toward lewrie though were i in the looting trade i would make such arrangements to keep anyone hunting me in the dark for as long as i could i fear though sir that catching our privateers and their abettors redhanded is almost impossible as you say we cant lurk off savannah and chase after any barges heading south of jekyll or cumberland islands not with a frigate not with any of the ships in our squadron either they could spot us a dozen miles off on a good day and put into brunswick and lay up til we have to sail on playing innocently dumb then finish their voyage laughing at our haplessness and we cant leave a picket line of ships boats as watchers either lewrie fumed theyd be able to shadow them perhaps but theyd have to signal us that the games afoot and that puts reliant or the others within sight from the barges well shit finally sir lt westcott said with a mournful sigh dammit just hammer it home do lewrie thought even if we could stand into the sounds and the rivers as if they were all enemy waters westcott pointed out the odds are that we would do it at the wrong time and there would be nothing there even if we did know the exact spot where they meet every time lewrie came to a halt near the larboard taffrail and the flag lockers his mouth wryly pursed with his hands in the small of his back he spent a long time studying the toes of his boots then the seaward horizon at last he hitched a deep breath and let it out in a long sigh sourly wondering if ones body could deflate as completely as ones highflown hopes and schemes i mightve overthought this whole problem mister westcott he told his patient first officer the straightforward thing for us to do is to trail our colours up and down the florida coast from just below saint augustine to the cumberland sound thorn lizard or firefly can stand in much closer than reliant and when we do reach the northern end of our patrolling we can send one or two of em in within three miles before we put about aye sir westcott said nodding nice and slow under reduced sail so we linger for a while off the entrance to the saint marys river lewrie said on perhaps fetchto for an hour or so without violating anyones neutrality whather its that treadwell fellow a sea island planter with a ship of his own or a trader in brunswick supplyin the privateers well put the wind up him and make him think twice about doing anything as long as were there often enough you recall that damned convoy we escorted last spring sir lewrie asked with more energy unfortunately i do sir westcott said with a wince once the privateers at least two of em maybe three caught their prizes they hared off souwest which wouldve put em off the coast of georgia if they held course lewrie sketched out there was no place for them to sell their prizes but saint augustine or at havana and the shortest way home was to the souwest against the gulf stream current which dont make for a fast getaway unless they had shelter and sure replenishment somewhere round the border with florida and georgia a place to lay up for a spell and victual for a voyage to the nearest prizecourt back yonder is still the right place he said gesturing at their wake to where they had been so if we haunt the area below savannah as often as possible sir sooner or later well snare something westcott said looking hungry and eager to be at it fairly sure mister westcott lewrie assured him and even if we dont our continual presence will deny any privateers the hope of using their hiding places sooner or later theyll see that the game is up and look for another source of shelter and resupply and whoever it is that aids em will have tgive up the business too simple and straightforward it will be then sir westcott said with a laugh baring his teeth in one of his quick and savage grins and a chore that doesnt keep me up nights in a perpetual fret over who what where and when mind now i still would dearly like to nab whichever yankee doodle is in on it lewrie admitted with a laugh of his own wrap the whole business up in ribbon and toss it into their president jeffersons soup and force him to pay more attention to maintaining neutrality maybe even see the bastard hung or ruined deck there the mainmast lookout on the crosstrees cried sail ho strange sail two points off the starboard bows shall we beat to quarters sir westcott eagerly asked not just yet lewrie decided shes still on the horizon and mostlike shes one of ours blockadin saint augustine we have time to determine her identity mister caldwell assures me that we are at least six miles off florida at present and the strange sail is inshore of us for now id admire did you make a slight alteration of course towards her carry on mister westcott aye aye sir westcott replied briefly doffing his hat and turning to go to the middle of the quarterdeck simple and straightforward is it lewrie scoffed to himself so simple that even a fool like me can perform it so much for me to try and be clever logic and reason really are bastards just a simple sailor me lewrie sang under his breath then did a few dance steps simples all ill ever be rovin round a dilberry tree he extemporised on the spot sailin all year for one pen ney arrh i could play that on my pennywhistle he told himself with a laugh come up with a whole tune and sell it all over england within half an hour reliant had fetched the strange sail hullup over the horizon even though miles still separated them lookouts aloft could espy british colours then just to be certain a reply of flag hoists in that months private signals she was little hms lizard and lt tristam burys command i wonder if hes found a new sort of fish lewrie said with a laugh as lizard jogged up to join about two cables off the frigates starboard side darling bury lovett lt westcott japed theres a good fellow or youll bury darling id lovett that made lewrie turn his head to peer at his first officer were not boring you that badly are we mister westcott he asked with an eyebrow up well sir since fetching bermuda it has been all claret and cruising westcott said with a shrug and a rare sheepish grin we had one brief mornings action at mayami bay and i must admit that i am desirous of something definitive concerning privateers or pleasureable lewrie hinted westcotts answer was a smile and a nod ye never can tell whatll fall out before the years out sir lewrie told him if nothing else we might be able to cross hawses with that bastard frenchman mollien and put paid to him you would take him and his ship to nassau and not burn her sir westcott asked hang what the prizecourt costs us in the long run in proctors fees some brief time ashore would be nice lewrie knew exactly what was ailing the first lieutenant and it was not the lack of combat hes gone so long without a chance to top a woman the crack o dawn aint safe he thought ill see what i can do sir lewrie promised but your little play on namesd be best kept to yourself theres no need for the younkers thear em of course sir westcott vowed with a wee bow of his head lizard was rounding up pointing her bows at reliant as she performed a wide arc to lay herself within hailing distance alongside the frigates starboard side once she was within musketshot and her sheets had been belayed lizard s crew began cheering and waving their hats as if the frigate had just come to her rescue or they had won a victory hallo captain lewrie lt bury shouted over the short distance between them with a brass speakingtrumpet to his mouth it is good to have you back with us glad to be back sir lewrie responded in kind what have you been up to in my absence we have been making a grand nuisance of ourselves along the coast as you desired sir lt bury hailed back it has been the most delightful fun by god it mustve been for bury tsound enthusiastic lewrie thought recalling how sombre and grave the fellow had struck him at their first meeting we have taken and burned five fishing boats sir lt bury happily went on with an actual smile on his lean and scholarly face and captured two more we thought useful we made prize of one small spanish vessel attempting to land military goods at saint augustineshe is under thorn s lee at present south of hereand we took and burned a spanish privateer that took shelter from us in mosquito inlet well done lewrie cheered him oh buggery was lt westcotts glum muttered assessment we have made amphibious raids ashore too sir bury boasted near saint augustine would you care for a fat boar or two sir we brought off what livestock we could find lt bury looked as if he would burst from pride of their accomplishments spin in a circle and snap his fingers or shoot out his arms and spin some st catherines wheels in delight where away are thorn and firefly lewrie asked feeling a bit jealous that he had missed out on all that excitement himself they are south of saint augustine at present sir prowling in concert sir bury informed him very well mister bury lewrie shouted over take station ahead of me and lead me to them within three miles of saint augustine on the way gladly sir bury shouted back and waved his speakingtrumpet over his head in glee lizard cracked on sail while reliant had to take in her topsls to the first reef and brail up her main course to match the speed of the smaller sloop lucky fellows lt westcott growled once done with the reduction of sail aloft enterprising fellows lewrie amended looking past the bowsprit and jibboom and the feet of the headsls to appreciate the sight of lizard heeling over slightly to starboard and slowly hobbyhorsing along spreading a clean white wake astern for which enterprise i will dine them aboard this evening thear their tales and celebrate you will join me sir aye sir even do i grind my teeth in envy lt westcott said that promised fat boars better exercise for your teeth lewrie said with a laugh as he looked aloft to the commissioning pendant lets give the dons at saint augustine something to think on mister westcott hoist my broad pendant and let em know that we are back and ready to bedevil em even worse chapter thirtyfive we decided to emulate your example at mayami bay sir lieutenant darling of thorn jovially said as he paused in slicing himself a bite of roast pork and set the crew of the privateer ashore on their own soil minus their seagoing kits of course even closer to saint augustine than the crews of the two privateers we took earlier they should have no trouble finding shelter of course we kept all of her papers her muster book and letters of marque and it was burys turn to carry them to nassau lt lovett of firefly was happy to add there and back again werent you tristam in record time too well i didnt want to miss anything lt bury shyly agreed and how was nassau lewrie asked smirking the port did strike me as much busier than saint georges on bermuda sir bury answered rather sombrely and cautiously and captain forrester lewrie pressed ehm i got the impression that he was impatient over something sir bury said ducking his head as if loath to speak ill of a senior officer or speculate aloud when i reported aboard mersey sir he did ask of you and your doings and when he may expect you to return to the bahamas it was all i could do to wrest myself and my sloop free to rejoin lt lovett griped since your lizard is larger im sure that he wished to keep you for his squadron too just so long as you dont send me with the proof of our next successes sir darling pled with a laugh thorn is the largest and the bestarmed damme if i do not sense lust from here you havent told me how you nabbed the privateer pray do lewrie bade as pettus refilled his wine glass oh it was priceless sir darling hooted in glee just at sunset we were off mosquito inlet and about to putabout northerly and gain some searoom for the night when out she darted from shoreward tried to take lovett on i was leading do you see sir and bury and his lizard was astern of me by about seven or eight miles lt lovett said taking up his part of the tale she flew no flag and seemed to come on most aggressively so we lowered our own tacked about in a panic and hared out to sea to lure her on bury evidently saw what was taking place and stood on closer inshore i signalled thorn sir got shoreward a bit of her then went about in chase lt bury contributed lewrie expected him to elaborate but bury lifted his wine and took a sip as if done she strode up to us and called for us to strike sir lovett went on so we hoisted colours and served her a broadside at about a half a cable when senor saw that they broke off but there was the lizard twixt her and her lair so she was caught between us and not a quarterhour later just at sunset lieutenant darling and thorn hove up and she struck without firing a return shot she was the torbellino the whirlwindout of havana sir lt darling gleefully said fifty men eight sixpounders and a pair of sixpounder carronades a twomasted lateener like an ottoman xebec of all things sir of about an hundred tons handy on a beat to weather though lt lovett opined the spanish found them useful back in european waters so its no wonder that theyd employ them out here carronades lewrie asked shifting in his chair in unease im not aware that anyone but great britain mounts carronades on their warships god help us do the french copy em well sir they are british lt darling told him from the carron iron works with proof marks to match the dons were using them for chase guns but where in hell did the spanish get em lewrie pondered twiddling with the stem of his wine glass could an american chandler or merchant order the bloody things and pass em on to just anyone with enough tin perhaps to a spanish or a french privateer that shows up at one of the rondys which you suspect take place somewhere along the lower georgia coast sir lt bury gravely suggested after dabbing grease and sauce from his thin lips if as you already suspect french privateers are being supported and aided who is to say if the spanish do not avail themselves of the same aid that would save them a long voyage back to havana to revictual and their solid coin is just as good as french specie sir matanzas inlet saint augustine and the saint marys and the saint johns rivers would be close enough to savannah for scheduled meetings lt lovett added it is a crying shame that we allowed the dons to land ashore before we could put the question to them sir but we did not know at that time of your suspicions anent savannah just as we let the spanish go free at mayami bay without any questions either lewrie gloomed drumming fingers on the tablecloth for lack of suspicions at the time damn that is a shame sirs what of the spanish merchantman then have any of you asked her master and crew if they know anything about privateers being based upon this coast perhaps she was bringing them supplies it doesnt appear that she was sir from her cargo manifest lt darling said she carried rice flour and cornmeal on order to the commanding officer of castillo de san marcos to feed his garrison and powder and heavy shot for the fortresss guns sir along with over one thousand flannel cartridge bags for twentyfour and thirtytwopounder cannon but nothing small enough to mount on a privateer well at least we have a prize that wont end up costing us lewrie said with a sigh he noted that lt darling was looking a tad cuttyeyed dont we he further asked i sent her master and crew ashore too sir darling admitted with a load of gunpowder aboard i didnt wish to risk any of them remaining aboard and creating mischief i also had it in mind that fifty or more penniless mouths to feed would cause the spaniards more trouble than it be worth to keep them ourselves in your absence sir you left me in temporary command so quite so mister darling lewrie had to say after a moment to stifle his frustration those spaniards might have known something i see the sense of your reasoning no use cryin over spilt milk hey she must be sent in to nassau to be adjudged i cant send you mores the pity lewrie thought thank god sir darling exclaimed with a whoosh of relief she might not need escort either for such a short voyage lewrie mused aloud one of your mids and enough hands to man her so long as i may expect to get them back sir lt darling said a bit worried i am already two hands short of full complement and my senior mid mister bracegirdle is rated passed midshipman and quite valuable to my ship for a day or so he may style himself sub lieutenant then lovett said with a laugh there were so many small vessels in the royal navy like those in lewries little squadron that were lieutenants commands that they had since been allowed a second sailing master to serve as an additional watchstanding officer and one seasoned passed midshipman who would hold the temporary rating of sublieutenant for as long as he was aboard that particular ship returning to his midshipmans rank when reassigned most of the navy thought that the term sounded a trifle silly and pretentious you want him back sir hed best not claim bein one lewrie hooted else forresterd poach him off you quick as a wink why with enough hands and a sublieutenant he might be tempted to arm and fit out a jolly boat to protect new providence from the dons thatd be a fine addition to his squadron that is indeed what i most fear sir darling said with a mock shiver the rest of their doings along the florida coast had been just as eventful and lewries young officers were more than happy to tell him all with the use of the larger boats they had seized at mayami bayscrofulous enough to appear civilian and harmlesstheyd sailed or rowed into every inlet they could find into every rivers mouth in search of trouble the few small clusters of huts they had encounteredfar too small to even be called hamletsthey had raided and burned to the ground rounding up what livestock they could catch and sailing off with it settlements were few and the number of settlers even fewer an amalgam of dirtpoor spaniards halfbreed survivors of the original indian tribes and runaway black slaves from plantations in georgia and the results of interbreeding of all these whod come to eke out a living in spanish florida only twice had they met any resistance to one of their predawn landings they had raided matanzas inlet cutting out a large thirtytwofoot fishing boat and had landed armed sailors near the mouth of the shallow matanzas river where they had found a ruined earthen fort a small settlement and little else the inhabitants had run off there was little to loot and they were just about to return to their boats when a small troop of spanish cavalry had shown up from st augustine about twenty or so who had charged them with a low berm to raise them above the ground and the remains of the forts wall even sailors could face the terrors of a cavalry charge and they had skirmished with them killing two of the soldiers wounding a few others who had reeled in their saddles and had run the rest off back to the town a hellishscruffy lot sir even for soldiers lt darling boasted being spanish though what could one expect the indians were better at it during another predawn landing at amelia island north of st augustine and the burning of what few buildings were there they had been hailed by an indian in deerhide breechclout and vest his head swathed in what looked like a hindoo turban with feathers hailed and cursed out in good english and told to bugger off if they knew what was good for them lt lovett had led the shore party and had laughed him off til the arrows had started flying and several muskets had been fired in their direction i think their first volleys were more dire warnings than any real attempt to kill us sir the piratical lovett imparted he just popped out of the brush about a long musketshot off said that he and his people were seminoli and that we were scaring off the deer and we should go away for there was nothing of value to loot sir we never got a clean shot at any of them the way they only stayed in sight long enough to shoot at us then disappear again i considered that discretion the better part of valour and ordered the men to make their way back to the boats in parties of ten when they saw that we were going to leave they stopped shooting and it was only once we were headed out to the ships that they stood up and showed themselves met some seminoli long ago lewrie was happy to reminisce during the revolution when we went up the apalachicola river in west florida to treat with the muskogee the seminoli are muskogee and the new tribes name means wanderers with the original tribes wiped out by the spanish long ago i spose this lands empty enough tsuit em they let you off easy lovett i once saw a muskogee bowman take down half a dozen spanish soldiers and their local indian allies in half a minute notch an arrow draw aim shout yuuu and down they went flick flick flick bows and arrows seem so crude and ancient though sir lovett poohpoohed raising a laugh among the other supper guests damned near inelegant youd think so til skewered by one lewrie drolly rejoined there hangs a grand tale i should think sir lt westcott who had been listening to the derringdo of the others and mostlike grinding his teeth in envy spoke up at last what you were doing in florida regarding indian tribes i believe that you made brief mention at charleston that you had first made the acquaintance of that gentleman mister mcgilliveray with whom you dined ashore during the revolution something to do with the whatyecallems the muskogee a kinsman of his a younger fellow was the family firms agent to the muskogee halfindian himself though educated at oxford lewrie told them all he and a foreign office fellow went with us to get them to agree to raiding rebel lands with the weapons and powder we brought along it didnt turn out well and it may be a better tale for another night dont wish to turn into one of those maundering old bores who talk yer legs off over brandy bad as a soused uncle hey what i wonder about sirs is what sort of boats did you decide to keep and what did you do with those captured carronades well i got a better sir lt bury said with a shy smile a hollowedout log canoe would have been better than that old ark you took bury lovett declared with a laugh never saw a worse excuse of a boat or such a sorry splotch of paint bury gave it the deep six soon as he snatched up a proper cutter sir it was a tad sickmaking to look upon lt bury agreed hammered together by a poorlyskilled house carpenter with not a clue beyond right angles lt darling further teased it was an illfavored thing sir but mine own bury quoted the bard showing a faint hint of amusement at their camaraderie and japing to burys sadly departed boat lovett cried raising his wine glass in toast long may it frighten bottomfeeding fish seriously though lewrie said after they had toasted that ugly old scow we did keep the carronades and two larger boats one is a thirtytwofooter about the size of an eightoared barge sir fitted with but one mast lt darling told him tother is a about twentyeight feet rigged the same both are very beamy and of shoal draught quite roomy before we burned the privateer we took off her guns and parcelled them out between us as ballast in our holds we still do have the carronades and their swivel mounts along with all her twopounder swivel guns and iron stanchions hmm sounds to me as if they might make passable gunboats for future shore landings lewrie decided he sopped the last bite of his freshbaked cornbread through the spicy juices of roast pork popped it into his mouth and chewed as he mulled things over they were usin the carronades as swivel guns as well as bow chasers the wooden slide mounts were mounted on swivelling platforms to either bow sir darling said that might have made the privateer a tad bowheavy but all in all it was a rather neat arrangement we could mount one in each bow of the captured boats lewrie sketched out mount the captured twopounder swivels on either beam perhaps put ten marines in each as well and wed have decentsized gunboats that could go up the rivers further than our sloops do we find a reason we could put together a whole flotilla of armed boats and get at any privateers or supply vessels no matter haw far upriver theyre anchored sail em as far as we can fire the carronades just a few degrees either side of the forestays then lower the masts and row em like they did galleys in the mediterranean in the old days when we do sir i implore you allow me command of one lt westcott exclaimed in some heat these fellows have been having too much fun surely they could share it round who shall have thisun then lt lovett bellowed imitating the ritual of the lower deck give it ol westcott es deservin gentlemen i give you mister geoffrey westcott lt darling quickly proposed making pettus and jessop scramble to top up their glasses a fireeater of the first order ha ha for hes a jolly good fellow for hes a jolly good fellow lovett sang out and they tossed their fresh wines back to heeltaps deed he is lewrie said once the song was done and the very fellow to whip up some drawings of how the carronades are to be mounted on swivelling platforms a dabhand artist i have found you draw sir lt bury asked blinking in surprise you must show me your work aye im told by captain lewrie that he found your artwork a wonder as well bury westcott replied though i must own that it is rare that i attempt sketches in colour more blackandwhite are mine with passable use of chiaroscuro he said with a modest shrug i should be delighted bury responded quickly glad to find a fellow who shared his artistic bent the others at table shared a few secret amused looks for they had already heard of burys fishes and the lengths he went to for accuracy in form and colouring beg pardon sir pettus asked at lewries shoulder should i clear and set out the port and bisquit aye pettus so long as ye dont include the dog lewrie told him with a snicker once the new gunboats are made suitable sir might we essay further raids ashore even closer to saint augustine lt lovett asked with a sly and hungry loot yes now youre back with us sir we could use reliant s marines lt darling enthused lets see any scruffy spanish cavalry charge us then gentlemen i am delighted with all youve accomplished in my absence lewrie told them damme but youre all possessed of such bottom daring and cleverly applied energy that im fairamazed by you now im back i fully intend to keep the dons on the hop just as you did we shall poke round further north to see if any french privateers lurk along the lower georgia coast as i strongly suspect catch one and frighten the rest off perhaps or nab a criminal yankee doodle who has truck with them into the bargain as i hope it may be that our continued presence up yonder will scare the privateers off to safer hideaways blockade them in and save our commerce drivin em off might have to suit if we cant bring em to action but in the meantime bedevillin the dons will suit too confusion to the spanish lt westcott proposed confusion to the kings enemies lovett proposed next really sir you spent time among red indians darling asked once the din had subsided from their vociferous shouts of agreement with the toasts sentiments do the muskogee really practice cannibalism as i heard img stylewidth height src img stylewidth height src not cannibalism no lewrie said with a chuckle i saw no sign of that no heaps of skulls either though there was the odd scalp hung up here and there but even their principal war chief a fellow by name of mankillertrulyof the white clan and one of the fearsomest fellows ever i did see said that it was whites who started scalping so they could have proof of payment from the old royal governors he was a senior war chief though they didnt make war all that often after we got back to the coast and had our setto with the dons and their indian allies after i got accepted as anhissi of their fire they named me imataor little warrior though i dont know if it was said in jest or not ehm my word lt bury said with a gulp mankiller thought it a grand jape tmarry me to a cherokee girl theyd captured on one of their raids too lewrie added chuckling i had to pay him a good pistol for the privilege you married her sir lt westcott marvelled had to lewrie told him grinning she was ankled and it was my doing think of a swordpoint wedding with tomahawks he had not intended to but since there were no impressionable and innocent midshipman attable this evening he elaborated on the story her name was soft rabbit i dont know tthis day if that was her cherokee name or one the muskogee gave her but it suited her he told them first time i saw her was at sundown when we were bathing at the shore of a lake wore nothing but a breechclout she did the weeest loveliest young woman ever i clipped eyes on with hair as black as a ravens wing and the biggest deerdoe eyes lt geoffrey westcott ever the ships casanova shifted about on his chair making it squeak as if to ease himself too taken by the image to top up his glass of port or pass the bottle larboardly to the next officer lewrie had no fear that he would be deemed a maundering old bore for once he began everyone sat rapt chapter thirtysix no matter lewries vow for further amphibious landings he had to take the little squadron south again to peek round cape florida into mayami bay once more to assure himself that that grand anchorage was not being used they probed round cape canaveral and into the banana river then each inlet they found on their way back north to recommence the loose blockade of st augustine in the main they found nothing of value to loot or burn and no sign of privateers from any nation reliant and thorn lay at anchor a mile offshore of the matanzas inlet once more whilst lizard and firefly were anchored in shallower waters closer in the two new gunboats along with a gaggle of ships boats had staged another raid strong enough to go deeper inland if they found no enemy they could forage after the first hour with no sounds of combat coming from shore and no telltale plumes of smoke from gunpowder discharges or burning huts lewrie gave up pacing the shoreside of the quarterdeck and had his collapsible woodandcanvas deck chair fetched up along with his pennywhistle for a good sitdown and a tootle or two for a bit he considered having the quarterdeck awnings rigged for it was a hot day with light sea winds and a blistering midjune sun toulon and chalky were spraddled out atop the crossdeck hammock nettings like sleeping leopards and did not even open one slitted eye as he began to work his way through the rakes of mallow he was into a second rendition when bisquit began to howl from beneath the starboard ladderway lewrie stopped and the dog stopped he started again and bisquit bayed and yipped like a lonely wolfs keening the watchstanders and the hands on deck found it highly amusing weve a singing dog midshipman grainger hooted to his mates as many nights as possible during the second dog watch there was music and singing on deck even some dancing of hornpipe competitions to mellow the ships crew that was what the posted notices had promised back in portsmouth when reliant was recruiting music and dancing nightly lewrie would now and then lounge on the quarterdeck to listen or to watchbut he couldnt recall a time when sailors music had set the dog to howling lewrie got to his feet and looked down into the ships waist to eye the dog bisquit was out of his wee cobbledtogether shelter or doghouse and was on his feet tail wagging with his head cocked over as if waiting for more lewrie fweeped a few random notes and damned if the dog didnt throw his head back and bay once more ehm bisquit does the same when the marine fifer plays the rum keg up on deck sir grainger helpfully offered and when the bosun pipes a salute at the entryport he howls then as well it must be something about fifes and whistles that excites him like the horn will stir up the fox hounds have ye noticed if he bays when i play when im aft lewrie asked skeptical no sir not then grainger told him with a grin i imagine the sound doesnt carry far enough even though his doghouse is right up against the bulkhead to your greatcabins dye mean tsay i can only play my bloody whistle when im out of earshot mister grainger lewrie harrumphed ehm it would appear so sir midshipman grainger said with his eyes alight with mischief about to break out in titters lewrie had never mastered even the pennywhistle much less proper musical instruments and his attempts had become a running joke after a while aboard every ship he had commanded mine arse on a bandbox lewrie said with a putupon sigh very well i can take a hint he stuck his head over the hammock nettings to look at the dog and thankee for the compliment deck there the masthead lookout called down our boats is comin off shore lewrie traded his pennywhistle for a telescope and went back to the bulwarks to look them over for clues counting them for losses despite the complete lack of battle sounds once out of the shallow inlet the boats broke off to return to their respective ships all were there and rowing in good order the two new gunboats were closing on reliant with redpainted tompions in the muzzles of the commandeered carronades and a file of redcoated and white crossbelted marines seated inboard of the oarsmen he could see lieutenant merriman and midshipman eldridge in one with marine officer simcock and lt westcott and midshipman warburton in the other god knows where hed found it but westcott had a widebrimmed straw hat on his head which he took off and waved once the gunboat met the first sea waves and began to hobbyhorse the dog and i are glad to see you back aboard mister westcott lewrie japed once the first lieutenant had come through the entryport and had gained the quarterdeck true to graingers statement the dog had sung along with bosun spragues calls to welcome the officers aboard accomplish anything not a blessed thing sir sorry to say westcott said with a scowl on his face he took off his straw hat and mopped his brow with a handkerchief after our last raid into the inlet the dons learned their lesson the civilians hereabout seemed to have moved away and abandoned what settlements they had into the safety of saint augustine most likely we did spot a few spanish infantry lurking in the woods far off but as soon as simcock sent a file of marines in their direction they scampered and gave us no problems arnold is piqued i must warn you sir his marines got their boots muddy and their kits soiled for nothing hell be in the blue devils for two days at least you got yourself a new hat lewrie pointed out there was an abandoned cornfield sir with a scarecrow stood up in it westcott told him displaying his hat the hat is almost new so was the maize too green to pick so that was a bust too westcott appeared crestfallen and weary after his initial excitement of arming and fitting the gunboatsand sharing his drawings with lt bury during the processhe had been panting for the opportunity to use them against the spanish and lewrie had sent him off on almost every landing with little to show for it and not a single chance of action since sorry you found no fun lewrie said more sincerely well sir there was some excitement westcott said one of lizard s sailors almost got bitten by a snake a coral snake lieutenant bury said it was pretty as anything but deadly it took a good dozen very scared sailors to club it to death with their musket butts and after that everyone was skittish of where they stepped let me guess lewrie japed bury claimed it and is even how painting a picture of it if not this instant he will be soon sir westcott said with a brief show of good humour some of our sailors thought to tangle with an alligator a young one no more than six feet long the first officer went on that wasnt a fair fight either and the alligator won no one got hurt he quietly assured lewrie just some feelings oh lovetts men found a dead cow that the locals had left behind but it was gone over in the heat so much for hung beef too i always said that florida isnt worth a tuppenny shit lewrie said and i cant imagine how desperate ye have tbe tlive here aye sir all biting flies gnats sand fleas and mosquitoes and such westcott firmly agreed once one is in off the beach it is hellishwarm without a whiff of wind too the spanish are welcome to the place fetch anything offshore for the dog mister westcott lewrie asked ye noted how fond was his greeting to ye second fiddle with the bosun not a single thing this time no westcott said he does sound fond of me simcock and merriman doesnt he youll tumble to it sooner or later lewrie thought lets give the shore party a quarterhour to get settled and time at the scuttlebutts for water then well hoist signal for all ships to weigh lewrie decided time enough to sponge yourself off thank you sir westcott said with a brief grin i do allow that after a morning in that stifling heat i am a bit high shall we sail as far as the rivers or cumberland sound sir i think a loaf off saint augustine is in order first lewrie told him the soldiers you saw in the woods surely have reported our presence and its time to drive the point home by midafternoon the wee squadron was two miles off st augustine temptingly trailing their coats within rangetorandom shot of the heavy guns of the castillo de san marcos and daring the spanish to waste powder and shot they had worked together long enough by then to be able to tack or jibe about in lineahead whenever reliant hoisted a flag signal for tack in succession or the riskier tack reversing the order of sailing in column it was their way of showing off to the dons or cocking a snook whilst honing their shiphandling sail ho a lookout shouted down after their third parade down the coast off the larboard beam westcott and merriman had been below napping through the days warmth in the wardroom but came boiling up in curiosity to join the officer of the watch lt spendlove and lewrie at the bulwarks with their telescopes to their eyes aloft there spendlove bawled how many sail just the one sir the lookout wailed back looks tbe a large jib no two jibs and a large mainsl lewrie speculated aloud shes bowson to us so her mainsls winged out on a soldiers wind he glanced up at the commissioning pendant to determine that the winds were from the eastsoueast so if the strange sail was on a wingedout run she was coming from the bahamas i think shes almost hullup lt spendlove commented and i think i can almost make out a speck of colour at her masthead red and orange lt merriman asked wondering if the colours of spain were in the offing all i can make out is red spendlove told his compatriot she might be one of ours lewrie said catching the tiniest flash of colour in his ocular too with the wind directly astern of the strange sail any flag aloft would stream directly at reliant and only a slight fluke of wind could display it properly it does look red odds are sir no spaniard would be coming from the bahamas lt westcott announced any of their ships naval or merchant would approach saint augustine from the south oh christ lewrie thought with a sinking feeling forresters got the collywobbles that the donsre about to invade his patch and wants my frigate tback him up when bury came back from nassau he said the bastard was anxious about something the fubsy toad whoever she is shes coming right for us sir spendlove said closing the tubes of his telescope and returning to the middle of the quarterdeck to resume his attentive watchstanding duties deck there the lookout shouted down shes hullup from the crosstrees sail is a onemasted cutter an aviso from nassau with orders mostlike lt merriman concluded his telescope still glued to his eye aye sir i can definitely make out a red ensign at her masthead now she is one of ours lewrie shut the tubes of his dayglass too his mouth screwed up in mild disgust forrester was ordering him back to nassau with his prime mission incomplete hed better have a damned good reason lewrie fumed chapter thirtyseven the singlemasted cutter which proved to be hms squirrel came closeaboard reliant within easy speaking distance as the squadron jogged slowly north up the coast a bit beyond st augustine and her commanding officer bellowed i have despatches and mail and some men of your squadron i will receive them all lewrie shouted back then turned to midshipman warburton hoist signals to the other ships sir make send boats and have mail aye sir warburton eagerly said reliant had not received any word from home since departing portsmouth nigh six months before and word of mail or newspapers set everyone to rubbing their hands in expectation the seas were running light the winds were soft and the space between the frigate and the cutter was not an hundred yards with no rushing foaming wakes to conjoin so squirrel s boat made a quick and easy transit to hook onto reliant s main chains and send a midshipman and ten of thorn s longlost sailors aboard allow me to name myself sirjohn bracegirdle the newcome midshipman said doffing his hat and bowing from the waist lieutenant darling will be very glad to have you and your men back mister bracegirdle lewrie told him saluting him back you have the squadrons mail in that bag do you aye sir bracegirdle replied unslinging it from round his neck and shoulder and i have a despatch addressed to you sir that waxsealed letter was brought from bracegirdles pocket and handed over it was from captain francis forrester lewrie took a breath held it then let it out through pumpedout lips before he turned away to rip it open and read it dreading the worst i thought i told the toad my squadron had admiralty orders and i aint his junior but what the devil lewrie thought stunned by the letters contents forrester would not hook him or net him he had bigger fish to fry so did every royal navy warship in the west indies the note was more by way of a warning that the french were on the prowl since early may rumours of the presence of a squadron of third rate s some frigates and troop ships had come up the island chains of the windwards from trinidad barbados and grenada was it eight or ten warships or was it only four or five were they come to stiffen the garrisons of the french colonies of guadeloupe and martinique or would they come to invade british islands or reclaim the islands taken from the french after the war had rebegun in no one knew captain francis forresters brief letter said that he was summoning the few brigsloops under his command and would lead them south as far as antigua to reenforce any royal navy squadron he encountered since you made it so evidently plain that you are not under my command i must trust that you possess enough sense to see your duty clearly and if you will not join me out of patriotism then in my absence you will abandon your insignificant quest after spurious privateers and take upon yourself the temporary protection of the bahamas until my return mine arse on a bandbox lewrie said with a snort put the onus on me and dash off for glory will you he was torn though by the temptation to dash off south and participate in a real battle whether he had to place himself under forresters haughty and vindictive command or not for doing so beat his fruitless patrolling and the uncertainties of american collusion all hollow except for their few shore raids hed been doing the dullest sort of blockade duty with not a blessed thing to show for it nothing of consequence anyway its impossible to protect the whole bahamas with one frigate and a handful of sloops he furiously thought any more than forrester could with a pair o brigsloops and his own ship and her damned near aground at nassau for months on end but he quickly realised if he did dash off to antigua or st kitts that would leave the bahamas with nothing but sloops like his and a parcel of cutters like squirrel to challenge an french invasion not the spanish invasion that forrester had dreaded when hed spoken to him in the early spring and just why the devil would the french even care to take the bahamas he further asked himself if they had sent a small squadron to the west indies reenforcing the islands they still held made a lot more sense so did invading one or more of the british windward isles the big sugar trades lewrie thought getting a leap of his stomach in his chest and a touch of cold chill if the french took nassau and new providence bimini and the berry islands perhaps even grand bahama and the abacos they could dominate the florida straits no convoy no matter how wellescorted would survive and it would not be the odd privateer preying on them but frigates too there would go a large portion of british trade guerre de course lewrie muttered recalling the french concept of commerce raiding to disperse the strength of the royal navy which would give their fleet an even chance to sail out and fight on moreequal terms even weaken channel fleet to the point that their emperor napoleon bonapartes vast invasion armada could succeed in landing that twohundredthousandman army of his in england and destroying the last opponent between napoleon and world domination if i were bony thats what id do lewrie told himself but christ weve at least twenty ships in the west indies and the frogs are still over one thousand miles from here its no use borrowin trouble or jumpin at shadows mister warburton lewrie said shaking himself free of his fretting and returning to the hereandnow pass the word for my clerk mister faulkes to attend me in my cabins instanter aye sir he dashed below and sat down at his desk in the daycabin with no mind for the cats who were glad to see him but disappointed by his inattention he opened the inkwell dipped a pen and began to write the gist of forresters note for each of his subordinate captains you sent for me sir faulkes said a few moments later aye faulkes will you make three copies of this at once lewrie said and they are to go to lizard thorn and firefly with the mids who come to collect the mail theres already one of thorn s mids on deck make sure that mister bracegirdle gets her copy faulkes blew on the hastily written note to dry the ink reading it as he did so and hitched an audible breath at its contents a french squadron on the loose sir faulkes asked wideeyed might they come here do you imagine not all that likely lewrie told him after a moment more to mull it over he got back to his feet and headed for the deck again leaving a puzzled faulkes and two frustrated cats in his wake he got back to the quarterdeck just as hms thorn s temporary sublieutenant was regaling the watch officers with his tale of woe at nassau thought we would be slung into irons and kept as replacements til next epiphany bracegirdle was chortling as for my part i was allowed liberty on the town but our poor hands were sent aboard mersey in lieu of a proper receiving ship it was only when commodore forrester announced that he would be sailing that her first officer said that mersey was at full complement and released them as supernumary and it was only the kindness of lieutenant richmond of squirrel who thought to fetch us back to the squadron ha ha we would have stayed at nassau kicking our heels else ah captain sir lt merriman said noting lewries arrival on deck it appears that squirrel s captain lieutenant richmond did us good service in delivering mister bracegirdle back and further good service by sorting out the despatches and mail into packets for each ship beforehand capital lewrie said we will distribute ours at once at the start of the first dog mersey has sailed mister bracegirdle he asked the midshipman who appeared to be a cheerful and competent fellow in his early twenties aye sir bracegirdle replied though i thought id never see the day he added with a hint of amusement ripped herself free of the coral under her keel lewrie asked tongueincheek or was it a reef o saltmeat bones a bit of both i would expect sir bracegirdle said grinning the french squadron lewrie posed is it rumour or were there definite sightings rumours at first sir bracegirdle informed him then it was mentioned in the latest newspapers from home it is certain that they sent a small squadron under an admiral missiessy to the windwards back in the winter and theres quite a stir that an admiral villeneuve has escaped toulon with a larger squadron the london exchange suffered a huge fall in the price of consols at the news and that the blame was put on admiral nelson for not blockading toulon as closely as demanded if you can imagine sir for anyone in government the newspapers or english society to cast any aspersions on horatio nelson by then was unthinkable especially in the closer society of the navy after his many crushing victories and everyone on the quarterdeck growled objections but the papers also say that nelson has gone after them with the entire mediterranean fleet so god help the french when he catches up with them bracegirdle confidently declared even if villeneuve comes to the west indies to join the other fellow nelson will settle their business that was greeted by agreeing growls and cheers thats a diffrent kettle o fish lewrie thought if nelsons on his way he will lash into em if only to shut his detractors up and win himself more glory and praise the preenin wee coxcomb no worries then forresters off on a goosechase my quick note to lieutenant darling did not contain that information pray do deliver it verbally to your captain once aboard thorn mister bracegirdle lewrie bade him hoy the boat warburton shouted to the first approaching boat from firefly as ordered her lone midshipman shouted back faulkes came on deck at that moment with his freshly penned notes and lewrie handed bracegirdle one more scribblin mister faulkes sorry he said to his clerk something i just learned oh hell it is faster tjust tell it to the other ships mids never mind im babblin lewrie chid himself stop that as each sloops boat came alongside lewrie handed over their packets of mail and newspapers and had a word with the midshipmen from firefly and lizard stressing that there might be upwards of ten or more french ships far down in the windwards but that nelson would be chasing after them with a powerful fleet of his own and that for the moment the squadron would continue its patrolling off spanish florida once that was done and the boat from thorn had arrived and departed with her lost seamen he turned to look seaward and there little squirrel still was loafing along one hundred yards off his frigates starboard beam spose i should invite him aboard for a drink at the least lewrie thought i might even dine him in he went to the binnacle cabinet took up a speakingtrumpet and went to the rails to shout an invitation over lt richmond was happy to accept a supper we will be standing out to deeper waters at the start of the first dog richmond lewrie called over if you will take station astern of me that will save you a long row in the dark most welcome captain lewrie richmond replied at any rate i hoped to remain in company til dawn before returning to nassau we are being plagued by reports of a french privateer in our waters and i do not relish making my little ship an appetiser a french privateer lewrie bellowed back have any ships been lost no way to know sir richmond responded settlers on grand bahama and the abacos have sent word to nassau that they saw her and one of our local merchantmen came in and said that shed been pursued and only made her escape by reaching shoal waters richmond was right there was no way to know if any ships had been taken once a merchant ship dropped below the horizon from new providence outbound it was just assumed that she would complete her voyage if a merchantman left england boston or charleston for the bahamas no one there could know she was coming or when she was expected to make port or if she had ever existed it would only be the owners and investors the ships husbands who would mourn her inexplicable loss months or years later lewrie suggested that richmond come aboard at the beginning of the second dog at pm gave him a cheery wave then returned to the binnacle cabinet to stow the speakingtrumpet then peer into the compass bowl up at the commissioning pendant and the sails to judge the strength and direction of the wind and ponder forrester had word that a privateer or two might be loose in his patch but he sailed off anyway lewrie thought with admitted wry amusement over the failings of a longago nonetooloved shipmate he always was a damned fool with mersey and the brigsloops gone with him theres nothing of worth left tguard nassau and adjacent waters hes off for glory his name in the newspapers and a pat on the back from admiralty for his boldness lewrie reached into a side pocket of his uniform coat to draw out forresters note to reread it once hed done so he began to grin in delight seeing the possibilities forrester had snidely asked him to take his place while he was gone a request that lewrie was sure was already a complaint in forresters report to london that would be a black mark against him but two could play that game lewrie thought with a rising excitement there was a french privateer prowling the bahamas could it be mollien and his otarie catching him would be sweet from charleston where he had first seen that schooner to the bahamas was close to the suspected aid and comfort of the lower georgia coast lewrie looked cross the quarterdeck to the shore the coast of spanish florida was a thin green streak and of late not a very productive one he contemplated leaving bury in lizard and lovett in firefly to continue the patrolling and partial blockading of st augustine but if he did run across a privateer in bahamian waters he would need them and their shoal draughts to chase the foe where his frigate could not dare go besides if he did manage to find a real enemy it would be unfair to deprive them of the excitement long ago he in alacrity and his old friend benjamin rodgers in sloop of war whippet had raided on walkers cay to suppress piracy and it was alacrity that had to strike from the west at dawn lewrie i dasnt risk the banks rodgers had said of the treacherously shoal bahama banks there was shelter for a privateer up yonder and only a sloop of shoal draught and the new gunboats would be able to get at it might he leave hms thorn no he rejected that too for there might be need of her heavier firepower closer to the shoals that ever reliant could get hang it ill take em all lewrie thought mister warburton lewrie said of a sudden pass word for my cook yeoviil and hoist a signal to all ships captains to supper at the start of the second dog watch then alter course to seaward aye sir this was the sort of thing that he would have to impart to all of them facetoface this change of their area of operations and a new mission now in much surer takings lewrie began to pace from the head of the starboard gangway to the taffrails and back again working up his appetite for supper and pondering just what he should serve and what yeoviil could come up with on short notice look at that midshipman warburton whispered to midshipman munsell who shared the watch with him both slyly grinned and then caught lt merrimans attention jerking their heads in lewries direction bringing a grin to merrimans face too i wager he doesnt even notice the ships dog bisquit had slunk up the ladderway to the quarterdeck that tempting forbidden territory had hidden by the binnacle cabinet til lewries back was turned and had then begun to pace along a few steps behind lewries shins mouth wide open in what could be construed as a grin as he looked up with his ears perked and darting ahead of him whenever lewrie turned about to continue his slow pacing then take station off his quarter once more and with lewrie so lost in his thoughts that he was all unknowing chapter thirtyeight reliant s little squadron augmented for a while by lt richmond and squirrel quartered the seas as they beat their way eastwards into the northwest providence channel with the smaller ships ranging back and forth to peek in at bimini and the isaacs into cross bay on grand bahama and the hurricane hole that lewrie had used tween the wars as if the frigate was the master of the hunt and the sloops were the fox hounds they stopped and inspected a few schooners and small brigs in case they were french or spanish privateers flying false colours and spoke to many local fishing boats which might have seen any sign of an aggressive strange sail or seen any british vessel being pursued by one they poked into the berry islands then dropped squirrel off to make her way to nassau with lewries latest reports and replies to the newly received mail and steered for the northeast providence channel and the abacos the mail well after sorting through and filing the important letters and sending the least important to the quarter gallery for use as toilet paper lewrie had had time to savour personal news from home before his captains had come aboard for supper there were several from lydia all warmly fond chatty and informative beyond all sense her brother percy was going to wed this midsummer though people in society thought him daft for taking a circus rider like eudoxia durschenko for wife eudoxias evillooking father arslan artimovich was already looking yearningly at their vast stables of saddle horses and the racing thoroughbred and was then at their principal estate installing himself as master of horse there were letters from sir malcolm shockley an old ally in parliament his father sir hugo brotherinlaw burgess chiswick and reports from dour governour chiswick and his wife millicent on his daughter charlottes progess and one from his youngest son hugh now a midshipman aboard hms aeneas under another old friend captain thomas charlton that one was most informative and news that lewrie could pass along to all of his captains over that supper aeneas was in the mediterranean and a part of admiral lord nelsons fleet that french admiral villeneuve had slipped out of toulon early in the year in a storm whilst nelsons fleet had been loading supplies at maddalena bay on sardinia they had sailed as far east as alexandria in egypt in search of villeneuve fearing a second attempt at building a french empire in the middle east and the holy lands but villeneuve had slipped back into toulon by midmarch they had learned that the french had sailed again and they had gone as far as sicily in search of them before hearing that the french had slipped past gibraltar and were bound for the west indies fears that villeneuves ultimate ambition is the conquest of jamaica so we are off all of us in hot pursuit and huzzah i know not if sewallis in pegasus is still on the brest blockade but if so will he feel envious we pray earnestly that we catch up the foe and bring him to action one can only hope that captain forrester and his brigsloops do not cross hawses with this villeneuve on his own sir richmond had said at supper if he and the first french squadron unite who knows how many ships of the line that will be lt westcott had commented looking a tad grimmer than was his usual wont the entire french toulon fleet whatd that be i wonder lt darling had speculated and did he pick up any spanish ships of the line with him twenty twentyfive sail of the line and at least half a dozen frigates if jamaicas their intent the bahamas will be safe lewrie had told them and when nelson lays into them so will the rest of the west indies perhaps the med too once the french have nothing left hear hear lt lovett had exclaimed raising his wine glass on high gentlemen allow me to give you nelson and a bloody battle nelson and victory lt bury had soberly amended all in all it had been a cheering supper but for the dessert for neither yeovill nor cooke had been able to master the receipt for pecan pie despite their experimentations once squirrel had departed them the squadron had sailed on out the northeast providence channel past the lowermost tip of great abaco the holeinthewall then up the eastern coast past cherokee sound little harbour hope town and marsh harbour the main settlement and seaward of the chain of cays man o war great guana green turtle and powell cay bound for the northernmost end of the bahamas where the little bahama bank continued beyond little abaco and fox town and walkers cay where lay the east entrance to the inner bank walkers cay channel this should be good lurkin grounds lewrie told himself as the seventh day of their search went on with nothing to show for it ships bound in or out of nassau had to use either of the providence channels and if one did not have enough ships to watch each of the channels simultaneously the best bet would be to cruise north of the little bahama bank making long transits to the eastsoueast to watch one channel and to the westsouwest to watch the other with a hideyhole round walkers cay should a warship turn up it was the very place lewrie would have chosen had he been a privateer in search of prey but perhaps the french didnt think like him he was beginning to doubt they had seen several american ships bound for new providence or returning to home ports from the island and had stopped and taken a look at them to ask if they had seen any privateers despite his cautions to treat the yankee doodles and brother johnathans with respect and to eschew the urge to check the bona fides of their crewmen to determine if any of them were british none of them had departed from those encounters happily even if none of their sailors had been pressganged stopping them for what seemed no cause was irritating enough some of the boarding parties reported that they had been accosted with shouts for free trade and seamens rights no matter how politely they had been handled should he give up this search and head south he speculated the pickings for a privateer further down the island chain would be leaner the prizes almost too small to be worth the effort if the prize courts which served the enemy were as parsimonious as the ones hed dealt with or by late afternoon they might put about and go noreast round the top of the little bahama bank to do it all over again reliant was at the north end of a lineabreast patrol line with only four or five miles between ships with little firefly the closest to the pale green waters of the bank the weather was clear and the winds a touch lively strong enough to mellow the heat the seas were sparkling glittering in mediumlength waves not over three or four feet in height all in all it was a pretty morning but it didnt appear as if it would be an eventful one lewrie was just about to decide to send down for his deck chair when a lookout shouted down to the deck signal from thorn sir midshipman grainger added from his perch halfway up the larboard shrouds of the main mast lewrie fetched his telescope and peered outward trying to read it for himself there was thorn four miles off the larboard beam with a hint of lizard four miles further off almost hulldown and perched off thorn s stern almost masked she too flew the same signal the firefly was only a topsl over the horizon completely masked by hms thorn the originator of the alert relayed up the patrol line the hoist is enemy in sight sir grainger shouted lieutenant lovett was not the skittish sort if he said that he could see an enemy ship then an enemy there was in the offing mister spendlove lewrie ordered the officer of the watch beat to quarters another signal sir grainger shouted once more enemy is a brig and enemy is flying south mister eldridge lewrie said turning to the older midshipman aft by the taffrail signalflag lockers youre fluent and fast by now i trust i will try sir eldridge replied this is going tbe complicated lewrie told him taking one quick look at the chart on the traverse board first a hoist for firefly and lizard their numbers for general chase adding inshore he wished his smaller ships to pursue slanting toward the little bahama bank to deny that brig a chance to get into shoal water he hoped that inshore would convey that desire and had to trust to lovett and bury to want to cut her off second hoist will be to thorn lewrie explained waiting impatiently as eldridge scribbled it down on a scrap of paper her number and general chase adding seaward i relieve you sir lt westcott told lt spendlove as he gained the quarterdeck in a rush still fumbling with his coat sword belt and hat he knuckled the brim of his hat in salute spendlove replying as casually before dashing to the waist where the gunners were assembling by their pieces weve found something sir it appears we have mister westcott lewrie told him do you wait til the hoists are completed then shape course due south to pursue the chase is a brig that lovett deems a foe lewrie looked aft as the signal halliard blocks squealed the first signal was soaring aloft to be twoblocked while lewrie was waiting for it to be repeated pettus came up with the keys to the arms lockers which lewrie passed on to lt merriman and his sword belt and his pair of doublebarreled manton pistols ill see your cats to the orlop sir pettus promised have jessop see to the damned dog too lewrie ordered thorn hoisted a repeat of the first signal and then there was a long wait til the masthead lookouts could report that lizard had made the hoist to firefly and an even longer wait til lizard made a singleflag hoist for affirmative back to thorn and then to the frigate this is one hellishpoor way tspeak with each other lewrie thought regretting that he had spaced his patrol line so far apart this command of a squadron and sendin orders and hopin for the best is enough ttear my hair out but if firefly hadnt been down south so far we mightve missed the chase altogether the blocks were squealing again as the first signal was lowered and the second was hurriedly bent on to the halliards with commendable despatch eldridge got the second one to thorn twoblocked not a minute later with only four miles between them lt darlings ship was quicker to respond with the repeat and no query or submit to delay the process strike it mister eldridge lewrie ordered which was the order for thorn to execute as soon as thorn whisked her repeat down her helm was put over and she wheeled sutherly hardening up her gaff sails and bracing round her topsl and wee royal for drive alter course mister westcott lewrie snapped aye aye sir reliant spread more sail aloft too braced her square sails and yards for more speed and hoisted the outer flying jib and both the fore and main topmast staysls she leaned her starboard shoulder to the sea and began to lope south her forefoot smashing and parting the sea her hull and masts humming and trembling in haste we might be up level with thorn in an hour lt westcott speculated aloud though i doubt either of us will be of much help to lovett and bury the important thing is for us to be seen west of the banks so the chase cant hope to hare off that way lewrie said feeling a need to cross his fingers what he hoped to occur could still turn to shambles the wee sloops can deny the chase an escape into the banks and thorn can loom up in a sternchase so long as shes a brig of average size lizard and firefly can catch her up and take her well be in sight of her taking think theres a penny or two per hand in that mister westcott he said with a grin only if shes full of solid coin sir westcott disparaged the enemy brig loomed up over the horizon after an hour or two of pursuit with lizard and firefly visible to the east of her and closing fast lt darling was getting a good turn of speed from his brigantine too and was several miles ahead of reliant standing out to the brigs west and within what looked to be two miles of her deck there all the masthead lookouts cried almost in chorus gunfire lizard and firefly are engaged lewrie was so fretful that he slung his telescope over his shoulder and scaled the shrouds of the mizen mast to see what he could see which wasnt all that revealing by then the enemy and his two smaller sloops were almost hullup to him merged together and almost impossible to demarcate one from the other the sounds of their engagement could not reach his ears but there was a growing pall of spent gunpowder smoke down yonder he swung the lens to the west and there was thorn rapidly closing aslant still with an eye towards closing the door to any escape towards open water and the inlets of faroff florida she had yet to commence fire deck there the mainmast lookout shouted down chase is bein doubled bound souwest she was trying to get away trying to get out to deep water but lizard and firefly were now engaging her on either quarter maybe on either beam denying the brig a chance to flee and if she did turn away by then she would lay her vulnerable stern open to a rake from one of the sloops and a broadside from the other deck there the lookouts whooped chase has struck ease helm a bit mister westcott and lay us about a mile to their lee and once level with em well fetch to lewrie ordered twixt the devil and the deep blue sea she was by then lt westtott cheered with a feral flash of his teeth before the next hour was out all of reliant s squadron and their prize were fetchedto within rowing distance of each other the frigate had been stood down from quarters the gun tools stowed below in the racks over the messtables tompions reinserted into the guns muzzles and the arms lockers locked and the keys returned to lewries care boats were coming to the frigate from lizard and firefly bearing the triumphant lieutenants lovett and bury with a few strangers lewrie noted with his telescope it aint mollien and his schooner mores the pity lewrie told himself so who did we bag book iv well roll him high and well roll him low way down in florida well heave him up and away well go and well roll the woodpile down rolling rolling rolling the whole world round that brown gal o mines down the georgia line and well roll the woodpile down sea chantey anonymous chapter thirtynine once lt lovett and lt bury had been piped aboard and congratulations had been bestowed bury motioned for one of the strangers to come forward allow me to name to you sir the master of the prize bury formally intoned captain charles chaptal of the insolent they aint makin frogs like they used to lewrie thought as he eyed the short slim and almost reedy fellow who stood before him with his hat raised in salute over his carroty frizzled hair he looked no older than reliant s junior lieutenants msieur capitaine allow me to name to you captain sir alan lewrie baronet of the reliant frigate lt bury went on at that point chaptal performed a very graceful leg with a sweep of his hat across his breast lewrie touched the brim of his cocked hat he offers you his sword sir in light of his defeat put up a decent fight did he mister bury lewrie asked a mos spirited resistance msieur chaptal boasted agains fourtoone odds i regret zough zat you ave ze best of me at ze end they may come weedier these days but just as boastful lewrie thought with a sigh exasperatin bastards in light of your honourable resistance you may keep possession of your sword captain chaptal lewrie allowed though you were at only twotoone odds since my ship and our brig did not engage your home port sir basseterre on guadeloupe msieur chaptal freely admitted with a very gallic shrug and moue zough we do not spend much time zere we find better prizes ere of late he smugly hinted lewrie took note that chaptal might have put up a good fight after all and was more nervous than his mien might admit the fellow was smudged with gunpowder smoke and his waistcoat and trousers were splattered with blood drops and despite his bold attitude his hands were shaking that is a long way to go to find a prize court sir lewrie pointed out perhaps your allies at havana are more convenient captain chaptal opened his lips as if to reply but then thought better of it and put an innocent smile on his face licking his lips and saying je regret msieur with another shrug no matter sir lewrie told chaptal with a grin for i do believe we have your ships papers right mister bury aye sir bury said with a cryptic ghost of a grin letters of marque muster book captains logs and accounts ledgers profit and loss where and when he victualled lewrie said happily smirking which took chaptals mood down another peg you are fluent in written french mister bury good pray do go through them quickly and let me know what you discover of captain chaptals doings msieur he said to the frenchman while i will allow you to keep your sword i regret that i cannot allow you to wear it or hold it sheathed in your hand no worries it will be returned to you when you have given your parole at nassau where you your men and your vessel will be taken tomorrow morning in the meantime lewrie looked out toward hms thorn thinking that lt darlings brigantine had a crew large enough to spare a prize crew for chaptals brig and could spare hands to guard the prisoners aboard his ship and the prize besides its darlings turn lewrie thought howl about it though he may and let him dine the frog in for the night if you would be so good as to surrender it temporarily to my senior midshipman mister entwhistle who will convey you to the care of the thorn which ship will carry your back to nassau hmm mister entwhistle pass word for a boat crew to see captain chaptal over er aye sir the surprised mid replied upon arrival inform lieutenant darling that he is to escort the prize and the prisoners to nassau with all despatch see them into the prize court then rejoin the squadron which will be awaiting him norwest of bimini aye aye sir entwhistle said if i may have your sword for a brief time sir and if you will follow me full departure honours mister westcott lewrie added aye sir westcott replied then in a more casual way said darling will make bad weather of it though captain forrester wont be there tplague him so itll be an easy duty with a shot at a run ashore lewrie reminded him in that case send me sir westcott exclaimed what sort o fight was it mister lovett lewrie said to the other victor who was looking anxious to boast of his deeds sharp enough sir for a privateer lt lovett glady related when she saw that there was no escape westward she opened fire upon me to which i replied she had ten sixpounders and they were wellmanned and welldrilled but not all that accurate thank the lord i opened at about a cables range and scored some hits then bury and lizard came up off her larboard quarter and served her a broadside at the mention of his name lt bury looked up from the captured books he was rapidly scanning and gave a little smile this chaptal fellow couldnt outfoot me though he did try to put helm up and come down on me lovett went on at which point bury fell off the wind and gave her a sternrake the same time as i hardened up to keep aloof of him and gave him another broadside which forced him to haul his wind else bury would rake him again i hauled wind and we ended up on either beam blazing away like mad and that was enough for them with her sails in rags she struck before the action began sir lt bury absently said his attention still glued to the books and ledgers the insolent bore sixtyeight hands in all and lost nine dead and fourteen wounded to some degree bury looked up long enough to reward them with another of his shy grins then returned to his delving we shot very well our surgeons mates are seeing to them sir lt lovett said three or four are in a bad way so perhaps your surgeon mister mainwaring might assist them pass word for my coxn and boat crew and for the surgeon lewrie ordered hes needed on the prize tell him theres another matter sir lt lovett said turning grim these two sailors were captured they claim to be american but one of them is as irish as paddys pig and the other might as well have been hauled up from a welsh coalmine on a french privateer lewrie said with a frown rounding to look at the two men whom lovett indicated could be deemed treasonous sir lt lovett gravelled indeed it could lewrie said pacing over toward them where they stood by the entryport tarred straw hats in their hands being nervously turned round and round and trying to look inconspicuous as if they took up little space perhaps no one would notice them both were dressed in typical sailors garb of loose shirts one in gingham check the other in tar and smokestained plain linen tucked into the usual canvas sloptrousers which almost hid the toes of their buckled shoes and who are you my lads lewrie gravely demanded michael innis so please ye sor the taller and fairer of the pair nervously replied cuttyeyed and unable to look lewrie in the eyes his accent was straight out of a peat bog and you lewrie asked the other who was shorter wirier and black haired with almost a cornish beak for a nose dyfid evans sir the young fellow said david tat is but some call me dewey tis tpatron saint dye see and he withered under lewries stern glare and shut his mouth two british subjects serving aboard an enemy privateer in time of war lewrie accused thats a foul business my lads but oim not british sor arrah innis protested in a sputter nor oirish neither swear by christ sor oive me citizenship papers in me seachest tprove it moy famly an me settled in darien south o savannah a whole ten year ago sor and im from savannah sir evans insisted ive been american tree years now i got my certificate too sir if youd let us fetch em and show tem to ya american consuls hand em out by the thousands to whoever wants em lewrie scoffed they print em up and sell them and hand lots over to jobbers to sell for a cut they arent worth the price of the ink no sir no sir evans frantically rejoined beggin your pardon sir but mine isnt from a consul sir but t mayor o savannah when i first shipped aboard tradin ships knowin tat te war was on and all me da wouldnt let me go less i had solid proof so i wouldnt be pressed we come tamerica ten year ago sor when i was but a wee lad innis stuck in oi been a georgian since loik davey here says sor when oi thought tleave the bargin trade and go tsea oi went to a local magistrate at sunbury for a certificate for the same reason mister caldwell lewrie called over his shoulder to the sailing master do you know of any places named darien or sunbury ehm sir the evercautious caldwell said referring to one of his americandrawn charts i do see the names which refer to river settlements of little importance there is a notation that the region is referred to as the midway settlements aye sor midways closer tsavannah an sunbury oncest was a rival tsavannah innis exclaimed with a hopeful note to his voice as if proof of his towns existence was proof of his innocence but why the devil would ye sign aboard a french privateer in time of war lewrie pressed shaking his head at the lunatick nature of such service surely yed know did you get taken thered be a good chance of hangin well sir evans said with a sheepish grin teres a power more money tbe earned tan aboard a merchantman and a chance tsee more o te world tan havana or basseterre beats th bargin trade all hollow too sor innis added only havana or basseterre lewrie asked perking up there and back again was all you did well sir we did see fortdefrance on martinique once evans offered shrugging and almost smiling in remembrance of a good time despite his circumstances do either of you speak french lewrie asked them curious as to how the pair of them had fit in aboard a french raider we learned enough o their words for sailtendin an such sor innis told him and seein as how short they were o sailors they made sure we picked up their palaver roight quick but they rated us landsmen sor and niver paid us no mind offwatch butt o teir japes morelike sir evans added i spent a year and a half a merchant mariner and got rated ordinary but not on te insolent shes a poor feeder tboot the merchant trade lewrie slowly said hands in the small of his back and his gaze averted to the horizon out of savannah to french or spanish ports nowhere else what sort o merchant work innis and evans shared a look nighshrugged at the same time as if resigned then announced te prizecourt trade dye see sir seein what prizes tat insolent and te others took tsell at basseterre or havana evans told him then ship aboard another bound back tsavannah sor innis chimed in tdo it all over again got roight boresome it did lewrie whirled to gawp at them with as much delight as if the christmas holidays had come early just for him the others you say lewrie asked them what others well theres the otarie what means te sea lion for one evans confessed ten teres t furieux but her captains a real tartar sea lion s captain mollien lewrie stuck in aye sir evans said hes good at it but cant hold a patch tcaptain chaptal tats why we signed aboard her sir for hes te most successful young tough he be there was a spaniard too now and again the torbellino innis told lewrie moighta been a catholicrun ship but theres no way oid ever take articles with a don sor we nabbed her lewrie boasted here now lads how would you two like not to hang well o course sor innis exclaimed do anything sir evans swore a bibleoath i would lieutenant lovett lewrie said id admire did you take these two prisoners back to the prize so they can fetch their seachests and determine if they possess worthless consular certificates or genuine papers very good sir lovett replied sounding as if he would have relished a hanging instead then bring them right back here lewrie went on turning to face the pair once more i want you to tell me everything you know about your socalled prizecourt trade who arranges it and where and how its conducted if your certificates are genuine you could be imprisoned at nassau like the rest of your crew but he insisted raising a finger in warning if you tell me all id be of a mind tlet you two volunteer into the brigantine yonder lieutenant darling her commander told me hes two hands short not pressed but allowed the joining bounty think upon it youve no hopes of even tuppence of what pay or shares in captured ships you were due you have your kits and seachests already so thorn s purser cant charge you much if you volunteer that beats prison hulks or a newgate hornpipe lewrie told himself but not by much recalling what dr samuel johnson had said of seaservicethat it was like a prison in which one has the chance to drown why tatd be more tan fair sir evans exulted whooshing with relief ill do it and tell you all you wish if oi kin have someun wroite me famly an tell em where oi be sor innis quickly agreed off ye go with lieutenant lovett here then lewrie said and when you return well have a good long talk hey good god above theyre in in up to their necks lewrie thought in joy theyve seen the whole scheme from the inside by sunset we may be able to smoak out the entire enterprise and put an end to it he did feel a moment of trepidation though those two might not really know all that much or could he really get that lucky he could almost hear dame fortune laughing in the wings chapter forty i find them most convincing sir lt bury said after he and lewrie had looked the certificates over in reliant s greatcabins as the two sailors in question innis and evans stood before the desk in the daycabin portion nighshivering as their fate was determined good bond writing paper not flimsy lt westcott agreed as he held them up to the light of the overhead lanthorns to squint over them and the letterheads are embossed if they are sham they are the best ive seen aye like bury says they seem genuine lets accept them at face value then lewrie decided lads i believe you when you say youre american citizens of georgia youll not hang not this year at least now ill ask ye to fufill your part of the bargain in vino veritas lewrie thought or in beer veritas get em wet and loosetongued where mister westcott lets you and i take the chairs lieutenant bury do you drag one from the diningcoach and you two have a seat on the settee yonder lewrie bade them as genially as he could pettus please draw us five mugs of beer innis you said you worked on the barges out of savannah first aye sor oi did the fellow said grinning in relief but a bit hesitant in his response it might have had something to do with being seated like an equal with officers even in a looser more easygoing society like america there were still lessers and betters and enough who would insist on deference from one like him first off oi was bargin timber from the mills to savannah and goods back but that was lowpayin and boresome and like davey told ye oi wanted tsee a bit more o the world went twork for the tybee roads tradin compny for more pay but that was just riverwork from savannah down tthe roads and back lewrie looked over at bury who had been scouring the captured privateers ledgers during the time it took to take innis and evans to the prize and return bury gave him a sage nod the name of that company featured prominently on the meticulously recorded receipts did that for about a year afore innis went on pausing as a foaming pint mug was offered him and he took a deep swig wiped his mouth with the back of his hand sighed and said ah thats toppin thankee sor the barge master he took me aside one evnin and asks me would oi care tmake five or six dollar more a week and o course oi said i would but thatd depend on if oi could keep me mouth shut and not go blabbin did i get a skin full in the taverns then oi got on the coastin barges down tthe cumberland sound and up the saint marys or the saint johns not all the time maybe one trip or two evry two three months and what was secret about those trips lewrie casually asked not wanting to press him too sharply but mightily intrigued wed meet the privateers sor innis almost happily admitted theydve fetched their prizes into the rivers and needed supplies vittles mostly wed breakbulk the prizes holds o what they carried and put it aboard the barges trun up tthe warehouses in savannah leave the most o the captured goods aboard and bury em in lumber rice cotton tobacco whateverd be welcome in havana or the french islands tatd be so did one of our ships be stopped boarded and inspected by a ship like yours capm sir evans contributed he had been silent up to that point but had downed half his mug of beer and was almost youthfully eager to relate their doings thered be false manifests like the whole cargo was export goods not loot so when the prizes made port the valuable british exports from the west indies or british goods sent to the west indies would earn more money from the french or spanish prize courts lewrie hesitantly summed up more than if the prizes were full of georgian produce aye sor thats the way of it innis agreed grinning like a loon and the stuff from england aye sterling and plate crystal and china bales o readymade stuff bolts and bolts o foine cloth pianers and furniture kegs and crates o wine and brandy a grand market for a share of that in savannah too if snuck past te customs house evans added or put aboard one o the company ships bound for te chesapeake philadelphee boston nor even new york tats what i was doing workin the ships tcharleston port royal and ports north and back wed be lyin in te roads awaitin a wind with local goods aboard when the bargesd come alongside in te nighttime and load te good stuff and no matter how innocent we were told tplay it we knew sometin was queer thats what oi wished tdo aboard the ships loik davey was workin innis told them at lewries wave pettus brought round a fresh pair of mugs for their testifiers and after a while when the bossmans thought oi was trustworthy thats what oi got or oi thought oi did bossmans lt bury asked with a quizzical moue what does that mean he had been taking notes in a ledger of his own tats what all te cuffies say do ya ask em sometin sir evans easily breezed off tey say yas massah or yas bossmam he mimicked in slave patois so eventually the both of you ended up crewing the prizes to french or spanish prizecourt ports on the same ship every time lewrie asked where you became mates not all that many the bossesd trust sor innis said with a shrug not all that many who could keep their stories straight too stories lt westcott asked in a skeptical tone well sir afore we could set sail for cuba or te french islands a clerkd come down from savannah and give te captain his new papers evans took up the tale oncet a prize come in shed need a new name so wed rip the quarterboards or transom boards off or paint out te old and paint in a new get rid of a figurehead was it too fine or somone might recognise her by it somed say tey were owned by te tybee roads compny some by others altamaha compny the ogeechee compny innis recited as if by rote or named after the squares in savannah some o the ships were sposed tbe charleston ships boston ships god knows whereall sor faith yed o thought theyd flog ye half tdeath did ye not be able tkeep your wits about ye if we got stopped and inspected and did that happen often lt bury enquired not all that often no sir evans assured him and when we were except for fear o bein pressed we were let go right easy comin and goin with supposedly innocent cargoes each way lewrie mused innocent as all getout on te way back for sure sir evans said with a laugh lewrie summoned pettus for more beer allround listening was dry work and what about the profits from the sale of the prizes lt bury softly queried looking up at them with solemn eyes how were they handled or concealed in french or spanish coin or by draughts from one bank to another niver saw any o that sors innis said with a puzzled shrug after a moment or two of thought us sailors got paid at the end of a voyage at havana say or after we got back to savannah good pay it was for as long as it lasted and all gone by te time we shipped aboard a compny ship for te return voyage sirs evans said with a sad shake of his head over the quickness with which it went french or spanish innkeepers were more tan glad tsee us and te ladies too for certain but by te time come tsail we were mostly skint savannah publicansd leave us on the bones o our backs as good as the frogs and dons too sor innis ruefully told them thats every sailors complaint lewrie commiserated id like to ask a question lt westcott said still looking grim and distrustful it sounds like you could play the innocents on either leg of your journeys with the prizes but how were the crew and mates of the prizes concealed on the way to havana or other ports innis and evans looked at each other as if where those people had gone had never come to mind both cocked their heads in wonder then turned to look at the officers and shrugged i cant recall any of tem bein aboard when we took charge o te prizes sir evans said tey mightve been slung below in irons aboard te privateers werent tere when we were sirs mayhap theyd aready been sent down tsaint augustine innis supposed when we put into the saint johns river ttake charge of a prize oi just assumed theyd been marched off tsaint augustine we niver saw hide nor hair of em nor their seachests neither roight davey all teir beddin and kits were cleared out like tey never were tere evans agreed by te time we went aboard a prize she was painted up new and renamed like she was fresh from te builders yards cept she was loaded and ready tsail lewrie shared a suspicious look with westcott and bury one wonders captain lewrie if their prisoners were landed at all lt bury icily accused peering hard at the two sailors might i enquire if during your time aboard the insolent you brought the master mates and sailors in with a prize or were they murdered and put over the side jaysus mary and joseph innis erupted in shock nary a hair on their heads was touched once theyd struck swear that on me sainted mither sor hardly anybody was ever killed nor even hurt when we took em sir evans hotly protested tis te rare masterd put up any kind o fight when we overhauled em wit te guns run out guns o teir own aboard or no cheeseparin masters never sign on hands enough for a fight less teyre an indiaman capm chaptal niver messed with the prisoners sor other than pennin em up below oncest they was taken and soon as we put in we sent em off with all their kits innis bubbled out in a rush to show his innocence he wouldnt let no man mess with any wimmen neither women lewrie barked wives o te masters sometimes passengers now and again and teir maids and such evans told them some real fine ladies but what happened to them once landed lt bury demanded who took charge of them well sors did we land em in the saint johns river there was dry land handy and thered be spanishlookin fellers some free cuffies with guns or indianlookin mend show up with horses and a cartr two and theyd march em off south there s a good road down tsaint augustine did we put into the saint marys wed put em in comp ny barges and sail or row the prisoners sevral miles upriver twhere theres solid land and thered be armed guards waitin don know if they was compny men or not but wed land em and thats the last we saw of em honest aint that right davey teyd put any wounded te women and teir seachests on te carts kind and gentle as anyting sir evans assured them lewrie sat back in his chair and gazed levelly at them i hope to god they aint lyin he thought maybe they believe what theyve been told and are too simple tquestion it or theyre too incurious to bloody care i still dont like the smell of it you never heard any talk or wondering about their fate lt bury pressed no sidelong glances or warnings to hush they wasnt any o our busness after we landed em innis replied with a shrug and another deep swig of beer right then lewrie said as he sat his empty beer mug down on the brass hindoo traytable with a click of metal on metal whenever your captain chaptal brought in a prize and the prisoners were taken away wherever how did he send word that he was back in need of supplies and such well sor innia croaked still shaken by newfound dread suspicions most o the time the barges was already there waitin there was only the oncest we came in offschedule and had tsend one o the mates up the darien road tsavannah by fast horse and why would they be waiting so long between the arrivals of the privateers lewrie further queried every two or three month sor innis told him at the dark o the moon evry second or third month when i was working barges reglar shipments o vittles and such exportsd be sent down evry new moon and if they had any special orders tbe filled a barged go back tsavannah tfetch the goods afore insolent d sail or one o the prizesd sail when we were workin that side o the trade and does the place change with the timing of the new moons lt bury asked every second month the saint marys river and then the saint johns river on the third say in te beginnin evans confessed but te saint marys is handier closer tsavannah and if anyone ever stumbled over us when we were there wed just shove off hug the spanish side and sail or row up far enough tstrand anyone chasin us on shoals if it was an american revenue cutter aye innis added but if someone like you your honour sor caught us wed hug the other bank georgia bein neutral and all and if we had to we could slip over the side and swim or row to american soil and be safe as babbies lewrie lowered his head and rested his upper lip on the forefinger of his right hand mulling all that hed been told at last he lowered his arm and looked to either side at westcott and bury do any of you gentlemen have any other questions for these men which might further enlighten us he asked any part of their tale that needs further explanation how long had your privateer been at sea lt bury thought to ask were you due in the river soon or would your captain chaptal wait til he had a prize we was in two month ago sor with our last prize innis said looking as if he would care for a fresh mug of beer in any case we cant stay out much moren three til the rum whisky and beer runs out wed just started prowlin the bahamas for pickins coz your navys convoy escorts is gettin too strong the last thing that a privateer ever wanted was a hard scrap with a warship or even a wellarmed merchantman with a master determined enough to put up a fight which might cripple the raider and cost her captain owners and investors a steep repair bill against a warship the only thing a privateer could do would be to flee and pray for a clean pair of heels even a wellarmed privateers guns were more for show to daunt the desperate not for a slugging match so the next new moon would be the next rondy lt westcott asked shifting in his chair hard enough to make it squeak sounding canny and eager for you or another privateer well aye sor innis said looking surprised that anyone had to ask it was plain as day to him westcott sat back with a smile on his face quite satisfied anything else lewrie asked smiling contentedly no then i suppose weve kept these men long enough mister westcott would ye kindly pass word for a midshipman of the duty watch and arrange for a boat to carry innis and evans over to thorn of course sir westcott agreed rising to go to the door to the weather deck lewrie stood too as did bury you two are gettin off by the skin of your teeth ye know that lewrie told the sailors yeve been up to your necks in an evil trade im still not satisfied that the crews off the prizes are safe or even alive understand me aye you think upon that and thank god i cant link you to their fates volunteeering for the navys your second chance i strongly advise the both of you to make the most of it obey orders chearly and sing small it may not pay as good as merchant service or lays in a successful privateer but pay it is dont make me or lieutenant darling regret givin you the benefit of the doubt we wont sor cross me heart an hope tdie innis swore a fine gentleman ye are sir and a merciful one evans said off with you now lewrie gruffly ordered shooing them to the forward door once they were gone lewrie cast his eyes on the overhead and let out a long weary sigh lieutenant darling will not thank you for them sir lt bury softly said theyre kings bad bargains if ever i saw any i expect youre right bury lewrie grudgingly agreed but i made a bad bargain of my own to get them to talk so freely and i have to keep to it no matter my personal feelings you suspect that the people off the prizes are dead the same as i do lewrie asked as he turned to look at him i hope not sir but it does not sound promising bury said most gravely but for the most scrupulous prizecourt officials the muster books listing crew members suffice so for a privateer captain the temptation to save rations and money by eliminating them is quite strong and saves him the trouble of guarding and sheltering them yet i cannot imagine that being done by even the most coldblooded and piratical there are rules of war after all a code of gentlemanly conduct of honour those two innis and evans saw the prisoners being marched away so they were brought in if they were to die why not kill them far out at sea i hope youre right lewrie moodily replied but this insidious scheme hangs on secrecy if the prisoners were kept in some holding pen out in the wilds even in a warehouse at saint augustine theres always the chance that a few might escape and make their way to american authorities and the entire enterprise falls apart with arrests and trials all round even held incommunicado til the end of the war whenever thatll be theyd have to be released then and if evidence of what they witnessed comes to light a lot of people would be ruined but perhaps it is not the french privateers who would stand to lose the most sir bury sagely pointed out to men like chaptal what matters most is operational secrecy and a way to dispose of his prisoners and prizes quickly and remain on his hunting grounds without a long and risky voyage to do so or putting them all aboard a neutral ship for a cartel to land them in a neutral port or return them to a british port and thumb his nose at us lewrie sourly added that too sir but who runs the greatest risk of having his activities in support of a belligerent exposed bury asked who is more liable to be ruined and imprisoned whichever bloody american is running this arrangement for em lewrie realised and sir if the american behind it wishes even more profit from it why waste funds on marching the prisoners all the way to the spanish authorities bury continued it costs to build holding pens for prisoners to feed them and guard them captain chaptal and the other privateer captains might not know the fate of their captives once landed and might not much care despite our longheld distrust and loathing for the french for the most part they fight a gentlemanly war whereas an unscrupulous american man of business might not someone not a soldier or sea officer lewrie thought sneering just a bloody tradesman with his soul bound in doubleentry account books no no one could be that coldblooded marching em to the donsd be a cost of doin business lewrie said with a grimace once at saint augustine theyre no longer his concern either and hed let them feed and guard em if he could run the risk of exposure sir bury said bury had risen at the dismissal of the two captured sailors and still had his beer mug in hand he looked down and seemed surprised to see it he took a sip and set it down on the brass traytable and exchanged it for the captured stack of captain chaptals books sorting through them to find a journal despite the haste required to look through chaptals accounts sir i noted that he was meticulous about listing his prisoners by name and numbers and how many were turned over bury said flipping through the pages he was also most secretive referring to where he landed them as either loire or saone instead of the saint johns or the saint marys rivers with no way to know which is the correct river or rendezvous he noted how mon vieux met him with proceeds from previous sales bury fumbled to pick up a second ledger eager to impart what he had learned sit bury so you dont spill em lewrie kindly offered as he sat himself back down on the settee thank you sir bury replied his attention rivetted on finding the right references ah mon vieux is his code for the man behind it all on the american side and the firm in question he calls just la compagnie but here sir bury excitedly said picking up that second book and flipping through it are his meticulouslykept accounts for the owners and investors in his ship to prove how successful hes been and how much hes earned them less demurrage in prizecourt harbours in proctors fees less operating costs and repairs and those are not in a personal code so you think you have an idea of whos guilty bury lewrie asked sitting up straighter and scooting to the edge of the settee i do sir bury said with a sly smile all his payments are to one firm the tybee roads trading company of savannah i also here bury went on laying aside the accounts ledger and picking up a thicker book nigh the size of a thick dictionary but when bury opened the cover it was revealed to be a box to prove to his investors and owners that each purchase and outlay was legitimate captain chaptal kept signed receipts while some are signed by various factotums of the tybee roads trading company a great many as well as receipts from prize courts at havana fortdefrance and basseterre are signed by a mister edward treadwell who styles himself as president of the firm this treadwell and his firm appear to make over ten percent of each prize plus chaptals ships needs there are stacks and stacks of them seemingly filed in this box in neat chronological order though we know the firm we know the company and we know the bastard behind it lewrie crowed in glee do we take these books to the authorities in savannah theyll hang him though sir there may be a second unidentified man bury said frowning in puzzlement for the most part of chaptals journal he refers to mon vieux as his principal dealer but in the last two references to prizes brought in he mentions someone he calls coton so there may be another company and without corroborating account books i cannot bury was cut off by lewries peel of laughter by his rocking back onto the settees back and slapping his knee my old and cotton and treadwell are one and the same bury lewrie hooted loud enough to make his cats start chaptal calls him mon vieux not in the old friend sense but because this treadwell looks old no matter hes no older than me he calls him coton because he has a very full and curly head of white hair as white as carded and washed cotton my purser mister cadbury met him at savannah and remarked on his appearance now lewrie sprang from the settee and went a bit forward to the starboardside chart space fetching a book off the fiddled shelf to bring back into better light he sat down and opened it running a finger down the tightly spaced entries squinting over the wee type damme do i need spectacles lewrie thought vexed i aint that old surely according to the ephemeris lieutenant bury the next dark of the moon is in eleven days lewrie said looking up from the book at last eleven days from now once thorn rejoins us i intend that the squadron be off the cumberland sound and up the saint marys river tsee what we can catch pen em in and row up to destroy em or catch em as they try to run either way we put paid to this fiendish business chapter fortyone we will not get far up the saint marys i fear to say sir mr caldwell the sailing master cautioned as he lewrie and lieutenant westcott huddled over the dining table two days later where one of the purchased americanmade charts was spread out not with reliant no lewrie said lifting chalky off to set him back on the deck and not with a cat in the way at the best we might ascend the river as far as the narrows twixt cumberland island and amelia island then come to anchor athwart the channel with springs on the cables to block any escape with our guns if these soundings are right there seems to be about thirty to fourty feet of depth for her from there itll be up to the sloops and gunboats actually the americandrawn chart told them little the river entrance was called the saint marys the bay to seaward was named the cumberland sound but once in the entrance the river itself was named cumberland sound no matter its narrowness there was sufficient depth in the entrance narrows between cumberland island and amelia island on the south bank with a width of half a mile once past the narrows the cumberland widened to about twothirds of a mile and swung norwest to make a fairly large bay before trending more northerly and narrowing once more to less than a half mile if one followed the main course of the cumberland sound far enough the chart finally referred to it as the cumberland river and fed into the much larger st andrew sound below jekyll island spooked privateers pirates or smugglers could flee up that way and make the sea or scuttle up one of the minor rivers or creeks and run for miles before they turned narrow and too shallow making pursuit worse barely half a mile past the entrance to the cumberland the amelia river fed in from the south behind the island of the same name and snaked round before being joined by the bells river and lanceford creek and just where the cumberland veered north lay yet another of those joinings the real st marys came in from the west but not an hundred yards off the rivers mouth there was the jolly river which oxbowed through swamps and marshes from the souwest theres more waterways than a dog has fleas it appears sir lt westcott glumly said the privateers could flee up any one of them as soon as they spot us we will have to block this amelia river as soon as we enter unless thats where theyre anchored then well have to be quick about it to reach this second fork where the jolly river and the saint marys enter we might need double the number of boats westcott was impatient bored and he would pick nits i see no notes indicating the rate of the currents lewrie complained scanning the margins of the chart nor are there any tide measurements i wonder if our privateers and smugglers lay out only one anchor or two depending on how strong the currents are or if the tide flow is stronger depending on how high up past the entrance they moor of course if by one they might be sternon to us and slowed by the currents when they try to cut and run but we would be slowed at the same rate in our pursuit sir the sailing master just had to point out our best bet is to catch them sleeping lt westcott suggested before they realise were among them we will be under sail or under sweeps and oars and we could catch them before they wake cut their cables and hoist sail or man their guns lewrie added and manning their guns at the same time aye sir westcott agreed just where though he trailed off making a humming noise through his nose and drumming the point of his pencil on the chart how high up must we go before we meet up with them that is the question how far would they go to feel safe from prying eyes this lowermost part of the georgia coast was much like the marshes to either side of the savannah river it was as flat as the top of a dining table and most of the shoreline maritime forests were windgnarled and did not grow very high though they were dense a mix of hardwoods and slender pines perhaps a mile or so inland along one of the minor rivers or creeks in stillwater sloughs behind the sea islands there might be cypresses and live oaks which would screen the topmasts of ships from observation from the sea but where recall what those two sailors told us lewrie called to mind they boasted that if caught by an american revenue cutter theyd hug the south bank of the saint marys and be in spanish territory and if someone like us came along theyd row over to the north bank and be safe as babbies in their mithers arms he said with a chuckle as he mimicked an irish lilt the entrance to the cumberland sound and the wide part of the river to the mouth of the saint marys is divided down the middle twixt spain and the united states as is the saint marys itself they get behind cumberland island and theyre out of sight from seaward they get into the mouth of the saint marys and go up about half a mile and they would be all but invisible there he said tapping a finger on the chart or here a bit up the amelia river are the likeliest places i should think mr caldwell pulled a brass divider from his pocket laid its spread points along the halfmile scale on the chart and stepped off the distance from the entrance narrows to the mouth of the st marys river proper then grunted we shall either come upon them almost at once in the amelia river or have to go about two miles further on to the mouth of the saint marys and perhaps another half mile upriver you will wish to strike just at dawn i would assume sir at murky sleepy predawn if we can pull that off depending on the river current and the tide lewrie eagerly told him are your books sufficient mister caldwell or should we gut a few chickens to read the auguries caldwell raised a brow and harumphed in good humour over his captains jape he turned to his tide table book that may be asking a lot sir eight or nine days from now hmm while caldwell hummed hawed and pondered chalky hopped back atop the table and sprawled on his back belly exposed and his forepaws waving for attention westcott reached out to teasingly touch him on the back legs and belly making chalky squirm writhe and lash his tail madly trying to seize the finger for a nip and gnaw too quick for you today hey westcott gloated ow twine or a length of wools safer lewrie cautioned too late ahem caldwell announced at last clearing his throat in preface of his ruling on the matter this part of the american coast had never been adequately surveyed sir and any estimates of local tides are mathematical extrapolations from bettersurveyed ports up the coast such as savannah or port royal loose lick and a promise extrapolations mind it would appear that the most desirable high tides occur two or three hours after midnight and the rise might be between three and a half to five feet this chart describes only the sketchiest attempts at measuring it the low tides occur midmorning damn lewrie groused the ebb below mean lowtide depths marked on the chart though are reckoned to be only threequarters to one and a half feet the sailing master went on with a happy uplift of one corner of his mouth given the indicated depths in the entrance channel where you wish to anchor our ship sir which range from thirtythree feet to fourty or more reliant should be quite safe even at the greatest variation of a new moon low tide of course such does not signify for the rest of the squadron which only draw ten to twelve feet barring the presence of unforseen silt and sediment shoals even thorn will swim most ably into the cumberland and up the tributaries the saint marys most especially very well then lewrie declared rubbing his hands together in relief theres where reliant will come to anchor nine days from now he said using a pencil to make an x on the chart just outside the entrance channel say around midnight giving us bags of time to man the gunboats and the smaller boats sort them out into order and get out of the way chalky with less chance that any watchers posted near the channel might see us westcott agreed or warn them before were on our way to their lair whichever river it will be the saint marys lewrie assured him its the likeliest settled upon that destination lewrie leaned down to peer at the chart more closely tracing the course of the st marys west to the first bend which sharply turned south about two miles along and ran south for another mile before yet another oxbow that led to the norwest there was a good deep channel all the way deep enough for any of their ships if they kept to the spanish side til they reached the southern bend there was a patch that showed only thirteen feet before hitting a deep pool at the oxbow bend with nighfourty feet of water on the american side then averaged twenty to twentyfour feet on the spanish side of the river to the next bend the chart did not cover enough territory it was more concerned with the immediately accessible waters near the sea far as i know the bloody river snakes its way to the gulf of mexico lewrie thought surely we wont have tchase em that far if it is navigable that far shouldnt there be a town of some kind up there far inland where they can dash ashore and get lost in the population damn and doubledamn well thank you mister caldwell you are most reassuring lewrie said returning to the hereandnow thankee indeed my pleasure sir and my duty caldwell preened bowing his head if i may be excused now sir i told the youngest mids that i would test them on their knowledge of the principal stars of course mister caldwell lewrie gladly told him just so long as ye dont think ttest me lewrie thought what got lashed into me ive mostly forgotten lewrie rolled up the chart to stow it away spilling chalky onto his feet mostnettled that play was over toulon had finally gotten from the deck to a chair seat thence atop the table and sat on his haunches looking about to see what fun he might have missed he and chalky got sufficient wubbies to mollify them care for some fresh air on deck mister westcott lewrie invited its hot and stuffy in here delighted sir westcott agreed they spent some time strolling the quarterdeck to savour the wind and the clear sunshine far to the souwest the isle of bimini was just above the horizon a wee speck set in the heaving and shortchopped seas near the northwest providence channel they paced sidebyside for several minutes without speaking til lt westcott spoke up have you given any thought to the allocation of the gunboats sir westcott asked in a low voice and which of us will stay with the ship im torn between whether the armed ships boats will lead or whether the gunboats should lewrie mused it could turn out to be a cuttingout if all goes accordingly and we might let some of the sloops crew manage that with some of our marines parcelled out with them with the gunboats very close astern with our hands and more marines in them perhaps all at once ships boats and gunboats working in concert hmm depending on whether we achieve complete surprise or not sir westcott seemed to agree though once we anchor there is the very real possibility that it will take longer than planned to get everyone ready to go it always does sir or seems to aye lewrie said theres many a slip twixt the crouch and the leap our cutters and barges sir westcott went on thats four two boats of decent size each from the other ships that makes a total of ten lovetts firefly has no lieutenant and only one midshipman lewrie pointed out perhaps only eight boats divided into two divisions or flotillas or whatyoucallems itd be best did lovett keep his small crew together that will require an aggressive officer to command one division on the water and closer to the action aye sir it would westcott said through taut lips i think youre best for that mister westcott lewrie told him youll take one of the gunboats i assume thats what youre drivin at it is sir and thank you westcott exclaimed in relief that he would not remain aboard the frigate and miss out on the action merrimans junior hell command reliant lewrie decided spendlove can take the other gunboat and well put our oldest mids in charge or our boats leaving munsell and rossyngton behind to aid merriman thorn can spare lieutenant child and one of her mids and bury can place rainey and a mid in her boats well speak with simcock as to how many marines he can spare for it ehm merriman will command our ship sir westcott asked where will you be i think ill go in aboard one of the gunboats lewrie said either yours or spendloves you will sir westcott gawped spendloves lewrie announced id not wish tcrimp your style mister westcott ehm well thank you sir westcott said grinning ive been bored shitless ive been insulted demeaned and ive been rebuffed and dismissed at every port weve called at lewrie went on not to mention discumbobulated and mystified and now that there is a good chance the privateers their prizes and this bloodthirsty treadwell bastard might be there with some of his damned barges damme if ill miss a shot at settlin their business for good and all he paused a moment to look up at the commissioning pendant and the topmasts rocking on the balls of his booted feet besides mister westcott even if they aint there and we hit an empty bag at least well be doin something chapter fortytwo anchored by best bower and kedge sir with springs on the cables and the guns will be manned and loaded once all our boats are clear lt merriman reported the night was so dark without a moon and the usual lights at forecastle belfry binnacle cabinet and the taffrail lanthorns extinguished that lewrie could not see that officers glum expression though he could hear the disappointment in his voice very well mister merriman you have charge of the ship until our return lewrie told him mister spendlove mister westcott are the gunboats alongside one to either beam sir spendlove reported and the barges and cutters waiting astern of them for boarding lets get on with it then lewrie ordered resisting an urge to pull out his pocket watch it was so dark that that would be bootless for the nights gloom did not allow even the faintest hint of starlight by which to read it there had been a warm and steady rain offshore that afternoon and the skies were solidly overcast after its ending sailors and gunners descended the manropes and battens to the gunboats followed by files of marines with muskets lewrie waited til the last had left the ship before clumsily descending himself burdened with both his doublebarrelled pistols and a cartridge pouch and brass priming flask his rifled breechloading ferguson musket and a second cartridge pouch and priming flask for that as well along with his hanger on his left hip there is a hooded lanthorn under a scrap of canvas aft sir spendlove offered do you wish to determine the time good you have your copy of the river chart lewrie asked right here sir spendlove assured him patting his chest coat pocket though it may be some time before we may refer to it before thorn had returned from nassau to rejoin the squadron lt westcott with his draughting skills and bury with his artistic talents and lewries clerk faulkes had made freehand copies of the chart for all officers and mids in charge of the boats distributed to all captains at a planning conference aboard reliant the day before they departed the northwest providence channel for the georgia coast once the slightly brighter predawn greyness came they might prove useful shove off there bow man spendlove ordered in a theatrical loud whisper ship oars and give way the converted fishing boat moved off only a long musket shot before the hands rested on their oars and let her lie rocking on the tide and current making room at the entryports for the cutters and barges to be manned and rowed off to join her as lewrie waited he peered out to either beam searching for lizard and firefly to see how they were coping with disembarkation clear of the ship he could barely make out the faintest ruffles of slightly whiter water breaking along their waterlines and further off the hint of lazy lakelike waves breaking on the shores of cumberland island and amelia island ahead of his gunboat the river was as black as his boots he sat himself down on a damp thwart near the tiller fighting the urge to duck under the canvas to check his watch by the light of that hooded lanthorn the less of that the better but this sort of complicated operation could not be done in complete darkness the final plan that they had threshed out at the conference in reliant s greatcabins made allowance for some signal lights during the darkest part of the night and the wee hours of the morning once all the various boats were manned and on the water bobbing about like so many sleeping ducks lewrie would order two flashes from that lanthorn to the rowing boats to head up the entrance channel a second series of three flashes to lt westcotts gunboat and he would begin to row after the boats in his division four flashes would be directed to lizard firefly and thorn to begin to make way in their rear with the two smaller sloops employing their rarely used sweep oars and thorn doing her best against the current and ebbing tide under sail what sort of shambles what sort of potmess that several hours could produce almost could not be contemplated if thorn could not breast the current she and her heavy guns might end up too far back when dawn broke and might end up using her original ships boats and more of her reduced crew to towing her into action the longer that lewrie sat and pondered fretting and squirming the dafter his plan became and he began to feel sure that when dawn did come he began to feel torn as to which would make him look even more foolishhow badly it had fallen apart or that they had stumbled in to find no sign of privateer prize or criminals ill take a peek at the time he whispered to spendlove at last ducking under the canvas opening the shutter of the lanthorn and discovering that it was almost am if caldwells right about the tides he thought dredging up one lean scrap of hope slackwaters over and its beginning to make i think that i can make out two of our boats astern sir spendlove said his whisper muffled by the canvas and there are two more off the starboard beam lizard s i think are they sparking lewrie asked emerging from the cover of the suffocating canvas glad for the sudden rush of cool night air they are sir spendlove said sounding not only relieved but amazed that the boats from lizard assigned to his division would be able to find them in the dark and link up he drew out an unloaded sea pattern pistola heavy and clumsy weapon of such poor accuracy that it was best when fired against a foes chest or bellyblew on the pan just to make sure that there was no priming powder and drew it to full cock holding it aloft he pulled the trigger and the flint created a brief but bright shower of sparks as it scraped down the raspy face of the frisson that was another necessary violation of complete blackout but a useful one suggested by lt lovett all our boats answer sir lewrie stood resting a steadying hand on spendloves shoulder and peered far out into the north looking for a matching set of sparks between lt westcotts gunboat and his assigned rowing boats yes i think i see them lewrie eagerly hissed three four theyre all assembled too show two flashes from the lanthorn mister spendlove and lets get this procession under way the plan laid out was for assorted rowing boats to lead with a gunboat close astern of each group once past the entrance channel westcotts group would take the centre of the river whilst the boats under spendlove would press towards the shore of amelia island and the mouth of that river in case any privateers or prizes were moored there closest to a quick exit from cumberland sound astern of the two boat groups lizard and firefly would try to row in abreast using their longer greater sweepoars with lovetts firefly stationed near the north bank and burys lizard with more pounders would provide support for spendloves group should they run into awake and wellarmed resistance at least it looked good on paper lewrie miserably thought as he recalled the last briefing to his officers his oversized sketch of the entrance channel the rivers and their bends with pecan shells to represent the major vessels all moving along in parallel columns abreast with thorn trailing closely what it looked like now in the dark what it would look like when false dawn greyed the sky would be a sloppy other matter silence was essential yet the oars still creaked as they were hauled despite the rags over the tholepins to muffle the skreak of woodonwood oarsmen had to breathe hard and sometimes cough the marines had to fidget and rattle their weapons and accoutrements and the gun crew of the pounder carronade now and then created wee rumbling noises as they swivelled the slide platform about the rush of the river seemed a loud rushgurgle as the boat ploughed through it the bow lifting at each rhythmic stroke of the oars i think i can make out our boats sir lt spendlove whispered close to lewries ear almost making him jump out of his skin it was true ahead lewrie could barely see the whitepainted transoms of the two boats from reliant and the four others off the sloops he looked astern and thought he made out the foresails and fore gaff sail of lizard too a quick duck under the canvas again and a furtive slit opening of the hooded lanthorn showed him that it was almost five in the morning false dawn would come a quarterhour later he closed the lanthorn and came back to the cooler air looking north to see if he could spot westcotts division but they were still invisible he didnt even try to hunt for thorn to the south there was nothing to be seen in the mouth of the amelia river there were no ships riding lights one might expect to see aboard a ship at safe anchorage well have to steer larboard mister spendlove just to make sure theres no one in there lewrie said ehm how do we tell the other boats to do that sir lt spendlove asked it was still thankfully dark enough to hide the stupefied look on lewries face he had planned for them to be off the river mouth with just enough light to see up it and had made no contingency plan for supplemental signals let the other boats proceed lewrie snapped well go a few hundred yards or so up the amelia on our own and catch up later aye sir spendlove said with nary a dubious note and whispered to the helmsman to put the tiller over the boats ahead rapidly melted back into the gloom and they were alone steering south into the river mouth lewrie stumbled forward to the boats single mast to cling to it and peer ahead easy all lewrie ordered rest on yer oars for a bit he got the sense that they were further west than the middle channel there was a strong hint of the bulk of amelia island to his left and a smell of marsh to his right as if they were nearer to the west bank what he could see was a faint mist beginning to rise and cling to the surface of the water there were no ships in sight lets put about mister spendlove and catch up our boats he ordered after making his way back to the stern the larboard oarsmen backed water the starboard oarsmen pulled and the gunboat slowly swung about to row norwest as they did so a spark loomed up off the starboard bows a moment later there came a second shower of sparks best answer that mister spendlove lewrie said hoy there a voice called who are you spendlove lewrie replied as loud as he dared lizard here lt bury called back for a minute we almost fired into you did you get lost spendlove sure enough the sloop loomed up in the dark her sails rustling and her sweep oars groaning we detatched to look into the river lewrie told him my idea if you swear not trun us over well be catching up our boats i will veer off norwest sir to avoid that bury promised lets get a goodly way on lewrie told spendlove he pulled out his pocket watch once more to duck under the canvas but found that he could almost make out its white face and barely identify the hour marks turning about he saw spendlove referring to his boatcompass without the use of the lanthorn it was false dawn at last without straining he could spot the gaggle of rowing boats that had gone on without him far off see the splashes of each oar as they bit the water and the low swirling mist they passed through to the north he could finally see lt westcotts division and firefly astern of them they looked to be in good order for a wonder the gunboats strokeoar set a hot pace and the oarsmen gasped and grunted as they rowed but they began to close the distance to the other boats which had swung nornorwest for the mouth of the saint marys river the midshipmen in charge of the largest boats from the frigate spotted them and slowed their stroke to allow them to rejoin but when the gunboat was slightly less than a cable off there came spark signals from entwhistle and grainger and all of the boats laid on their oars slowly coasting to a stop mr entwhistle was standing and waving his arms over his head to get their attention then pointing towards the rivers mouth two minutes longer on and the gunboat was within hailing distance lights sir entwhistle called out with his hands cupped by his mouth riding lights in the river by god they are there lewrie crowed immensely relieved to know that they had not punched an empty bag that this new moon was a rendezvous for a privateer and his supplier were about to catch somebody mister spendlove lay on yer oars for a bit lads sorry about the long row load your weapons load and prime the carronade chapter fortythree once all weapons were loaded and the oarsmen took up the stroke again a slower and more cautious one this time the confluence of the jolly and the st marys rivers spread wide before them revealing not just one or two ships but half a dozen anchored up the st marys a schooner lay closest to the south bank stemon to them as it streamed to the river current a french tricolour lazily flew over her transom thats molliens schooner by god lewrie said with a laugh that snaileatin bastard we saw at charleston beyond her lay a larger brig with no flag flying upriver on the american side lay yet another brig with several masted barges at her larboard side even further upriver yet another vessel could be seen this one a fullrigged ship with a few more barges alongside her and beyond molliens schooner lay a brig that flew a french flag and another brig with a french flag strung above a british merchant ensign in sign that she was a prize its as crowded as the pool of london lt spendlove rejoiced which do we take on first sir the otarie the schooner lewrie quickly decided shes the strongest opposition he looked round his gaggle of boats sorting out the best for the task he would need the marines and most of them were in his gunboat and reliant s two boats mister rainey he called to lizard s lieutenant were taking thatun yonder once we do i wish you and your men to guard any prisoners and take charge of her work her out to the middle of the cumberland if you can once thats done ill take the gunboat and my two boats from reliant and press on to the prize anchored above her sergeant trickett you and your marines fix bayonets and be ready to board please stay sleepin just a bit longer lewrie prayed as the boats crept into the st marys the men aboard the privateer would be sleeping snugly anchored they werent navy men so they might not keep a strict watch if they werent at sea they might have been carousing the night before contemplating the value of their prize and might already have money in their pockets from previous captures and lashings of celebratory drink if only no lights glowed behind the sashwindows in the schooners transom so her captain might still be abed lewrie could not see any men walking her decks they were only one hundred yards off from her when a hesitant and reedy voice called out qui vive a sailor no more than a ships boy stood by the schooners taffrails in a wool stocking cap over thick blond hair peering at them wideeyed with a gaping mouth the next instant the lad ran forward with a wordless shrill or of alarm the next instant the schooners watchbell was being rung garde a vous aux armes les anglais mon dieu well shit lewrie spat so much for stealth guncaptain dye have a clear shot then put one right through her transom wake her captain up go go go lewrie shouted to the rest of the boats the carronade was swivelled to the proper angle and the round platform was pegged in place the guncaptain drew the trigger line taut bent to assure his aim one last time then leaned away and gave the line a hard jerk and the carronade squealed back on its slide carriage as it went off with a very loud bang sleeping shore birds sea birds and a flock of white egrets and blue herons cried in alarm and rose from the marshes and woods in swirling clouds the privateers graceful wide transom was punched clean through leaving a starshaped hole of shattered planking and a cascade of glittery glass shards if that dont wake em all up the damned birds did lewrie told himself as both of reliant s boats went alongside the schooner grapnelled to her and midshipmen entwhistle and grainger led their boat crews and marines up to her low bulwarks cheering like mad come on come on lewrie exhorted going to the gunboats lone mast once more to take hold of the larboard stays ready to board her himself lay her alongside her quarterdeck spendlove pistols were popping aboard the schooner and british cutlasses were clashing tinnily with french ones feet were thundering as otarie s sleeping crew came boiling up from below ready to fight for their lives there there was the schooners mainmast chain platform and handholds by which to scramble up three of the gunboats sailors and two bellowing marines preceded him before he could reach out and grab hold he got his feet on the platform and a marine reached back to hoist him up and over he was greeted by a shot and the bumblebee drone of a musket ball singing past his ear lewrie spotted the shooter drew one of his pistols and cocked both locks raised it and fired one of molliens escorts ashore at charleston a large side of beef dropped his musket from nerveless hands and clutched his chest before thudding to the deck on his back there were three french sailors who had just emerged from the fore hatchway to their belowdecks quarters one was shot one was spitted on a marines bayonet and the third took a cutlass swing on the side of his neck that halfway decapitated him raising a fountain of blood and a hopeless scream before he tumbled back down below to block others trying to rush to the deck vous captain mollien cried coming to his quarterdeck from an after hatchway sword in his hand and ready to fight rushing at lewrie at once with his smallsword levelled for a thrust you lewrie shouted back shooting him in the middle of his chest with the second charge in his pistol molliens charge veered off to lewries right as the frenchman stumbled tripped over his own feet and fell to his knees by the helm the hilt of his sword held in limp twitching fingers lewrie stowed his first pistol in a pocket of his coat and drew the second cocking the righthand barrel i told you wed nab you fore the years out ye little turd lewrie gloated as he stood nearby clumsy try that mollien keeled over to lay on his side mouth gulping for air like a landed fish his teeth stained red with his own gore vous anglais pedale you cannot more blood from a punctured lung gushed and his eyes glazed over unseeing damme but that felt hellish good lewrie thought turning to face the schooners bows in search of a new threat but it appeared that their boarding action had been successful there were over one dozen bodies on the deck unmoving and several more propped up on guncarriages or mast trunks badly wounded even more stood crouched with their arms over their head and their hands empty of weapons theres more of them below still under arms sir midshipman grainger reported pointing at the hatchway with a bloodied dirk sergeant trickett lewrie called for the senior marine id admire did you and your men go down the aft hatchway and work your way forrud root em out mister grainger hows your french passably good sir grainger replied shout down to the holdouts that well be setting this ship afire in fifteen minutes lewrie instructed him to say and if they dont wish tburn theyll come on deck unarmed and quickly there was a great cheer coming from somewhere and lewrie turned to find that lizard was passing the privateer schooner closeaboard her long sweepoars now stowed away and ghosting along on a very faint breeze her crew stood by the bulwarks and rails waving their hats we will be taking the brig beyond sir if you do not object lt bury shouted over waving his own hat on high aye bury take her and welcome to her lewrie shouted back laughing and doffing his own hat go get her lizards as lizard wafted by lewrie could look across the river and see lt westcotts boats approaching the prize brig that was surrounded by sailing barges there were french sailors aboard the brig a harbour watch it was a bit too far for him to see if they were armed or not he was already so laden with weapons that he had not brought his telescope there were some american sailors aboard her too possibly the crew that would have taken her to havana or other prizecourt ports they were not waiting around to be captured they were scrambling to board their barges cut loose and make sail upriver out of reach of the british raid others were going over the brigs starboard side to some rowboats to make a quick dash to neutral ground below his feet boots were thundering on the schooners lower deck doors were being smashed open men were shouting and there was a sharp volley of musketry and a scream or two as trickett and his marines made their way forward through the mates wardroom and into a series of storerooms bound for the focsle lewrie took time to reload his first pistol and reprime the pans by the time that he was through lt lovetts firefly was almost up to the prize brig on the american side of the river and westcotts men were swarming the brig and the remaining barges there were only a few shots fired and the deck and gangways of the brig looked to be populated only with british tars with nothing better to do lewrie descended the steep ladder to molliens small cabins the smell of spent gunpowder was strong but could not overpower the stench of sweat and soiled and mildewing clothing and bedding man lived like a pig lewrie muttered did he ever bathe he poked around in the wee desk into a seachest and under the transom settee to the storage lockers he found the ships muster book molliens accounts ledgers logs and a heap of letters along with the precious letter of marque issued by the senior officer commanding at basseterre on guadeloupe proof positive that the schooner otarie was good prize for the court at nassau all that he stuffed into a pillow case lastly there was one of those boxes that looked like a thick book when opened he found heaps of receipts all from the tybee roads trading company that treadwell shitd better hope hes powerful friends or hes a goner lewrie muttered again quite pleased with himself as he made his way back to the deck even if treadwell was not here there was solid proof that he had aided at least two french privateers over a year or more and when the evidence was presented at savannah there was a good chance he would pay for it his own hands were cheering and jeering as the last french holdouts came up from below tossing aside their muskets pistols swords and cutlasses even personal knives onto a loose pile of weaponry a lone marine emerged from the forward hatchway his uniform and his kit still in sunday divisions best with his musket slung over his shoulder and a bundle of abandoned weapons in his arms to add to the pile lewrie went forward as sgt trickett appeared from the hatch beg treport capm sir trickett said stamping and stiffening in paradeground fashion all the lower decksre clear o enemies no weapons remainin no spirits looted and guards on their run and such the frogs did put up a wee fight up forrud but we ended that right quick theres two dead and five wounded still below none o our lads though sir very well sergeant trickett lewrie replied looking over to his mids entwhistle and grainger any of our people hurt sirs some nicks cuts and bruises sir thats all mr entwhistle reported well done lads lewrie congratulated them all damned well and briskly carried do you be free with the frenchs scuttlebutts and drink some water theres more work upriver funs not over sir sir lt rainey from lizard cried once he and his men had boarded and secured their boats to take charge of the prize the other privateer is cutting her cable and making sail she and her prize i do believe theyre trying to escape us further upriver right then drink up lads and well get back in our boats mister rainey lewrie said the prize is yours i will leave you five of my marines to help guard the prisoners be sure that no one gets into the rum and all those weapons get moved aft of the helm aye sir i have charge of the prize rainery agreed reliant s cutter and barge refilled with men and shoved off as lewrie waited by the entryport the gunboat was brought alongside and sailors and marines tumbled down into her lewrie going last shove off and get a way on lewrie snapped to spendlove once seated aft by the tiller on a thwart take us closeaboard lizard if ye please sir i wish tspeak to bury as we pass aye sir spendlove said lizard had gone alongside the prize brig upriver of molliens schooner and british sailors were swarming her bulwarks and the sailtending gangways bury stood aft evidently waiting for lewrie he leaned far out to shout his news the french guards took a boat and rowed to the spanish side sir lt bury told him but the prizes master mates and crew are here on board weve freed them let them work her out to midriver short of the entrance channel mister bury and anchor lewrie directed standing in the boat well need their testimony before we let em sail off i have need of your ship upriver i see sir and i shall follow you directly bury promised pointing up the st marys to the fleeing privateer and prize brig and the gaggle of barges that were trying to escape two of them had men at the rails tossing goods overboard to lighten them to reduce their draughts and improve their speed we will have those soon theres enough wind it seems sir lt spendlove told him should we hoist sail aye lets give it a try lewrie agreed its a lovely morning for a race the oarsmen aboard heartily agreed with that as well and raised a brief cheer as the jib and gaff lugsl were hauled aloft the halliards cleated and the sheets drawn in it was not a good wind they found but the gunboat did begin to move forward breasting the river current and heeling over a few degrees its a river so it must be fresh lewrie thought he hadnt taken his own advice to drink from the freshwater scuttlebutts aboard the privateer he dipped a hand overside took a tentative taste of the river then scooped up several handfulls to slake his thirst it was fresh with a silty leafmouldy taste hmph lt spendlove commented looking off the gunboats starboard quarter thats expedient what lewrie asked turning to see what he was talking about mister westcotts cut the last barges free and is letting the river current take them out into the cumberland sound sir i think hes getting the brig under way but i dont see many hands aboard spendlove pointed out if the harbour watch and guards have abandoned her shed not need many twork her out lewrie speculated some of thorn s hands perhaps none of her own still aboard her then sir spendlove asked with a worried frown already marched off or slain god knows mister spendlove lewrie said with a sigh all of westcotts marines and most of his sailors were getting back into their boats leaving not over a dozen on board lovetts sloop firefly had not waited for them to complete their work and had continued sailing on her sails limply filling and flagging as she left the north side of the river for midchannel and began to slant nearer to lewries gunboat hoy captain lewrie lovett bellowed through a speakingtrumpet do you wish me to pursue or should i board the threemaster to see if she can be worked out of the river lewrie looked at the threemasted ship that was slowly looming up on the spanish side he could not see anyone aboard her above her bulwarks or on her gangways or quarterdeck no one was working on her forecastle to cut her anchor cable and no one had laid aloft to free any sail she might have already been abandoned by the french sailors who formed her harbour watch if lovett fetches alongside her itll take him half an hour twork back to the speed hes already got lewrie thought scheming an answer as quickly as he could hes best left to pursue view halloo lovett go after them lewrie shouted to him and even from two hundred yards away lewrie could see how much that order pleased the fellow tally ho what about the threemaster lewrie asked himself mister entwhistle he called forward to reliant s barge i fear that you and mister grainger must go aboard this prize here spendlove and i will continue on with the gunboat aye aye sir entwhistle replied looking crestfallen once the rivers clear astern of you you may try to get her anchor up and work her out and anchor short of the entrance lewrie added more as a sop to their disappointment than anything else the excitement of the day was over for those lads lewrie looked round again there was firefly slowly stepping away ahead by about an hundred yards lizard was astern of his boat by about two hundred yards standing away from the freed brig lt westcott and his gunboat cutter and barge formed a short column on the american side of the river astern of them all but making sail still have that chart with you mister spendlove lewrie asked aye sir spendlove said pulling it from the breast pocket of his coat and handing it over lewrie spread it out on his knees they were past a possible escape route the very shallow point peter creek on the american side and there was marsh on either hand for at least a mile on the spanish side and the north so there came a series of distant bangs from astern lewrie saw puffs of powder smoke rising from the marshes on the north bank and return fire from westcotts boats some of these that ran off must have poled their boats into the marshes and are firing from cover of the reeds spendlove guessed aloud yes well it wont do em lewrie began to say when the hum of a musket ball sang past and some shots were fired at them by someone hiding in the marshes on the south bank puffs of smoke rose as if by magic and a ball caromed off the gunboats gunnl taking a divot of painted wood warnt us tshoot back sir a nervous marine private asked waste o shot and powder lewrie told him we cant see em til they pop up just long enough tfire theyre wastin powder too if thats any comfort lt lovett obviously was not quite as sanguine firefly s larboard pounders erupted one at a time each evidently loaded with a charge of grape musket balls or langridge for the marshes twitched and shivered in wide swathes lovett had turned those four cannon into shotguns a minute or so later there were two musket shots from the marshes another broadside from firefly that must have been carefully aimed at roughly the same point another great parting of reeds and marsh grasses like a full gale and after that nothing there was still some sniping going on against westcotts boats the boat carronade at his gunboats bows erupted and his marines and sailors let off a volley of musketry it was lt darlings thorn that settled the matter she had slowly worked her way past where the first privateer and the prizes had been anchored and turned her much heavier guns the six pounder carronades of her starboard battery loose on the sharpshooters with much the same results that lovett had there were no more shots fired at westcotts boats theyre almost at the narrows the bend of the river sir lt spendlove pointed out holding up a length of spunwool to judge the winds strength and direction and tautening the main sheet just a bit snugger the prize brig was showing her larboard side as she made the turn that led south with her captor the other privateer brig in her wake as the privateer began her turn her sails shivering she let loose with a stern chase gun and the aftermost of her larboard battery the round shot passed so close to the few fleeing barges that two of them shied away off course for a moment and one sheered north to run for the marshes lewrie did a quick estimate of where it might run aground and found that there was a spit of dry land behind all the marsh perhaps only a tenth of a mile for her small crew to scramble before reaching some woods ahead firefly was running out her starboard battery in hopes of smashing her to kindling once level with the grounded barge firefly was beginning to make good progress in her chase closing the distance on the remaining sailing barges and the bend in the river astern lewrie could see that lizard had a wee mustachio of foam under her forefoot as well the wind was freshening just a bit all of westcotts boats were now under sail the thirtytwofoot barge with two lugsls footing away from the singlemasted cutter and the gunboat as lewrie watched westcott put his oarsmen to work once more for just a bit more speed the two fleeing brigs might have gotten round the bend but were still in plain sight above the grasses of the marshes showing themselves in profile the privateer opened fire with her larboard guns and roundshot howled overhead mostly aimed at firefly which had little in the way of bowchasers with which to reply the wind was on their beams whilst the pursuing vessels had the winds astern in a sudden shift the sun was not quite risen but the east horizon showed a lighter bluegrey streak of clearing behind the darker gloom of the nights overcast try a shot with the carronade sir spendlove asked eager to be doing something other than tending the sheets still too far for a light carronade lewrie decided as lovett opened fire on the barge which had indeed grounded on the north bank near that long narrow spit of dryer land firefly s four pounders on her starboard side raised great splashes all round the barge scoring at least one hit that tore her transom open the range was not one hundred yards from midchannel to the marshes two or three sailors on the barge had been going over her bows to wade through the clinging mud and silt but two of them whirled and fell likely splintered by the shards from the shattered transom the barge began to sink a minute later and firefly was at the bend of the river with lizard striding up to join her passing both gunboats much to the frustration of lewrie spendlove and obviously westcott who held up a fist and shook it at the sloops shouting something best not heard by gentlemen firefly quickly went about her sails luffing and refilling on a new course with lizard nipping at her heels should we continue sir spendlove asked sounding weary as long as we can sir lewrie told him i want tsee how it ends be in at the kill even if we cant contribute much to it two minutes more and their gunboat was at the bend too and going about lewrie consulted the handdrawn chart once more noting how short this leg was to the south just over half a mile with the best channel nearest the spanish bank and a long narrow and shallow shoal in midchannel that widened and shoaled further where the river made a turn to the norwest for a bit then bent again to the west lewrie saw what they might be driving for on the north bank there was dry and neutral ground on the american side of the st marys right down to the river with over twenty feet of depth they hoped to ground there whoa thats a closeun one of the gunboats sailors cried snapping lewries attention ahead once more the privateer was nearest to them still firing slowly overlapping her prize brig stealing her wind it looked as if the two of them were abreast and close enough to scrape hull paint shes run totherun aground the sailor exclaimed a moment later theres no room for both in the channel lewrie crowed its not an hundred feet wide weve got the prize at least we will board her sir spendlove asked no shes a deadun leave it lewrie laughed aloud were after the privateer lovett and bury were ahead of their gunboat by then and when they came level with the prize they veered east of her lovett could not resist the urge to hear loud bangs it appeared for he fired his starboard battery into her to make sure that she would not be worked off the shoal the range was almost hulltohull and the brig flung parts of herself into the air when struck a minute later and damned if the phlegmatic lt bury didnt do the same thing first firefly then lizard reached the deep channel that led round to the norwest in pursuit of the privateer slewing far to the south to follow the deep channel then wearing to take the wind on the other quarter and hardening up a bit to claw over to the north shore to follow the channel to the american side as each wore they fired a full broadside at the privateer which was sternon to them got er they did they it er twixt wind an warter the garrulous sailor cheered huzzah firefly huzzah lizard ha ha the privateers main topsls yard was shattered and her topmast swung a full degrees to hang inverted across the marshes all could see her stern chewed up with gouts of old paint dirt and shattered planking flung out in clouds i dont think shes turning lewrie said quickly looking at the chart on his lap excitement rising theres over fourty feet o water yonder then one foot or less right by the bank of the shes aground spendlove shouted waving his hat in joy weve got her lewrie said in delight a clean sweep do you think we could put up a broom at the main top like the dutch did ages ago sir spendlove chortled hoy theres boats puttin out from the grounded brig the guncaptain of the carronade pointed out can i try my eye on em capm blaze away lewrie was happy to allow the boats had been towed astern of the brig before she grounded and people had tumbled into them on her larboard side as soon as they were hauled up by the towing lines damme is it him lewrie muttered as he saw a tall man with white hair making his way down the battens to the second boat with a musket slung over his shoulder and a redleather pouch on his hip their gunboat was less than a quartermile off the brigs stern it was possible that both rowboats might get away the first got away from the brigs side and headed for the deep channel the guncaptain swivelled his carronade round trying to aim at it but the jib was in the way its foot less than a foot from the carronades muzzle if he fired he might set it afire hand the jib for a while spendlove ordered give the gun a clear shot the second rowboat was now clear of the brig hands aboard it hastily hoisting a lugsl and jib others were aiming their muskets astern some of them fired and rounds sang past one thunk ing into the gunboats hull far beyond the range of a musket that lewrie saw two of them standing up to reload placing a ball in the muzzles and shoving them down with their ramrods shoving hard they have rifles not muskets lewrie warned the boats crew he reached for his ferguson rifle stowed aft near spendlove and the tiller the morning had been so damp and muggy that he had not loaded it depending on his pistols and sword for fighting he turned the long sweeping trigger guard around one full turn lowering the thick vertical screw behind the breech from his rifle pouch he drew out a paper cartridge and shoved it up into the breech a turn of the screw in the opposite direction sealed the breech once more and ripped the paper cartridge end to expose the propellant charge drawing the lock to halfcock he opened the pan and sprinkled finemealed powder in then closed the pan and pulled the lock to full cock then turned to sit across the thwart and take aim thunk came another rifle ball from the rowboat which was now under full sail ow god elp me an idle oarsman cried as a second shot hit him in his upper arm bang went the carronade as the gunner finally got a clear bead on the first boat which was still under oars lewrie waited for the smoke from the carronade to clear wondering why he had not practiced with his rifled musket more often thinking that if there had only been something worth hunting at bermuda in the bahamas there the whitehaired man was standing to reload placing a thin leather patch and a ball atop the muzzle of his pennsylvania rifle he began to push down as lewrie took careful aim holding a bit above the mans head so the drop of the round would strike somewhere in midchest he took a deep breath let it out and gently stroked the trigger with the tip of his forefinger the powder in the pan flashed off in a cloud of sparks then an eyeblink later the powder in the barrel took light and the rifle shoved him in the shoulder he blinked waited for the smoke from the muzzle to clear praise th lord capm ye got him a marine whooshed in disbelief at nighon a hundred an fifty yards is it a foot held too low or my aim shifted lewrie thought but all in all he could be quite pleased with his marksmanship the whitehaired fellow wore a shiny white satin waistcoat and a pair of buff trousers there was a splotch of blood between the bottom of his waistcoat and his groin right into the guts and a death wound for sure not right away of course that might take several agonising days the fellow collapsed into the arms of his compatriots who showed no more interest in shooting back bang went the carronade once more and the boats crew whooped in joy to see the first boat shot clean through and begin to take on water at once the men aboard went over the side a rare few of them swimming to the shallows of the american side and safety most of them though were like british sailors who could not swim a lick they floundered kicked and wailed to keep their heads above water but the st marys had them and by the time the gunboat reached the spot where only the upturned bow of the rowboat remained afloat on a pocket of trapped air there was only one survivor to pluck from death the other boat from the brig the one that had been under sail made the turn to the norwest at the end of that stretch of river wore and rounded the last of the shoal on the north bank when in the shallows where it grounded and its survivors could splash madly into the marshes it was abandoned lets close thatun mister spendlove lewrie ordered i want tsee if that fellows the whitehaired bastard behind all of this that treadwell aye sir the current had lifted the boat from the mud and silt and the loose grip of the first of the marsh grass reeds like moses baby cradle set afloat on the nile it rocked gently as the gunboat came alongside it the gunboat sidled up to the rowing boat and sailors took hold of its gunnl til a couple of short lines could be lashed between some tholepins and lewrie could step over from his boat to the other and kneel on a thwart to look down at the man sprawled in the inch or so of water in the boats sole he was a welldressed gentleman in a satiny waistcoat a ruffled shirt and white neckstock in buff trousers and topboots but he was groaning and gasping in pain those trousers darkstained almost from his waist to midthigh with blood with a visible bullethole seeping almost in a flood do you think that is he sir lt spendlove asked treadwell edward treadwell of the tybee roads trading company lewrie asked in a loud voice as if trying to rouse the dead yeyes the fellow weakly admitted hehelp me for for the he had to stop to stifle a loud cry i fear sir that with a wound like that theres nothing to be done lewrie told him with a shake of his head not even trying to be sympathetic it had been a fine shot after all youre slain and bound tmeet your maker before the hours out all your friends and partners are run off without a care for you too weve stopped your business with the privateers youre through now think of this as a deathbed confession sir lewrie continued leaning closer looming over treadwell filling his sight and softening his tone dont face eternity with a lie what did you do with the people off the prizes when they were brought in susurgeon treadwell gasped instead writhing about and trying to both claw at and staunch his wound no help there i told you lewrie snapped what did you do with the prisoners aah treadwell cried whimpering tears rolled from his eyes of pain or fear of death or for the ruin of everything hed built there was no telling the prisoners lewrie roared sasafe saint augaugustine treadwell whimpered so faintly that lewrie had to bend to hear him spanish have good lewrie said leaning back thank you for that well ill leave you to it lewrie cheerfully added give my regards to the devil lewrie stood up to return to his boat but took a moment for looting instead would you care for a pennsylvania rifle mister spendlove he said lifting treadwells piece its powder horn priming flasks and leather pouch its a rather fine one custommade id expect ehm thank you sir spendlove hesitantly said stunned by his captains revelation of a very ruthless nature we will simply leave him sir he asked once lewrie was back aboard like the vikings saw off their kings lewrie told him with a grin set his boat adrift to get snagged in the marshes or waft out to sea it was his river let it have him lets go see if bury and lovett are done with the privateer she shouldve struck by now aye aye sir spendlove replied much subdued lewrie sat down on the after thwart once more and dug into his cartridge pouch for a wornout toothbrush an oily rag and a length of twine with a small weight on one end and a brass slot for a cleaning patch on the other opened the breech of his ferguson riflemusket and began to clean the bore the pan and touchhole he looked up distracted by the cries of marsh birds the sun was fully up at last and the sounds of combat had silenced allowing the myriad flocks of gulls terns sandpipers herons ibises egrets and skimmers to soar up from hiding the clearing sky was teeming with them in their swirling thousands beyond round the bend of the river firefly lizard and the privateer were close together the smoke from the last broadsides still risen above them as if from eyelevel from his boat a naval battle was occurring on a vast green lawn with the last of the river mist hazing the vast and verdant marsh grasses damme if this aint the best day ive had in months he happily thought and a righthandsome one tboot epilogue expulsis piratisresituta commercia he expelled the pirates and restored commerce m otto of c aptain w oodes r ogers former g overnor of the b ahamas chapter fortyfour ive the fair copies of your reports ready sir if you would care to glance them over lewries clerk faulkes said aye thankee faulkes lewrie agreed seated on the settee to starboard of his greatcabins reliant and her small squadron were quietly anchored in west bay below fort charlotte in nassau harbour at long last and he could lounge at ease in his shirtsleeves and a comfortable old pair of white canvas trousers with a tall glass of cool tea sweetened and lemoned the way he liked it the most important of his correspondence was to admiralty far off in london which described all his actions over the last few weeks the capture of three french privateers the insolent otarie and the furieux the amphibious landings his squadron had made and the raid up the st marys river included was his evidence against the late unlamented edward treadwell and his tybee roads trading company and details of the nefarious plan to aid enemy privateers for profit in violation of american neutrality a second set of evidence had to be sent to the british ambassador at washington city with a briefer report that covered his raid and its results which proved the existence of treadwells plot and justified his kind of sort of skirting of american neutrality in the narrows of the river so the ambassador could present the matter to the american government that would be titfortat and so there for american complaints that british forces still garrisoned the upper reaches of the michigan territory ages after the peace treaty that had ended the revolution in despite his distaste for the necessity lewrie would have to send a copy of the evidence the ledgers account books and all to their consul at savannah that toplofty idler mr hereford with a cover letter that most carefully disguised lewries loathing of the man and referred to him as a colleague hopefully hereford would stir up his lazy arse and present the matter to the city officials in savannah perhaps to their state government too who might lodge accusations and prosecutions against the tybee roads company and all of its subsidiaries did they seize the properties and assets there was a good chance that their seizure and sale or fines would make someone in state government a tad richer when it was dissolved thud went his marine sentrys musketbutt on the deck beyond the door to his cabins midshipman munsell sah enter lewrie idly said without looking up from his reading my duty sir and i am to tell you that a navy brigsloop is entering harbour sir munsell reported hat under his arm shes made her number the ah delight sir i believe she is listed as being assigned to the bahamas squadron one of captain forresters lewrie asked with his head over to one side in curiosity i thought he took both of his brigsloops south hmm how far off is she mister munsell shes hullup at the moment sir munsell informed him an hour or more from anchoring or firing a salute thatll give me time enough tread all this over before whoever it is comes callin then lewrie decided yawning thankee mister munsell come report to me when i should have tbe up and dressed aye sir lewrie quirked his mouth in faint frustration once munsell had departed he had planned to finish reading the reports and see them along with his personal letters to the packets bound for savannah the chesapeake and england then put his head down for a long lazy nap but delight s arrival put paid to that idleness damn he thought i wonder if her captain is important enough for me to put on my bloody star and sash thankfully it was a whole two hours before delight came into port fired her salute a cautious one of twelve guns befitting a postcaptain of a fifth rate frigate and came to anchor she made a hoist of have despatches then another of permission to board which reliant answered with captain to repair aboard and a boat made its way to the frigates starboard entryport lewrie awaited the newcomer on deck in the warm earlyaugust sun shoved into his everyday uniform with the lesser concession of the star of the order of the bath pinned to his coat breast bosun sprague and his mate wheeler did the ship proud with their welcoming calls the fullyuniformed marines and sailors of the sideparty saluted smartly and the onwatch hands doffed hats as the officer a commander with a lone gilt and fringed epaulet perched on his left shoulder doffed his hat in reply midshipman rossyngton saw him from the entryport to the quarterdeck where lewrie stood whispering to the new arrival captain sir rossyngton glibly said making the introduction allow me to name to you commander isaac gilpin of the delight sloop commander gilpin allow me to name to you captain sir alan lewrie baronet of the reliant frigate your servant sir alan gilpin said with a slight bow as he doffed his hat once more good tmake your acquaintance commander gilpin lewrie said in turn at long last that is since your ship was out on patrol whenever i came in to nassau and our paths never crossed til now it is my honour to make yours sir alan gilpin declared join me in my cabins sir lewrie invited for a glass of something cool sounds grand sir gilpin agreed rhenish commander gilpin or cool tea lewrie offered once they were seated on the starboard side mind the cats theyre just curious he cautioned as toulon and chalky came slinking tea sir if you please gilpin decided wary of the cats who found any new visitor worthy of sniffs and inspection gilpin had on his bestdress uniform and the blue coat so far was pristine you were down south with captain forrester i take it just before he departed he sent me a letter about it lewrie said he wished me tjoin him but i had other orders theyre finished now at last did you manage tcatch up with villeneuve and his fleet we never did sorry to say sir gilpin told him as he was presented with lemon juice and turbinado sugar to stir into his tea we got as far as antigua and english harbour put in to speak with the officer commanding and found that the first arrival that french admiral missiessy had already hared back to france and there was no clear information as to villeneuves whereabouts so that was as far as we went then it was best that i kept reliant here or off saint augustine and spanish florida lewrie said commander gilpin was a pleasantlooking fellow in his middle thirties trim and fit and welluniformed with a blunt and honest face he took a sip of tea smiled in pleasant appreciation and gave out a sigh quite refreshing sir thank you sir alan i lewrie waved the formality off ehm i noted quite a few prizes in port sir gilpin said are they your doing three french privateers and a ship and two brigs awaiting return to their owners lewrie happily told him laying a brief sketch of their recent doings and you command a squadron of your own sir gilpin further enquired i note that you fly a whiteballed broad pendant a wee one lewrie replied i brought a sloop with me from bermuda and borrowed lieutenants lovett and darling from your captain forrester when i arrived damned fine men full of daring i shall be sorry to lose them gilpin cocked a brow at that weve fulfilled my orders lewrie explained the criminal enterprise is broken up the french and spanish are on warning that the georgia coast cant be used for privateering any longer so ive nothing left to fulfill but for the minor task of making new charts of the reefs of bermuda so lizard and i and her captain lieutenant bury will soon depart before hurricane season hopefully and the climes at bermuda arent as sickly as the west indies or the bahamas in point of fact my first lieutenant and lieutenant bury wish to do a survey of north ireland island and grassy bay with an eye towards its possible use as a naval dockyard ever been up to bermuda commander the one harbour saint georges is close to the sea but its bad holdingground in a blow and a tight fit did one of our fleets put in there whereas grassy bay and the great sound are hard to get to for us and any foe but huge and deep with what looks tbe a completely impassible set of reefs all round only a rowboat could get through assumin they didnt get lost in the deadend channels and the maze of coral heads soon as forrester brings mersey back to nassau im off captain forrester will not be coming back sir gilpin said with a quirky look of surpise or was it wellhidden glee oh lewrie rejoined hoping for the worst why is that well sir once we put into english harbour he went ashore to confer with the admiral commanding and while i do not know what was said he returned in some discomforture gilpin related chalky lewrie snapped leave his boot tassels alone go on sir pray do here puss pester me instead soon after captain forrester summoned us aboard the flagship and told us wed be returning to nassau that our services had been deemed unnecessary and we weighed the next morning gilpin went on even though there wasnt a breath of wind and we had to put down our boats to tow us from one warping post to the next out to the channel well i remember leavin english harbour lewrie said with a rueful grin chalky had come to lewries lap to sniff at the star on his chest whilst toulon was still on the settee by gilpin seated with his tail curled over his paws and staring in curiosity toulon there is safe tpet dye care for it ehm thank you sir gilpin said though making no move to do so lewrie gestured him to go on with his story he meant but his guest took it for an order to pet toulon so he gave him a tentative pat on the head you were sayin lewrie pleasantly urged sure that that fubsy toad forrester had come some sort of cropper aye sir gilpin began again the other brigsloop led out and found a faint breeze with a harbour pilot aboard and i followed in her wake when mersey got past the last warping post and took her boats back aboard though the tide began to carry her astern and a fluke of wind laid her aback before they could cast an anchor free she was driven on the coral and rocks despite the best efforts of the other harbour pilot and her officers come a real cropper has he lewrie thought feeling like he could laugh out loud like a lunatick how bloody wonderful how awful for him he said though pretending sorrow quite well if he did say so himself badly damaged was she they finally got her off and fothered the holes in the hull well enough to tow her back into harbour sir gilpin continued his tale but it took half the crew on the pumps and the other half at getting her lightened they took her down to a gantline and landed all her guns and carriages ashore along with all her stores before getting her into the docks whether she is repaired and taken on as a receiving or store ship or condemned and burned for her fittings had not been decided when fulmar and delight were ordered to return to nassau sir they were however assembling the sufficient number of postcaptains for a courtmartial for her loss and the charge of captain forrester abandoning his area of responsibility sir yes there is a god and hes just tboot lewrie gleefully told himself theyll yellow squadron the fool at long last well hmm was lewries comment hah damn my eyes the admiral at antigua sent you a letter sir gilpin went on reaching into a sidepocket of his coat sorry for being remiss evidently captain forrester must have made mention that you and your frigate were on station or somewhere nearby under admiralty orders and a complaint that i refused tjoin him lewrie freely admitted recalling the wording of forresters last attempt to order him under his flag so both i and commander richie of fulmar were ordered to seek you out at once and relay the admirals request gilpin said as he handed the letter over for so long as the strength and the whereabouts of the french fleet under villeneuve is discovered and their objective is determined his verbal orders to me were to tell you that he cannot spare any ships of his squadron to take mersey s place but as soon as he may safely do so he will send a ship or several to defend the bahamas until then though sir you are in command of the largest ship onstation which makes you the temporary senior naval officer commanding the bahamas mine arse on a bandbox lewrie gawped a reaction that commander gilpin did not expect from a postcaptain especially one of lewries repute in the navy wasnt he the aggressive ramcat the bane of the french well hmm lewrie said after a long moment i suppose that bermudas out for a good while im glad that ill have you with me commander gilpin and commander richie is it of fulmar i dont know what else well have beyond the two ships of the squadron that i borrowed when i arrived if villeneuve comes this way theres not much we can do to face him but we can give it a good try i spose thisll make bury darling and lovett happy lewrie whimsically thought they had all dined ashore together a few nights before and his junior captains had all expressed glum regrets that he would be turning them over to forresters control or for lt bury to sail back to the boring patrols round bermuda at least still in his squadron they could look forward to exciting doings they had assured him wheres fulmar lewrie asked richie thought to seek you off spanish florida sir gilpin said we need tkeep a partial blockade of saint augustine once youve revictualled ill send a sloop to find him and let him do that for a while lewrie decided establish a patrol line down near the turks and caicos on the lookout for the french too i quite look forward to serving under you sir gilpin said with an eager grin once gilpin had returned to his own ship lewrie laid aside his finery and changed back to comfortable clothes once more ready for a midday meal yeovill and cooke had run across a free black woman in the bay street markets who had been brought as a cook to the islands by a refugee tory family at the end of the american revolution she had been freed years later and swore that she possessed the best receipt for both pecan pie and peach pie ones that had been her mothers back in colonial georgia and this time perhaps they would bake one as good as those hed tasted in charleston and savannah lewrie propped his feet up on the brass traytable with a fresh glass of tea handy and mused over his new duties and over what a welldeserved disaster had befallen francis forrester if he knew the current locations of those few former midshipmen of old desperate s cockpit with whom he had served he would have written them that very instant sure that all would gloat and shout hosannahs at the news he could caulk for half an hour or so though the windows in the transom were open and the smaller ones in the coachtop overhead were open too it was a warmish day with little breeze reaching him play a little hornpipe of commiseration he thought fingering the holes of his pennywhistle and putting it to his mouth he got started on one but there came a howl and singing wail from above deck there he bellowed to the midshipmen who stood harbour watch in lieu of the commission officers is bisquit on the quarterdeck ehm aye sir rossyngton called down kneeling down by the coachtop to show his face in one of the windows the dogs head appeared in another sorry sir ill shoo him off directly oh never mind lewrie said with a sigh laying his musical instrument aside just make sure he doesnt shit on the deck really sir rossyngton yelped in surprise i mean aye aye sir well keep an eye on him come on boy for a moment bisquit gazed down at lewrie matching eyes with him panting and grinning with what looked like glee and his triumph of the forbidden territory at last then he answered to midshipman rossyngtons summoning whistles and scampered off its official and unanimous lewrie thought with a shake of his head theres nobody who cares for my music afterword before privateering was banned by international treaty in and merchant ships no longer had to be defensively armed every fresh war between seafaring nations brought hundreds of aspiring rovers from the woodwork with hopes of great profits and adventure near at hand are the examples of the american revolution and the war of which saw british trade attacked from the grand banks to the west indies to the irish sea and the english channel by an auxiliary fleet larger by far than the nascent continental navy or the us navy privateering companies were formed overnight investors bought in in anticipation of rich quick returns and the fastest and handiest ships were purchased or offered by their owners as their investment share bold and canny seacaptains with good reputations were hired or promoted themselves men who could attract sailors on the strength of their reputations and the soundness of their vessels and younger fitter bolder sailors eagerly responded mariners lives from the times of sir francis drake and those bowld english sea rovers of elizabethan years to the end of the great age of sail were dismal and consisted of low pay foul rations backbreaking physical labour tyrannical and miserly officers and a good chance of being cheated at the end of each voyage whenever war broke out common sailors faced the added risk of being pressed into a warship where navy pay was even lower and discipline and good order were enforced with physical punishment and shore liberty was quite out of the question for years on end to prevent desertion it was no wonder then that sailors would rather sign articles aboard a privateer and go aroving in search of riches loot from any captured ship and a lay or share in a voyages profits in port they could leave the ship for a good drunk or two some fresh air away from the typical ships reek find elbow room and some precious privacy away from their shipmates and have a run at the whores to be a privateersman put a swagger in their step and made seafaring a grand adventure not a thankless chore when captains of any nation at war held recruiting rondies they found themselves outshone by the blandishments of privateers in those days there were no organised recruiting establishments no basic training camps and no admiralty department responsible for assigning draughts of men to ships fitting out or replacing men who had been killed crippled discharged or lost to desertion a royal navy captain had only a limited time to attract trained experienced hands wideeyed young volunteers who would be deemed landsmen and scour the dregs offered by the impress service to complete his ships complement if he couldnt he lost his precious active commission and another officer took his ship and his place some warships had to sail with just enough people aboard to work the ship to sea perhaps hundreds of men short to save the captains fullpay job god forbid that a warship and a privateer were fitting out in the same port at the same time for it would be the privateer that would always win privateers operated in every corner of the world where ships of an enemy nation traded and no seas were immune some french privateer captains mostly from stmalo were spectacularly successful in the indian ocean against convoys of the british east india company which bore rich cargoes to and from china india and the far east some even dared to engage warships and win though that was usually the last thing a privateer would risk if the privateer lost it was all up and even if they escaped with damage that had to be repaired in port resulting in long downtimes with no profit and a loss of money to pay for the repairs a fastsailing privateers speed was her best defence as falconer noted in his dictionary privateers sortakinda agreed to follow navy rules when applying for their letters of marque and reprisals but once at sea it was katy bar the door or as it was said in pirates of the caribbean the pirates code was not like real rules but more like guidelines and so was a privateers behaviour indeed some of the really successful privateers were expirates temporarily made legitimate conversely once a war was over the most successful privateers turned pirate they swung both ways bermuda and its mysterious magnetic variationsthere is no good explanation for them that ive heard of i dont know if there really is a bermuda triangle but the latest admiralty charts i used when writing this book note the swings of several degrees from magnetic north that are not seasonal have nothing to do with sunspots and arent caused by phases of the moon they caution all mariners to be excrutiatingly cautious when navigating bermudan waters basil hall a midshipman aboard hms leander working out of bermuda during the peace of amiens related several accounts of his time there in every man will do his duty an anthology of firsthand accounts from the age of nelson edited by dean king et al owl books henry holt and co which i found useful hall had little good to say of bermudan pilots citing a captain who found himself trapped in a maze of reefs and coral heads when putting out to sea for a huge sum a pilot offered to conn him free which the captain paid the pilot led him and his ship into an even worse spot then demanded a second large payment the captain paid again but once safely free and in deep water the captain got his own back by threatening to take the pilot to charleston and sell him for a slave if he didnt get all his money back from basil hall we also get bisquit the dog leander s captain and officers had purebred hounds aboard for hunting ashore and the midshipmans mess found themselves a dog for their own hunts an incredibly ugly mutt they named shakings a term for scrap rope ends and ravellings shakings was too friendly too playful especially with the officers pack and was put ashore several times but he always mysteriously turned up aboard again after a few days shakings sealed his own fate by putting his shoremudded paws on the first officers snowwhite breeches the next day he was gone forever drowned by the ships cook at the officers behest dumped overboard tied up in a breadbag with a pounder shot that will most definitely not be bisquits fate that xebec that lewries squadron captured in his absence in american portsin a sailor of king george the journals of captain frederick hoffman rn us naval institute press hoffman related his early days as a mid and lieutenant in the west indies chasing french and spanish privateers in the florida straits and on the northern coast of cuba with its myriad of pocket harbours he saw many lateenrigged xebecs in the coasting trade and some fitted out as very fast weatherly and manoeuvrable privateers for short raiding cruises the spanish had known of their good qualities since the days of the reconquista and the depredations of barbary corsairs and brought the type from the mediterranean early on in the colonial days see i didnt make it up spanish florida and lower georgia were very sparsely settled in the early s and there were no settlements at what is now miami or in the keys the border country had been a battlefield between the spanish english and french since the s and if whites werent at each others throats it was the indians who raided and the british colonists who made war on them in return governour oglethorpe lured emigrants to lower georgia to form a barrier against those raids to protect his crown jewel savannah brunswick sunbury midway and darien are real places and there are many historical sites from the colonial era and the revolutionary war era to visit including some restored forts and of course there are the sea islands cumberland island is prettymuch offlimits for all but daytrippers unless youre one of the kennedys st simons is more touristy and jekyll which ive visited several times is much more laid back good luck though if you go in late summer its love bug season after driving from i to jekyll island i had to use half a bottle of windshield cleaner and a dobie scrub pad to see where i was going lewries assault up the st marys river is based on an actual event in july of hms cambrian captured a french privateer the matilda off spanish florida and put a british crew aboard led by lt george pigot not guns the second of that name on the navy list with orders to enter the st marys in search of a rumoured spanish privateer pigot went much further than lewrie did a whole twelve miles and way beyond the edge of my coastal chart under fire by sharpshooters on both banks captured the privateer and brought her out when i found that incident in clowess the royal navy a history from the earliest times to volume five near places where i had previously visited my course was set i knew where alan lewrie would go and knew what he would be doing in the momentous year of the year of trafalgar news travelled no faster than ships in those days so rumours of missiessy and villeneuve bringing fleets to the west indies with admiral horatio nelson in pursuit came to lewrie weeks and months after the actual events he still has no idea whether the french will attack the bahamas or not if nelson brings them to battle he also does not know whether to fear for his youngest son hugh now a midshipman in hms aeneas or not if battle is joined all lewrie can do is to enjoy being temporarily in command of all the smaller warships in the bahamas keep his fingers crossed in hopes that the french have bigger fish to fry and hope that it all blows over so he can return to bermuda to fulfill the last part of his orders to survey and chart the reefs and anchorages he lt bury and lt westcott might even have time to sketch out the groundwork for that naval dockyard and fort on north ireland island on grassy bay and the great sound which was finally begun in whilst engaged in that endeavour might lewrie take up fishwatching with lt bury with a bucket on his head or will dame fortune decide to serve lewrie a barricoe of bad turns he cant be too sure that the threat of privateers along the coasts of georgia and spanish florida is well and truly ended or that mr treadwells death and the ruin of his company will convince other americans who would connive with his kings enemies in violation of us neutrality to think twice before filling that void since i have a say in such things after all rest assured that fresh orders will come summoning lewrie to new seas and new misadventures there is one snag though so long as bisquit is the ships dog will lewrie ever get to play his pennywhistle again i will give you one wee hint lewrie will find himself and his frigate south of the equator the next time round dragged into a bit of glory followed by a monumental cockup til then i wish yall fair winds and calm seas about the author dewey lambdin is the author of seventeen previous alan lewrie novels a member of the us naval institute and a friend of the national maritime museum in greenwich england he spends his free time working and sailing he makes his home in nashville tennessee but would much prefer margaritaville or murrells inlet this is a work of fiction all of the characters organizations and events portrayed in this novel are either products of the authors imagination or are used fictitiously
