michael palmer side effects prologue mecklenburg germany august wirli becker leaned against the coarse wood siding of the officers club and squinted up at the late afternoon sun a pale disk rendered nearly impotent by the dust from a hundred allied bombings of industrial targets surrounding the ravensbriick concentration camp for women he closed his eyes and for an instant thought he heard the drone of enemy planes somewhere to the south not a moment too soon dr becker he muttered you will be leaving this hellhole not a moment too soon he checked the chronometer his brother edwin had sent him from a grateful patient in the dachau camp nearly fifteenthirty after months of the most meticulous preparations there were now only hours to go he felt an electric excitement across the dirt courtyard clusters of prisoners their shaved heads glistening worked on bomb shelters while their ss guards jockeyed for bits of shade beneath the overhangs of barracks becker recognized two of the women a tall awkward teenager named eva and a feckless russian who had encouraged him to call her bunny they were but two of the three dozen or so subjects whose examinations he was forced to omit in the interest of escape for a minute becker battled the urge to call the two scarecrow women over and tell them that fate had denied them their parts in the magnificent work that scholars and generations to come would hail as the start of the beckerian population control beckerian the word though he spoke it daily still had a thrilling ring newtonian physics shakespearean drama malthusian philosophy upon so very few had human history bestowed such honor in time becker was certain this immortality would be his after all he was still six weeks shy of his thirtieth birthday yet already acknowledged for his brilliance in the field of reproductive physiology adjusting the collar on the graygreen ss uniform he was wearing for the last time the tall classically nordic physician crossed the courtyard and headed toward the research buildings on the north edge of camp the ravensbriick medical staff once numbering more than fifty had dwindled to a dozen himmier bending to the cry for physicians in military hospitals had suspended the experiments in gas gangrene and bone grafting as well as those on battlefield cauterization of wounds using coals and acid the doctors responsible for those programs had been transferred only the sterilization units remained three of them in all each devoted to the problem of eliminating the ability to procreate without impairing the ability to perform slave labor becker strode past the empty laboratoriesanother sign of the inevitableand turned onto griinestrasse the tarmac track on which the officials and research facilities of his green unit were located to the east he could see the camouflagepainted chimney tops of the crematorium a gentle west wind was bearing the fetid smoke and ash away from the camp becker smiled thinly and nodded the mecklenburger bucht fifty kilometers of capricious baltic sea between rostock and the danish island fishing village of gedser would be calm one less variable to be concerned about becker was mentally working through the other incalculables when he glanced through the windows of his office dr franz miiller his back turned was inspecting the volumes in beckers library becker tensed a visit from mwier the head of the blue unit and director of reproductive studies was not unusual but the man was considerate to a fault and almost always called ahead was miillers visit on this of all days a coincidence becker paused by the doorway to his office and prepared for the cerebral swordplay at which the older man was such a master he congratulated himself for holding back the documentation however scant of blue units deception miillers blade might be as quick as his own but his own had poison on its tip miiller he felt certain was a sham the blue unit work concerning the effect of ovarian irradiation on fertility looked promising on paper however becker had good reason to believe that not one prisoner had actually been treated with radiation the data were being falsified by miiller and his cohort josef rendl whether they had gone so far as to assist prisoners in escaping becker was unsure but he suspected as much his proof though skimpy would have been enough to discredit if not destroy both men however their destruction had never meant as much to him as their control in an effort to gain some tiny advantage becker opened the outside door silently and tiptoed up the three stairs to his office door not a sound not even the creak of a floorboard becker opened the door quickly miiller was perched on the corner of his desk looking directly at him ah willi my friend please excuse the brazenness of my intrusion i was just passing by and remembered your mentioning that fruhopfs reproductive physiolog was among your holdings first exchange to the master it is good to see you franz my library and laboratory are always yours as i have told you many times a perfunctory handshake and becker moved to his seat behind the desk did you find it pardon the fruhopf did you find it oh yes yes i have it right here fine keep it as long as you wish thank you miiller made no move to leave instead he lowered himself into the chair opposite becker and began packing his pipe from a worn leather pouch not even the formality of a request to stay beckers wariness grew hidden by the desk his long manicured fingers undulated nervously sweet he asked sliding a dish of mints across the desktop it was miillers show and miiller could make the initial move thank you no miiller grinned and patted his belly you heard about paris becker nodded no surprise except perhaps for the speed with which patton did the job i agree the man is a devil miiller ran his fingers through his thick muddy blond hair he was beckers equal in height perhaps an inch or so more but he was built like a kodiak bear and in the east the russians come and come we wipe out a division and two more take its place i hear they are nearing the oil field at ploesti they are a barbarous people for decades all they have done is rut about and multiply what our armies cannot do to them their own expanding population will eventually accomplish ah yes miiller said the theories of your sainted thomas malthus keep our panzers in abeyance and let our enemies procreate themselves into submission becker felt his hackles rise cynicism was the finest honed of miillers strokes an irritated angry opponent left openings made mistakes calm down he urged himself calm down and wait until the man declares himself could he know about the escape the mere thought made the green unit leader queasy now franz he said evenly you know how much i enjoy discussing philosophy with you especially malthusian philosophy but right now we have a war to win yes miillers eyes narrowed quatsch he said what i said quatsch willi absolute nonsense first of all we are not ia k going to win any war you know that as well as i do secondly i do not believe you care one way or the other becker stiffened the bastard had found out somehow he had found out he shifted his right hand slightly on his knee and gauged the distance to the walther revolver in his top left drawer how can you impugn me in this way miiller smiled and sank back in his chair you misunderstand me willi what i am saying is a compliment to you as a scientist and philosopher surtout le travaille above all the work is that not how you feel on second thought i will have that sweet if you please becker slid the dish across here he was bewildered apprehensive and totally off balance and still with no idea of the reason for milliers visit inwardly and grudgingly he smiled the man was slick a total bastard but a slick one i believe in my research if that is what you mean precisely and your research franz how does it go time for a counterthrust it goes and it stops and it goes again you know how that is sure sure but mostly it doesnt exist becker wanted to say instead he nodded his agreement willi my friend i fear the war will be over anytime now weeks days hours no one seems to know i have no notion of what will happen to usto those in our laboratoryafter that perhaps our research will be made public perhaps not i feel it is crucial for each unit blue green and brown to know exactly the nature and status of the work being done by the others that way we can be as well prepared as possible for whatever the future brings beckers eyes widened i have decided to start with your green unit miiller went on a meeting has been scheduled for twentyone hundred hours this evening in the blue unit conference room please be prepared to present your research in detail at that time what and willi i would like time to study your data before then please have them on my desk by nineteen hundred hours miillers eyes were flint becker felt numb his data including the synthesis and biological properties of estronate were sealed in a dozen notebooks hidden in the hull of a certain rostock fishing boat his mind raced my my work is very fragmented franz i i shall need at least a day perhaps two to organize my data this cant be happening he thought nineteen hundred hours is too early even twentyone hundred hours is too soon let me show you what i have becker said reaching toward the drawer with the walther at that instant dr josef rendi stepped inside the office doorway rendis aide a behemoth whom becker knew only as stossel remained just outside in the hall they had been somewhere out there all the time becker felt sure of it rendl a former pediatrician was a short doughy man with a pasty complexion and a highpitched laugh both of which becker found disgusting beckers information had it that rendls mother was a jew a fact that had been carefully concealed for a frozen second two becker sized up the situation miiller was but two meters away rendl three and the animal stossel perhaps five no real chance for three kills even with surprise on his side which it seemed now might not be the case the battle would have to be verbal at least for the moment becker nodded at the newcomer welcome josef my my the entire blue unit brain trust what a pleasant honor willi rendl smiled and returned the gesture leutnant stossel and i were just passing by and noticed the two of you in here what do you think of the meetings a good idea to present our work to one another no you smarmy son of a jenv whore becker thought yes yes an excellent idea he said and you will honor us by presenting the green unit biochemical studies tonight rendi though an oberst exactly the same rank as willi often spoke with miillers authority dusting his words becker fighting to maintain composure sucked in an extra measure of air tonight would be acceptable both of the other men nodded but he added tomorrow evening would be much better because he smiled to himself i intend to be a thousand kilometers away from here by then oh franz miiller propped his chin on one hand yes i have a few final chemical tests to run on estronate twofifty some loose ends in the initial set of experiments as becker scrambled through the words searching for some kind of purchase an idea began to take hold theres an extraction with ether that i was unable to complete because my supply ran out late yesterday several five gallon tins arrived you signed for them yourself miiller nodded beckers words became more confident well if you would give me tonight to complete this phase of my work i shall gladly present what i have tomorrow you must remember that what i have is not much estronate twofifty is far more theory than fact a promising set of notions with only the roughest of preliminary work on humans miiller pushed himself straighter in his chair and leveled his gaze across the desk actually willi i do not believe that what you say is true the words a sledgehammer were delivered with silky calm wh what are you talking about the question in beckers mind was no longer whether miiller knew anything but how much his trump cardblue units falsified datawould have to be played the only issue now was timing what i am talking about is information that your work on estronate twofifty is rather advanced thats nonsense becker shot back further that you are lacking only stability studies and the elimination of a troublesome side effectsome sort of bleeding tendency is it before more extensive clinical testing can be done why willi are you keeping this information from us you have here perhaps the most awesome discoveryeven the most awesome weaponof our time yet you claim to know nothing ridiculous no willi not ridiculous information straight from a source in your laboratory now either we receive a full disclosure of the exact status of your work or i shall see to it that mengele or even himmier receives the information we have your accusations are preposterous we shall judge that after you have presented your work tonight then no not tonight it was time my work is not ready for presentation becker paused theatrically drumming his fingertips on the desktop and then stroking them bowlike across one another is yours what becker sensed more than saw miiller stiffen your work the blue unit radiation studies you see the two of you are not the only ones withwhat was the word you used ah yes sources that was it sources rendl and miiller exchanged the fraction of a glance the gesture was enough to dispel any doubt as to the validity of beckers information willi willi miiller said shaking his head you try my patience i shall give you until tomorrow night meanwhile we shall organize our data and present them at the same time excellent becker said reveling in being on the offensive at last and please do try to have some of your human subjects available for examination it would lend so much to the understanding of your work this time miiller and rendl shared a more pronounced look you dont really care willi do you miiller said suddenly i im afraid i dont know what you mean franz you see only yourself your place in history the here and now mean nothing to you germany the reich the jews the americans the prisoners your colleaguesall are the same to you all are nothing you have your mistresses and i have mine becker said simply is immortality so homely that i should throw her out of my bed you are right franz i do not concern myself with petty daytoday issues i have already reached planes of theory and research that few have ever even dreamed of should i worry about the price of eggs or whether the fiihrers hemorrhoids are inflamed or whether the prisoners here at ravensbriick are pathetic inside the wire or without on top of the dirt or beneath it willi willi willi miillers voice and eyes held pity rather than reproach becker looked over at rendl and there too saw condescension not ire dont you dare pity me he wanted to scream revere me the children of your children will prosper because of me the lebensraum for which so many have fought and died will be attained not with bullets but with my equations my solution mine miiller broke the silence we are all with the same laboratory we all stand to lose much if we fall into disfavoreither now with the reich or soon with the allies i expect a full disclosure of your work with estronate twofifty dr becker becker nodded his acquiescence and silently prayed that his portrayal of a beaten man would be convincing minutes later the three men from the blue unit were gone becker closed his eyes and massaged the tightness at the base of his neck then he poured three fingers of polish vodka from a bottle edwin had sent him and drank it in a single draught the encounter with miiller and rendl triumphant though it had been had left him drained he fingered his chronometer was there time for a nap no he decided no sleeping until this filthy camp with its petty people and skeleton prisoners was a thing of the past he walked briskly from his office to the low frame barracklike building that housed the green units biochemical research section with glances to either side he backed through the rear door and locked it from the inside the wooden shutters were closed and latched creating a darkness inside that was tangible the flashlight was by the doorwhere he had hung it that morning using the hooded beam becker counted the slate squares making up the top of his long central workbench reaching beneath the fifth one he pulled the cabinet supporting the slate slid out from the others beneath it hidden from even a detailed search was the circular mouth of a tunnel and the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air alfi runstedt sang the words as he dug although he had no idea of their meaning the song he knew was the american anthem and this day at least that was all that mattered as a child in leipzig he had spent hours beside his familys new victrola memorizing selections from a thick album of anthems of the world even then the american star spangled banner had been his favorite now he would have the chance to see the country itself and even more wonderful to become an american oh say does that star spangled baanerer yeet waave with one syllable he rammed the spade into the sandy soil with the next he threw the dirt up to the side of the grave the trench three feet deep was better than half done lying on the grass to alfis left two meters from him were the corpses of the peasant woman and her son which would be laid inside as soon as the proper depth was reached alfi runstedt paid them no mind he was stripped to his ample waist dirt mingling with sweat was turning his arms and walrus torso into a quagmire the thick red hair on his chest was plastered into what looked like a fecal mat his ss uniform pants were soaked and filthy and the home of the brave oh say can you see alfi take a break if you need one we cannot make any moves until dark i told you that from his perch atop a large boulder willi becker gazed down into the narrow crypt alfi stopped his digging and dragged a muddy wrist across his muddy forehead it is nothing herr oberst believe me nothing i would dig a thousand such holes in the ground for the honor you have done me and the reward you have promised tell me do you know if many american women are thin like betty grable one of the men in the barracks at friedrichshafen had her picture by his cot i dont know alfi becker laughed soon you shall be able to see for yourself if we meet the boat in denmark and if my cousin has made all the arrangements we should be in north america with valid papers within a few weeks big ifs yes not so big the biggest if anyplace is money and hopefully we have enough of that well need some luck but our chances of making it out undetected seem rather good and you do not think me a traitor or a coward for wanting to leave with you am i you are different herr oberst you have research to complete important research i am just a junior officer in an army that is losing a war ah but you are also my aide my invaluable aide was it not you who informed me of the old system of drainage pipes running beneath ravensbriick well it was just my fortune to have worked with the sanitation department when i was younger and and was it not you who chose to keep that information our little secret and to help me with the connecting tunnel well i guess so dont say you are not deserving unteroffizier runstedt dont ever say that thank you oberst thank you and at that moment alfred runstedt the man who had overseen or assisted in the extermination of several thousand ravensbriick prisoners the man who had not an hour before calmly strangled to death a woman her young son her husband and her father wept with joy hollywood new york baseball chicagonow just words they would soon be his life since the june invasion at normandy and even more frequently since the abortive july attempt to assassinate the filhrer at rastenburg in eastern prussia he had been forced to endure the recurrent nightmare of his own capture and death in one version of the dream it was execution by hanging in another by firing squad in still another ghostly prisoners totally naked beat him to death with sticks soon the nightmares would stop the grave was nearly deep enough the wooded grove which was serving as an impromptu cemetery accepted the evening more quickly than did the adjacent field and was nearly dark when becker pushed himself off the rock so just a few more spadefuls is it he said i think so alfi answered he had donned a windbreaker against the chill of dusk his uniform shirt hanging on a branch would be kept clean for a final display cigar thank you herr oberst alfi paused to light the narrow cheroot one of a seemingly endless supply possessed by becker i think you are deep enough now becker said after a half dozen more passes let me give you a hand alfi scrambled from the grave one with the arms and one with the legs the two men unceremoniously tossed the bodies of the woman and the boy into the pit alfi replaced the dirt with the spade becker helped using his foot forgive me if i am out of line herr oberst alfi said as he shoveled but is there any possibility of notifying my sister at the munitions plant in schwartzheide that contrary to the reports she will receive i am alive and well becker chuckled and shook his head alfi alfi i have explained to you the need for secrecy why do you think i waited until only a few hours ago to tell you of my escape plan i myself have been measuring every word for weeks afraid i might give it away for now and for the foreseeable future both of us must remain among the lamentable casualties of the war even my brother edwin at the camp in dachau will not know i understand alfi said realizing that he did notat least not totally by the morning you and i shall be both free and dead becker stamped on the topsoil of the grave and began throwing handfuls of dusty sand and pine needles over the fresh dirt the idea of using the bodies of the farmer and his soninlaw was sheer genius becker acknowledged originally he had planned to have the two farmers supply him with transportation to rostock their lorry would now run just as well with him at the wheel the other refinements in his original plan were dazzling when all was said and done miiller and rendi would be left to face the music with little or no suspicion that he was still alive and the home of the brave becker joined the startled runstedt in the final line both runstedt and becker groaned repeatedly with the effort of dragging first one body and then another through the sewage pipe to the false cabinet in the biochemical research building intermixed with the sounds of their effort were the scratching and scraping of countless rats scurrying about in the pitch darkness the young farmer was in height and frame a virtual twin of beckers the older man like runstedt was heavy but taller than runstedt by several centimeters dont worry about the difference in your heights alfi becker had reassured him by the time the explosion and fire are through with these bodies no one will want to get any closer to them than it takes to remove our watches rings identification medallions and wallets with becker pushing from below runstedt hauled the corpses through the base of the cabinet and stretched them out on the wooden floor perfect perfect becker said scrambling through the hole we are right on time oberst alfi said i have one question if i may of course how will we keep the tunnel from being discovered after the fire and explosion hah an excellent point becker exclaimed one i might add that i am not at all surprised to have you make i have kept the steel plate you removed to make the opening in the pipe it fits perfectly and stays in place with several small hooks i have welded on with ashes and debris piled on top i doubt the pipe will ever be discovered brilliant herr oberst you are a truly brilliant man thank you unteroffizier and now we must check have you said anything to anyone which might suggest you are planning to leave tonight no sir good and have you told the men in your barrack that you will be working late in the laboratory with me yes oberst wonderful we are ready to arrange the ether to set the charge and the timer and to exchange clothes with our friends here then it is off to hot dogs and betty grable alfi said hot dogs and betty grable becker echoed but first a toast to our success thus far amaretto cheroots amaretto my god oberst how do you keep coming up with these things alfi took the proffered glass inhaled the wonderful almond scent and then drained the liqueur in a gulp the cyanide its deadly aroma and taste masked took just seconds to work becker was removing his uniform and jewelry as runstedt writhing and vomiting on the floor breathe his last with some effort becker dressed the young farmer in his own uniform adding a ring billfold identification necklace and finally edwins watch an elegant piece which many in the camp associated with him next he stepped back and with the use of the hooded flashlight surveyed the scene everything everyone had to be perfectly placed he undressed the farmer who was to have served as alfis double tossed the clothes to one side and then dumped the naked body down the tunnel now alfi my most loyal of servants we must find a place for you he shone the torch on the contorted violet face by his feet in minutes the arrangement was complete the young farmers body lay in the center of the laboratory his face resting beside a laboratory timer and a fivegallon tin of ether several other tins were spaced throughout the dry wooden building alfis body lay near the door as far from the explosive vapors as possible it would be the validity of runstedts face which would assure acceptance of beckers own demise the simple elegance of the whole plan was as pleasing as a major research success and becker felt ballooned with pride as he made a final survey of the scene he checked the small ignition charge and set the timer for ten minutes willi becker was grinning as he dropped into the tunnel and pulled the workbench cabinet back in place he sealed the drainage pipe opening and without a glance at the farmers body crawled toward the exit beyond the camps electrified fence he was behind the wheel of the lorry a quarter mile from the camp when the peaceful night sky turned redgold seconds later he heard the muffled series of explosions goodbye josef rendl he said i shall enjoy reading in the new york times of your trial and execution and as for you dr miiller it is game and match between us eh a shame you shall never know who really won perhaps someday if you survive i will send you a postcard his wife and son were waiting for him in rostock as becker bounced down the road he began humming the star spangled banner the morning was typical of december in massachusetts a brushed aluminum sky blended into threedayold snow covering the cornfields along route dulled by streaks of road salt jared samuelss red mgtd roadster still sparkled like a flare against the landscape from the passenger seat kate bennett watched her husband negotiate the country road using only the thumb and first two fingers of his left hand his dark brown eyes though fixed on the road were relaxed and he seemed to be singing to himself kate laughed hey doc jared asked glancing over just what are you laughing at you well thats a relieffor a moment there i thought you were laughing at me tell me what i was doing that was so funny i might want to write it down not funny kate said just nice it makes me happy to see you happy theres a peacefulness in you that i havent seen since the campaign began then you should have turned on the bedroom light last night at oh eleventhirty was it you didnt just pass out after nope five minutes of absolute nirvana then i passed out he flashed the smile that had always been reserved for her alone i love you you know kate said jared looked at her again it had been a while since either of them had said the words outside the bedroom even though im not going to be the honorable congressman from the sixth district especially because youre not going to be the honorable congressman from the sixth district she checked the time jared its only ninethirty do you think we could stop at the lake for a bit we havent in such a long time i brought a bag of bread just in case jared slowed only if you promise not to poach when goddamn carlisle starts hitting to my backhand once i stole a ball from you once in almost two years of playing together and you never let me forget it no poaching was he being serious it bothered her that after almost five years of marriage she couldnt always tell no poaching she vowed finally wary of making a response that would chip the mood of the morning lately it seemed their upbeat moods were becoming less frequent and more fragile the ducks bless you jared said in a tone which did nothing to resolve her uncertainty the lake more a large pond was a mile off in the general direction of the oceanside racquet club it was surrounded by dense thickets of pine and scrub oak separated by the backyards of a dozen or so housesupperclass dwellings in most communities but only average in the north shore village of beverly farms at the far end of the ice cover hockey sticks in hand a trio of boys chased a puck up and down a makeshift rink their bright mufflers and caps phosphorescing against the pearlgray morning nearer the road a spillway kept the surface from freezing bobbing on the halfmoon it created were a score of ducks several more rested on the surrounding ice the couple stood motionless by their car transfixed by the scene currier and ives kate said wistfully bonnie and clyde jared responded in the same tone youre so romantic counselor kate managed a twosecond glare of reproach before she smiled jareds often black sense of humor was hit or misskamikaze humor she had labeled it come on lets duck she called her runners legs objects of the fantasies of more than a few of her fellow physicians at metropolitan hospital of boston brought her easily down the snowy embankment her auburn hair bouncing on the hood of her parka as she approached the water a huge gander honking arrogantly advanced to get his due kate eyed the bird and then threw a handful of bread over his head to a milling group of smaller mallards and wood ducks a moment later from atop the bank jared scaled an entire roll precisely at the feet of the gander who snatched it up and swaggered away kate turned to him hands on hips are you trying to undermine my authority always side with the overdog thats my motto he said brightly i even voted for mattingly in the sixth congressional race i mean who would want to waste his vote on a sure loser like the other guy a twopoint defeat when you started out twentytwo behind some loser slide on down here big boy and ill give you our traditional sunday morning kiss we have a traditional sunday morning kiss not yet jared surveyed the embankment and then chose a safer albeit much longer route than kate had taken she stifled a smile never lift up your left foot until your fight ones firmly planted was a favorite saying of jareds father and here was the scionthe discipleembracing the philosophy in its most literal sense someday jared she thought you are going to lift up both of your feet at the same time and discover you can fly his kiss was firm and deep his tongue caressing the roof of her mouth the insides of her cheeks kate responded in kind sliding both her hands to his buttocks and holding him tightly you kiss good doc he said i mean good do you think the ducks would mind if we started making dirty snow angels she whispered warming his ear with her lips no but i think the carlisles would jared pulled free weve got to get going i wonder why they keep inviting us to play with them when we havent beaten them once in two years they just love a challenge i guess kate shrugged tossed out the remaining bread and followed him along the safe route to the road did someone call this morning he asked over his shoulder pardon while i was in the shower jared turned to her as he reached the mg and leaned against the perfectly maintained canvas top i thought i heard the phone ring oh you did a nugget of tension materialized beneath her breastbone jared hadnt missed hearing the phone after all it it was nothing really just dr willoughby kate slid into the passenger seat she had wanted to choose carefully the moment to discuss the pathology chiefs call how is yoda he asked settling behind the wheel hes fine i wish you wouldnt call him that jared hes been very good to me and it sounds so demeaning its not demeaning honestly he turned the key and the engine rumbled to life why without yoda luke skywalker would never have survived the first star wars sequel what else could i possibly call someone whos three feet tall bald with bushy eyebrows and lives in a swamp anyway what did he want kate felt the nugget expand and fought the sensation he just needed to discuss some twists and turns in the politics at the hospital she said evenly ill tell you about them later how about we use the little time we have to plan some kind of strategic ambush for the carlisles dont poach thats all the strategy we need now what was so important to ol yoda at eightthirty on a sunday morning although the words were spoken lightly kate noted that he had not yet put the car into gear from the beginning of their relationship he had been somehow threatened both by her career and by her unique friendship with her aging department head it was nothing he had ever said but the threat was there she was certain of it later she tried one last time jared switched off the ignition the mood of the morning shattered like dropped crystal kate forced her eyes to make and maintain contact with his he said that tomorrow morning he was going to send letters to the medical school and to norton reese announcing his retirement in june or as soon as a successor can be chosen as chief of the department a nd and i think you know already what comes next deep inside her kate felt sparks of anger begin to replace the tension this exchange her news her chance to become at thirtyfive the youngest department chief to say nothing of the only woman department chief at metrothey should have been embraced by the marriage with the same joy as jareds election to congress would have been try me jared said gazing off across the lake kate sighed he wants my permission to submit my name to the faculty search committee as his personal recommendation and you thanked him very much but begged off because you and your husband agreed two years ago to start your family when the election was over and you simply couldnt take on the responsibility and time demands of a department chairmanshipespecially of a moneyless understaffed political football of a department like the one yoda is scurrying away from nowright wrong the snap in her voice was reflex she cursed herself for losing control so easily and took several seconds to calm down before continuing i told him i would think about it and talk it over with my husband and some of my friends at the hospital i told him either to leave my name off his letter or wait a week before sending it have you thought what the job would take out of you i mean yodas had two coronaries in the last few years and he is certainly a lot more low key than you are dammit jared stop calling him that and they werent coronaries only angina all right angina do you suppose we could talk this over after we play youre the one who was so worried about being late jared glanced at his watch and then restarted the engine he turned to her there was composure in the lines of his face but an intensity perhaps even a fearin his eyes it was the same look kate had seen in them when before the election he spoke of losing as not the end of the world sure he said just answer me that one question do you really have a sense of what it would be like for youfor usif you took over that department i i know it wouldnt be easy but thats not what youre really asking is it jared shook his head and stared down at his clenched hands kate knew very well what he was asking he was thirtynine years old and an only child his first marriage had ended in nightmarish fashion with his wife running off to california with their baby daughter even jareds father senior partner of one of bostons most prestigious law firms with all the kings horses and all the kings men at his disposal couldnt find them jared wanted children for himself and for his father he wanted them the agreement to wait until after the election was out of deference to the pressures of a political campaign and the newness of their marriage now neither was a factor oh yes she knew very well what he was asking the answer is she said finally that if i accepted the nomination and got the appointment i would need some time to do the job right but that is the grossest kind of projection at this point norton reese has hardly been my biggest supporter since i exposed the way he was using money budgeted for the forensic pathology unit to finance new cardiac surgery equipment i think he would cut off an arm before he would have me as a department chief in a hospital he administrated how much time jareds voice was chilly please honey im begging you lets do this when we can sit down in our own living room and discuss all the possibilities how much i i dont know a year two jared snapped the stick shift into first gear sending a spray of ice and snow into the air before the rear tires gained purchase to be continued he said as much to himself as to her fine she said numbly she sank back in her seat and stared unseeing out the window her thoughts drifted for a time and then began to focus on a face kate closed her eyes and tried to will the thoughts the face away in moments though she could see arts eyes glazed and bloodshot see them as clearly as she had that afternoon a dozen years before when he had raped her she could smell the whiskey on his breath and feel the weight of his fullbacks body on top of hers though bundled in a down parka and warmup suit she began to shiver jared turned onto the narrow access drive to the club to kates right the metallic surface of the atlantic glinted through a leafless hardwood forest she took no notice of it please art dont her mind begged youre hurting me please let me up all i did was take the test i didnt say i was going to apply look there are the carlisles up ahead of us i guess were not late after all jareds voice broke through the nightmare dampened by a cold sweat she pushed herself upright the assault had taken place the day after the second anniversary of her previous marriage and only an hour after her husband a failure first in a pro football tryout then in graduate school and finally in business had learned that she had taken the medical college admission test and worse that she had scored in the top five percent his need to control her never pleasant had turned ugly by the evening of that day she had moved out jared she pleaded quietly well talk okay yeah sure he answered well talk the ball rainbowed off jareds racquet with deceptive speed a perfect topspin lob from her spot by the net kate watched jim and patsy carlisle skid to simultaneous stops and amidst flailing arms legs and racquets dash backward toward the baseline the shot bounced six inches inside the line and then accelerated toward the screen the carlisles in frantic pursuit you fox kate whispered as jared moved forward for the uling shot they both knew would not be necessary that was absolutely beautiful just keep looking sort of bland like we dont even know were about to beat them for the first time ever across the net patsy carlisle made a fruitless lunge that sent her tumbling into the indoor courts green nylon backdrop kate watched the minidrama of the woman still seated on the court glaring at her husband as he stalked away from her without even the offer of a hand up husbands and wives mixed doubles she thought games within games within games three match points she said maybe we should squabble more often before we play a took at jareds eyes told her she should have let the matter lie finish em with the ol high hard one she urged as he walked back to the service line her enthusiasm she knew now sounded forcedan attempt at some kind of expiation jared nodded at her and winked kate crouched by the net eighteen feet in front of her jim carlisle shifted the weight of his compact perfectly conditioned body from one foot to another a successful real estate developer a yachtsman and club champion several years running he had never been one to take any kind of loss lightly you know he had said to her on the only attempt he had ever made to start an affair between them there are those like youknowwho who are content to tiptoe along in daddys footsteps and those who just grab life by the throat and do it im a doer the reference to jared even though prodded forth by far too many martinis had left an aftertaste of anger that kate knew would never totally disappear when carlisle sent the samuels for congress committee a check for five hundred dollars she had almost sent it back with a note telling him to go grab somebodys life by the throat instead out of deference to her husband she had invited the carlisles over for dinner her hypocrisy however honorable its purpose continued to rankle her from time to time especially when carlisle wearing his smugness like aftershave was about to inflict yet another defeat on team samuelsbennett at last she was beating the man not even a disagreement with her husband could dull the luster of the moment through the mirror of jim carlisles stages of readiness to return serve kate pictured jareds movements behind her feet planted jared had settled in at the line hunching over knees bent jared was tapping ball against racquet gaining his rhythm just before carlisle began the quick bouncing which would signal the toss she heard jareds voice the ol high hard one he said kate tensed awaiting the familiar sharp pok of jareds serve and carlisles almost simultaneous move to return instead she heard virtually nothing and watched in horror as carlisle with the glee of a tomcat discovering a wounded sparrow advanced to pounce on a woefully soft hit the serve was deliberatevintage jared samuels his way of announcing that by no means had he forgotten their argument jared you bastard kate screamed just as carlisle exploded a shot straight at her chest from less than a dozen feet away an instant after the ball left carlisles racquet it was on kates then ricocheting into a totally unguarded corner of the court the shot was absolute reflex absolute luck but perfect all the same match kate said simply she shook hands with each of their opponents giving jims hand an extra pump then without a backward glance she walked off the court to the locker room the oceanside racquet club three quarters of an acre of corrugated aluminum box squatted gracelessly on a small rise above the atlantic facing wimbledon was the way the clubs overstuffed director liked to describe it keeping her hair dry and moving quickly enough to ensure that jared would have to work to catch up with her kate showered and left the building the rules of their game demanded a reaction of some sort for his behavior and she had decided on taking the mg perhaps stopping a mile or so down the road as she crossed the halffilled parking lot she began searching the pockets of her parka for her keys almost immediately she remembered seeing them on the kitchen table damn the feeling was so familiar she had in the past slept through several exams required police assistance to locate her car in an airport parking garage and forgotten where she had put the engagement ring art had given her although she had come to accept the trait as a usually harmless annoyance there was a time when visions of clamps left in abdomens concerned her enough to influence her decision to go into pathology rather than clinical medicine this day she felt no compassion whatsoever toward her shortcoming testily she strode past their car and down the road the move was a bluff jared would know that as well as she it was an eightmile walk to their home and the temperature was near freezing still some show of indignation was called for but not this she realized quickly at the moment she accepted the absurdity of her gesture and decided to turn back she heard the distinctive rev of the mg behind her there could be no retreat now it was a game between them but not a game their scenarios were often carefully staged but they were life all the same actions and reactions spontaneous or not that provided the dynamics unique to their relationship there had been no such dynamics in her first marriage put simply arthur everett decreed and his dutiful wife kathryn acquiesced for two destructive years it had been that way her childhood programming offered no alternatives and she had been too frightened too insecure to question even now there were times though gradually fewer and farther between when dreams of the farmhouse and the children the wellstocked sunlit kitchen and the pipe smoke wafting out from the study dominated her thoughts they were she knew nothing more than the vestigesthe reincarnationsof that childhood programming unfortunately much of jareds programming was continually being reinforced thanks largely to a father who remained convinced that gods plan for women was quite different from his plan for men you have a wonderful behind do you know that jareds voice startled her he was driving alongside her studying her anatomy through a pair of binoculars yes i know that she stiffened enough to be sure he could notice and walked on please dont get hurt she thought put those silly binoculars down and watch where youre going and your face have i told you lately about your face no but go ahead if you must it is the blue ribbon gold medal faceofthedecade face thats what you tried to get me killed in there kate slowed but did not stop it was childish and ill and it was dumb gcand and it didnt work jared and im sorry i really am the devil made me do it but i went and let im he opened the door she stopped hesitated the obligatory few seconds and got in the scenario was over through it a dram of purulence had been drained from their marriage before it could fester energy no longer enmeshed in their anger would now be rechanneled perhaps to a joint attack today on the pile of unsplit wood in the yard and later to a battle with the times crossword puzzle as likely as not before the afternoon was through they would make love eyes closed kate settled back in her seat savoring what she had just heard im sorry he had actually said it apologizing has been bred out of samuels men was yet another teaching from the philosophy of j winfield samuels kate had suffered the pain of that one on more than one occasion she thought about jareds vehement reaction to the possibility of her taking over the chairmanship of her department the morning she had decided had been a draw dad i wife i now dr engleson you may proceed with your report tom englesons groan was not as inaudible as he would have liked your patient is still bleeding sir thats my report during his year and a half of residency on the ashburton service at metropolitan hospital of boston engleson had had enough dealings with d k bartholomew to know that he would be lucky to escape with anything less than a fifteenminute conversation dr donald k bartholomew held the receiver in his left hand adjusted the notepad in front of him and straightened his posture and what is her blood count twentyfive her crit is down to twentyfive from twentyeight engleson pictured the numbers being shakily reproduced in black felt tip she has had a total of five units transfused in the last twentyfour hours two of whole blood one of packed cells and two of fresh frozen plasma he closed his eyes and awaited the inevitable string of questions for a few seconds there was silence how many fresh frozen did you say two the hematology people have been to see her again her blood is just not clotting normally he had decided to keep the complicated explanation for beverly vitales bleeding problem out of the conversation if at all possible a single request from bartholomew for specifics and the phone call could drag on for another half hour in fact there was no good explanation even available the hematologists knew whattwo of the womans key clotting factors were at critically low levelsbut not why it was a problem the surgeon should have at least identified before performing her d and c have they further tests to run no sir not today anyhow getting d k bartholomew to come into the hospital on a sunday morning was like getting a cat to hop into the tub they suggested loading her up with fresh clotting factors and perhaps doing another d and c theyre afraid she might bleed out otherwise how long will it take to give her the factors weve already started sir there was another pause well then bartholomew said at last i guess the patient and i have a date in the operating room would you like me to assist engleson closed his eyes and prayed for an affirmative response for a d and c no thank you doctor it is a oneman procedure and i am one man i shall be in by twelve oclock please put the or team on notice fine engleson said wearily he had already scheduled beverly vitale for the operating room he hung up and checked the wall clock over the door of the cluttered residents office only eight minutes a record he announced sardonically to the empty room i may have just set a record moments later he called the operating suite denise its tom engleson you know the d and c i scheduled for dr bartholomew vitale thats right well i was wondering if you could switch it to the observation or i want to watch i know youre not supposed to use that room on a weekend thats why im asking in such a groveling tone of voice bartholomew doesnt want anyone assisting him but he cant keep me from watching through the overhead i owe you one denise thanks looking down from behind the thick glass observation window into the operating room tim engleson exchanged worried looks with the scrub nurse assisting dr donald k bartholomew the dilatation of beverly vitales cervix and subsequent curettagescrapidgof the idner surface of her uterus was not going well she had gone to the emergency ward three days before because of vaginal bleeding that started with her period but would not let up for several years she had been receiving routine gynecologic care through the omnicenterthe outpatient facility of the ashburton womens health service of metropolitan hospital as her omnicenter physician d k bartholomew had been called in immediately in his admission physical bartholomew had noted a number of bruises on the womans arms and legs but elected nevertheless to proceed with a d and ccommonly done for excessive bleeding he did not order blood clotting studies until after his patients bleeding worsened postoperatively now with the woman loaded with fresh clotting factors bartholomew was repeating the curettage beverly vitale a thin delicate young cellist with straight jet hair and fine artists hands lay supine on the operating table with her eyes taped shut and her head turned ninety degrees to one side a polystyrene tube placed through her mouth into her trachea connected her with the anesthesia machine her legs draped in sterile sheets were held aloft by cloth stirrups hooked beneath each heel overhead in the observation gallery tom engleson watched and waited he was dressed in standard operating room whites with hair and shoe covers but no mask as he watched the level of suctioned blood rise in the vacuum bottle on the wall engleson wondered if d k batholomew was considering removing the womans uterus altogether he cursed himself for not throwing protocol to the winds and inviting himself into the or the prospect of the old surgeon moving ahead with a hysterectomy brought a ball of anger to the residents throat much of his reaction he knew had to do with beverly vitale though he had only spoken with her a few times engleson had begun fantasizing about her and had become determined to see her when she was released from the hospital now his thoughts added if she was released from the hospital he glanced again at the vacuum bottle and then at bartholomew there was a flicker of confusion and uncertainty in the mans eyes her pressure is dropping a bit engleson heard the anesthesiologists voice crackle through a barely functional speaker on the wall behind him young lady get me the freshest unit of blood we have and see if the blood bank can send us up ten units of platelets yes sir the nurse said dr bartholomew blood loss so far is four hundred and fifty ccs bartholomew did not respond immediately he stood motionless staring at the steady flow of crimson from beverly vitales cervix lets try some pitocin maybe her uterus will clamp down he said finally dr bartholomew the anesthesiologist said an even tenseness in his voice youve already ordered pitocin shes been getting it maximum doses engleson strained to see the older surgeons face if he rushed into the or and the man did not need assistance a formal complaint was sure to before he could complete the thought the bellboy hanging from his waistband emitted the abrasive tone signaling a transmission dr engleson call two eight three stat dr engleson two eight three stat please an anxious check of the scene below and the resident rushed to the nearest phone it was a rule of the ashburton service that all stat pages were to be answered within sixty seconds telephones had even been installed in the residents bathrooms for such purposes the call concerned a postop patient whose temperature had risen to not a lifeordeath situation by the time engleson had listened to the nurses report given orders for evaluating the patients fever and returned to the observation window bartholomew had begun swabbing antiseptic over beverly vitales lower abdomen engleson switched on the microphone by his right hand whats going on he asked below no one reacted to his voice can you hear me again no response through the door to the scrub area engleson saw carol nixon a surgical intern rotating through the ashburton service beginning to scrub apparently bartholomew had called her in to assist perhaps when engleson could not be found over my dead body engleson said as he raced down the hall to the stairs no way do you open that woman up without my being there in less than a minute he had joined nixon in the scrub room the nurses said stone hands was trying to find you the woman said i was just finishing up a case down the hall when denise grabbed me do i have to stay you might want to learn from the master in there engleson responded acidly cleaning his fingernails with an orange stick the intern smiled nodded a thanksbutnothanks and left him to finish his scrub order a peach and you get a pear was bartholomews comment on the change in assistants he laughed merrily at his own humor and seemed not to notice the absence of response from around the room with engleson handling sponges and hemostats bartholomew used an electric scalpel to make an incision from just below beverly vitales navel to her pubis the scalpel buzzing and crackling like hot bacon grease simultaneously sliced through the skin and cauterized bleeding vessels next with the voltage turned up he cut through a thin layer of saffroncolored fat to her peritoneum the opaque membrane covering her abdominal cavity a few snips with a metzenbalim scissors and the peritoneum parted exposing her bowel her bladder and beneath those her uterus in a perfunctory manner too perfunctory for englesons taste the older surgeon explored the abdominal cavity with one hand everything seems in order he announced to the room i think we can proceed with a hysterectomy no engleson said sharply the room froze i mean dont you think we should at least consider the possibility of ligating her hypogastric artery he wanted to add his feelings about rushing ahead with a hysterectomy in a thirtyyearold woman with no children but held back also unsaid at least for the moment was that the hypogastric ligation while not always successful in stopping hemorrhaging was certainly accepted practice in a case like this bartholomew was still guided by the old schoolthe school that removed a uterus with the dispatch of a dermatologist removing a wart d k bartholomews pale blue eyes came up slowly and locked on englesons for five seconds ten an eerie silence held impinged upon only by the wheeze of air into the vacuum apparatus the tall resident held his ground but he also held his breath the outburst by the older surgeon now and there would be a confrontation that could further jeopardize the life of beverly vitale then moment by moment engleson saw the blaze in bartholomews eyes fade thank you for the suggestion doctor the surgeon said distantly i think perhaps we should give it a try the relieved sighs from those in the room were muffled by their masks you or me engleson asked it its been a while since i did this procedure bartholomew understated dont worry well do it together in minutes the ligation was complete almost instantly the bleeding from within the womans uterus began to lessen while were waiting to see if this works engleson said would you mind if i got a better look at her tubes and ovaries bartholomew shrugged and shook his head engleson probed along the fallopian tubes first to one ovary and then to the other they did not feel at all right carefully he withdrew the left ovary through the incision it was half normal size mottled gray and quite firm this time it was his eyes that flashed you said everything was in order bartholomew sagged there was a bewildered vacant air about him as if he had opened his eyes before a mirror and seen a painful truth the womans right ovary was identical to her left i dont think ive ever seen anything quite like this engleson said have you no well not exactly pardon i said i hadnt either there was an uncertainty a hesitation in the older mans words he reached over and touched the ovary you sure engleson prodded i i may have felt one once im trying to remember do you suggest a biopsy engleson nodded a wedge section another nod the mans confidence was obviously shaken by the time the wedge biopsy was taken the bleeding had slowed dramatically as engleson prepared to close the abdominal incision over the uterus he had just preserved he sensed the irony of what was happening tighten in his gut the uterus was saved true a fine piece of surgery but if the pathology in beverly vitales ovaries was as extensive as it appeared the woman would never bear children anyhow denise he said could you find out whos on for surgical path this month both the resident and the staff person okay right away engleson glanced at the peaceful face and tousled hair of the young cellist some women try for years to get pregnant never knowing whether they can or not he thought at least youll know glumly he began to close twenty minutes later the two surgeons shuffled into the doctors locker room dr bartholomew have you been able to remember where you might have encountered ovarian pathology like this womans oh yes well no i what i mean is i dont think ive ever seen anything like them you look as if you want to say something more i may have felt something like them once thats all when on whom there was some excitement in englesons voice d k bartholomew md fellow of the american college of surgeons and diplomate of the american college of obstetrics and gynecology shook his head i im afraid i dont remember he said what are you talking about it was surgery for something else maybe removal of a fibroid tumor the ovaries felt like this womans did today but there was no one around to consult and i think i had another case or two left to do and so you just ignored them and closed i felt they were probably a normal variant yeah sure did you mention them on your operative note i i dont remember it might have been years ago the wall telephone began ringing dr bartholomew engleson said allowing the jangle to continue i dont think you should operate anymore with that he turned and snatched up the receiver dr engleson its denise i called pathology yes i couldnt find out who the resident is on surgicals but the staff person is dr bennett cgood excuse me i just said thats good thanks denise thank you for what you did in there doctor you made my day kates back was arched over the pillows beneath her hips as jared knelt between her legs and used her buttocks to pull himself farther inside her again and again he sent jets of pleasure and pain deep into her gut and up into her throat her climax grew like the sound of an oncoming trainfirst a tingle a vibration next a hum then a roar with jared helping her body came off the pillows until only her heels and the back of her head were touching the carpet her muscles tightened on him and seemed to draw him in even deeper he dug his fingers into the small of her back and cried out in a soft childs voice then he came his erection pulsing in counterpoint to her own contractions i love you he whispered oh katey i love you so much gently he worked his arms around her waist and guided her onto her side trying to stay within her as long as possible for half an hour they lay on the soft living room carpet their lovers sweat drying in the warmth from the nearby wood stove from the kitchen the aroma of percolating coffee forgotten for over an hour worked its way into the sweetness of the birch fire a cashmere blanket one of the plethora of wedding gifts from jareds father lay beside them kate pulled it over her sleeping husband and then slipped carefully from underneath for a time she knelt there studying the face of the man who had five years before arranged to have himself and a dozen roses wheeled under a sheet into her autopsy suite in order to convince her to reconsider a rebuffed dinner invitation five years years filled with so much changeso much growth for both of them she had been a nervous overworked junior faculty member then and he had been the hotshot young attorney assigned by mintonsamuels to handle beleaguered metropolitan hospital the memory of him in those daysso eager and intense brought a faint smile kate reached out and touched the fine creases that had overnight it seemed materialized at the corners of her husbands eyes a year jared she asked silently would a year make all that much difference you understand your own needs so well can you understand mine almost instantly another far more disturbing question arose in her thoughts did she in fact understand them herself silently she rose and walked to the picture window overlooking their wooded backyard superimposed on the smooth waves of drifted snow was the reflection of her naked body kept thin and toned by constant dieting and almost obsessive exercise on an impulse she turned sideways and forced her abdomen out as far as it would go six months she guessed maybe seven not too bad looking for an old pregnant lady fifteen minutes later when the phone rang kate was ricocheting around the kitchen preparing brunch the edge of her terrycloth robe narrowly missed toppling a pan of sweet sausages as she leapt for the receiver answering it before the first ring ended nevertheless through the door to the living room she saw jared stir from the fetal tuck in which he had been sleeping and begin to stretch hello she answered mentally discarding the exotic plans she had made for awakening her husband dr bennett its tom engleson im a senior resident on the ashburton service at metro do you remember me of course tom you saw me at the omnicenter once saved my life when dr zimmermann was away i did there was a hint of embarrassment in his voice what was the matter well actually i just needed a refill of my birth control pills but i remember you just the same what can i do for you her mental picture of engleson was of a loose gangly man thirty or thirtyone with angular features and a youthful face slightly aged by a teddy roosevelt moustache please forgive me for phoning you at home on sunday nonsense thank you the reason im calling is to get your advice on handling a surgical specimen its one youll be seeing tomorrow a wedge section of a patients left ovary taken during a hypogastric artery ligation for menorrhagia how old a woman reflexively kate took up a pen to begin scratching data on the back of an envelope so doing she noticed that jared was now huddled by the wood stove with roscoe their fouryearold almostterrier and the marriages declared neutral love object thirty engleson answered no deliveries no pregnancies and in fact no ovaries what oh theyre there but theyre unlike any ovaries ive ever seen before dr bartholomew was with methe woman is his patientand he has never seen pathology like this either kate pulled a high stool from beneath the counter and wrapped one foot around its leg explain she said well whatever this is is uniform and symmetrical we took a slice from the left ovary but it could just as well have been the right shrunken the consistency of of a squash ballsort of hard but rubbery the surface is pockmarked dimpled what color kate had written down almost every word gray grayish brown maybe interesting she said does what ive described ring any bells no at least not right off however there are a number of possibilities any idea as to why this woman was having menorrhagia two reasons one is a platelet count of just fortyfive thousand and the other is a fibrinogen level that is fifteen percent of normal an autoimmune phenomenon kate searched her thoughts for a single disease entity characterized by the two blood abnormalities an autoimmune phenomenon the body making antibodies against certain of its own tissues seemed likely so far thats number one on the list engleson said the hematology people have started her on steroids was she on any medications hey kate it was jared calling from the living room do you smell something burning nothing but vitamins engleson answered kate did not respond receiver tucked under her ear she was at the oven pulling out a tray of four blackened lumps that had once been shirred eggsjareds favorite shit she said what both jared and tom engleson said the word simultaneously oh sorry i wasnt talking to you a miniature cumulonimbus cloud puffed from the oven jared its all right she called out this time covering the mouthpiece its just our meal thats all dr bennett if youd rather i called back no tom no listen theres a histology technician on call the lab tech on duty knows who it is have whoever it is come in and begin running the specimen through the technichron that way it will be ready for examination tomorrow rather than tuesday better still ask them to come into the lab and call me at home ill give the instructions myself okay sure thanks no problem she said staring at the lumps ill speak to you later shirred eggs jared wrapped in the cashmere blanket leaned against the doorway roscoe peered at her from between his knees kate nodded sheepishly i sort of smelled the smoke but my one track brain was focused on what this resident from the hospital was saying and somehow it dismissed the smoke as coming from the wood stove i i never was too great at doing more than one thing at once too bad you couldnt have chosen to let the resident burn to a crisp and save the eggs he said next time good any possibilities for replacements howard johnsons thanks but ill take my chances with some coffee and whatevers in that frying pan you sure that wasnt yoda on the phone jared he held up his hands against her ire just checking just checking he said come on roscoe lets go set the table kate noted the absence of an apology but decided that two in one day was too much to ask more difficult to accept however was jareds apparent lack of interest in what the call was about it was as if by not talking about her career her life outside of their marriage he was somehow diminishing its importance in public he took special pride in her professionalism and her degree privately he accepted it as long as it didnt burn his eggs almost against her will she felt frustration begin to dilute the warmth and closeness generated by their lovemaking she walked to where her clothes were piled in the living room and dressed silently vowing to do whatever she could to avoid another blowup that day minutes later the crunch of tires on their gravel driveway heralded a test of her resolve roscoe heard the arrival first and bounded from his place by the stove to the front door jared now in denims and a flannel work shirt followed hey kate its sandy he called out opening the inside door sandy dick sandler jareds roommate at dartmouth had been best man at their wedding a twa pilot he lived on the south shore and hadnt been in touch with them for several months is ellen with him no hes alone jared opened the storm door hey flyboy he called in a thick spanish accent welcome i have just what you want sefior a seexteenyearold american virgin only feefty pesetas sandler a rugged marlon brando type exchanged bear hugs with jared and platonic kisses with kate and then scanned what there was of their brunch what no bloodies kate winced before images of the two men emboldened by a few bloodies exchanging offcolor jokes she seldom thought were funny and singing i wanna go back to dartmouth to dartmouth on the hill invariably she would end up having to decide whether to leave the house try to shut them off or join in when ellen sandler was around no such problem existed a woman a few years older than kate and sandys wife since his graduation ellen was as charming interesting and full of life as anyone kate had ever known she was a hostess with poise and grace the mother of three delightful girls and even a modestly successful businesswoman having developed an interior design consulting firm that she had run alone for several years from their home and more recently from a small studio cum office in town sandy with his flamboyance his stature as a captain and his versitile wit was the magnet that drew many fascinating and accomplished people into the sandlers social circle ellen kate believed was the glue that kept them there so sandy she said dropping a celery stick into his drink and sliding it across the table what brings you north to boston how are ellen and the girls it was at that moment that she first appreciated the sadness in his eyes i well actually i was just driving around and decided to cruise up here sort of a whim i i needed to talk to jared and to you you and ellen jareds sense of his friend told him immediately what to ask i im leaving her moving out sandler stared uncomfortably into the center of his drink at his words kate felt a dreadful sinking in her gut ellen had stated on many occasions and in many ways the uncompromising love she bore for the man how long had they been married now eighteen years nineteen maybe holy shit jared whispered setting a hand on sandlers forearm whats happened nothing i mean nothing dramatic somewhere along the way we just lost one another sandy people who have been married for almost twenty years dont just lose one another kate said now what has happened there was an irritability in her voice which surprised her jareds expression suggested that he too was startled by her tone sandler shrugged well between running the house and entertaining and taking the girls to one lesson or another and scouts and committees at our club and that business of hers ellen simply ran out of energy for me in some areas meals and such she still goes through the motions but without much spark how is ellen handling all this kate asked checking jareds face for a sign that she might be interloping with too many questions the message she received was noncommittal she doesnt know yet what her exclamation this time drew a be careful glare i just decided yesterday but ive been thinking about it for weeks longer i was hoping you two might have some suggestions as to how i should go about breaking the news to her have you been to a counsellor or a shrink or something jared asked the question its too late what do you mean you just said ellen doesnt even know what youre planning to do jared sounded baffled across the table kate closed her eyes she knew the explanation theres someone else sandler said selfconsciously a flight attendant i weve been seeing one another for some time for kate the words were like needle stabs jared was pressing to get a commitment from her to alter her life along pathways ellen sandler could negotiate blindfolded yet here was sandy like jared in so many ways rejecting the woman for not devoting enough energy to him the image of ellen sitting there while he announced his intentions made her first queasy and then frightened the fear as happened more often than not mutated into anger before it could be expressed ellen doesnt deserve this she said backing away from the table we just lost one another sandy dont you think thats sort of a sleazy explanation for whats really going on how old is this woman twentysix but i dont see what her i know you dont see you dont see a lot of things jared stood up now just one second kate and you dont see a lot of things either dammit there were tears streaming down her face you two boys work out how youre gonna break the news to ellen that she did everything she goddamn well could in lifemore than both of you put together probablybut that it just wasnt enough shes fired dismissed not flashy enough not showy enough her services are no longer required excuse me im going to the bathroom to get sick then im going to my hospital people there are grateful and appreciative for the things i do well i like that it helps me to get up in the morning fists clenched she turned and raced from the room roscoe who had settled himself under the table padded to the center of the room and after a brief glance at the men followed ginger rittenhouse a firstgrade teacher had just finished her run by the icecovered charles river when she began to die like the random victim of a crazed sniper she did not hear the sound or see the muzzle flash of the weapon that killed her in fact the weapon was nothing more malevolent than the corner of her bureau drawer the shot an accidental bump less than twentyfour hours before to a spot just above her right eye thats one incredible lump her new roommate had exclaimed forcing an icepack against the golfballsized knot the woman a licensed practical nurse had commented on the large bruise just below her right knee as well ginger was too selfconscious to mention the other similar bruises on her lower back buttocks and upper arm her death began with a tican annoying electric sensation deep behind her right eye the wall of her right middle cerebral artery was stretching bruised by the shock from the bureau drawer the vessel narrow as a piece of twine had developed a tiny defect along the inner lining the platelets and fibrinogen necessary to patch the defect were present but in insufficient amounts to do the job blood had begun to work its way between the layers of the vessel wall squinting against the pain she sat on a bench and looked across the river at the general electric building in cambridge the outline of the building seemed blurred from the rent in her right middle cerebral artery blood had begun to ooze a microdrop at a time into the space between her skull and brain nerve fibers exquisitely sensitive detected the intrusion and began screaming their message of warning ginger mindless of the huge lump over her ear placed her hands on either side of her head and tried to squeeze the pain into submission powered by the beating of her own heart the bleeding increased her thoughts became disconnected snatches the low skyline of cambridge began to fade behind her runners jogged by a pair of lovers passed close enough to read the dial on her watch ginger now paralyzed by pain that was far more than pain was beyond calling for help suddenly a brilliant white light replaced the agony the heat from the light bathe the inside of her eyes her random thoughts coalesced about woods and a stream it was the dingle the secret hiding place of her childhood she knew every tree every rock home and safe at last ginger rittenhouse surrendered to the light and gently toppled forward onto the sooty snow monday december first there was the intense yellow white lightthe sunlight of another world then subtly colors began to appear reds and pinks purples and blues kate felt herself drifting downward alice drawn by her own curiosity over the edge and down the rabbits hole how many times had she focused her microscope in on a slide tens of thousands perhaps even hundreds of thousands still every journey through the yellowwhite light began with the same sense of anticipation as had her first the colors darkened and coalesced into a mosaic of cells the cells of beverly vitales left ovary chemically fixed to prevent decay then embedded in a block of paraffin cut thin as a slick of oil and finally stained with dyes specific for coloring one or another structure within the cell pink for the cytoplasm mottled violet for the nuclei red for the cell walls with a deep breath calculated at once to relax herself and to heighten her concentration she focused the lenses and her thoughts on the cells now magnified a thousand times her efforts were less successful than usual thoughts of sandy and ellen of jared and the s discussion they had had following her return from the hospital the previous night continued to intrude she had come home late almost eleven after meeting with tom engleson interviewing beverly vitale examining the frozen section of her ovary and finally spending an hour in the hospital library her expectations had been to find the former roommates in the den comatose or nearly so with the essence of a half a case of lowenbrdu permeating the room instead she had found only a somber and perfectly sober jared hi he said simply hi yourself she kissed him on the forehead and then settled onto the ottoman by his chair when did sandy leave a couple of hours ago did you get done whatever it is you wanted to kate nodded his expression was as flat and as drained as his words no surprise she realized first his wife stalks out of the house with no real explanation then he has to listen to the agonies of the breakup of his best friends marriage i i guess i owe you an apology for the way i acted earlier some sort of explanation jared shrugged ill take the apology the explanations optional im sorry for leaving the way i did im sorry you left the way you did too i could have used some helpat least some moral support sorry again the three feet separating them might as well have been a canyon anything decided he went home to tell ellen and to move out i guess it got awful quiet here after you left neither of us was able to open up very well we each seemed to be wrapped up in our own bundle of problems three im sorries thats my limit she unsnapped her barrette shook her hair free and combed it out with her fingers the gesture was natural enough but at some level she knew she had done it because it was one jared liked after what happened this morningin the car i meani couldnt listen to sandy just brush off ellen and their marriage the way he did i mean here i am scrambling to do a decent job with my career and to be a reasonably satisfying friend and wife to you and theres ellen able to do both of those so easily and raise three beautiful talented children to boot and its not right what youre doing kate whats that youre comparing your insides to ellens outsides thats what she looks good ill give you that but dont go and cast sandy as the heavy just because hes the one moving out there are things that are missing from that relationship maybe things too big to overcome whats that got to do with our discussion this morning anyway jared you know perfectly well what it has to do having children is a major responsibility as it is i feel like a onearmed juggler half the time our lives our jobs the things we do on our own and together toss in a baby at this point and what guarantee is there i wont start dropping things what do you want me to say im almost forty years old im married i want to have children my wife said she wanted to have children too now all of a sudden having children is a threat to our marriage christ jared thats not what i mean and you know it i didnt say i wont have children i didnt say its a threat to our marriage all im trying to say is theres a lot to think aboutespecially with the opportunities that have arisen at the hospital its not the idea im having trouble with so much as the timing a mistake here and its a bitter unfulfilled woman or a neurotic insecure kid or or a twentysixyearold stewardess can you understand that i understand that somewhere inside you there are some issues youre not facing up to issues surrounding me or having children or both and youve got it all together right kate struggled to stop the tears that seemed to be welling from deep within her chest i know what i want well i dont okay and im the one whos going to have to pass up a chairmanship and go through a pregnancy and change my life so that i dont make the same horrible mistakes with our child that my mother made with us i jared im frightened it was she realized the first time she had truly recognized it hi frightened im perplexed how do you do you know you could use a little better sense of timing yourself okay folks here we go its time once again to play letsjumpall overeverythingjaredsays well please before you get rolling count me out im going to bed ill be in in a while dont wake me the section from beverly vitales left ovary was unlike any pathology kate had ever encountered the stromacells providing support and according to theory critical feminizing hormoneswere perfectly normal in appearance but the folliclesthe pockets of nutrient cells surrounding the ovawere selectively and completely destroyed replaced by the spindleshaped deep pink cells of sclerosisscarring assuming the pattern held true throughout both ovariesand there was no reeison to assume otherwisebeverly vitales reproductive potential was as close to zero as estimate would allow for nearly an hour kate sat there scanning section after section taking notes on a yellow legal pad why couldnt jared understand what it all really meant to her why couldnt he see what a godsend medicine had been to a life marked by aimlessness and a selfdoubt bordering on selfloathing my god woman if i didnt know better id swear you were a model the zeiss company had hired to plug their latest line of microscopes aha kate said melodramatically her eyes still fixed on the microscope a closet male chauvinist pig i expected as much all along dr willoughby she swung around and as always felt a warm jet of affection at the sight of her department head in his early sixties stan willoughby was egg bald save for a pure white monks fringe the pencilthin moustache partially obscured by his bulbous nose was a similar shade his eyes sparkled from beneath brows resembling endstage dandelions in all jareds likening him to the wise imp yoda was though inappropriate not inaccurate willoughby packed his pipe and straddled the stool across the table from kate the young lady on ashburton five he asked kate nodded this a good time for me to take a looksee although willoughbys primary area of interest was histochemistry thirtyfive years of experience had made him an expert in almost every phase of pathology every phase that is except how to administer a department willoughby was simply too passive too nice for the dogmaimdog world of hospital politics especially the freeforall for an adequate portion of a limited pool of funds stan i swear ive never seen or even heard of anything like this the chief peered into the student eyepieces on the teaching microscopea setup enabling two people to view the same specimen at the same time all right if i focus kate nodded ritualistically he went from low power magnification to intermediate to high and finally to thousandfold oilimmersion punctuating each maneuver with a hmm or an uh huh through the other set of oculars kate followed they looked so innocent those cells so deceptively innocent detached from their source and set out for viewing they were in one sense a work of art a delicate geometrically perfect montage that was the antithesis of the huge cluttered metal sculptures kate had built and displayed during her troubled mount holyoke years the irony in that thought was immense form follows function the essential law of structural design yet here were cells perfect in form produced by a biologic cataclysm tantamount to a volcano a virus a toxin an antibody suddenly transformed the art of pathology demanded that the cells and tissues though fixed and stained never be viewed as static did you send sections over to the electron microscopy unit willoughby asked not yet but i will and the young woman is bleeding as well platelets thirty thousand fibrinogen fifteen percent of normal all ouch yes ouch i spoke with her at some length last night no significant family history no serious diseases nonsmoker social drinker no meds none vitamins and iron but thats all no operations except an abortion at the omnicenter about five years ago the two continued to study the cells as they talked shes a cellist with the pops travel history europe china japan none to third world spots i told her how envious i was of people who could play music and she just smiled this wistful smile and said that every time she picked up her cello she felt as rich and fulfilled as she could ever want to feel i only talked to her for half an hour or so stan but i came away feeling like we were i dont know like we were friends spend a day here sometime jared come to work with me and see what i do how i do it the hematology people are talking autoimmune phenomenon they think the ovarian problem is longstanding a coincidental finding at this point never postulate two diseases when one will explain things willoughby restated the maxim he had long since engrained upon her i suppose theyre pouring in steroids stan shes in trouble real trouble ah yes forgive me sometimes i forget that theres more to this medicine business than just making a correct diagnosis thanks for not letting me get away with that kind of talk well doctor i think you may really have something here i have never encountered anything quite like it either neither had dr bartholomew that fossil he probably has trouble recognizing his own shoes in the morning talk about a menace aji by himself hes an epidemic no comment good i have enough comments for both of us listen kate do you mind if i try a couple of my new silver stains on this material the technique seems perfect for this type of pathology i was about to ask if you would willoughby engaged the intercom on the speakerphone system one of the few innovations he had managed to bring into the department sheila is that you no doctor willoughby its jane fonda of course its me you buzzed my office could you come into dr bennetts office please there was no response sheila are you still there its not what it sounds like dr willoughby she said finally not what what sounds like sheila kate cut in firmly its me were calling because we have a specimen wed like to try the silver stain on for a few moments there was silence i ill be over shortly the technician said willoughby turned to kate his thick brows presaging his question now what was that little ditty all about nothing really nothing kate that woman has worked for me for fifteen years maybe more shes cynical impertinent abrasive aggressive and at times as bossy as my wife but shes also the best and brightest technician ive ever known if theres trouble between the two of you perhaps id best know about it is it that study of the department i commissioned you and your eomputer friend sebastian to do its nothing stan i mean it like most people who are very good at what they do sheila has a lot of pride especially when it comes to her boss of fifteen years i know its not my place to decide but if its okay id like the chance to work through our differences without involving you okay willoughby hesitated and then shrugged and nodded thanks she said if i were ever to take over the chairmanship of the department id like to know i had a solid relationship with my chief technicianespecially if she were someone as invaluable as sheila pierce invaluable is right i keep giving her raises and bonuses even though she puts a knot in my ninny just about every time she opens her mouth say did i hear you just give me the green light to submit your name to reese i said if and you know it willoughby grinned mischievously your voice said if but your eyes you rang sheila pierce saved kate from a response fortyish with a trim efficient attractiveness she had kate knew earned both bachelors and masters degrees while working in the department by the time kate had begun her residence the onetime laboratory assistant had become chief pathology technician ah sheila willoughby said come in hi sheila kate hoped there was enough reassurance in her expression and her voice to keep the woman from any further outburst at least until they had a chance to talk privately their eyes locked for a fraction of a second then mercifully sheila returned the greeting the problem between them had as stan willoughby suspected arisen during kates computeraided study of the pathology departments budget and expenditures specifically in regard to a six hundred and fifty dollar payment for an educational meeting in miami that sheila could not document ever having attended kate had decided to drop the matter without involving the department chief but the technician was clearly unconvinced that she had done so hows my new batch of silver stain coming willoughby asked its much much thicker than the old stuff sheila said settling on a high stool equidistant from the two physicians fourteen hours may be too long to heat it i seem to recall your warning me about that when i suggested fourteen hours in the first place is it a total loss well actually i split about half of it off and cooked that part for only seven hours and and it looks fine perfect even willoughbys sigh of relief was pronounced do you know how much that stain costs to make how much you just saved me by t of course i know who do you think ordered the material in the first place the ghost of christmas past willoughby shot kate a whatdiditellyou glance then he picked up the slides and paraffin blocks containing tissue from beverly vitales ovary dr bennett has an interesting problem here that i think might be well suited to my silver stain do you think you could make some sections and try it out your command is my command pierce said bowing give me an hour and your stain will be ready she turned to kate dr bennett i think you should have a little review session with our chief here on the basics of hypertension on his desk right next to his blood pressure pills is a halfeaten bag of doritos bye now sheila pierce dropped off the paraffin block in histology and then returned to her office on her desk was the stain willoughby had referred to as his pierce laughed disdainfully if it werent for her the stain that was soon to be known by his name would be little more than an expensive beaker of shit there they sat she thought willoughby and that goddamn bennett sharing their little physician jokes and performing their physician mental masturbations and issuing orders to a woman with an iqa proven iqhigher than either of theirs could possibly be onefifty thats what her mother said genius level one hundred and fucking fifty so where was the md degree that would have put her where she deserved to be pierce glared at the small framed photo of her parents carefully placed to one side of her desk then her expression softened it wasnt their fault being poor just their fate they didnt want the stroke or the cancer that had forced their daughter to shelve her dreams and begin a life of taking orders from privileged brats who more often than not couldnt come close to her intellectual capacity one hundred and fifty what was kate bennett oneten onetwenty tops yet there she was with the degree and the power and the future listen sheila youre terrific at your job i dont see that theres anything to gain by bringing this up to dr willoughby or even by making you reimburse the depailment but never again okay patronizing bitch whos a bitch startled sheila whirled norton reese stood propped against the doorjamb eyeing her curiously jesus you scared me whos a bitch reese checked the corridor in both directions then stepped inside and closed the door behind him bennett thats who ah yes whats our little rebecca of sunnybrook farm up to now oh nothing new its that damn american society meeting miami yes the time you assured me there was no way anyone would ever find out i didnt go she is a resourceful cunt reese mumbled ill say that for her what didnt she say she was going to do her girl scout good deed for the month and let the whole matter drop thats what she said but she and dr willoughby are like that sheila held up crossed fingers either shes already told him or shes going to hold the thing over my head forever either way she shook her head angrily easy baby easy reese said crossing to her and slipping his hands beneath her lab coat sheila grimaced but allowed herself to be embraced balding moderately overweight and wedded to threepiece suits reese had never held sex appeal for her in any visceral sense still he was the administrator of the entire hospital complex and time and experience had taught her that true sex appeal was based not so much on what a man could do to her as for her you have the most beautiful tits of any woman ive ever known reese whispered baby do you know how long its been she blocked his move toward her breasts with an outstretched hand its not my fault norty im divorced youre the one with all the family commitments remember reese gauged the determination in her eyes and decided against another advance so he said settling into the chair by her desk wonder woman has been at it again huh well believe it or not shes the reasonone of the reasonsi came down here oh maybe youd better sit down reese motioned her to her chair and then waited until she had complied did you know that old willoughby has decided to resign no no i didnt actually she felt some hurt that reese had been told of the decision before she was hes giving health as a reason but i think the old goat just cant cut it anymore never could really sheila shot him a look warning against any further deprecation of the man she had worked under for fifteen years thats too bad she murmured yeah well baby hang onto your seat you dont know what bad is for his successor your willoughby wants to recommend one k bennett md sheila fought a sudden urge to be sick for years she had in effect run the pathology department using willoughby for little more than his signature on purchase orders and personnel decisions with bennett as chief she would be lucky to keep her job much less her power and influence you said wants to recommend she managed bennett refuses to give him the goahead until shes talked it over with her husband she picked a tiny smurf doctor doll off her desk and absently twisted its arm how do you feel about it she asked after what she did last year writing what amounted to a letter of complaint about me to the board how do you think i feel so the blue rubber arm snapped off in sheilas hand i wont have that woman heading a department in my hospital and thats that what can you do the forcefulness in reeses voice softened there at least for the moment is the rub ive started talking to some of the members of the board of trustees and some of the department heads it turns out that as things stand she would have no trouble getting approval it seems only a few beside me he smiled conspiratorially and now you know what an incredible pain in the ass she is sheila flipped the arm and then the body of the doll into the trash so we both know she said baby i need something on her anything that i can use to influence some people the prospect of dealing with bennetts crusades month after month is more than i can take keep your eyes and ears open dig around theres got to be something if i do find something sheila said ill expect you to be grateful ill be very grateful good sheila said sweetly then we shall see what we shall see she rose and kissed him on the forehead her breasts inches from his eyes very grateful she whispered now dont you forget that she backed away at the moment reese reached for her next time norty right now ive got work to do the braxton building was more impressive as an address than it was as a structure at one time the twentyeight story granite obelisk had been the centerpiece of bostons downtown financial district now surrounded by highrise glass and steel the building seemed somehow iu at ease no uninformed passerby could possibly have predicted from the buildings exterior the opulence of the lobby and office suites within especially the grandeur of the twentyeighth floor most elegant of the three floors occupied by the law firm of mintonsamuels j winfield samuels selected a havanamade panatella from a crystal humidor and offered it to his son jared seated to one side of the huge inlaid louis quatorze desk groaned dad its not even eleven oclock didnt dr whatshisface limit the number youre supposed to smoke in a day i pay shrigley to fix me up so i can do whatever the hell i want to do not to tell me how many cigars i can smoke he snipped the tip with a bonehandled trimmer and lit it from the smokestack of a sterling silver replica of the qe i swear if castro had found a way to keep these little beauties from making it to the states i would have found a way to cancel the bastards ticket years ago think of it wed probably have world peace by now because of a cigar he took a long loving draw blew half of it out inhaled the rest and gazed out the floortoceiling window at the harbor and the airport beyond jared sipped at his mug of coffee and risked a glance at his watch win samuels had summoned him and win samuels would tell him why when win samuels was good and ready to do so that was the way it had always been between them and for all jared knew that was the way jared winfield samuels sr had related to win the notion left a bitter aftertaste beyond his grandfather the family had been traced through a dozen or more generations three centuries and three continents not that he really cared about such things his years of rebellion in vermont had certainly demonstrated that but now with the possibility that he represented the end of the line he was more aware so hows kate the older samuels was still looking out the window when he spoke shes okay a little harried at work but okay it was unwise jared had learned over the years to offer his father any more information than asked for at seventy the man was still as sharp as anyone in the game what he wanted to know he would ask and how are the negotiations coming with the union people at granfield fine almost over i think were meeting with them this afternoon if that idiot shop steward can understand the pension package weve put together the whole mess should get resolved with no more work stoppage i knew you could do it i told toby granfield you could do it well like i said its not over yet but it will be the words were an order not a question yes jared said it will be excellent excellent how about a little vacation for you and kate when everything is signed and sealed goodness knows you deserve it those union thugs are slow but theyre tough bert hodges says his place in aruba is available the week after next suppose we book it for you i dont what i mean is ill have to talk with kate shes got quite a bit going on at the hospital i know win samuels swung around slowly to face his son at six feet he was nearly as tall as jared and no more than five pounds heavier his rimless spectacles and discreetly darkened hair neutralized the aging effects of deep crows feet and a slightly sallow complexion what i said that i knew she was having a busy time of it at the hospital samuels paused perhaps for dramatic effect norton reese called me this morning oh the statement was upsetting for five years jared had handled all of boston metros legal affairs there was no reason for norton reese to be dealing directly with his father even allowing that the two of them had known each other for years he tells me the head of pathology is retiring jared nodded that the information was not news he also said that this head pathologist willoughby wants kate to take over for him she mentioned that to me jared understated did she now good im glad you two communicate about such minor goings on the facetiousness in samuelss voice was hardly subtle kates independence had been a source of discussion between them on more than one occasion somewhere in the drawer of that louis quatorze desk was a computer printout showing that while he had received fortynine percent of the total vote cast in the congressional race he had garnered only fortytwo percent of the womens vote to win samuels the numbers meant that if mrs jared samuels had been out stumping for her husband instead of mucking about elbow deep in a bunch of cadavers jared would be packing to leave for washington selfserving contrary disloyal thoughtlessthe adjectives had from time to time flown hot and heavy from the old man though never in kates presence toward her he had always been as cordial and charming as could be look dad jared said ive still got some preparation to do for that session at granfield do you think donna samuels said through the intercom could you bring in another tea for me and another coffee for my son please jared sank back in his seat and stared helplessly at the far wall a wall covered with photographs of politicians athletes and other celebrities arm in arm or hand in hand with his father a few of them were similar shots featuring his grandfather and one of them was an eight by ten of jared and the president taken at a threeminute meeting arranged by his father for just that purpose with a discreet knock samuelss sensuous receptionist entered and set their beverages and a basket of croissants on a mahogany stand near the desk her smile in response to jareds thank you was vacanta subtle message that her allegiance was to the man on the power side of the louis quatorze so samuels said settling down with a mug of tea in one hand and his havana in the other what do you think of this business at metro i havent given it much thought jared tied as far as i know nothing formal has been done yet well id suggest you start thinking about it what norton reese doesnt want kate to have that position and frankly neither do i he thinks shes too young and too inexperienced he tells me that if she gets the appointment which incidentally is doubtful anyhow shell run herself ragged burn out and finally get chewed to ribbons by the politicians and the other department heads according to him kate just doesnt understand the way the game is playedthat there are some toes that are simply not to be stepped on like his jared snapped jared you told me that the two of you were planning on starting your family does kate think she can do that and run a department too what about her obligation to you and your career its bad enough shes married to you and doesnt even have your name christ her looks alone would be worth thousands of votes to you if shed just plunk her face in front of a camera a few times add a little baby to that and i swear you could make a run for the senate and win kates business is kates business jared said with neither enthusiasm nor conviction take her to the caribbean have a talk with her samuels reasoned calmly help her see that marriage is a series of compromises give and take okay ill try good kate should see where her obligations and her loyalties lie ross mattingly may be on a downhill slide but he still managed to hang on and win the election dont think hes going to roll over and play dead next time the fewer liabilities we have the better and frankly the way things stand kate is a minus have i made my thoughts clear clear jared felt totally depleted fine let me know when the granfield business is done and also let me know the date you two decide on so i can tell bert hodges with a nod winfield samuels signaled the meeting over in his seagreen scrub suit and kneelength white coat tom engleson might have been the earnest young resident on a daytime soap opera loving his way through the nurses one moment stamping out disease the next but his eyes gave him away kate saw the immense fatigue in them the moment she entered the residents office on the fourth floor of the building renovated by the ashburton foundation and renamed in memory of sylvia ashburton it was a fatigue that went deeper than the circles of gray enveloping them deeper than the fine streaks of red throughout their sclerae been to sleep at all kate asked glancing at the clock as she set two tinfoil pans of salad on the coffee table it was twenty minutes of two engleson merely shook his head and began to work off the plastic cover of his salad with a dexterity that was obviously far from what it had been when he had started his shift thirty and a half hours before studying the mans face kate wondered how residency programs could justify the ridiculous hours they required especially of surgical trainees it was as if one generation of doctors was saying to the next we had to do it this way and we came out all right didnt we meanwhile year after year a cardiogram was misread here an operation fumbled there never a rash of problems just isolated incidents at one hospital then another one program then anotherincidents of no lasting consequence except of course to the patients and families involved i hope you like blue cheese kate said gianettis has great vinaigrette too i just guessed its fine perfect dr samuels engleson said between bites ive missed a meal or two since this vitale thing started yesterday morning eat away you can have some of mine if you want im not too hungry and its xate we pathologists have a little trouble with formality engleson his mouth engaged with another forkful of salad nodded his acknowledgment sorry i missed you when i was here last evening the nurse said you were in the delivery room a set of twins hows beverly vitale her blood counts down this morning twentyfive shes due for a recheck in an hour or two any further drop and well give her more blood her gi tract kate asked speculating on the site of blood loss probably theres been some blood in every stool weve checked shes on steroids you know i do know withhold steroids and her antibodies run wild destroying her own clotting factors use them and she risks developing bleeding ulcers its one of those situations that makes me grateful i decided on pathology stan willoughby and i reviewed the ovary sections this morning his impression is that the findings are unique hes doing some special stains now and has sent slides to a colleague of his at johns hopkins whom he says is as good as anyone in the business at diagnosing ovarian disorders he also is calling around town to see if anything like this has turned up in another department etiology no clues tom virus toxin med reaction all of the above none of the above a and b but not c she told you she wasnt on any meds right none except vitamins the multivitamin plus iron we dispense through the omnicenter well im living proof those dont cause any problems ive taken them for a couple of years make frail pathologist strong like bull kate flexed her biceps make pathologist excellent teacher too why thank you kates green eyes sparkled thank you very much tom for a moment she saw him blush how about we go say hello to beverly id like to make extra sure about one or two aspects of her history here you can stick this salad in that refrigerator for later provided the bacteria who call that icebox home dont eat it first tom said the two were heading down the hall toward the stairway when the overhead page snapped to life code ninetynine ashburton fiveohtwo code ninetynine ashburton fiveohtwo oh jesus tom was already racing toward the exit as he spoke kate was slower to react she was almost to the stairway door before she realized that ashburton was beverly vitales room it had been a year perhaps two since kate had last observed a cardiac arrest and resuscitation attempt she was certified in advanced cardiac life support but training and testing then had been on resusciannie a mannequin her practical experience had ended years ago along with her internship at the moment however none of those considerations mattered what mattered was the life of a young woman who loved to make music with an athletes quickness kate bolted after tom engleson up the stairs from ashburton four to ashburton five there were more than enough participants in the code residents nurses medical students and technicians filled room and overflowed into the hall kate worked her way to a spot by the door from which she watched the nightmare of beverly vitales final minutes of life it was a gastric hemorrhage almost certainly from an ulcer eroding into an artery the womans relentless exsanguination was being complicated by the aspiration of vomited blood cloaked in abysmal helplessness kate witnessed tom engleson desperation etched on his face issuing orders in a deceptively composed tone the organized chaos of the whiteclad code team pumping injecting monitoring reporting respirating suctioning and through the milling bodies the expressionless bloodsmeared face of beverly vitale for nearly an hour the struggle continued though there was never a pulse or even an encouraging electrocardiographic pattern in the end there was nothing but another lesson in the relative impotence of people and medicine when matched against the capriciousness of illness and death tom engleson his eyes dark and sunken shook his head in utter futility its over he said softly thank you all its over simultaneously with hearing the report from the weei traffic helicopter of a monumental backup stemming from the mystictobin bridge kate became part of it commuting to the city from the north shore was an experience that she suspected ranked in pleasantness somewhere between an irs audit and root canal work although tuesday was normally a lowvolume day this morning she had encountered rain sleet snow and even a bizarre stretch of sunlight during her thirtymile drive far too much weather for even boston drivers to attack with a groan she resigned herself to being half an hour late perhaps more for the appointment stan willoughby had arranged for her at white memorial hospital the pathology chiefs call had punctuated another confusing bittersweet morning with jared it seemed as if the intensity and caring in their relationship was waxing and waning not only from day to day but from hour to hour or even from minute to minute in one sentence the man was jared samuels the funny sensitive often ingenuous fellow she had married and still loved deeply in the next he was calculating and distant a miniature of his father intransigent on points they should have been working through as husband and wife at last after an awkward hour of lighting brush fires of dissension and then scurrying to stamp them out jared had suggested a week or ten days together in aruba away from the pressures and demands of their careers what do you say boots he had asked calling on the pet name she favored most of the four or five he used aruba you all over the expression in his eyesurgency fear belied his levity aruba you too jared she had said finally then we go if stan can give me the time off and if you can stand the thought of trying to hang onto a woman swathe in coppertone we go at that moment jared looked reborn grumpertogrumper stallandcrawl traffic headed in a snail trail toward the bridge thanks to a fender bender in the lefthand lane the eyeinthesky was sparing none of his cliches in describing the mess on route south kate inched her volvo between cars but gained little ground finally resigned to the situation she settled back turned up the volume on the allnews station and concentrated on ignoring the wouldbe lothario who was winking and waving at her from the transam in the next lane the news like stan willoughbys call dealt with the sudden death of red sox hero bobby geary a homegrown boy who had played his sandlot ball in south boston not a mile from the luxurious condominium where he was found by his mother following an apparent heart attack stans name was mentioned several times as the medical examiner assigned to autopsy the man who had given away thousands of free tickets and had added an entire floor to childrens and infants hospital in the name of the kids of boston kate willoughby had begun i hope im not interrupting anything no no just getting ready for work she had said smiling at jared who was nude by the bathroom door dancing a coarse hula and beckoning her to the shower with a longhandled scrub brush well i dont want you to come to work what i want you to go to white memorial you have an appointment in the pathology department there at eightthirty leon olesky will be waiting for you do you know him only by name well i called around town trying to see if anyone had seen a case similar to our miss vitales initially there was nothing but late last night leon called me at home from what he described the two cases his and ourssound identical i told him youd be over to study his material how old was the woman kate had asked excitedly i dont remember what he said twentyeight i think im cause of death ah ha i thought youd never ask cerebral hemorrhage secondary to minor head trauma platelets fibrinogen her hand was white around the receiver leon didnt know the case was handled by one of his underlings he said hed try to find out by the time you got there cant you come hell no havent you heard the news about bobby geary the ball player heart attack late last night found dead in bed im posting him at tenthirty in fact id like you back here before i finish just in case i need your help youve got it you know you are a pretty terrific chief stanley are you sure you want to retire yesterday if i could arrange it kateygirl you hurry on back to metro after you see olesky now no telling what this shriveled brain of mine might miss white memorial hospital an architectural polyglot of more than a score of buildings was the flagship of the fleet of harvard medical school affiliated hospitals overlooking the charles river near the north end wmh had more research facilities professors grants and administrative expertise than any hospital in the area if not the world metropolitan hospital had once held sway reportedly supplying ninety percent of all the professors of medicine at all the medical schools in the country but that time had long since been buried beneath an avalanche of incompetent administrators unfavorable publicity and corrupt city politicians although metro had made a resurgence of sorts under the guidance of norton reese there was little likelihood of its ever recapturing the prestige endowments and fierce patient loyalty of the glory days when at least one man was known to have had take me to metro tattooed across his chest it had been some time since kate had had reason to visit the pathology unit at white memorial and she was uncomfortably impressed with the improvements and expansion that had occurred equipment her department congratulated itself on acquiring this unit possessed in duplicate or triplicate corridors and offices were brightly lit with plants paintings and other touches that made the work environment less tedious and oppressive almost subconsciously kate found herself making mental lists of things she would press to accomplish as chief of pathology at metro leon olesky a mild lincolnesque man brushed off her apologies for her tardiness and after exchanging compliments about stan willoughby left her alone in his office with the material from the autopsy of ginger rittenhouse on a pink piece of paper by his elegant microscope were the data on the womans blood studies only two of many parameters measured were abnormal fibrinogen and platelets the levels of each were depressed enough to have been life threatening her hands trembling with anticipation kate took the first of the ovarian sections and slid it onto the stage of the microscope a moment to flex tension from the muscles in her neck and she leaned forward to begin another journey through the yellowwhite light fortyfive minutes later the one had become three leon olesky hunched over one set of oculars of the teaching microscope controlling the focus with his right hand and moving the slide with his left across from him in the seat kate had occupied was tom engleson you know olesky said if stan hadnt called me about your case the findings on our young woman would have slipped right past us i mentioned the matter last night at our weekly department conference but no one responded an hour later dr hickman came to my office young bruce is perhaps the brightest of our residents but at times im afraid a bit too quick for his own good kate sighed oleskys observations described many of the socalled hotshot residents she had worked with over the years ill take methodical over genius any day of the week she said both is best olesky responded but thats a rare combination indeed i might mention though that it is a combination your mentor feels he is lucky to have found in you methodical yes kate allowed but ive yet to receive a single membership application from mensa shes only the best in the hospital tom interjected somewhat impetuously finish telling us about your resident kate withheld reaction to englesons enthusiasm sensing that what she felt was in equal parts flattered and embarrassed well it seems our dr hickman was uncertain about the pathology he was seeing in this womans ovaries however rather than think that the finding might be unique he assumed although he wont say so in as many words that the condition was one he should have known about and hence one he would look foolish asking for help with since the cause of death was unrelated to the ovaries he chose to describe his findings in the autopsy report and leave it at that no harm done kate said quite the contrary in fact this event may be the pinprick hickmans ego needs so he can reach his full potential as a physician it will make even more of an impression if as dr willoughby and now yours truly suspect this pathology turns out to be one never before described kate and tom exchanged excited glances how would you explain its showing up in two women in the same city at about the same time she asked the professors eyes dark and deeply serious met first englesons and then kates considering the outcome of the illness in both individuals i would suggest that we work diligently to find an answer to that question at the moment i have none there must be a connection engleson said i hope there is young man olesky rose from his stool and i hope the two of you will be able to find it i have a class to teach right now at the medical school this evening i leave for meetings in san diego and from there i go to the wedding of my son in new mexico my office and our department are at your disposal thank you they said olesky replaced his lab coat with a wellworn mackintosh he shook hands first with engleson and then with kate a final check of his desk and he shambled from the office kate waited for the door to click shut im glad you were able to get here so quickly she said did you have any trouble getting the records people to let you take beverlys chart out of the hospital none i just followed englesons first law of chutzpah the more one looks like he should be doing what hes doing the less anyone realizes that he shouldnt ill have to admit that the crooks with moving vans and uniforms who pick entire houses clean thought of the law before i did but i was the first one i know to put it in words are you okay i went to find you after the code was over yesterday but you were gone before i could call i was rushed to the or to do an emergency csection i was okay she paused actually i wasnt it hurt like hell to see her lying there like that i cant remember the last time i felt so helpless at the thought the mention of the word arthur everetts grotesque face flashed in her mind his reddened eyes bulging with the effort of forcing himself inside her yes i do she thought i do remember when how about you she asked engleson shrugged i think im still numb its like im afraid that if i let down and acknowledge my feelings about her and what happened ill never set foot in a hospital again kate nodded her understanding you know tom contrary to popuiar belief being human doesnt disqualify you from being a doctor are you married engleson shook his head i think its hard to face some of the things we have to face and then have no one to talk them out with to cry on if necessary when we get home she thought about the difficult morning with jared and smiled inwardly at the irony of her words had you known beverly outside the hospital no i met her when she came into metro but i thought about trying to start up a relationship as soon as she his voice grew husky he cleared his throat i understand kate said look maybe we can talk about our work and our lives in medicine some day soon right now weve got to start looking for some common threads between these women im due back at metro in she checked her watch shoot ive only got about twenty minutes tom was thumbing through the thin sheaf of papers dealing with ginger rittenhouse it shouldnt take long to check they have next to no information here ginger louise rittenhouse twentyeight elementary school teacher lived and worked in cambridge but she was running along the boston side of the river when she collapsed apparently she lived long enough to get an emergency cat scan but not long enough to get to the or married kate asked no single thats the second time youve asked that question about someone in the last two minutes he narrowed one eye and fingered his moustache you have perhaps a marriage fixation kate smiled lets leave my fixations out of this at least for the time being okay what about family place of birth next of kin did they document any prior medical history hey slow down we obstetricians are hardly famous for our swift reading ability no known medical history next of kin is a brother in seattle heres his address you know worlds greatest hospital or not they take a pretty skimpy history it doesnt look like they had time for much more kate said solemnly there had to be a connection she was thinking the two cases were at once too remarkable and too similar somewhere the lives of a teacher from cambridge and a cellist from a suburb on the far side of boston had crossed wait engleson said she had a roommate it says here on the accident floor sheet sandra tucker that must be how they found out about her family kate again checked her watch tom ive got to go i promised dr willoughby id help out with the post on bobby geary do you think you could try and get a hold of this sandra tucker see if our woman has seen a doctor recently or had a blood test dont teachers need yearly physicals or something not the ones i had i think their average age was deceased are you going to call from here engleson thought for a moment and then nodded fine give me a ring when you get back to metro and tom thanks for the compliment you paid me before she reached out and shook his hand firmly and in a businesslike manner then she left with the pistolshot crack of bat against ball thirty thousand heads snapped in horror toward the fence in right center field jesus katey its gone was all jared could say the ball a white star arced into the blueblack summer night sky on the base paths four runners dashed around toward home there were two out in the running the ninth running the scoreboard at the base of the left field wall in fenway park said that the red sox were ahead of the yankees by three runs but that lead it appeared had only seconds more to be kate enthralled by the lights and the colors and the precision of her first live baseball game stood frozen with the rest her eyes fixed on the ball now in a lazy descent toward a spot beyond the fence then into the corner of her field of vision he came running with an antelope grace that made his movements seem almost slow motion he left the ground an improbable distance from the fence his gloved left hand reaching it seemed beyond its limits up to the top of the barrier and over it for an instant ball and glove disappeared beyond the fence in the next instant they were together clutched to the chest of bobby geary as he tumbled down onto the dirt warning track to the roar of thirty thousand voices it was a moment kate would remember for the rest of her life this too was such a moment the body that had once held the spirit and abilities of bobby geary lay on the steel table before her stripped of the indefinable force that had allowed it to sense and react so remarkably to one side in a shallow metal pan was the athletes heart carefully sliced along several planes to expose the muscle of the two ventriclesthe pumping chambersand the three main coronary arteriesleft right and circumflex images of that night at fenway more than four years ago intruded on kates objectivity and brought with them a wistfulness that she knew had no place in this facet of her work nothing in the heart at all she asked for the second time stan willoughby leprechaunish in green scrubs and a black rubber apron shook his head must a bin somethin he et he said by way of admitting that anatomically at least he had uncovered no explanation for the pulmonary edema fluid that had filled bobby gearys lungs and essentially drowned him from within kate clad identically to her chief examined the heart under a highiotensity light teenage heart in a thirtysixyearold man i remember reading somewhere that he intended to keep playing until he was fifty this heart says he might have made it this edema says no way willoughby corrected im inclined to think dysrhythmia and cardiac arrest on that basis preliminary blood tests are all normal so i think it possible we may never know the specific cause there was disappointment in his voice sometimes we just dont kate said the words were willoughbys a lesson he had repeated many times to her over the years willoughby glared at her for a moment then he laughed out loud you are a saucy pup flipping my words back at me like that suppose you tell me what to say to the police lieutenant drinking coffee and dropping donut crumbs right now in my office or to the gaggle of reporters in the lobby waiting for the ultimate word ladies and gentlemen the ultimate word from the crack pathology department you help support with your taxes is that we are absolutely certain we have no idea why bobby geary went into a pulmonary edema and died kate did not answer she had grabbed a magnifying glass and was intently examining gearys feet especially between his toes and along the inside of his ankles stan look she said all along here tiny puncture marks almost invisible there must be a dozen of them no wait there are more willoughby adjusted the light and took the magnifier from her holy potato he said softly bobby geary an addict he stepped back from the table and looked at kate who could only shrug if he was he was a bloomin artist with a needle a twentyseven or twentynine gauge would make punctures about that size and a narcotics or amphetamine overdose would explain the pulmonary edema kate nodded holy potato willoughby said again if its true there must be evidence somewhere in his house unless it happened with other people around and they brought him home and put him to bed why dont we send some blood for a drug screen and do levels on any substance we pick up willoughby glanced around the autopsy suite the single technician on duty was too far away to have heard any of their conversation what do you say we label the tube smith or schultz or something im no sports fan but i know enough to see whats at stake here the man was a hero what about the policeman his names detective finn and he is a fan i think hed prefer some kind of story about a heart attack even if the blood test is positive schultz sounds like as good a name as any kate said are these the tubes good ill have new labels made up ill send finn over to the boys place and then ill tell the newsnoses they will just have to wait until the microscopics are processed now when can you give me a report on the goings on at the wmht well beyond what ive already told you theres not much to report weve got some sort of ovarian microsclerosis in two women with profound deficiencies of both platelets and fibrinogen at this point we have no connections between the two nothing even to tell us for sure that the ovarian and blood problems are related so whats next next well tom engleson the resident who was involved with beverly vitale is trying to get some information from the roommate of the wmh woman and thou kate held her hands to either side palms up no plan im on surgicals this month so ive got a few of those to read along with a frozen or two from the or after that i thought id talk to my friend marco sebastian and see if that computer of his can locate data on a woman named ginger rittenhouse sounds good willoughby said keep me posted he seemed reluctant to leave is there anything else kate asked finally well actually there is one small matter all right let me have it kate knew what was coming i um have a meeting scheduled with norton reese this afternoon several members of the search committee are supposed to be there and well i sort of wondered if youd had time to willoughby allowed the rest of the thought to remain unspoken kates eyes narrowed he had promised her a week and it had been only a few days she wasnt at all ready to answer there were other factors to consider besides merely want to or dont want to willoughby had to understand that ive decided that if you really think i can do it and you can get all those who have to agree to do so then ill take the position she heard her voice say the girls name was robyn smithers she was a high school junior assigned by roxbury vocational to spend four hours each week working as an extern in the pathology department of metropolitan hospital her role was simply defined do what she was told and ask questions only when it was absolutely clear that she was interrupting no one she was one of twelve such students negotiated for by norton reese and paid for by the boston school department that these students learned little except how to run errands was of no concern to reese who had already purchased a new word processor for his office with the receipts from having them robyn had made several passes by sheila pierces open door before she stopped and knocked yes robyn what can i do for you miss pierce im sorry for botherin you really i am its fine robyn i was beginning to wonder what you were up to walking back and forth out there well maam its this blood doctor bennett you know the lady doctor yes i know what about her well dr bennett gave me this here blood to take to she consulted a scrap of paper special chemistries only i cant find where that is im sorry to bother you while youre working and all nonsense child here let me see what youve got casually sheila glanced at the pale blue requisition form the patients name john schultz meant nothing to her that in itself was unusual she made it her business to know the names of all those being autopsied in her department however she acknowledged occasionally one was scheduled without her being notified in the space marked patients hospital number the departments billing number was written the request was for a screen for drugs of abuse penned along the margin of the requisition was the order stat phone results to dr k bennett asap curiouser and curiouser sheila muttered pardon maam oh nothing dear listen youve been turning the wrong way at that corridor back there come ill show you she handed back the vials and the requisition and then guided the girl to the door of her office there she said sweetly just turn right there and go all the way down until you see a cloudyglass door like mine with special chemistries written on it okay yes thank you maam robyn smithers raced down the corridor glad to help you dumb little shit sheila listened until she heard the door to special chemistries open and close then she went to her phone and dialed the cubicle of marvin grimes grimes was the departments deiner the preparer of bodies for autopsy it was a position he had held for as long as anyone could remember marvin sheila asked could you tell me the names of the cases we autopsied today jes two ms pierce the old lady partridge n the ball player no one named schultz sheila pictured the bottle of wild irish rose grimes kept in the lower righthand drawer of his desk she wondered if by the end of the day the old man would even remember talking to her no siree no schultz today yesterday wait now let me check nope only mcdonald lacey briggs and ca capez capezio no one named what did you say the name was never mind marvin dont worry about it as she replaced the receiver sheila tried to estimate the time it would take the technicians in special chemistries to complete a stat screen for drugs of abuse curiouser and curiouser and curiouser she said the dozen or so buildings at metropolitan hospital were connected by a series of tunnels so tortuous and poorly lit that the hospital had recommended that its employees avoid them if walking alone several assaults and the crash of a laundry train into a patients stretcher only enhanced the grisly reputation of the tunnel as did the now classic harvard medical school senior show rats kate unmindful of the legends and tales had used the tunnels freely since her medical student days and except for once coming upon the hoursold corpse of a drunk nestled peacefully in a small concrete alcove by his halfempty bottle of thunderbird she had encountered little to add to the lore the single greatest threat she faced each time she traveled underground from one building to another was that of getting lost by forgetting a twist or a turn or by missing the crack shaped like italy that signaled to her the turnoff to the administration building at various times over the years she had headed for the surgical building and ended up in the massive boiler room or headed for a conference in the amphitheater only to dead end at the huge steam pressers of the laundry building concentrating on not overlooking the landmarks and grimedimmed signs kate made her way through the beigepainted maze toward the computer suite and marco sebastian nurses in twos and threes passed by in each direction heralding the approach of the three oclock change in shift kate wondered how many thousands of nurses had over the years walked these tunnels on the way to their charges the metro tradition nurses professors of surgery medical school deans country practitioners even nobel laureates now in her own way and through her own abilities she was becoming part of that tradition jared had to know how important that was to her she had shared with him the ugly secrets of her prior marriage and stifling often futile life surely he knew what all this meant in typically efficient metro fashion the computer facilities were situated on the top floor of the pediatrics building as far as possible from the administrative offices that used them the most kate paused by the elevator and thought about tackling the six flights of stairs instead the day not yet nearly over had her feeling at once exhausted and exhilarated three difficult surgical cases had followed the geary autopsy just as she was completing the last of them a special chemistries technician had dropped off the results of gearys blood test the amphetamine level in his body was enormous quite enough to have thrown him into pulmonary edema before she could call stan willoughby with the results she was summoned to his office the meeting there with willoughby and the detective martin finn had been brief evidence found on a careful search of bobby gearys condominium had yielded strong evidence that the man was a heavy amphetamine user it was information known only to the three of them finn was adamantbarring any findings suggesting that gearys death was not an accidental overdose there seemed little to be gained and much to be lost by making the revelation public the official story would be of a heart attack secondary to an anomaly of one coronary artery the elevator arrived at the moment kate had decided on the stairs ism she changed her mind in time to slip between the closing doors marco sebastian expansive in his white lab coat and as jovial as ever met her with a bear hug she had been a favorite of his since their first meeting nearly seven years before in fact he and his wife had once made a concerted effort to fix her up with his brotherinlaw a caterer from east boston after a rapidfire series of questions to bring himself up to date on jared the job willoughby and the results of their collaborative study the engineer led her into his office and sat her down next to him facing the terminal display screen on his desk now then dr bennett he said in a voice with the deep smoothness of an operatic baritone what tidbits can i resurrect for you this time from the depths of our electronic jungle do you wish the hat size of our first chief of medicine we have it the number of syringes syringed in the last calendar year can do the number of warts on the derriere of our esteemed administrator you have merely to ask actually marco i wasnt after anything nearly so exotic just a name the first baby born here was he punched a set of keys and then another jessica peerless february eighteenth eighteen fortythree marco that wasnt the name i had in mind how about the two hundredth appendectomy nope the twentyeight past directors of nursing uhuh im sorry marco all this data and nobody wants any of it the man was genuinely crestfallen i keep telling our beloved administrator that we are being underused but i dont think he has the imagination to know what questions to ask periodically i send him tables showing that the cafeteria is overspending on pasta or that ten percent of our patients have ninety percent of our serious diseases just to pique his interest remind him that were still here my name oh yes im sorry its been a little slow here i guess you can tell that its rittenhouse ginger rittenhouse heres her address birthplace and birthdate thats all i have i need to know if shes ever been a patient of this hospital in or out keep your eyes on the screen sebastian said dramatically thirty seconds later he shook his head nada a shirley rittenhouse in nineteen fiftysix but no others are you sure sebastian gave her a look that might have been anticipated from a judge who had been asked do you really think your decision is fair sorry she said of course she still could have been a patient of the omnicenter kate stiffened what do you mean well the omnicenter is sort of a separate entity from the rest of metro this system here handles records and billing for the ashburton inpatient service but the omnicenter is totally selfcontained has been since the day they put the units inwhat is it nine ten years ago isnt that strange strange is normal around this place sebastian said cant you even plug this system into the one over there nope dont know the access codes carl horner the engineer who runs the electronics there plays things pretty close to the vest you know horner no i dont think so kate tried to remember if during any of her visits to the omnicenter as a patient she had even seen the man why do you suppose theyre so secretive not secretive so much as careful i play around with numbers here horner and the omnicenter people live and die by them every bit of that place is computerized records appointments billing even the prescriptions i know i go there for my own care then you can imagine what would happen if even a small fly got dropped into their ointment homer is a genius let me tell you but he is a bit eccentric he was writing advanced programs when the rest of us were still trying to spell ibm from what ive heard complete independence from the rest of the system is one of the conditions he insisted upon before taking the omnicenter job in the first place so how do i find out if ginger rittenhouse has ever been a patient there its important marco maybe very important well paleolithic as it may sound we call and ask the phone marco sebastian shrugged sheepishly and nodded dead end alone in her office kate doodled the words on a yellow legal pad first in block print then in script and finally in a variety of calligraphies learned through one of several selfenrichment courses she had taken during her two years with art according to carl horner marco sebastians counterpart at the omnicenter ginger rittenhouse had never been a patient there tom engleson had succeeded in contacting the womans roommate but her acquaintance and living arrangement with giilger were recent ones aside from a prior address engleson had gleaned no new information connections thus far between the woman and beverly vitale zero outside the daylong dusting of snow had given way to thick wet flakes that were beginning to cover the homeward commute was going to be a bear kate tried to ignore the prospect and reflect instead on what her next move might be in evaluating the microsclerosis cases perhaps an attempt to find a friend or family member who knew ginger rittenhouse better than her new roommate she might present the two womens pathologies at a regional conference of some sort hoping to luck into yet a third case she looked at the uncompleted work on her desk face it she realized with the amount of spare time she had to run around playing epidemiologist the mystery of the ovarian microsclerosis seemed destined to remain just that for a time her dread of the drive home did battle with the need to get there in order to grocery shop and set out some sort of dinner for the two of them originally they had tried to eschew traditional roles in setting up and maintaining their household but both rapidly realized that their traditional upbringings made that arrangement impractical if not impossible the shopping and food preparation had reverted to her the maintenance of their physical plant to jared daytoday finances they agreed were beyond either of their abilities and therefore to be shared again she checked out the window then after a final hesitation a final thought about calling home and leaving a message on their machine that she was going to work late she pushed herself away from the desk as she stood up she decided if it was going to be dinner then dammit it was going to be a special dinner in medical school and residency she had always been able to find an extra gear a reserve jet of energy when she needed it perhaps tonight her marriage could use a romantic gourmet dinner more than it could her moaning about the exhausting day she had endured spinach salad shrimp curry candles grgich hills chardonnay maybe even a chocolate souffle she ticked off a mental shopping list as she slipped a few scientific reprints into her briefcase bundled herself against the rushhour snow and hurried from her office pleased to sense the beginnings of a surge it was good to know she still had one in the quiet of his windowless office carl horner spoke through his fingertips to the information storage and retrieval system in the next room he had implicit faith in his machines in their perfection if there was a problem as it now seemed there was the source he felt certain was humaneither himself or someone at the company again and again his fingers asked again and again the answers were the same finally he turned from his console to one of two black phones on his desk a series of seven numbers opened a connection in buffalo new york four numbers more activated the line to a dead box in atlanta and a final three completed an untraceable connection to darlington kentucky cyrus redding answered on the first ring carl orange red cyrus had the colors been reversed redding would have been warned either that someone was monitoring horners call or that the possibility of a tap existed i can talk redding said cyrus a woman named kate bennett a pathologist at metro just called asking for information on two women who died from the same unusual bleeding disorder patients of ours that is affirmative although dr bennett is only aware that one of them is both women had autopsies that showed in addition to the blood problems a rare condition of their ovaries have you asked the monkeys about them affirmative the monkeys say there is no connection here does that make sense to you carl negative keep looking into matters i want a sheet about this doctor bennett ill learn what i can and teletype it tomorrow tonight tonight then be well old friend and you cyrus youll hear from me later wednesday december coronary strikes out bobby kate cringed at the boston herald headline on her office desk the story was one of the rare events that managed to make the front page in both that paper and the boston globe though the globes treatment was more detailed the lead and side articles said essentially the same thing in the two papers bobby geary beloved son of albert and maureen geary son of the city itself had been taken without warning by a clot as thin as the stitching on a baseball the stories many of them by sportswriters were the heartrending stuff of which pulitzers are made the only problem being that they werent true the storm which had begun the evening before had dumped a quick eight inches of snow on the city before skulking off over the north atlantic however neither the columns of journalistic halftruths nor the painful drive into the city could dampen the warmth left by the c talking and the sharing that had followed the candlelight meal kate had i prepared for her husband for the first time in years jared had talked about his disastrous first marriage and the daughter he would in all likelihood never see again gone to find something better was all the note from his wife had said the trail of the woman and her daughter had grown cold in new york and finally vanished in a morass of evanescent religious cults throughout southern and central california gone to find something better jared had cried as he spoke of the vermont years of his need then to break clear of his fathers expectations and build a life for himself kate had dried his tears with her lips and listened to the confusion and pain of a marriage that was far more an act of rebellion than one of love kate was finishing the last of the globe stories when with a soft knock a ponderous woman entered carrying a paper bag the womans overcoat was unbuttoned exposing a nurses uniform pin and name tag kate read the name as the woman spoke it dr bennett im sandra tucker ginger rittenhouse was my roommate of course please sit down coffee no thank you im doing privateduty work and im expected at my patients house in weston in half an hour dr engleson said that if i remembered anything or found anything that might help you understand gingers death i could bring it to you yes thats true im sorry about ginger did you know her no no i didnt we had shared the house only for a few months i know a week after she moved in ginger baked a cake and cooked up a lasagna for my birthday that was very nice kate said wishing she had thought twice about engaging the woman in small talk there was a sad aura about hera loneliness that made kate suspect she would talk on indefinitely if given the chance patient or no patient we went to the movies together twice and to the pops but we were only just getting to be friends and its good of you to come all the way down here in the snow kate said in as gentle an interruption as she could manage oh well its the least i could do ginger was a very nice person very quiet and very nice she was thinking about trying for the marathon next spring what do you have in the bag is that something of hers a frontal assault seemed the only way bag oh yes im sorry dr engleson what a nice man he is asked me to go through her things looking for medicines or letters or doctors appointments or anything that might give you a clue about why she why she i know it was a hard thing for you to do miss tucker and im grateful for any help its mrs tucker im divorced kate nodded the bag my god i apologize again she passed her parcel across the desk sometimes i talk too much im afraid sometimes i do too kates voice trailed away as she stared at the contents of the bag i found them in the top of gingers bureau its the strangest way to package pills ive ever seen on that one sheet are nearly two months worth of them packaged individually and labeled by day and date when to take each one looks sort of like it was put together by a computer it was kate said her thoughts swirling pardon i said it was put together by a computer her eyes came up slowly and turned toward the window across the street its glass and steel facade jewellike was the pride of metropolitan hospital of boston the pharmacydispensing computer of the omnicenter the omnicenter where ginger rittenhouse never went i dont understand kate rose mrs tucker youve been a tremendous help ill call if we need any further information or if we learn something that might help explain your friends death if youll excuse me there are some phone calls i must make the woman took kates hand think nothing of it she said oh i felt uncomfortable at first rifling through her drawers but then i said to myself if youre not going to do it then mrs tucker thank you very much one hand still locked in sandra tuckers kate used her other to take the woman by the elbow and guide her out the door the tablets were a mediumstrength estrogenprogesterone combination a generic birth control pill kate wondered if ginger rittenhouse had been too shy to mention to her roommate that she took them computer printed along the top margin of the sheet were gingers name the date six weeks before when the prescription had been filled and instructions to take one tablet daily also printed was advice on what to do if one dose was missed as well as if two doses were missed common side effects were listed with an asterisk beside those that should be reported immediately to gingers omnicenter physician perforations vertical and horizontal enabled the patient to tear off as many pills as might be needed for time away the setup like everything at the omnicenter was slickthoughtfully designed and practicalfurther showing why there was a long list of women from every economic level waiting to become patients of the facility kate ran through half a dozen possible explanations of why she had been told ginger rittenhouse was not a patient at the omnicenter then she accepted that there was only one way to find out she answered doctor bennett when the omnicenter operator asked who was calling emphasizing ever so slightly her title immediately she was patched through to dr william zimmermann the director kate this is a coincidence i was just about to call you how are you it was typical of the man a dynamo sometimes called rocket bill to forgo the redundancy of saying hello im fine bill thanks what do you mean coincidence well ive got a note here from our statistician carl horner along with a file on someone named rittenhouse carl says he originally sent word to you that we had no such patient thats right well we do apparently there was a coding mistake or spelling mistake or something did he tell you why i wanted to know only that this woman had died thats right does your carl horner make mistakes often the idea of an error didnt jibe with marco sebastians description of the man once every century or so as far as i can tell ive been here four years now and this is the first time ive encountered any screw up by his machines do you want me to send this chart over to you can i pick it up in person bill there are some other things i want to talk with you about one oclock okay with you fine and bill could you order a printout of the record of a beverly vitale the woman who bled out on the inpatient service yes ive already reviewed it a copys right here on my desk excellent one last thing yes id like to meet carl horner is that possible old carls a bit cantankerous but i suspect it would be okay one oclock then one oclock ellen sandler clutched her housecoat about her and sat on the edge of her bed staring blankly at a disheveled blackbird foraging for a bit of food on the frozen snow beyond her window she was expected at the office in less than an hour the house was woefully low on staples betsys math teacher had set up a noontime conference to investigate her falling interest and grade in the subject eve needed help shopping for a dress for her piano recital darcy had come home an hour after weekday curfew her clothes tinged with a musty odor that ellen suspected was marijuana so much to do so much had changed yet so little the silence in the house was stifling gradually she focused on a few ongoing sounds the hum of the refrigerator the drone of the blower on the heating and air conditioning system sandy had installed to celebrate their last anniversary the sigh that was her own breathing get up she told herself goddamn it get up and do what you have to do still she did not move the hurt the oppressive constricting ache in her chest seemed to make movement impossible it wasnt the loneliness that pained so although certainly that was torture it wasnt the empty bed or the silent telephone or the lifeless eyes that stared at her from the mirror it wasnt even the other woman whoever she was it was the liesthe dozens upon dozens of lies from the one person in the world she needed to trust it was the realization that while the anguish and hurt of the broken marriage might in time subside the inability to trust would likely remain part of her forever get up dammit get up get dressed and get going with what seemed a major effort she broke through the inertia of her spirit and the aching stiffness in her limbs and stood up the room the house the job the girlsso much had changed yet so little she walked to the closet wondering if perhaps something silkier and more feminine than what she usually wore to the office would buoy her the burgundy dress she had bought for london caught her eye two men had made advances toward her the first day she wore it and there had been any number of compliments on it since as she crossed the room ellen felt the morning discomforts in her joints diminishall that is except a throbbing in her left thigh that seemed to worsen with each step she slipped off her housecoat hung it up and pulled her flannel nightgown off over her head covering much of the front of her thigh was the largest bruise she had ever seen gingerly she explored it with her fingers it was somewhat tender but not unbearably so she did not know how she had gotten it she had sustained no injury that she could remember it must she decided have been the way she slept on it she selected a blue thin wool jumpsuit in place of the dress which it seemed might not cover the bruise in every situation she dressed still unable to take her eyes off the grotesque discoloration her legs had always been one of her best features even after three children she took pride that there were only a few threadlike veins visible behind her knees now this for a moment she thought about calling kate for advice on whether or not to have a doctor check things out but she decided that a bruise was a bruise besides she had simply too much else to do a bit of makeup and some work on her hair and ellen felt as ready as she ever would to tackle the day the face in her mirror thin and fine featured would probably turn some heads but the eyes were still lifeless she was leaving the room when she noticed the note tacked to the doorjamb each day it happened like this and each day it was like seeing the note for the first time despite the fact that she had tacked it there more than a year before take vit was all it said ellen went to the medicine cabinet took the sheet of multivitamins plus iron from the shelf punched one out and swallowed it without water half consciously she noticed that there was only a fourweek supply remaining and she made a mental note to set up an appointment with her physician at the omnicenter although she was limping slightly as she left the house ellen found the tightness in her thigh bearable in fact compared to the other agonies in her life at the moment the sensation was almost pleasant the sign a discreet bronze plate by the electronically controlled glass doors said metropolitan hospital of boston ashburton womens health omnicenter kate had been one of the first patients to enroll and had never regretted her decision gynecological care hardly a pleasant experience had become at least tolerable for her as it had for the several thousand other women who were accepted before a waiting list was introduced the inscription above the receptionists desk said it all complete patient care with complete caring patience kate stopped at the small coatroom to one side of the brightly lit foyer and checked her parka with a bluesmocked volunteer she could have used the tunnel from the main hospital but she had been drawn outdoors by the prospect of a few minutes of fresh air and a fluffy western omelet sandwich spetcialite de la maison at maurys diner the receptionist signaled kates arrival by telephone and then directed her to dr zimmermanns office on the third floor the directions were not necessary zimmermann had been kates omnicenter physician for four years since the accidental drowning death of dr harold french his predecessor and the first head of the omnicenter although she saw zimmermann infrequentlythree times a year was mandatory for women on birth control pillskate had developed a comfortable patientphysician relationship with him as well as an embryonic friendship he was waiting by his office door as she stepped from the elevator even after four years the sight of the man triggered the same impresi sions as had their first meeting he was dashing corny as the word was kate could think of no better one to describe him in his late thirties or early forties zimmermann had a classic chiseled handsomeness along with an urbanity and ease of motion that kate had originally felt might be a liability to a physician in his medical specialty time and the man had proven her concerns groundless he was polite and totally professional in a hospital rife with rumors few had ever been circulated regarding him those that had gone around dealt with the usual speculations about an attractive man of his age who was not married active on hospital and civic committees giving of his time to his patients and of his knowledge to his students william zimmermanns was a star justifiably on the rise dr kate zimmermann took both her hands in his and pumped them warmly come in come in i have fresh coffee and have you had lunch i could send out for something i stopped at maurys on the way over im sorry for being so thoughtless i should have brought you something nonsense i only asked about lunch for your benefit i have been skipping the meal altogetherpart of a weight loss bet with my secretary even if the bet were concocted on the spot and considering the mans trim frame that was quite possible his words were the perfect breeze to dispel kates embarrassment zimmermanns office was the den of a scholar texts and bound journals filled three walls of floortoceiling bookcases and opened or marked volumes covered much of a reading table at one end of the room on the wall behind his desk framed photographs of european castles were interspersed with elegantly matted sayings quotations and homilies the downfall of any magician is belief in his own magic there are two tragedies in life one is not to get your hearts desire the other is to get it and of course the omnicenter complete patient care with complete caring patience there were several others most of which kate had heard or read before one however she could not recall having seen done in black benedictine calligraphy with a wonderfully ornate arabesque border it said monkey work for the monkeys zimmermann followed her line of sight to the saying a gift from carl he explained his belief is that the energy of physicians and nurses should be directed as much as possible to areas utilizing their five senses and those properties unique to human beingsempathy caring and intuitiveness the mechanics of our job the paperwork setting up of appointments filling of prescriptions and such he calls monkey work his machines can do those jobs faster and more accurately than any of us ever could and it seems carl teaches them more almost every day so said kate hes named his computers the monkevs zimmermann said the last two words in unison with her kate sensed a letup in the uneasiness she had developed toward carl horner and began looking forward to meeting the man now zimmermann asked can you brief me on what you have found in these two patients of ours i have reviewed their records and found little that might be of help to you in the concise stylized method of case presentation ingrained in physicians from their earliest days in medical school kate gave a one minute capsule of each womans history physical exam laboratory data and hospital course ive brought sections from the ovaries of both patients i think theres a decent microscope in the lab downstairs she concluded zimmermann whistled softly and the only link to this point is that both were patients here kate nodded well i cant add much miss rittenhouse had been an omnicenter patient since nineteen seventynine nothing but routine checkups since then except that she was within one missed appointment of being asked to go elsewhere for her gynecologic care the contract we have our patients sign gives us that option i know i signed one kate said the contract was another example of the patientoriented philosophy of the omnicenter fees were on a yearly basis adjusted to a patients income there was no profit to be made from insisting on compliance with periodic routine visits yet insist they did what about beverly vitale zimmermann shrugged six years a patient abortion here five years ago by suction had a diaphragm never on birth control pills or hormones of any kind always somewhat anemic hematocrits in the thirtyfour to thirtysix range she was on iron yes dr bartholomew has had her on daily supplements since the day of her first exam who was ginger rittenhouses doctor kate was grasping for any connection however remote actually she was cared for by the residents with the help of a faculty advisor in this womans case it was me however there was never any need for me to be consulted she became a patient just after i arrived i saw her once and she has had no trouble since he grimaced at what he considered an inappropriate remark excluding the obvious he added dead end kates minds eye saw the words as she had written them she glanced at her watch there would be a surgical specimen processed as a frozen section in half an hour her reading would determine whether the patient underwent a limited or extensive procedure still she felt reluctant to let go of the one common factor she had found im due back for a frozen in a short while bill do you think voll could take me by to meet carl horner and his trained monkeys certainly zimmermann said hes expecting us by the way i understand congratulations are in order for what well word has it that you are to be the next chief of pathology kate laughed ruefully welcome to the new game show ive got no secrets actually i dont even think my name has formally been presented for consideration yet so you can hold the congrattllations besides with the financial mess the department is in im not sure condolences wouldnt be a better response you dont suppose that ashburton foundation of yours has a few extra hundred thousand lying around do you i have no idea kate norton reese handles that end of things i am just one of the barge toters and bale lifters you might talk to him though the foundation certainly has taken good care of us kate stepped into the carpeted brightly lit corridor ill say they have she said the chance that norton reese would put himself out on behalf of her department was less than none monkey work for the monkeys the message was displayed throughout carl horners computer facility which occupied an area at the rear of the first floor several times the size of marco sebastians unit ensconced in the midst of millions of dollars in sophisticated electronics carl horner looked to be something of an anachronism beneath his kneelength lab coat he was wearing a plaid work shirt and a pair of farmers overalls his battered work boots might just as well have received their breaking in on a rock pile as in the climatecontrolled ultramodern suite horner greeted kate with an energetic handshake thotlgh she could feel the bulbous changes of arthritis in every joint still the man stoop shouldered and silver haired had an ageless quality about him it emanated she decided not only from his dress but also from his eyes which were a remarkably luminescent blue dr bennett i owe you my deepest apology the error regarding the rittenhouse file was nothing morenor lessthan a spelling mistake on my part kate smiled apology accepted incident forgotten have you found the explanations you were looking for no no we havent mr horner could you show me around a bit im especially interested in how the machines work in the pharmacy carl zimmermann said if you and dr bennett dont mind im going to get back to work kate i plan to review those slides later tonight and to do some reading together i promise that we shall get to the bottom of all this meanwhile enjoy your tour were certainly proud of carl and his monkeys patiently the old man took kate through the filling of a prescription these cards are preprinted with the patients name and code number and included with the patients chart when she has her appointment the doctors tear em up if theyre not needed as you can see there are twentyfive separate medications already listed here along with the codes for dosage amount and instructions the machines dispense only these medications and then only in the form of a generic as good as any brandname pharmaceutical but only a fraction of the cost the machines automatically review the patients record for allergies to the medication prescribed as well as any interaction with medications she might already be taking horners presentation had all the pride of a grandmother holding court at a bridge party if theres any problem at all the prescription is not filled and the patient is referred to our pharmacist who handles the matter personally what if the physician wants to prescribe a medication other than the twentyfive on the card kate asked our pharmacy is fully stocked however because of the monkeys we need only one pharmacist on duty and he or she has more time to deal with problems such as drug interaction and side effects amazing kate said softly have the monkeys ever made an error horners smile was for the first time somewhat patronizing computers cannot make errors there are programs backing up programs to guarantee that of course human beings are a different story so ive learned kates cattiness was reflex there was something about horners limitless confidence in the wires chips discs and other paraphernalia surrounding them that she found disquieting tell me where do the generics come from that the machines dispense one of the drug houses we hold a closedbid auction each year and the lowest bidder gets the contract which one has it now horners answer had been somewhat evasive hardly in character with the man she watched his eyes was there a flicker of heightened emotion in them she couldnt tell now redding has it redding pharmaceuticals ah the best and the brightest kate was not being facetious in an industry with a checkered past that included thalidomide and many other destroyers of human life redding stood alone in its reputation for product safety and the development of orphan drugs for conditions too rare for the drugs to be profitable well mr horner i thank you your monkeys are truly incredible my pleasure if theres anything else i can do let me know kate turned to go but then turned back do you have a list of the companies that have held the contract in years past since the omnicenter opened yes for the second time kate sensed a change in the mans eyes well it wont be much of a list reddings the only one eight auctions and eight reddings huh no bids have even been close to theirs well thanks for your help no problem horners parting handshake and smile seemed somehow more forced than had his greeting kate watched as he ambled off feeling vaguely uneasy about the man but uncertain why she glanced at her watch the frozen section was due in ten minutes and the patient would be kept under anesthesia until her diagnosis was made aside from alerting bill zimmermann as to what was going on her omnicenter visit had accomplished essentially nothing still the clinic remained the only factor common to two dead women as she walked through the lobby to retrieve her coat kate ran through the possible routes by which the ovarian and blood disorders might have been acquired finally with time running short she stopped at the reception desk and wrote a note to zimmermann dear billthanks for the talk and the tour no answers but perhaps together we can find some meanwhile im sending over some microbiology people to take cultures viral and bacterial if thats okay with you they will also check on techniques of instrument sterilizationperhaps a toxin has been introduced that way let me know if you come up with anything also check your calendar for a night you could come north and have dinner with my husband and me id enjoy the chance to know you better kate she sealed the note in an envelope and passed it over to the receptionist could you see to it that dr zimmermann gets this the woman smiled and nodded kate was halfway to the tunnel entrance when she stopped hesitated and then returned she reclaimed the note tore the envelope open and added a ps and bill could you please get me ten tablets of each of the medications dispensed by the monkeys thanx k well what do you say clyde can i count on you or not norton reese set aside the paper clip he was mangling and stared across his desk at the chief of cardiac surgery clyde breslow was the fourth department head he had met with that day the previous three had made no promises to help block kate bennetts appointment despite delicately presented guarantees that their departments would receive muchneeded new equipment as soon as her nomination was defeated in fact two of the men milner in internal medicine and hoyt the pediatrician had said in as many words that they were pleased with the prospect of having her on the executive committee bright new blood milner had called her breslow napoleonic in size and temper watched reeses discomfort with some amusement now jes what is it about that little lady that bothers you so norton he asked in a thick drawl that often disappeared when he was screaming at the nurses and throwing instruments about the operating room or screaming at the medical students and throwing instruments about the dog lab she refuse to spread those cute little buns of hers for ya or what the bitch made me look bad in front of the board of trustees clyde you should remember that it was your fucking operating microscope that caused all the trouble ill be damned if im going to have her on my executive committee whoa there norton your executive committee now aint you gettin just the slightest bit possessive about a group you dont even have a vote in look clyde ive had a bad day do you back me on this and talk to the surgical boys or dont you now that jes depends dont it the extra residents slot clyde i cant do it i told you that then maybe you jes better get used to seeing that pretty little face of katey bs at the meetins every other tuesday reese snapped a pencil in half all right ill try he said silently cursing kate bennett for putting him in a position to be manipulated by a man like breslow you do that know what i think norton i think youre scared of that woman thats what i think a looker with smarts is more than you kin handle without warning reese exploded look clyde he said slamming his desk chair against the wall as he stood you have enough fucking trouble remembering that the heart is above the belly button without taking up playing amateur shrink now get the hell out of here and get me some support in this thing ill do what i can about your goddamn resident with a plastic smile clyde breslow backed out of the office reese sank into his chair frightened of kate bennett the hell he was he just couldnt stand a snotty dogooder kid going around trying to act grown up she ought to be home keeping house and screwing that lawyer husband of hers mr reese theres a call for you on two the secretarys voice startled him and lunging for the intercom he spilled the dregs of a cup of coffee on his desk tlammit bettv i told you no calls i know you did sir im sorry its mr horner from the omnicenter he says its very important reese sighed all right tell him to call me on three seven four four he blotted up the coffee and waited for his private line to ring it was unusual for carl horner to call at all omnicenter business was usually handled by arlen paquette reddings director of product safety in the few moments before rang he speculated on the nature of a problem that might be of such concern that horner would call none of his speculations prepared him for the reality mr reese horner said im calling on behalf of a mutual friend of ours cyrus reddings name was one horner would never say over the phone but reese had no doubt whom he meant how is our friend a bit upset mr reese one of your staff physicians has been nosing about the omnicenter asking questions about our pharmacy and requesting dr zimmermann to send her samples of the medications we dispense the word her brought reese a bonedeep chill who is it he asked already knowing the answer its the pathologist dr bennett shes investigating the deaths of two women who were patients of ours damn her reese said too softly to be heard horner are you i mean is the omnicenter responsible for the deaths that appears to be negative what do you mean appears to be do you know whats at stake paquette promised me nothing like this would happen reese began feeling a tightness in his chest and dropped a nitroglycerine tablet under his tongue vowing that if this discomfort was the start of the big one his last act on earth would be to shoot kate bennett between the eyes our friend says for you to remain cool and not to worry however he would like you to find some effective way of diverting dr bennetts interest away from the omnicenter until we can fix up a few things and do a little more investigating into the two deaths in question what am i supposed to do that mr reese i do not know our friend suggests firing the woman i cant do that i dont hire and fire doctors for christs sake our friend would like something done as soon as possible he has asked me to remind you that certain contracts are up for renewal in less than a month fuck him pardon i said all right ill think of something suddenly he briohtened in fact he said reaching into his desk drawer i think i already have fine carl horner said all of us involved appreciate your efforts im sure our friend will be extremely beholden when you succeed reese noted the use of when instead of if but it no longer mattered ill be in touch he said replacing the receiver he extracted a folder marked schultzgeary inside were a number of newspaper articles the official autopsy report signed by stanley willoughby and kathryn bennett mds and an explanatory note from sheila pierce also in the folder were a number of laboratory tests on a man named john schultza patient who as far as he or sheila could tell never existed in metropolitan hospital while the chances of some kind of coverup werent a hundred percent they certainly seemed close to that sheila he thought as he readied a piece of paper in his typewriter if this works out im going to see to it that you get at least an extra night or two each month to charles c estep editor the boston globe reese whispered the words as he typed them he paused and checked the hour by the time he was done with a rough draft the pathology unit would be empty a sheet of kate bennetts stationery and a sample of her signature would then be all he needed to solve any number of problems the woman would be out of his hair perhaps permanently and cyrus redding would behow had horner put it extremely beholden dear mr estep as norton reese typed he began humming there is nothing like a dame thursday december do you think god is a man or a woman daddy suzy paquette sat crosslegged on the passenger seat of her fathers new mercedes sl parked by the pump at bowens texaco behind the wheel arlen paquette watched the midmorning traffic glide by along main street his thoughts neither on the traffic nor on the question he had just been asked well daddy well what sugar the attendant rapped twice on the trunk that he was done company account harley paquette called out as he pulled away which is it man or woman which is what darling god daddy youre not even listening to me at all she was seven years old with sorrel hair pulled back in two ponytails and a china doll face that was at that moment trying to pout paquette swung into a space in front of darlington armynavy and stopped never totally calm he was he knew unusually tense and distracted this morning still it was second thursday and that gave him the right to be inattentive or cross as he had been earlier with his wife he turned to his daughter she had mastered the expression she wanted and now sat pressed against the car door displaying it her arms folded tightly across her chest in that instant paquette knew that she was the most beautiful child on earth he reached across and took her in his arms the girl stiffened momentarily then relaxed and returned the embrace im sorry sugar paquette said i wasnt listening im sorry and i love you and i think god is a woman if youre a woman and a man to someone whos a man and probably a puppy dog to the puppy dogs i love you too daddy and i still dont know why i should have to pray to our father when god might be our mother you know youre right i think that from now on we should say our buddy who art in heaven oh daddy paquette checked the time listen sugar my meeting is in half an hour ive got to get going you be brave now she flashed a heartmelting smile i dont have to be brave daddy its only a cleaning well then you be clean mommy will be by in just a little while you wait if shes not here by the time youre done he watched as she ran up the stairs next to the armynavy and waited until she waved to him from behind the picture window painted dr richard philips dds then he eased the mercedes away from the curb and headed toward the south end of town and his eleven oclock second thursday meeting with cyrus redding president and chairman of the board of perhaps the largest pharmaceutical house in the world the meeting would start at exactly eleven and end at precisely ten minutes to noon for seven years as long as paquette had been with the company it had been like that and like that it would remain as long as cyrus redding was alive and in charge nine oclock labor relations ten oclock public relations eleven product safety an hour and ten minutes for lunch then research and development sales and production and finally from three to threefifty legislative liaison department heads meeting with cyrus redding one on one the second thursday of each month the times and the order of second thursday were immutable vacations were to be worked around the day illnesses to be treated and tolerated unless hospitalization was necessary even then on more than one occasion redding had moved the meeting to a hospital room second thursday raises new projects criticisms terminationall whenever possible on that day the factory covered most of a thirtyacre site bordered to the south and west by pinecovered hills and to the east by pinkhams creek double fences nine feet high with barbed wire outcroppings at the top encircled the entire facility the inner of the two barriers was electrified stunning voltage during the day lethal voltage at night and on weekends the only approach paralleling the new railbed from the north was tree lined and immaculately maintained two hundred yards from the outer fence a v in the roadway directed employees and shippers to the right and all others to the left a rainbow sign spanning the approach at that point announced redding pharmaceuticals incorporated darlington kentucky the most good for the most people at the least cost paquette bore to the right beneath the sign and stopped by a brightly painted guardhouse the first of a series of security measures he found himself wondering as he did on almost every second thursday if knowing what he knew now he would have left his university research position in connecticut to become director of product safety the question was a purely hypothe ical one he had taken the job he had agreed to play cyrus reddings game by cyrus reddings rules now like it or not he was cyrus reddings man of course an annual salary that with benefits exceeded four hundred thousand dollars went far toward easing pangs of conscience suzy was the youngest of three children all of whom would one day be in college at the same time he stopped at the final pass gate handed the trunk key to the guard and drummed nervously on the wheel while the man completed his inspection it hardly paid to be late for a second thursday appointment over the hundred and eighty years since gault darling led a band of renegades moonshiners and other social outcasts to a verdant spot in the foothills of the cumberlands and then killed two men for the right to have the new town named after himself darlington kentucky had undergone any number of near deaths and subsequent resurgences disease soldiers cherokees floods fires and even a tornado had at one time or another brought the town to its knees always though a vestige survived and always darlington regrew in the lexingtonknoxville railway passed close enough to darlington to send off a spur the primary purpose of which was the transport of coal from the rich juniper mines by the end of the century however output from the junipers had fallen to a trickle and the railbed was left to rot darlington was once again in danger of becoming a ghost town shops closed the schoolhouse and baptist church burned down and were not rebuilt town government dwindled and then disappeared in the end where once there had been well over a thousand only a handful remained fortunately for the town one of those was elton darling selfproclaimed descendant of gault in darling engineered a massive hoax utilizing three pouches of lowgrade gold ore two confederates and a remarkable ability to seem totally inebriated when stone sober rumors of the darlington lode spread quicky through cities from chicago to atlanta and darlington acquired an instant citizenry many of whom stayed on either out of love for the beauty of the area or out of lack of resources to move elsewhere having singlehandedly repopulated his town elton darling set about giving it an industry making use of the areas only readily available resource the sulfurrich water of pinkhams creek a tributary of the cumberland river in less than a year with some food coloring smokyglassed bottles an attractive label and an aggressive sales force the vile water of pinkhams creek uninhabitable by even the hardiest fish had become darlings astounding rejuvenator and purgator an elixir alleged effective against conditions ranging from dropsy to baldness over the years before his death in elton darling made such changes in his product as the market and times demanded he also made a modest fortune by the time his son tyrone took control of the family enterprises the rejuvenator had been replaced by a variety of vitamin and mineral supplements and darlington pharmaceuticals was being traded though lightly on the american stock exchange far from being the visionary and businessman his father was lyrone darling spent much of his time and most of his money on a string of unsuccessful thoroughbreds and a succession of city women each of whom was more adept at consuming money than he was at making it darlings solution to his diminishing cash reserves was simple issue more stock and sell off some of his own in the fall of at the annual darlington stockholders meeting the ax fell intermediaries for a man spoken of only as mr redding produced proof of ownership of more than fiftythree percent of darlington pharmaceuticals and in a matter of less than a day took over the company on behalf of mr cyrus redding of new york new york stripped of influence as well as of a source of income darling tried to negotiate to the best of anyones knowledge he had not succeeded even in meeting with the man who had replaced him when on the following new years eve he and a woman named densmore were shot to death by the womans husband thus it was that the fortunes of darlington kentucky became tied to a reclusive genius named cyrus redding and to the pharmaceutical house that now bore his name in the years to follow there were a number of minor successes terranyd a concentrated tetracycline rebac an overthecounter antacid and several cold preparations redding pharmaceuticals doubled in size and the population of darlington grew proportionally then in the early s redding obtained exclusive u s patents to several successful european products including the tranquilizer that was following a blitzkrieg promotional campaign to become one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals in the world a year after release of the drug darlington was selected an all american city and shortly after that the darlington dukes minor league baseball franchise was established marilyn wyman sipped at a cup of tea and risked a minute glance at her gold rolex ten minutes to go and another second thursday would be over for reddings director of public relations from across his enormous desk cyrus redding appraised her through his cokebottle spectacles there are exactly eight minutes and thirty seconds to go marilyn he said does that help im sorry sir wyman in her midfifties had been with the company longer than had any other department head still no one had ever heard her refer to her employer as anything other than mr redding or to his face sir she had closecut graybrown hair and a sophisticated sensuality that she used with consummate skill in dealing with media representatives of both sexes we have one final piece of business no small piece either its arthgard i thought it had been taken off the market in england it has but not yet here it has been only eight weeks since we released it and already it is in the top forty in volume and the top twentyfive in actual dollar return thats a shame the feedback ive gotten from pharmacists and patients has been excellent too still the british have proven it responsible for how many deaths so far sixty eightyfive actually eightyfive reflexively wyman shuddered arthgard had been released to the american market almost immediately after the patent had been acquired by reddinz though she had no way of knowing how it had been accomplished the fdarequired testing periods both laboratory and clinical seemed to have been circumvented it was not her place to ask about such things testing was the provinoe of arlen paquette and the exchange of information between department heads was not only frowned upon by redding but in most cases forbidden well we still have lapsol and carmalon she said the figures i looked at yesterday showed them both in the top ten of antiarthritic preparations ill write a press release announcing the suspension of our arthgard production and then see what i can do to remind the public about both of those other products you will do no such thing marilyn pardon redding pulled a computer printout from a file on his desk do you have any idea how many millions it cost us to buy the arthgard patent test the product go into production advertise get samples out to physicians and finally distribute the product to pharmacies and hospitals correction miss wyman not how many millionshow many tens of millions marilyn wyman shook her head redding continued the projections i have here say that at our present rate of increase in sales the product would have to stay on the market for another ten weeks just for us to break even that is where you will be concentrating your efforts but reddings icy look made it clear that there was to be no dialogue on the matter she stared down at the toes of her twohundreddollar ferragamo pumps yes sir ive got some preliminary data from that survey firm you contracted with showing that less than forty percent of physicians and less than ten percent of consumers are even aware of whats going on in england i want those numbers to stay in that ball park for the next ten weeks but dammit i am not looking for buts i am looking for ten weeks of sales so that we can get our ass out of this product without having it burned off our legislative liaison will do his job with the fda now if you want to give me buts ill find a pr person who does her job and need i remind you that her first job will be to do something creative with that m wyman file i have locked away wyman bit at her lower lip and nodded it had been several years since redding had mentioned the collection of photographs telephone conversations and recordings from the company hotel suite she had vacationed in at acapulco beneath her expertly applied makeup she was ashen redding seeing the capitulation in her eyes softened marilyn listen you do your part i promise that if theres any trouble on this side of the atlantic with arthgard well pull it immediately okay good now tell me hows that little buggy of yours riding the alpha fine thank you needs a tuneup thats all well dont bother just bring it over to buddy michaels at darlington sport hes got a spanking new lotus just arrived and itching for you to show it the beauty of the kentucky countryside he checked the slim digital timepiece built into his desk eight minutes of eleven its been a good meeting marilyn as usual youre doing an excellent job why dont you stop by next week and give me a progress report i also want to hear how that new lotus of yours handles the downgrade on the back side of black mountain with a smile a nod and the smallest gesture of one hand marilyn wyman was dismissed arlen paquette was drinking coffee in the sumptuous sitting room outside of reddings office when wyman emerged though they had worked for the same company for years they seldom met in situations other than second thursday still the greeting between them was warm both sensing that in another place and at another time they might well have become friends at precisely eleven oclock marilyn wyman exited through the door to the reception area and paquette crossed to reddings door knocked once and entered hour three of second thursday had begun redding greeted paquette with a handshake across his desk on occasion usually when their agenda was small the man would guide his motorized wheelchair to a spot by the coffee table at one end of his huge office and motion paquette to the maroon chesterfield sofa opposite him this day however there was no such gesture ive sent for lunch arlen we may run over paquette tensed in seven years his eleven oclock visit had never run over im all yours he said realizing as he was sure the old man across from him did that the words were more than a polite figure of speech have you any problem areas you wish to discuss with me before we start paquette shook his head he knew cyrus redding abhorred what he called surprises if paquette encountered major problems in the course of his work a call and immediate discussion with redding were in order fine redding said adjusting his tie and then combing his gray crew cut back with his fingers i have two situations that we must ponder together the first concerns arthgard do you have your file handy i have my files on everything that is current paquette said rummaging through his large wellworn briefcase is our testing on arthgard current reddings tone suggested that he would consider an affirmative response a surprise yes and no sir the formal testing was completed several months ago you have my report yes i remember however paquette continued i began reading about the problems in the uk and decided to continue dispensing the drug to some of the test subjects at the womens health center in denver excellent thinking arlen excellent have there been any side effects so far minor ones only breast engorgement and pain stomach upsets diarrhea hair loss in half a dozen loss of libido rashes and palpitations nothing serious or life threatening serious or life threatening even after seven years paquettes inner feelings were belied by the callousness of his words still he was reddings man and redding was concerned only with those side effects that would be severe enough consistently enough to cause trouble for the company only those were deemed reason to delay or cancel the quick release of a new product into the marketplace in a business where a week often translated into millions of dollars and a jump on the competition into tens of millions redding had set his priorities how many subjects were involved in the arthgard testing counting those at the denver facility and at the omnicenter in boston there were almost a thousand he checked his notes nine hundred and seventy and no one from the omnicenter is receiving arthgard right now the testing there was stopped months ago there were too many other products that we had to work into the system paquette knew that the arthgard recall in great britain was going to prove a fiasco if not a disaster for redding pharmaceuticals a company that had not suffered a product recall or even an fda probe since the man in the wheelchair had taken over testing of pharmaceuticals in europe seldom met fda standards still the uk had a decent safety record and the boston and denver testing facilities served as a double check on all foreigndeveloped products as well as on drugs invented in redding labs problems inherent in various productsat least by cyrus reddings definition of problemshad always been identified before any major commitment by the company was undertaken always until now tell me arlen redding said drawing a cup of coffee from a spigot built into his desk and lacing it with a splash from a small decanter what do you think happened how did this get past us paquette searched for any tension any note of condemnation in the mans words there was none that he could tell well he said basically it boils down to a matter of numbers he paused deciding how scientific to make his explanation he knew nothing of cyrus reddings background but he was certain from past discussions that there was science in it somewhere straightforward and not condescendingthat was how he would play it the arthgard side effectthe cardiac toxicity that is being blamed for the deaths in englandseems to be part allergy and part dose related in other words redding said first the patient has to be sensitive to the drug and then he has to get enough of it exactly and statistically that combination doesnt come up too often arthgard has been so effective though and so well marketed that literally millions of prescriptions have been written in the six years since it was first released in the united kingdom a death heref a death there weeks or months and miles in between no way to connect them to the drug finally a number of problems show up at just about the same time in just about the same place and one doc in one hospital in one town in the corner of sussex puts it all together a little publicity and suddenly reports begin pouring in from all over the british world do you have any idea how many hundreds of thousands of arthritis patients have had their suffering relieved by arthgard i can guess and i understand what youre saying riskbenefit ratio thats all people in our industry or any health provider for that matter have to go by ive decided to keep arthgard on the american market for ten more weeks redding dropped the bomb quietly and simply then he sat back and watched paquettes reaction noticeably at least there was none fine paquette said would you like me to continue the denver testing we have about an eighteenmonth head start on the overall marketplace by all means arlen paquette nodded scratched a note on the arthgard file and slid it back in his briefcase struggling to maintain his composure there was little to be gained by revealing his true feelings about what redding was doing and muchoh so muchto lose his involvement in the testing centers aloneinvolvement of which redding possessed detailed documentationwas enough to send him to prison in fact he suspected that redding could claim no knowledge of either facility and make that claim stick even if no confrontation occurred the chances were that he would be fired or demoted or worse several years before a department head had been openly critical of redding and his methods to the point of discussing his feelings with the editor of the darlington clarion journal not a week later the man a superb horseman had his neck broken in a riding accident and died within hours of reaching darlington regional hospital have you the product test reports for this month yes sir i took them off the computer yesterday evening paquette was rummaging through his briefcase for the progress reports on the fourteen medications currently being investigated when he heard the soft hum of reddings wheelchair just leave the reports on my desk arlen redding said gliding to i the center of the room ill review them later could you bring my coffee over to the table please i want to apprise you of a potential problem at the omnicenter and i could use a break from talking across this desk paquette did as he was asked keeping his eyes averted from redding as much as possible lest the man a warlock when it came to reading the thoughts of others realized how distasteful the arthgard decision was to him on the day of their first interview over eight years ago he had sensed that uncanny ability in the aging invalid it was as if all the power that would have gone into locomotion had simply been transferred to another function arlen the omnicenter was already operational when you joined us yes sort of sir paquette settled into the chesterfield and took a long draught of the coffee he had surreptitiously augmented with cognac while redding was motoring across the room the computers were in our people were in place and the finances had been worked out but no formal testing programs had been started yes of course i remember now you should go easy on that cognac so early in the day my friend its terrible on the digestion in the course of your dealings in boston did you by chance run into a woman pathologist named bennett first name kathryn or kate paquette shook his head he had set his coffee aside no longer finding reassurance in the warm velvety swallows reese keeps me away from as many people as possible he smiled and whispered i think hes ashamed of me redding enjoyed the humor such a reaction would be typical of the man wouldnt it he lacks the highly advanced abilities to appreciate and respect with him a person is to be either controlled or feared none of the subtleties in between exactly paquette was impressed but not surprised by the insight as far as he knew redding had had but one direct contact with the metropolitan hospital administrator but for the warlock one was usually enough what about this dr bennett she has begun investigating the omnicenter in connection with two unusual deaths she has autopsied the women in question had similar blood and reproductive organ disease and both were omnicenter patients so are a fair percentage of all the women in boston paquette said have you talked to our people carl called me both women have participated at various times in our work but never with the same product the omnicenter connection appears to be a red herring unfortunately we have other herrings in that building which are that is precisely my concern redding said and now yours i have sent instructions to reese that he is to find a way to divert young dr bennetts interest away from our facility he seems to think he can do so however i have had my sources do some checking on this woman and i tell you norton reese is no match for her intellectually or in strength of character he would be the last to admit that i agree redding opened a manila folder he had apparently placed on the coffee table prior to paquettes arrival here are copies for you of all the information we have obtained thus far on the woman i want you to go to boston and keep tabs on things do not show yourself in any way without checking with me first meet with our omnicenter people only if absolutely necessary yes sir there is a small item in that report which may be of some help to us bennetts fatherinlaw heads the law firm that handles the metropolitan hospital account as well as some of the northeast business of the tiny tummies line of breakfast cereals although the connection s not generally known tiny foods is a subsidiary of ours the mans name is winfield samuels from all i can tell hes a businessman paquette nodded coming from cyrus redding the appellation businessman was the highest praise it meant the man was like redding himself a pragmatist who would not allow emotions to cloud his handling of an issue do you have any idea of what reese has in mind to deal with the doctor no except that carl horner says he seems quite sure of himself if thats the case paquette said i should be back in just a few days redding smiled benignly i told you how i perceive the bennettreese matchup arlen he said ive had reservations made for you at the ritz openended reservations metro doc labels bobby junkie the layout editor of the herald had it seemed dusted off type that had not been used since dday the paper lay on the living room floor along with the globe and roscoe who was keeping an equal distance between himself and both his masters it was still afternoon but the mood and the dense overcast outside made the hour feel much later the calls had begun at two that morning and had continued until jared unplugged their phones at fourthirty letters typed on kathryn bennetts stationery and signed by her had been dropped off at both boston dailies and all three major television stations sometime during the previous night the gist of the letters was that driven by conscience and a sense of duty to the people of boston kate had decided to tell the truth about bobby geary stan willoughby who was mentioned in the letter and norton reese as metro administrator were called immediately by reporters the pathology chief not as sharp as he might have been had he not been woken from a sound sleep confirmed the story adding that kate was an honest and highly competent pathologist whom he was sure had good reason for doing what she had done it was not until an hour after speaking with the first newsman that he thought to call her by then kates line was so busy that it took him almost another hour to get through meanwhile norton reese aided by marco sebastian and an emergency session with the hospital computers had confirmed that there was in fact no patient named john schultz ever treated or tested at metropolitan hospital reese was careful to add that he knew absolutely nothing of the allegations lodged by dr bennett whom he described as a brilliant woman with a tendency at times to rebel against traditional modes of conduct questioned for details he refused further comment the house was like a mausoleum both kate and jared had attempted to go to work for business as usual but both had been forced by harassing reporters to return home over the hours that followed they sat drapes closed ignoring the periodic ring of the front doorbell the telephones remained disconnected there was a silence between them chilly enough to offset even the warmth from the wood stove jared do you want a cup of coffee thanks but no three in an hour and a half is a little over my limit he leaned forward from his easy chair and plucked the herald from beside roscoes nose beneath the headline were insert photos of bobby gearys parents along with a quotation from each about kate neither the least bit complimentary goddamn tabloid really knows how to slobber it on he said unable to mask the irritation in his voice honey you do believe what i said about not knowing anything about those letters dont you of course i believe you why would you think otherwise no reason i guess the anger she had felt earlier in the day had been greatly muted by frustration and the growing realization that beyond a simple denial and the call for a handwriting analysis of her signature she had absolutely no cards to play even the signature was of doubtful assistance to her claims of innocence no one had yet come forward with the original letter and on the photostat she had seen the signature appeared quite accurate why would somebody do this why jared seemed to be talking as much to himself as to her but it was clear that in his mind confusion and doubt remained you say that yoda and this detective finn were the only two besides you who knew about the amphetamines i said as far as i knew they were reese has it in for me and he has his finger in just about every pie in metro he could have found out somehow and she shrugged and shook her head i dont think much of the man but i cant imagine him doing a thing like this you know kate you could have told me you were going to fake gearys autopsy report i mean i am your husband kate glared at him jared the three of us decided that nobody else should know call mrs willoughby or mrs finn and ask if their husbands told them do you share all the inner secrets of your work with me you never ask give me a break will you listen i know youre upset you are a public figure and directly or indirectly youre getting negative press but dont go blaming me jared i didnt do anything jared rose shuffled to the stove and began stoking embers that were already burning quite nicely i spoke with my father this morning he said over his shoulder my god winfield must be absolutely fried over all this do you think it would help matters if i called him he thinks you should call a press conference and admit that you sent the letters what its his feeling that as things stand it looks like you performed an act of conscience and then i talked you out of owning up to it so my fatherinlaw wants me to lie in public to keep his protege from losing any votes jared slammed the poker against the stove door dammit you already did lie thats what caused all this trouble in the first place kate felt herself about to cry i did what i thought was the kindest and fairest thing i could do for that boy and his family well now youre going to have to think about whats kind and fair to this boy and his family so you think thats what i should do too a loud pounding on the front door precluded jareds response police open up kate opened the door a slit and peered out expecting to see another overly resourceful reporter instead she saw detective lieutenant martin finn any lingering doubt they might have had about whether or not the policeman was responsible for the letters evaporated with the mans first words you really fucked me dr bennett do you know that im sorry but i didnt send those letters she said with exaggerated calm would you like to sit down can i get you some coffee finn ignored her questions and instead remained in the center of the room pacing out a miniature circle on the rug i went along with this because im irish and a fan and look what it gets me i was up for a promotion maybe captain now thanks to you and your fucking grandstand play im going to be lucky i dont get busted to dogcatcher went along with it kate was incredulous lieutenant finn it was your suggestion in the first place for the kids of boston dont you remember saying all that her voice cracked the day had been punishing enough without this suddenly jared pushed past her and confronted the man though he was taller than finn the policeman was far stockier finn if youve said what you came to say i want you and your foul mouth out of here if not say it then leave ill leave when im fucking ready get out jared stepped forward his fists clenched in front of him it was only then that kate sensed how heavily finn had been drinking she moved toward them but not quickly enough with no warning or windup finn sank a vicious uppercut into jareds solar plexus a guttural grunt accompanied the explosion of air from his lungs as he doubled over and dropped to his knees kate knelt beside her husband you damn animal she screamed at finn i wish it had been you lady finn said as he turned and walked clumsily from the house the antique vase kate threw shattered against the door as it closed behind him jared remained doubled over but his breathing was deepening you okay she said softly never laid a glove on me he responded with no little effort could you bring over the wastebasket please just in case you poor darling can i do anything else get you anything slowly jared sat back and straightened up his eyes were glazed just remind me again what i told that minister for better or for worse thats what you told him jared i dont want to sound corny but that was a pretty wonderful thing you did standing up to that animal for better or for worse you sure that was it uhhuh katey i dont know how to tell you this but in some perverse way getting hit the way i just did felt good i dont understand right before finn came in i was ready to tell you that i agreed with my father in thinking everything would be simpler and look better for all of us if you would just admit to writing the letter then that asshole started in all of a sudden i realized how wrong i was and im sorry i couldnt stand hearing him talk to you that way katey please just try to remember that theres a lot going on thats confusing to me sometimes i feel that living with you is like trying to ride a cyclone sometimes i feel like a slab of luncheon meat between one slice of winfield and one slice of kate sometimes he whirled to the wastebasket and threw up sheila pierce stared past norton reeses sweatdampened pate at the stucco ceiling of their room in the mid city motel and reminded herself to continue the groans that the man found so exciting careful not to disrupt his rhythm she reached up and reassured herself that her new diamond studs hadnt come dislodged oh baby she murmured oh baby youre so good so good she wished she could have seen kate bennetts face when the reporters started calling reese was hardly a valentino for her but she had to give credit where credit was due and reese deserved what she was giving him for what he had given bennett oh baby come to me come to me she moaned it had been a thrill just to watch kathryn bennett md miss perfect confused and irritable suddenly not in control of every little thing how good at last to be the one pulling the strings too bad there was no way for bennett ever to know dont stop norty oh yes baby yes dont stop friday december compared with the conference rooms of other departments in metropolitan hospital of boston the one belonging to the pathology unit was spartan french impressionist prints mounted on poster board hung on stark beige walls below them metal governmentsurplus bookcases were half filled with worn dogeared texts and journals the meager decor plus a large gouged oak table and two dozen variegated folding chairs did little to obscure the fact that prior to a modest department wide renovation in the room had been the hospital morgue some among the twentynine assembled for the hastily called meeting still sensed the auras of the thousands of bodies that had temporarily rested there kate stan willoughby seated to her right stood at one end of the table and surveyed the room there were six pathologists besides the two of them some residents and a number of lab technicians it bothered her terribly to think that oneor moreof them might be capable of an act as malicious as the bobby geary letter those in the room were in a sense her familypeople she spent as many waking hours with each week as she did with her husband it had always been her way to deal with them in a straightforward manner respectfully and with no hidden agendas there were only two characteristics that they knew she would not toleratelaziness and dishonesty however to the best of her knowledge none in the room could be accused of either the closest had been the business of sheila pierces claiming she had misplaced the required vouchers and certification for her miami trip and even then kate had no proof of her suspicions besides the matter had been settled between them with little disagreement john gilson the units electron microscopist liu huang a meticulous pathologist whom kate tutored in english marvin grimes the always pleasantly inebriated deiner sheila herself so very bright so dedicated to the department momentarily kates eyes met each of theirs i want to thank you all for taking the time out of your schedules to hear me out she began i know the last day and a half have been how should i say a bit disrupted around here there was a murmur of laughter at the understatement well im here to tell you that compared to what you all have been through my life has been absolutely nuked at three oclock this morning my husband and i caught a reporter trying to sneak out of our bedroom in time to make the morning edition he had disguised himself as our antique brass coatrack laughter this time was more spontaneous and animated kate smiled thinly norton reese has set up a news conference for me in about an hour he wants me to state my position on the bobby geary business once and for all well before i tell those vultures i wanted to tell you what the press has been saying about bobby geary is true from all we were able to tell at post he had been a longtime user of intravenous amphetamines how he could do what he did to his body and still play ball the way he did is a mystery to me but the chronic scarring we found along certain veins makes the truth clear sad for bobbys family sad for the baseball fans and the kids and im sure a nightmare for bobby the decision to withhold our findings from the press was as much mine as dr willoughbys or detective finns a jet of acid singed her throat at the mention of the man i have trouble with deceit in any form but every sense i have of what is decent says that our decision was the right one now someone is doing his best to make me pay for that decision i did not write the letter and i have no idea who did why they did it how they got the information on bobby gearys post or how they obtained my stationery the possibility exists that it was someone from this department i very much hope notall of you are very important to me i feel like were a team and that helps me show up every day ready to try and practice decent pathology in this dinosaur of a hospital but whats done is done ive agonized as much as im going to and after the little qanda session in reeses office i intend to begin stuffing this whole business into the barrel i use to dispose of the garbage in my life if any of you have any questions ill be happy to answer them as best i can stan willoughby rose and put his arm around her shoulders no questions from me kate just a statement for everybody i have submitted this womans name to the search committee as my personal recommendation to succeed me as department chief its possible this whole business is someones way of trying to sabotage that appointment i want you all to know that i am more committed than ever to seeing that she gets it for a moment there was silence then diminutive liu huang stood and began applauding another joined in and then another soon all but one were demonstrating their support were behind you doc a technician called out the reaction was as enthusiastic and sustained as it was spontaneous in the back of the room the lone holdout smiled around clenched teeth and then stiffly joined in the applause that was pretty special wasnt it willoughby said to kate as the room emptied out little looie huang standing there in his formal inscrutable way leading the cheers i just love im are you all right if you mean am i about to come apart and start bawling like a baby the answer is yes so bawl willoughby said taking her by the arm as they followed the last of the meetinggoers from the room you know stan i dont understand it i dont think i ever will whats that willoughby bent over the bubbler he had tried for years to get replaced and sucked vigorously for a sip of tepid water people i guess she shrugged you know you wake up in the morning you get dressed you march off for another encounter in the battle of lifeall you want to do is grow a little try your best and grab some little morsel of peace and contentment along the way no big deal every day you do that and every day you think that everyone else is doing the same thing trying for that same smidgen of happiness it makes so much sense that way ah yes my child but therein lies the rub you see what makes sense and what is are seldom the same thing the stew you propose cooking up would taste just fine but its a bit short on the condiments of realitygreed envy bigotry insecurity to say nothing of that ol standby just plain craziness no matter who you are no matter how hard you try to tend your own little garden no matter how kind you try to be to your fellow man theres always gonna be someone somewhere tryin to stick it to you you can count on it terrific it all boils down to priorities what do you mean well i know i have the reputation around here for being too passive my door is always open bring in your troubles and problems whenever you want as long as you bring in the solutions to them at the same time i wasnt always like that kate there was a time when i would have gone to the mat with the toughest of them and i did many times in the early days before you came on board then i started getting the pains beneath the ol sternum and started visiting all those eager young cardiologists gradually my priorities began to shift away from playing with the stickittoyou fanatics i went back to basics my wife my children my grandchildren my healthphysical and mental i couldnt see how a new microscope or an extra technician or a refurnished room could measure up against any of them but stan your work is important its your job to fight for the department dont you agree yes well then how do you resolve that fact with what you just said stanley willoughby leaned over and kissed her gently on the forehead i cant kate dont you see thats why im stepping down see you at the conference with a smile that held more wistfulness and sadness than mirth he turned and entered the office that if he had his way kate would occupy within a few months kates office half the size of her chiefs was on a side corridor next to the autopsy suite there was room only for a desk and chair a file cabinet a small microscope bench and two high stools on one of the stools sat jared well hi she said crossing to kiss him hi yourself his response was chilly perfunctory hows your belly as long as i dont try to sit down get up or walk its only painful as hell he said but not nearly as painful as this he slid a handbill across to her copies of this have been circulating all over south boston and are beginning to work their way up into the city damn she whispered staring at the paper in disbelief jared im sorry i really am the flyer printed on an orange stock bright enough to offend even the least political irish catholic was headlined partners in compassion beneath the words were kate and jared arm in arm in a photograph she could not remember ever having posed for it was labeled atty j samuels and dr k bennett at the bottom of the page was a photograph of bobby geary in the midst of his pictureperfect swing it was captioned simply bobby r i p finn she ventured maybe maybe not hes hardly the only irish catholic around whod like to firebomb us the name bobby geary seems set to take its place right next to chappaquiddick and watergate in the list of political death knells for all i know mattingly or his sleazy campaign manager decided to make sure i was no problem for them in the next election im sorry you already said that kate sighed and sank down on her desk chair jared things arent really going very well for me right now do you have to make them worse things arent going well for you is that all you can think of please honey ive got this damn news conference in half an hour ive got a biopsy due from the or dont you remember saying yesterday how you were going to try to be more understanding she clenched her teeth against any further outburst i remember getting laid out by a policeman id never seen before that moment thats what i remember my father tells me that martin finn is numero uno in power and influence in certain quarters of the bpd with him for an enemy its possible that i might end up having my car towed while its stopped for a red light kates eyes narrowed suddenly jareds appearance in her office made sense win samuels one of the mans countless sensors scattered about the city and throughout the media must have reported that his daughterinlaw was scheduled to meet the press jared did your father tell you to come here this morning to make sure i didnt disgrace anyone at the news conference were just trying to avoid any more of this stuff he held up the orange handbill kate glared at her husband for a moment then her expression softened you know when you are yourself you are the funniest nicest gentlest handsomest man i have ever known i swear you are given a builditmyself husband erector set i dont think i could have done any better but when you start operating with that man in the braxton building i swear look lets leave my father out of this shall we im the one whos watching a political career go down the toilet not him im not so sure what nothing jared look ive got some work to finish and any moment i have to diagnose the biopsy of a womans thyroid gland that one of the other pathologists is having trouble with i cant talk about this any more right now how about you just his outburst was cut short by the arrival of a technician carrying a stainless steel specimen tray and cardboard slide holder which she set on the microscope bench please tell dr huang ill call him in a few minutes with my diagnosis kate said jared watched the young woman leave and then checked his watch look he said coolly ive got to go i have an appointment with norton reese in two minutes what for apparently hes been contacted by a lawyer friend of the gearys theyre thinking of some kind of action against the hospital based on invasion of privacy jesus kate said pressing her fingertips against the fatigue burning in her eyes jared stood to go dont forget about the carlisles cocktail party tonight kate groaned i guess you already have huh im sorry what time seventhirty okay jared i yes she shook her head never mind it wasnt she decided the moment to tell him that she felt she was losing her mind please hold me jared she wanted to say come over here and hold me and tell me everythings going to be all right instead she waved weakly and turned to the slide and tissue in the specimen dish before jared had crossed to the door the telephone began ringing reflexively he turned back hello oh hi kate said howre you holding up how long have you tried pressure ice ellen please just calm down and get a hold of yourself have you ever had any trouble like this before any bruising you cant explain your whole thigh why didnt you call me ellen a few years ago i helped get you accepted into the omnicenter are you still going there all right now listen carefully i want you to come up to the emergency ward here but i dont want you to drive can you get someone to bring you fine pack an overnight bag and ask your sister or someone to cover the girls just in case ellen relax now i mean it coming apart will only make things worse besides it raises havoc with your mascara thats better now maintain pressure as best you can and come on up here ill have the best people waiting to see you youll probably be home in a couple of hours good and ellen bring your medicines too i know theyre only vitamins bring them anyway ellen sandler jared asked as she hung up kate nodded her face ashen her nose has been bleeding steadily for over two hours do you know where sandy is by any chance europe i think kate stared down at the specimen tray and thought about the woman on the operating table waiting word on whether the lump in her neck was cancerous or not chances were that the initial biopsy had been done under local so the woman would be fully awake frightened jared there is something you can tell norton reese for me tell him that i wont be able to make his news conference tell him that i didnt do anything and didnt write anything so i really dont have anything to say anyway but tell him that as my husband for almost five years you know that whatever i say is the truth and that if anyone wants to get at me theyll have to go through you just like last evening okay she placed a slide under her microscope and prepared for an encounter with the yellowwhite light jared moved to respond but then stopped himself walked to the door and finally turned back i hope ellens all right he said softly kate looked up every muscle in her body seemed to have tensed at the prospect of what the blood studies on her friend might reveal so do i jared she said so do i relax concentrate focus in center your mind center it it took a minute or two longer than usual but in the end the process worked it always did extraneous thoughts and worries lifted from her like a fog until finally all that remained in her world were the cells arlen paquette sat by the window of his suite in the ritz watching the slow passage of pedestrians along the snowcovered walks of the public gardens his schooling had been at harvard and mit and no matter how long he lived in kentucky coming to boston always felt like coming home watching the students and lovers the vagrants and executives paquette found himself longing for the more sheltered if much more improverished life in a university over the seven years with redding he had gained much the land the house the tennis court and pool to say nothing of the opportunities for his children and lifetime security for himself and his wife only now was he beginning to appreciate fully the price he had paid more and more especially since the arthgard recall he avoided looking at himself in mirrors more and more as his selfrespect dwindled his effectiveness as a lover also declined and now a thousand miles from his exquisitely manicured lawn and the country club he was about to direct two women had bled to death as he looked out on the gray new england afternoon paquette prayed that the connection of the dead women to the omnicenter was mere coincidence at precisely three oclock a messenger arrived with the large manila envelope he had been expecting paquette tipped the man and then spread the contents on the coffee table next to the dossier he had brought with him from darlington the thoroughness with which cyrus redding approached a potential adversary surprised him not in the least the warlock kept his edge honed his remarkable intuitiveness through factscountless snatches of data that taken individually might seem irrelevant but which like single jigsawpuzzle pieces helped construct the truth in this case the truth that was kathryn bennett samuels md paquette found the volume of information amassed over just a few days both impressive and frightening biographical data academic publications medical history from a life insurance application even grades and a yearbook picture from mount holyoke there were in addition to the photostats and computer printouts a dozen blackandwhite photographsfivebyseven blowups of shots obviously taken with a telephoto lens instinctively the chemist glanced out the window of his eighthfloor suite wondering if there were a spot from which someone might be taking photographs of him one at a time paquette studied the carefully labeled photographs k b and husband jared samuels k b and pathologist stanley willoughby samuelsbennett residence salt marsh road essex k b jogging near home the woman had a remarkable face vibrant and expressive with the welldefined features that translated into photogenicity her beauty was at once unobtrusive and unquestionable and as he scanned the photos arlen paquette felt the beginning pangs of loneliness for his wife pay special attention to dr steins report redding had instructed him the man has done this sort of thing for me before on even shorter notice and with even less data than he has had to work with here if you have questions let me know and ill have stein get in touch with you the report was typed on stationery embossed stephen stein phd clinical psychologist there was no address or telephone number paquette mixed himself a weak dewars and water and settled onto the brocaded sofa with the three singlespaced pages much of the report was a condensation of the data from the rest of the dossier paquette read through that portion underlining the few facts he hadnt encountered before actually he was familiar with steins work nearly seven years before he had studied a similar document dealing with norton reese he had wondered then as he did again this day if somewhere in the hundreds of manila folders locked in cyrus reddings files was one containing a stein study of arlen paquette two older brothers highschool cheerleader ribbonwinning equestrian art department award for sculpture mt holyoke college one piece search still on display on campus grounds fourteenday hospitalization for depression junior year paquette added the information to what he already knew of the woman in conclusion stein wrote it would appear that in dr bennett we have a woman of some discipline and uncommon tenacity who would make a valuable ally or a dangerous foe under any circumstances her principles appear solidly grounded and i would doubt seriously that she can be bought off a cause in which she believes intellectually i have no reason to believe her abilities have declined from the days when she scored very high marks in the medical college admission test see p c and national medical boards also c her friends as far as we have been able to determine are loyal to her and trusting in her loyalty to them statements summarized pp c and c she does however have some problem areas that we shall continue to explore and that might yield avenues for controlling her actions she likely has a deepseated insecurity and confusion regarding her roles as a wife and a professional a threat against her husband may prove more effective in directing her actions than a threat against herself faced with a challenge it is likely that she would fight rather than back away or seek assistance the possibility of influence through blackmail areas for this being investigated or extortion seems remote at this time followup report in one week or as significant information is obtained estimate of potential for control on redding index is two or three paquette set the report aside and tried to remember what norton reese had been graded on reddings scale an eight and what about himself a ten he muttered move over bo derek here comes arlen paquette an absolute ten he poured a second drink this one pure dewars and buried it in minutes the amber softness had calmed him enough for him to begin some assessment of the situation bennett had sent specialists to the omnicenter to take cultures no problem if they were negative as he suspected they would be the clinic had gotten a free comprehensive microbiology check if they were positive investigation would move away from the pharmacy anyhow she had asked for and received samples of the pharmaceuticals dispensed by horners monkeys no problem the samples would prove to be clean horner had seen to that would she press her investigation further steins report and what he knew of the woman said yes however that was before she had become mired down in the baseball player mess the more he thought about the situation the more convinced paquette became that there was no avenue through which kate bennett could penetrate the secret of the omnicenter especially since all product testing had been suspended tenacity or no tenacity the woman could not keep him away from home for more than a few days as he mixed another drink paquette realized that there was in fact a way it was a twisting rocky footpath rather than an avenue but it was a way nonetheless after a moment of hesitation he placed a call to the area good afternoon ashburton foundation estelle yes its dr thompson oh hi doctor long time no hear only a week estelle everything okay fine any calls just this one i almost jumped out of my skin when the phone rang i mean days of doing nothing but my nails i any mail just the two pieces from denver i forwarded to you a while ago i got them listen if any calls come in i dont want you to wait until i check in call me through the numbers on the sheet in the desk the message will get to me and ill call you immediately okay but thank you estelle have a good day goodbye dr thompson to kate bennett the scene in room of the metropolitan hospital emergency ward was surreal off to one side two earnest hematology fellows were making blood smears and chatting in inappropriately loud tones to the other side tom engleson leaned against the wall in grim silence flanked by a nurse and a junior resident kate stood alone by the doorway alternating her gaze from the crimsonspattered suction bottle on the wall to the activity beneath the bright overhead light in the center of the room pete colangelo chief of otorhinolaryngology hunched in front of ellen sandler peering through the center hole of his head mirror at a hyperilluminated spot far within her left nostril its high oh yes its high he murmured to himself as he strove to cauterize the hemorrhaging vessel that because of its location was dripping blood out of ellens nose and down the back of her throat kate looked at her friends sheetcovered legs and thought about the bruise the enormous bruise which had been a harbinger of troubles to come dont let it be serious please if you are anything like a god please dont let her tests come back abnormal in the special operating chair ellen sat motionless as marble but her hands kate observed were whitened from her grip on the armrest please could you check her pressure colangelo asked he was a thin minute man but his hands were remarkable especially in the fine plastic work from which surgical legends were born kate was grateful beyond words that she had found him available still she knew that the real danger lay not so much in what was happening as in why gruesome images of beverly vitale and ginger rittenhouse churned in her thoughts at that moment in the hematology lab machines and technicians were measuring the clotting factors in a woman who was no more than a name and hospital number to them please colangelos assistant reported ellens pressure at oneforty over sixty no danger there the jets of blood into the suction bottle seemed to be lessening and for the first time kate sensed a slight letup in the tension around the room come to papa colangelo cooed to the bleeding arteriole thats the little fellow come to papa now what do you think kate spun to her left tom engleson had moved next to her sorry he whispered i didnt mean to startle you the concern she was feeling was mirrored in his face his brown eyes dulled somewhat by the continued pressures of his job were nonetheless wonderfully expressive i think pete is winning she said if thats what youre asking it isnt in that case i dont have an answer at least not yet not until the hematology report comes back she continued speaking but turned her gaze back to the center of the room if her counts are normal and you have the time we can celebrate ill buy you a coffee if theyre low id like towait make that need totalk with you anyhow besides stan willoughby you are the only one who knows as much as i do and i think these past two days stan has been battered enough by his association with me im free for the rest of the day tom said if you like maybe we could have dinner together the moment the words were out he regretted saying them impetuous inappropriate tactless dumb kate responded with a fractional lookfar too little for him to get a fix on i think petes done it she said making no reference to his invitation moments later colangelo confirmed her impression weve got it mrs sandler you just stay relaxed the way you have been and we should be in good shape you are a wonderful patient believe me you are i love caring for people who help me to do my best work he took a step back and waited the reflected light from his head mirror illuminating the bloodsmeared lower half of ellens face then he turned to kate his lips parted in a hopeful halfsmile good job pete she whispered damn good colangelo nodded and then turned back to his patient mrs sandler i think it best for you to stay overnight here there are some lab studies that havent come back yet and i would also like to be sure that vessel stays cauterized no ellen said i mean i cant i mean i dont want to if i dont have to kate tell dr colangelo all the things i have to do and how responsible i am and how ill do exactly what he tells me to do if i can go home please kate no offense but i hate hospitals hate them i almost had betsy in a roadside park because i wanted to wait until the last minute kate crossed to her friend and wiped the dried blood from her face with damp gauze lets see she said finally as i see it you want me to arbitrate a disagreement in medical philosophy between the chief of ent surgery who also happens to be a professor at harvard and the chief of e sandler interior designs inc kate please ellens grip on kates hand and the quaver in her voice reflected a fear far more primal than kate had realized kate turned to the surgeon pete colangelo shrugged i get paid to do surgery and give advice he said if youre asking me whether i think admission is one hundred percent necessary the answer is no however as i said i get paid to give advice and observation in the hospital is my advice before kate could respond a whitecoated technician from the hematology service entered and handed her three lab slips two pink and one pale green she studied the numbers and felt a grinding fear and anger rise in her throat lady she said struggling to mask the tension in her voice im going to cast in with dr colangelo i think you ought to stay ellens grip tightened kate what do the tests show is it bad no el a couple of the numbers are off a bit and should be rechecked but its not bad or dangerous at this point silently she prayed that her judgment of the womans strength was correct and that she had done the right thing in not lying ellen studied her eyes not bad or dangerous at this point but it could be is that what youre saying kate hesitated and then nodded ellen sighed then i guess i stay she said you shouldnt be here long and youll have the very best people taking care of you ill help you make arrangements for the girls and ill also let them know whats going on thank you i know it sounds foolish to say dont worry but try your best not to well keep an eye on your nose and recheck the blood tests in the morning most likely youll be home by the end of the weekend kate fought to maintain an even eye contact but somewhere inside she knew that her friend didnt believe the hopeful statement any more than she did its the omnicenter somehow i just know it is kate grimaced at the coffee she had just brewed and lightened it with halfandhalf ferreted out from among the chemicals in her office refrigerator the omnicenter is just that pile of glass and stone across the street every one of these reports is negative bacteriology chemistry epidemiology all negative wheres the connection tom engleson flipped through a sheaf of reports from the studies kate had ordered there was nothing in any of them so far to implicate the outpatient center i dont know kate responded settling in across the work bench from him he was dressed in jeans and a bulky ivory fishermans sweater it was the first time she had seen the man wearing anything but residents whites the change was a positive one the marvelous irish knit added a rugged edge to his asthenic good looks i think its a virus or some sort of toxin or a contaminant in the pharmacy whatever it is is in there she jabbed a thumb in the general direction of the omnicenter the pharmacy these reports say that the analyses of ginger rittenhouses medications and of the ones zimmermann sent you were all perfectly normal not a bad apple in the bunch i know so so i dont know look my friend has whatever this thing is that has killed two women platelets seventy thousand fibrinogen seventyfive percent of normal you saw the report not as bad as either of the other two at least not yet but sure headed in the wrong direction her words came faster and her voice grew more strident i dont really need you to come down here and point out the obvious for that i can go get gus from the newsstand outside i need some thoughts on what might be the explanation not on what cant be suddenly she stopped jesus im sorry tom i really am between political nonsense here at the hospital the mess with bobby geary and his damn amphetamine addiction two young women dying like ours did the everyday tensions of just trying to do this job right and now ellen im feeling like someone has plunked me inside a blender and thrown the switch you dont deserve this its okay im sorry for not being more helpful he was unable to completely expunge the hurt from his voice and kate reminded herself that while the five or so years difference in their ages meant little in most areas hypersensitivity might not be one of them if you think its the pharmacy he said maybe you should call the fda one jot of evidence and i would im the one who talked her into going to the omnicenter in the first place absently she slipped her hands into her lab coat pockets in the right one folded back and again on itself was the cardboard and plastic card containing what remained of ellens omnicenter vitamins plus iron she set them on the bench no luck finding any of beverly vitales vitamins she asked none kate crossed to her desk returned with a medication card similar to ellens and slapped it down next to the other i think we should try one last time with our friends at the toxicology lab and their magic spectrophotometer ellens vitamins and these if the reports come back negative i shall put all my suspicions in the witch hunt file and turn my attention to other pursuitslike trying to regain some of the respect that was snatched away in the bobby geary disaster dont worry tom said you still have respect admiration and caring in a lot of places especially right here he tapped himself on the breastbone with one finger thank you for saying that whose pills are those other ones he asked huh the other card of pills whose are they oh theyre mine friday december there was an air of excitement and anticipation throughout the usually staid medical suite of vernon drexler md the matronly receptionist bustled about the empty waiting room straightening the magazines and taking pains to see that the sixmonth old issue of practical medical science with drexlers picture on the cover was displayed prominently enough to be impossible for cyrus redding to miss even if he were ushered directly into the doctors office in the small laboratory the young technician replaced the spool of paper in the cardiograph machine and realigned the tubes needle and plastic sleeve she would use to draw blood from the arm of the man drexler had described as one of the most influential if not one of the wealthiest in the country behind her desk lurleen fiske the intense severe office manager phoned the last of their patients and rescheduled him for another day she had been with drexler in when cyrus redding had made his first trip up from kentucky nineteen sixtyseven fiske smiled wistfully their office in the back bay section of boston had been little more than two large closets then one for the doctor and one for herself now drexler owned the entire building it was twelvethirty reddings private had probably touched down at logan already in precisely an hour the woman knew his limousine would glide to a stop in front of their brownstone redding on foot if he could manage it in his wheelchair if he could not would be helped up the walk and before entering the building would squint up at their office window smile and wave his aide for the last five or six years a silent hardlooking man named nunes would be carrying a leather tote bag containing reddings medicines and invariably a special personal gift for each of those working in the office on reddings last visit nearly a year before his gift to her had been the diamond pendantalmost half a caratnow resting proudly on her chest of course she realized this day could prove an exception some sort of pressing situation had arisen requiring redding to fly to boston he had called the office late on the previous afternoon inquiring as to whether as long as he had to be in the city he might be able to work in his annual checkup mrs fiske drexler called from his office i cant remember did you say dr ferguson would be coming in with mr redding or did you say he wouldnt be i said might doctor mr redding wasnt sure the woman smiled lovingly and shook her head vernon drexler may have been a renowned endocrinologist and a leading expert on the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis but for matters other than medicine his mind was a sieve she and his wife had spent many amusing evenings over the years imagining the keystone comedy that would result were they not available to orchestrate his movements from appointment to appointment lecture to lecture the thought of dr ferguson sent the office manager hurrying to the small fireresistant room housing their medical records she returned to her desk with the mans file john ferguson md afflicted as was cyrus redding with myasthenia was a close friend of the tycoon the two men usually arranged to have their checkups on the sameday and then for an hour or so they would meet with dr drexler lurleen fiske suspected though drexler had never made her party to their business that the two men were in some way supporting his myasthenia research laboratory at the medical school mrs fiske drexler called out again perhaps youd better get dr fergusons chart just in case yes doctor ill get it right away she said already flipping through the lengthy record to ensure that the laboratory reports and notes from his last visit were in place drexler was nervous she could tell from his voice he was conducting himself with proper decorum and professional detachment but she could tell nonetheless once years before he had been ferried by helicopter to onassiss yatch for a consultation on the mans already lost battle against myasthenia that morning he had calmly bid the office staff good day and then had strode out minus his medical bag journal articles and sport coat reddings limousine slowed by the snowcovered streets arrived five minutes late lurleen fiske joined the two other employees at the window across the room drexler a tall gaunt man in his midfifties watched his staff pridefully look look there he is the receptionist twittered is he walking drexler wanted to see for himself but was reluctant to disrupt the ritual that had developed over the years lurleen fiske craned her neck his wheelchair is out she said but yes yes hes taking a few steps on his own another year dr drexler youve done it again there was no mistaking the reverence in her voice in spite of himself drexler too was impressed in sixtyseven he had predicted three years for redding four at the most now after more than fifteen the man was as strong as he had been at the start if not stronger youve done it again mrs fiskes praise echoed painfully in his thoughts myasthenia gravis a progressive deterioration of the neuromuscular system cause unknown prognosis progressive weakness especially with exertionfatigue difficulty in chewing difficulty in breathing and eventually death from infection or respiratory failure treatment stopgap even at its most sophisticated yet here were two men redding and john ferguson who had in essence arrested or at least markedly slowed the progress of their disease and they had performed the minor miracles on their own though his staff thought otherwise and neither patient would ever suggest so they had received only peripheral supportive help from him they were certainly a pair of triumphs but triumphs that continually underscored the futility of his own lifes work from the hallway drexler heard the elevator clank open for years his two prize patients had been treating themselves with upwards of a dozen medications at once most of them still untested outside the laboratory for years he had dedicated his work to trying to ascertain which drug or combination of drugs was responsible for their remarkable results the answer would likely provide a breakthrough of historic proportions perhaps this would be his year redding seated in an unmotorized wheelchair waved his aide on ahead and then wheeled himself to the doorway using the mans arm for some support he pulled himself upright and took several rickety steps into the office thank you for seeing me on such short notice vernon he said extending his hand to give drexlers a single vigorous pump mr nunes the aide a sullen swarthy man with the physique of an olympic oarsman slid the wheelchair into place for redding to sit back down across the waiting room lurleen fiske and the two other women beamed like proud grandmothers you look wonderful cyrus drexler said absolutely wonderful come on into my office in a moment first i should like to wish your staff an early merry christmas mr nunes the expressionless nunes produced three gifts of varying sizes from the leather bag slung over his shoulder and redding presented them one at a time to the women who shook his hand selfconsciously lurleen fiske squeezed his shoulders and kissed him on the cheek my limousine will go for dr ferguson redding said as he was wheeled into drexlers office he will be here to share notes with the two of us but not to be examined he would rather keep the appointment he has for next month if that is agreeable to you fine fine drexler said the two men ferguson and redding had met perhaps a dozen years before in his waiting room and had developed an instant rapport by their next appointment redding had asked that a half day be set aside for just the two of them the request supported as it was by the promise of substantial research funds was of course granted reddings bodyguard wheeled him into drexlers office set the bag of medications on the desk and left to accompany the limousine to john fergusons house carefully redding arranged the vials and plastic containers on the blotter before drexler there were all told thirteen different preparations well doctor he said here they are most of them you already know we have been taking a couple of them you dont dr ferguson continues to follow exactly the same regimen as you as far as i know the endocrinologist made notes concerning each medication there were two highly experimental drugsstill far from human testing that he himself had only learned of in the past six or seven months he bit back the urge once again to warn against the dangers of taking pharmaceuticals before they could be properly investigated and simply recorded the chemical names and dosages somehow the two men were screening the drugs for side effects they had let him know that much and no more as far as vernon drexler md was concerned with a goodly proportion of his own research at stake there was no point in pushing the matter this one drexler held up a halffilled bottle of clear powderfilled gelatin capsules from podgorny at the institute for metabolic research in leningrad redding said simply he believes the theory behind the compound to be quite sound amazing drexler muttered absolutely amazing rudy podgorny was a giant in the field but so inaccessible that it had been two years since he had met with him face to face reddings resourcefulness the power of his money was mindboggling well he said when he had finished his tabulations these two preparations have finally had clinical evaluations both of them have been shown to be without significant effect we can discuss my thoughts when dr ferguson arrives but i feel the data now are strong enough to recommend stopping redding fingered the bottles one of these was your baby yes the physician shrugged helplessly and nodded yes he said i am afraid i have hitched my wagon to a falling star he failed in his attempt to keep an optimistic tone in his voice four years of work had in essence gone down the drain then you must strike out in other directions eh just tell me drexler thought tell me how in the hell you know the medications you are taking wont just kill you on the spot yes he said through a tight smile i suppose i must you the sleek stretch limousine moved like a serpent through the light midafternoon traffic on the southeast expressway in the front seat reddings portly driver chattered at the taciturn nunes whose contribution to the conversation was an occasional nod or monosyllable in the rear seated across from one another surrounded on all sides by smoked glass redding and john ferguson sipped brandy and reviewed the session they had just completed with vernon drexler i am sorry things have not been going well with you john redding said perhaps we should have stayed and let drexler exnmine nonsense i have an appointment next month and that will be quite time enough yes i suppose so there was little question in reddings mind that ferguson perhaps eight years his senior was failing the man never robust had lost strength and weight he could shuffle only a few dozen steps without exhaustion his face was drawn and sallow dominated by a mouth of full perfect teeth that gave his every expression a cadaverous cast only his eyes sparkling from within deep hollows like chips of aquamarine reflected the immense drive and intellectual power that had marked the mans life their collaboration for that is what it quickly became had begun on the day of their first meeting in drexlers office ferguson though still ambulatory with a cane had the more advanced disease of the two he was employed at the time as medical director of a state hospital outside of the city and was already taking two experimental drugs after testing them for a time on the patients of his facility within a year redding had begun locating new preparations while ferguson expanded his testing program to include them quickly though both men came to appreciate the need for a larger number of test subjects than could be supplied by fergusons hospital establishment of the total care womens health center in denver and soon after the omnicenter in boston was the upshot of that need vernon drexler continued as their physician monitoring their progress and watching over their general states of health reddings driver still prattling cheerfully at nunes swung onto north although they would eventually end up at john fergusons newton home his only other instruction had been for a steady one hour drive john redding said setting his halffilled snifter in its holder on the bar how long has it been since you were at the omnicenter ferguson laughed ruefully how long since ive been anyplace would be a better question two years perhaps maybe longer its just too difficult for me to get around i understand i take it from our conversation yesterday evening that theres been some kind of problem zimmermann this time it was redding who laughed no no he said from all i can tell zimmermann was the perfect choice for the job you were absolutely right in recommending him a harmless fop with the intelligence to implement and monitor our testing program without getting in the way no not zimmermann well then actually there may not even be a problem when you were working with dr french to set up the omnicenter did you ever run into a dr kathryn bennett ferguson thought for a moment and then shook his head i suspected you wouldnt have redding said it took only a few minutes for redding to review the events leading to kate bennetts inspection of the omnicenter ferguson listened with the dispassion of a scientist his silence punctuated only by occasional gestures that he was following the account carl horner assures me redding concluded that none of the pharmaceuticals we are studying could have been responsible for the problems young dr bennett is investigating but you are not so sure john youve worked with carl you know that being wrong is not something he does very often the mans mind is as much a computer as any of his machines but you think two such distinctive cases and now possibly a third are too many to explain by coincidence redding stared out the window he removed his glasses and cleaned them with a towel from the bar to tell you the truth john i dont know what to think the facts say one thing my instincts another you know the omnicenter better than i do could anyone be fooling around with some drug or other kind of agent behind our backs i hope not john mull over what ive told you see if you can come up with any theories that might explain why all three women with this bleeding problem and two of them with the same ovary problem were all patients of the omnicenter he flipped the intercom switch mr crosscup you may drive us to dr fergusons house he said i will think it over ferguson said but my impression is that this once at least your instincts should yield to the facts a week excuse me a week john redding said i should like to hear something from you about this matter in a week ferguson probed the younger mans eyes you seem to be implying that i am holding something back i imply nothing of the kind he smiled enigmatically i am only asking for your help the limousine pulled into the snowbanked drive of john fergusons house a trim white colonial on perhaps an acre of land redding engaged the intercom mr nunes he said our business has been concluded kindly assist our guest to his home the men shook hands and redding watched as nunes aided an obviously exhausted john ferguson up the walk to the front door the old man was many things redding acknowledged a brilliant physician and administrator an exceptional judge of human nature and predictor of human behavior a gifted philosopher what he was not redding had known since the early days of their association was john ferguson reddings investigators had been able to learn that much but no more there had been a john ferguson with an educational background identical to this mans but that john ferguson had died in the bombing of a field hospital in bataan originally reddings instincts had argued against a confrontation with his new associate over what exactly the man was hiding from that decision had proved prudentat least until now ferguson bid a final goodbye with a weak wave and entered his home behind the smoked glass of the limousine cyrus redding was placing a phone call through the mobile operator dr stein please redding said hello doctor this is your friend from darlington the man john ferguson of whom i spoke last night i should like the reinvestigation and close observation instituted at once keep me informed personally of your progress he seems to have materialized shortly after world war two so perhaps that is a period to reinvestigate first thank you all right my friend he thought for fifteen years i have allowed you your deception let us hope that courtesy was not misplaced i kate bennett set her dictaphone headpiece in its cradle and stared across the street at the darkened omnicenter reflections from the headlights of passing cars sparkling off its sixfoot windows lent an eerie animation to the structure which stood out against its dark brick surroundings like a spaceship kate knew it was her nevertimid imagination at work knew it was the phone call she was expecting but she still could not rationalize away her sense of the building as something ominous something virulent the message had been on her desk when she returned from the friday meeting of the hospital infection control committee which she had chaired for almost a year the department secretary handed her a note sent normal one spec contaminated please await phone call with details between six and seven tonight contaminated its you i know it is her mind spoke the words to the gleaming five stories something inside you inside your precious monkeys has gone haywire something inside you is killing people and you dont even know it the ringing of the telephone startled her kate bennett she answered excitedly kate bennetts husband jared said flatly oh hi you surprised me i was expecting a call from ian toole in the toxicology lab and never mind that where are you is everything all right at home where youre supposed to be and no kate glanced at the clock on her desk and groaned oh damn jared i forgot about the carlisles im sorry apology not accepted he said with no hint of humor kate sank in her chair resigned to the outburst she knew was about to ensue and knowing that it was justified im sorry anyhow she said softly youre always sorry arent you jared said youre so wrapped up in kates job and kates world and kates problems that you seem to forget that there are any other jobs or worlds or problems around my father and several bigmoney people are going to be at that party tonight what kind of an impression is it going to make when i show up without my wife jared you dont understand something is going on here people are dying people like bobby geary kate glanced at the clock it was five minutes to seven look she said im waiting for a call that could help solve this mystery i can call you back or i can get home as soon as possible change and make it over to the carlisles by eightthirty or nine dont bother jared what do you want me to do jareds sigh was audible over the phone i want you to do whatever it is you feel you have to do he said ill go to the carlisles and make do we can talk later tonight or tomorrow okay all right she said taken somewhat aback by his reasonableness hows ellen pardon it was one minute to seven ellen you remember our friend ellen how is she shes in the hospital jared listen i really am sorry and i really am in the middle or at least on the fringes of something strange ellens life may be at stake in what im doing sounds pretty melodramatic to me jared said but then again im just a poor ol country lawyer well talk later thank you jared i love you see you later kate ian tooles call came at precisely sevenfifteen these are some little pills you sent me here dr bennett he said my assistant millicent and i have been running them most of the afternoon and we still dont have a final word for you but you said ellens pills were contaminated ellen sandlers hardly i think your secretary mixed up my message probably went to the same school as ours what do you mean ellen sandlers vitamins are a pretty runofthemill lowpotency preparation b complex a little c a little iron a splash of zinc its yours that are weird mine kates throat grew dry and tight uhhuh youre not only taking the same vitamins as ellen sandler but youre also taking a fairly sizable jolt every day of some kind of anthranilic acid anthranilic acid millicent and i are trying to work out the side chains but thats the basic molecule kate felt sick mr toole what is it im a chemist not a doctor but as far as ive been able to determine youre taking a painkiller of some sort nonnarcotic some kind of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug the basic molecule is listed in our manuals but i dont think were going to find the exact side chains whatever it is its not a commercially available drug in this country if it were wed have it in the book ill check out the european manuals as soon as we know the full structure let me know kate had written out the word anthranilic and begun a calligraphic version of course probably wont be until next week though i had to promise millicent a bottle of wine to get her to put off her date with her boyfriend even this long mr toole is it dangerous what anthranilic acid like i said im not a doctor its not poisonous if thats what you mean but its not vitamins either any drug can do you dirt if youre unusually sensitive or allergic to it thanks kate said numbly and thanks to millicent too no problem ian toole said it was a hot sultry day at fenway park when kate seated in a box next to jared began to bleed to death silently painlessly thick drops of crimson fell from her nose landing like tiny artillery bursts on the surface of the beer she was holding turning the gold to pink she squeezed her nose with a napkin but almost instantly tasted the sticky sweetness flowing down the back of her throat jared unaware of what was happening sipped at his beer his attention riveted on the field help me please jared help me im dying the words were in her mind but somehow inaccessible to her voice help me please suddenly she felt a warm moistness inside her jeans and knew that she was bleeding there as well help me in the box to her right winfield samuels looked her way smiled emptily as if she werent even there and then turned back to the field and genteelly applauded a good play by the shortstop the players and the grass the spectators and the huge green left field wallall had a reddish cast kate rubbed a hand across one eye and realized she was also bleeding from there giddy with fear she stood and turned to run sitting in the row behind her chatting amiably and smiling as blandly as jareds father had were norton reese and a man with the overalls and gray hair of carl horner but the grotesque face of a monkey i see youre bleeding to death reese said pleasantly im so sorry carl arent you sorry jared please help me help me help me the words faded like an echo into eternity kate became aware of a gentle hand on her shoulder dr bennett are you all right kate lifted her head and blearily met the eyes of night watchman walter macfarlane she was at a table alone in the hospital library surrounded by dozens of books and journals dealing with bleeding disorders ovarian disease and pharmacology oh yes walter she said im fine thank you really her blouse was uncomfortably damp and the taste in her mouth most unpleasant just checking the man said its getting pretty late or should i say early he tapped a finger on the face of his large gold pocket watch and held it around for her to see twenty after two kate smiled weakly and began gathering her notes together ill see you to your car if you want doctor thanks walter ill meet you by the main entrance in five minutes she watched as the man shuffled from the library then she discarded the notion of calling jared knowing that she would just be adding insult to injury by waking him up and finished packing her briefcase as she neared the doorway she glanced out the window across the street the winter night reflected obscenely in its dark glass stood the omnicenter sunday december the night was heavy and raw crunching through slush that had begun to gel and shielding her face from blowgun darts of sleet kate crossed commercial street and plowed along hanover into the north end traffic and the weather had made her twenty minutes late but bill zimmermann was not the irritable impatient type and she anticipated a quick absolution demarscos the restaurant they had agreed upon was a small familyowned operation where parking was as difficult to find as an unexceptional item on the menu initially when kate had called and asked to meet with him zimmermann had proposed his office at the omnicenter it was perhaps among the last structures on earth she felt like entering on that night unfortunately if there were a list of such things demarscos his other suggestion might also have been on it demarscos was one of her and jareds favorite spots and now jared was gone a sort of separation but not a separation he had called it in the note she had found waiting for her at three oclock on saturday morning he had taken some things and gone to his fathers where he would stay until leaving for business in san diego on monday a sort of separation but not a separation there was no lengthy explanation no apology not even any anger but the hurt and confusion were there in every word it was as if he had just discovered that his wife was having an affairan upanddown intense emotionally draining affairnot with another man but with her job her career space for both of us to sort out the tensions and pressures on our lives without adding new ones he had written space for each of us to take a hard look at our priorities kate wondered if standing in the center of his fine paneled study his elegant mistress awaiting him on his black satin sheets winfield samuels jr had raised a glass to toast his victory over kate and the return of his son and to plan how to make a temporary situation permanent it was a distressing picture and probably not that far from reality however as distressing to her as the image of a gloating win samuels was the realization that her incongruous emotion at least at that moment and over the hour or so that followed before sleep took her was relief relief at being spared a confrontation relief at being alone to think someone was trying to sabotage her reputation and perhaps her career her close friend was lying in a hospital bed bleeding from a disorder that had killed at least two other womena disorder that had no definite cause let alone a cure and now there was the discovery that she herself had been exposed to contaminated vitamins that her own body might be a time bomb waiting to go offperhaps to bleed perhaps to die priorities why couldnt jared see their marriage as a blanket on which all the other priorities in their lives could be laid out and dealt with together why couldnt he see that their relationship neednt be an endless series of eitherors why couldnt he see that she could love him and still have a life of her own demarscos was on the first floor of a narrow brownstone there were a dozen tables covered with redandwhite checkered tablecloths and adorned with candledripped chianti bottlesa decor that might have been tacky but in demarscos simply wasnt bill zimmermann seated at a small table to the rear rose and waved as she entered he wore a dark sport jacket over a gray turtleneck and looked to her like a mix of the best of gary cooper and montgomery clift a maternal waitress perhaps the matriarch of the demarsco clan took her coat and ushered her to zimmermann with a look that said she approved of the woman for whom the tall dashing man at the rear table had been waiting they have a wonderful soave kate answered settling into her seat but youll have to drink most of it i havent been getting much sleep lately and when im tired more than one glass of wine is usually enough to cross my eyes i have no such problem unfortunately he said nodding that the ample waitress could fill his earlier order sometimes i fear that my liver will desert me before my brain even knows i have been drinking it is one of the curses of being european i stopped by the hospital earlier to see your friend mrs sandler i know i was with her just before i came here she was grateful for your visit whatever you said had a markedly reassuring effect kate smiled inwardly remembering the girlish exchange she and ellen had had regarding the omnicenter directors uncommon good looks and marital status maybe i could rent him for a night ellen had said just to parade past sandy a time or two zimmermann tapped his fingertips together the lab reports show very little change i know kate said if anything theyre worse unless there are several days in a row of improvement or at least stability i dont think her hematologist will send her home she felt a heaviness in her chest as her mind replayed the gruesome scene on ashburton five during beverly vitales last minutes ellens counts were not yet down to critical levels but there were so many unknowns a sudden precipitous fall seemed quite possible the stream of thoughts flowed into the question of whether with ian tooles findings kate herself should have some clotting measurements done she discarded the notion almost as quickly as she recognized it i hope as you do that there will be improvement zimmermann said he paused and then scanned the menu what will it be for you he asked finally im not too hungry how about an antipasto some garlic bread and a side order of peace of mind zimmermanns bluegray eyes still fixed on the leatherenclosed menu narrowed a fraction that bad kate chewed at her lower lip and nodded suddenly very glad she had gone the route of calling him if as seemed possible a confrontation with redding pharmaceuticals was to happen it would be good to have an ally with bill zimmermanns composure and assuredness especially considering the fragility of her own selfconfidence in that case perhaps i had best eat light also zimmermann called the waitress over with a microscopic nod and ordered identical meals i want to thank you for coming out on such a grisly night kate began there have been some new developments in my efforts to make sense out of the three bleeding cases and i wanted to share them with you oh zimmermanns expression grew more attentive you know ive had sample after sample of medications from the omnicenter analyzed at the state toxicology lab yes of course but i thought the results had all been unremarkable they were until late friday afternoon one of the vitamin samples i had analyzed contained a painkiller called anthranilic acid the basic chemical structure of the drug is contained in several commerical productsby mid from sampson pharmaceuticals and levonide from freemangannett to name two however the form contaminating the vitamins is something newat least in this country ian toole at the state lab is going to check the european manuals and call me tomorrow is he sure of the results he seemed to be i dont know the man personally but he has a reputation for thoroughness what do you think happened contamination kate shrugged that there was no other explanation that made any sense either at redding pharmaceuticals or perhaps at one of the suppliers of the vitamin components although i would suspect that a company as large as redding can do all the manufacturing themselves yes i agree do you think this anthranilic acid has caused the bleeding disorders in our three women bleeding and ovarian disorders kate added at least ovarian in two of the women we dont know about ellen the answer to your question is i dont know and i certainly hope not why because bill the vitamins that were finally positive for something were mine ones you prescribed for me zimmermann paled the waitress arrived with their antipasto but he did not so much as glance up at her jesus he said softly it was the first time kate had ever heard him use invective of any kind are you sure this toole couldnt have made a mistake you said yourself there were any number of samples that were negative anythings possible she said i suppose ian toole and his spectrophotometer are no more exempt from error than redding pharmaceuticals do you have more of a sample can we have the findings rechecked at another lab kate shook her head it was an old prescription there were only half a dozen left i think he used them all zimmermann tried picking at his meal but quickly gave up i dont mean to sound doubtful about what you are saying kate but you see whats at stake here dont you of course i do and i understand your skepticism if i were in your position and the omnicenter were my baby id want to be sure too but bill the situation is desperate two women have died my friend is lying up there bleeding and i have been unknowingly taking a medication that was never prescribed for me someone in or around reddings generic drug department has made an error and i think we should file a report with the fda as quickly as possible i spoke to the head pharmacist at metro about how one goes about reporting problems with a drug did you mention the omnicenter specifically zimmermann asked i may be nervous and frightened about all this bill but im neither dumb nor insensitive no everything i asked him was hypothe ical thank you nonsense grandstand plays arent my style she smiled despite what the papers and all those angry red sox fans think any decisions concerning the omnicenter we make together kate nibbled on the edge of a piece of garlic bread and suddenly realized that for the first time since returning home to jareds note she had an appetite perhaps after the incredible frustrations of the week past she was feeling the effects of finally doing something she passed the basket across to zimmermann here she offered have a piece of this before it gets cold zimmermann accepted the offering but deep concern continued to darken his face what did the pharmacist tell you theres an agency called the u s pharmacopia independent of both the fda and the drug industry but in close touch with both they run a drugproblem reporting program fill out a form and send it to them and they send a copy to the fda and to the company involved do you know what happens then not really i assume an investigator from the fda is assigned to look into matters and the great bureaucratic dragon rears its ugly head what have you had many dealings with the fda speed and efficiency are hardly their most important products no ones fault really the fda has some pretty sharp peopleonly not nearly enough of them what else can we do absently kate rolled a black olive off its lettuce hillock and ate it along with several thin strips of prosciutto i need help as it is im spending every spare moment in the library ive even asked the national institutes of health library to run a computer cross on blood and ovarian disorders they should be sending me a bibliography tomorrow ive sent our slides to four other pathologists to see if anyone can make a connection the fda seems like the only remaining move the fda may be a necessary move but it is hardly our only one first of all i want to speak with carl horner and our pharmacist and see to it that the use of any redding products by our facility will be suspended until we have some answers excellent will you have to bring in extra pharmacists yes but weve had contingency plans in place in case of some kind of computer failure since well since even before i took over as director well manage as long as necessary lets hope it wont be too long kate said again thinking of beverly vitales lifeless bloodsmeared face if we go right to the fda it might be pardon kate i think our first move should be to contact redding pharmaceuticals directly i think the company deserves that kind of consideration for the way theyve stood up for orphan drugs and for all the other things theyve done to help the medical community and society as a whole besides in any contest between the bureaucratic dragon and private industry my money is on industry every time i think its only fair to the omnicenter and our patients to get to the bottom of matters as quickly as possible kate sipped pensively at her wine i see what you mean sort of she said couldnt we do both i mean contact redding and notify the fda we could but then we lose our stick our prod if you will the folks at redding will probably bend over backward to avoid the black eye of an fda probe i know they will ive had experience with other pharmaceutical housesones not as responsive and responsible as redding they would go to almost any length to identify and correct problems within their company without outside intervention that makes sense i guess she said you sound uncertain kate listen whatever we do we should do together you said that yourself ive given you reasons for my point of view but im by no means inflexible zimmermann drained the last half of his glass and refilled it kate hesitated and then said i have this thing about the pharmaceutical industry its a problem in trust they spend millions and millions of dollars on giveaways to medical students and physicians they support dozens upon dozens of throwaway journals and magazines with their ads i get fifty publications a month i never ordered and i dont even write prescriptions i can imagine how many you get zimmermann nodded that he understood in addition i have serious questions about their prioritiesyou know who comes first in any conflict between profit and people what do you mean well look at valium roche introduces the drug and markets it well and the public literally eats it up its a tranquilizer a downer yet in no time at all it becomes the most prescribed and taken drug in the country unfortunately it turns out to be more addicting than most physicians appreciated at first and lives begin to get ruined meanwhile a dozen or so other drug houses put out a dozen or so versions of valium each with its own name and its own claim slower acting faster acting lasts all night removed more rapidly some busy physicians get so lost in the advertising and promises that they actually end up prescribing two of these variants to the same patient at the same time others think theyre doing their patients a big favor by switching some favor pardon me for saying it kate but you sound a little less than objective im afraid you hear right she said i had some emotional stresses back in college and the old country doctor who served the school put me on valium it took a whole team of specialists to realize how much my life came to revolve around those little yellow discs finally i had to be hospitalized and detoxed so i just have this nagging feeling that the drug companies cant be trusted thats all zimmermann leaned back rubbed his chin and sighed i dont know what to say if speed is essential in solving this problem as we both think it is then the route to go is the company im sure of that he paused tell you what lets give them this coming week to straighten out matters to our satisfaction if they havent done so by friday we call in the fda sound fair kate hesitated but then nodded yes she said finally it sounds fair and it sounds right do you want to call them zimmermann shrugged sure he said ill do it first thing tomorrow theyll probably be contacting you by the end of the day the sooner the better meanwhile do you think you could talk to some of your omnicenter patients and get me a list of women who would be willing to be contacted by me about having their medications analyzed i certainly can try excellent its about time things started moving in a positive direction you know theres not much good i can say about all thats been happening except that im glad our relationship has moved out of the doctorpatient and doctordoctor cubbyholes into the personperson right now im the one who needs the help but please know that if its ever you youve got a friend you can count on zimmermann smiled a cary grant smile that kind of friend is hard to come by he said thank you thank you except for tom engleson ive felt pretty much alone in all this now were a team she motioned the waitress over coffee the woman asked none for me thanks bill zimmermann shook his head in that case could i have the check please nonsense zimmermann said i wont the reproving look in kates eyes stopped him in midsentence allow you to do this too many times without reciprocating kate beamed at the mans insight deal she said smiling broadly deal zimmermann echoed the two shook hands warmly and after kate had settled their bill walked together into the winter night numb with exhaustion john ferguson squinted at the luminescent green print on the screen of his word processor his back ached from hunching over the keyboard for the better part of two full days his hands feeling the effects of his disease more acutely than at any time in months groped for words one careful letter at a time it had been an agonizing effort condensing forty years of complex research into thirty pages or so of scholarly dissertation but a sentence at a time a word at a time he was making progress to one side of his desk were a dozen internationally read medical journals ferguson had given thought to submitting his completed manuscript to all of them but then had reconsidered the honor of publishing his work would go only to the new england journal of medicine most prestigious and widely read of them all the new england journal of medicine ferguson tapped out a recall code and in seconds the title page of his article was displayed on the screen studies in estronate a synthetic estrogen congener and antifertility hormone john n ferguson md it would almost certainly be the first time in the long distinguished publication of the journal that an entire issue would be devoted to a single article but they would agree to do that or find the historic studies and comment in lancet or the american journal of medicine ferguson smiled once the new england journals editors had reviewed his data and his slides he doubted there would be much resistance to honoring his request for a time he studied the page then electronically he erased the name of the author there might be trouble for him down the road for what he was about to do but he suspected not he was too old and too sick even for the fanatic simon weisenthal to bother with with a deliberateness that helped him savor the act he typed wilhelm w becker md phd where fergusons name had been perhaps he thought with a smile some sort of brief funeral was in order for ferguson he had after all died twiceonce in bataan forty years ago and a second time this night with the consummate discipline that had marked his life willi becker cut short the pleasurable interlude and advanced the text to the spot at which he had left off because of a pathologist named bennett cyrus redding had picked up the scent of his work at the omnicenter knowing the man as well as becker did he felt certain the tycoon would now track the matter relentlessly there was still time to put the work on paper and mail it off but no way of knowing how much he had to push he had to fight the fatigue and the aching in his muscles and push at least for another hour or two the onset of his scientific immortality was at hand furtively he glanced at the small bottle of amphetamines on the table it had been only three hours much too soon especially with the irregular heartbeats he had been having still he needed to push it would only be a few more days perhaps less barely able to grip the top of the small vial becker set one of the black coated tablets on his tongue and swallowed it without water in minutes the warm rush would begin and he would have the drive however artificial and short lived to overcome the inertia of his myasthenia you really shouldnt take those you know father especially with your cardiac history becker spun around to face his son cursing the diminution in his hearing that enabled such surprises i take them because i need them he said sharply what are you doing sneaking up on me like that what do you think doorbells are for such a greeting and here i have driven out of my way to stop by and be certain you are all right three blocks becker thought some hardship you startled me thats all im sorry for reacting the way i did in that case father it is i who should be sorry was there sarcasm in his sons voice it bothered becker that he had never been able to read the man theirs was a relationship based on filial obligation and respect but little if any love for the greater portion of his sons years they had lived apart becker in a small cottage on the hospital grounds where he worked and his wife and son in an apartment twenty miles away it was as necessary an arrangement as it was painful becker and his wife had tried for years to make their son understand that there were those they tried to explain who would arrest becker in a moment on a series of unjust charges put him in prison and possibly even put him to death in the hysteria following the war he had been marked simply because he was german nothing more than that for their own safety it was necessary for the boy and his mother to keep their address and even their name separate from his although becker would provide for them and would visit as much as he could no one would ever know his true relationship to the woman anna zimmermann and the boy william so becker said now that we have apologized profusely to one another come in sit down pour yourself a drink william zimmermann nodded his thanks poured an inch of wild turkey into a heavy glass and settled into an easy chair opposite his father i see youve started putting your data together he said why now well i no special reason really it would seem that the modifications i made have greatly if not completely eliminated the bleeding problems we were experiencing with the estronate so what else is there to wait for which journal will you approach i think the new england journal of medicine i plan to submit the data and discussion but to withhold several key steps in the synthesis until a commission of the journals choosing can take charge of my formulas and decide how society can best benefit from them sounds fine to me zimmermann said with all thats been happening this last week the sooner i see the last of estronate twofifty the better have any further bleeding cases turned up zimmermann shook his head just the sandler woman i told you about the one whos the friend of dr bennetts she was treated over eighteen months ago in the julyaugust group the last group to receive the unmodified estronate how is she doing i think she is going to end up like the other two couldnt you find some way of suggesting that they try a course of massive doses of delta amino caproic acid and nicotinic acid on her not without risking a lot of questions id rather not answer i mean i am a gynecologist not a hematologist besides you told me that that therapy was only sixty percent effective in such advanced states becker shrugged sixty percent is sixty percent and my career is my career no father i have far too much to lose i am afraid mrs sandler will just have to make it on her own perhaps you are right becker said the men shook hands formally and william zimmermann let himself out twelve miles away on the fourth floor of the berenson building of metropolitan hospital of boston in room ellen sandlers nose had again begun to bleed monday december now suzy promise daddy that you will mind what mommy tells you and that you will never never do that to the cat again good i have to go now sugar you better get ready for your piano lesson i know what i said but my work here isnt done yet and i have to stay until its finished i dont know two maybe three more days suzy stop that youre not a baby i love you very much and ill see you very soon now tell daddy you love him and go practice that new piece of yours suzy damn arlen paquette slammed the receiver down he had protested to redding the futility of remaining in boston over the weekend but the man had insisted he stay close to the situation and the omnicenter as usual events had proven redding right paquette stuffed some notes in his briefcase and pulled on his suitcoat right for redding pharmaceuticals but not for suzy paquette who was justifiably smarting over her fathers absence from her school track meet earlier in the day how could he explain to a sevenyearold that the very thing that was keeping him away from home was also the sole reason she could attend a school like hightower academy he straightened his tie and combed his thinning hair with his fingers how could he explain it to her when he was having trouble justifying it to himself still for what he and his family were gaining from his association with redding the dues were not excessive he glanced down at the photographs of kate bennett piled on the coffee table at least he thought not yet the cab ride from the ritz to metropolitan hospital took fifteen minutes paquette entered the main lobby through newly installed gliding electronic doors and headed directly for norton reeses office half expecting to have the woman whose life and face he had studied in such detail stroll out from a side corridor and bump into him arlen its good to see you youre looking well norton reese maneuvered free of his desk chair and met paquette halfway with an illdefined handshake theirs was more an unspoken truce than a relationship and no amount of time would compensate for the lack of trust and respect each bore the other however paquette was the envoy of cyrus redding and the several millions of redding dollars that had sparked reeses rise to prominence although it was reeses court it was the younger mans ball youre looking fit yourself norton paquette replied our mutual friend sends his respects and regards did you tell him about our speed freak outfielder and the letters to the press and tv i did i even sent a packet of the articles and editorials to him by messenger he commends your ingenuity so incidentally do i try as he might he could put no emotion behind the compliment still reeses moon face bunched in a grin its been beautiful arlen he gushed just beautiful i tell you ever since that story broke kathryn bennett md has been racing all over trying to stick her fingers in the holes that are popping open in her reputation by now i doubt if she would know whether she had lost a horse or found a rope you did fine norton just fine only for our purposes not enough what reese began to shift uneasily a diversion thats what horner asked me for and by god thats what i laid on that woman a goddamn avalanche of diversion you did fine norton i just told you that why shes had so much negative publicity its a wonder she hasnt quit or been fired by the medical school reese chattered on as if he hadnt heard a word in fact i hear the medical school ethics committee is planning some kind of an inquiry paquette silenced him with raised hands easy norton please he said evenly im going to say it one more time what you did the letter and all was exactly what we asked of you our mutual friend is pleased he asked that i convey to you the ashburton foundations intention to endow the cardiac surgical residency you wrote him about well then why was what i did not enough reese realized that in his haste to defend himself he had forgotten to acknowledge reddings generosity before he could remedy the oversight paquette spoke ill convey your thanks when i return to darlington he said a note of irritation in his words norton do you know what has been going on here not not exactly he said nonplussed paquette nodded indulgently dr bennett in her search to identify the cause of an unusual bleeding problem in several women has zeroed in on the omnicenter although the women were omnicenter patients we see no other connection among them the the work youre doing i mean none of the women got after years of scrupulously avoiding the omnicenter and the people involved in its operation reese was uncertain of how even to discuss the place paquette spared him further stammering from time to time each of the women was involved in the evaluation of one or more products he said however carl horner assures me that there have been no products common to the three of them whatever the cause of their problem it is not the omnicenter thats a relief reese said not really paquette said his expression belying his impatience you see our dr bennett has been most persistent despite the pressures brought about by your letter shes a royal pain in the ass ill grant you that reese interjected she has tested several omnicenter products at the state toxicology lab charging the analyses i might add to your hospital damn her she didnt find anything did she horner assured me that there was nothing to worry about paquettes patience continued to fray of course she found something norton thats why im here she even had dr zimmermann phone the company to tell us about it oh sorry our friend in kentucky has asked that we step up our efforts to discredit dr bennett and to add what was the word you used distraction no diversion that was itdiversion to her life we have taken steps to obscure if not neutralize her findings to date but there is evidence in dozens of medicine cabinets out there of what we have been doing if dr bennett is persistent enough she will find it i am completely convinced of that and so is our friend dr bennett has given us one week to determine how a certain experimental painkiller came to be in a set of vitamins dispensed at the omnicenter if we do not furnish her with a satisfactory explanation by that time she intends to file a report with the us pharmacopia and the fda damn her norton reese said again what are we going to do not we you dr bennetts credibility must be reduced to the point where no amount of evidence will be enough for authorities to take her word over ours the letter you wrote was a start but as i said not enough once again reese began to feel ill at ease paquette was not making a request he was giving an orderan order from the man who reese knew could squash him with nothing more than the eraser on his pencil he unbuttoned his vest against the uncomfortable moistness between the folds of his skin look he pleaded i really dont know what i can do ill try but i dont know youve got to understand arlen youve got to make him understand bennett works in my hospital but she doesnt work for me there was understanding in paquettes face but not sympathy reese continued his increasingly nervous rambling besides the womans got friends around here i dont know why but she does even after that letter shes got supporters shit id kill to make sure she didnt his voice trailed away his eyes narrowed paquette followed the mans train of thought the answer is no norton he said absolutely not we wish her discredited not eliminated for gods sake we want people to lose interest in her not to canonize her she has already involved dr zimmermann a chemist at the state lab and a resident here named engleson there may be others but as far as we can tell the situation is not yet out of control we are doing what we can do to ensure it remains that way dr bennetts fatherinlaw does some business with our company i believe our friend has already called him and enlisted his aid there are other steps being taken as well he rose and reached across the desk to shake reeses hand i know we can count on you if you need advice or a sounding board you can reach me at the ritz thank you reese said numbly his bulk seemed melted into his chair paquette walked slowly to the door then turned our friend has suggested thursday as a time by which he wants something to have been done thursday reese croaked paquette nodded smiled blankly and was gone half an hour later his shirt changed and his composure nearly regained reese sat opposite sheila pierce straightening one paper clip after another and thinking much more than he wanted to at that particular moment of the chief technicians breasts howre things going down there in pathology he asked wondering if she would take off her lab coat and then reminding himself to concentrate on business the woman was going to require delicate handling if she was going to put her neck on the line to save his ass you mean with bennett sheila shrugged shes getting some letters and a few crank phone calls every day but otherwise things seem pretty much back to normal its been amusing well reese said i know for a fact that the bobby geary business is hardly a dead issue oh ive heard the matters going to the medical school ethics committee good sheila said that will serve her right going to the newspapers about that poor boy the way she did they laughed do you think she went on that it will be enough to keep her from becoming chief of our department inwardly reese smiled the question was just the opening he needed doubtful he said grimly very doubtful too bad you dont know the half of it what do you mean well he tapped a pencil eraser on his desk he closed his eyes and massaged the bridge of his nose he chewed at his lower lip i got a call this morning from dr willoughby he requested a meeting with the finance and budget committee of the board at which time he and kate bennett are going to present the results of a computer study shes just completed they plan to ask for six months worth of emergency funding until a sweeping departmental reorganization can be completed sheila pierce paled sweeping departmental reorganization thats what the man said did he say anything about you know reese sighed as a matter of fact baby he did he said that by the time of the meeting next week bennett will have presented him with a complete list of lost revenues including the misappropriation of funds by several department members but she promised i guess a few brownie points with the boss and the board of trustees outweigh her promise to a plain old technician chief technician she corrected damn her did it seem as if she had already said something about me to willoughby the bait taken reese set the hook definitely not i probed as much as i could about you without making willoughby suspicious she hasnt told him anything specific yet norty weve got to stop her i cant afford to lose my job dammit ive been here longer than she has much longer her hands were clenched white her jaw set in anger and frustration well reese said with exaggerated reason weve got two days three at the most any ideas ideas i dont work with the woman baby you do doesnt she ever fuck up blow a case christ the rest of the mds in this place do it all the time shes a pathologist norty her cases are all dead to begin with theres nothing for her to blow except she stopped in midsentence and pulled a typed sheet from her lab coat pocket what is it its the surgical path schedule for tomorrow bennett and dr huang are doing frozen sections this month she scanned the entries well sheila hesitated uncertainty darkening her eyes are you sure shes going to report me to willoughby baby all i can say is that dr willoughby asked me for a copy of the union contract expressly for the part dealing with justifiable causes for termination she has no right to do that to me after she promised not to you know about people with md degrees sheila they think theyre better and smarter than the rest of us they think they can just walk all over people sheilas eyes told him that the battlethis phase of it at any ratewas won well see whos smarter she muttered tapping the schedule thoughtfully maybe its time bennett found out that there are a few people with brains around who couldnt go to medical school make it good baby reese urged because if shes in youre out no way she said theres no way im going to let that happen here look at this what well you can see its a pretty busy schedule theres a lung biopsy a thyroid biopsy a colon and two breast biopsies bennett will be working almost all day in the small cryostat lab next to the operating rooms usually she goes into the or picks up a specimen freezes it in the cryostat sections it stains it and reads it all without leaving the surgical suite and well there are a lot of ifs sheila said in an even almost singsong voice but if we could disable the surgical cryostat and force bennett to use the backup unit down in the histology lab i might be able somehow to switch a specimen all i would need is about three or four minutes what would that do sheila smiled the smile of a child well with any luck depending on the actual pathology we can have the great dr bennett read a benign condition as a malignancy then when the whole specimen is taken and examined the next day her mistake will become apparent would a pathologist make a mistake like that reese asked again sheila smiled only once she said serenely only once louisburg square a score of tall brick townhouses surrounding a raggedy wroughtironfenced green on the west side of beacon hill had been the address in boston for generations levi morton lived there after his four years as vice president under benjamin harrison jennie lind was married there in cabots and saltonstalls lodges and alcottsalll had drawn from and given to the mystique of louisburg square kate had the cab drop her off at the foot of mount vernon street she used the steep twoblock walk to louisburg square to stretch her legs and clear her thoughts of what had been a long and trying day at the hospital two committee meetings several surgical specimens and a lecture at the medical school combined with half a dozen malicious phone calls and an equal number of hate letters all relating to her callous treatment of bobby geary and his family ellens nose had begun bleeding againjust a slow trickle from one nostril but enough to require pete colangelo to recauterize it her clotting parameters were continuing to take a significant drop each day and the unencouraging news was beginning to take a toll on her spirit late that afternoon the national institutes of health library computer search had arrived there were many articles listed in the bibliography dealing with sclerosing diseases of the ovaries and a goodly number on clotting disorders similar to the boston cases there were none however describing their coexistence in a single patient expecting little kate had begun the tedious process of locating each article photocopying it and finally studying it the project would take days to complete if not longer but there was a chance at least that something anything might turn up that could help ellen at the turnoff from mount vernon street kate propped herself against a gaslight lamp post and through the mist of her own breath reflected on the marvelous christmas card that was louisburg square single orangebulbed candles glowed from nearly every townhouse window tasteful wreaths marked each door christmas trees had been carefully placed to augment the scene without intruding on it having season after season observed the stolid elegance of louisburg square kate had no difficulty understanding why shortly after the death of his agrarian wife winfield samuels had sold their gentlemans farm and stables in sudbury and had bought there the twothe address and the manwere made for one another somewhat reluctantly she mounted the granite steps of her fatherinlaws home eschewed the enormous brass knocker and pressed the bell in seconds the door was opened by a trim extremely attractive brunette no more than two or three years kates senior dressed in a gold blouse and dark straight skirt she looked every bit the part of the executive secretary which in fact she had at one time been kate welcome she said warmly come in let me take your coat ive got it thanks you look terrific jocelyn is that a new hairstyle a few months old thanks for noticing youre looking well yourself kate wondered if perhaps she and jocelyn trent could collaborate on a chapter for amy vanderbilt or emily post proper conversation between a daughterinlaw and her fatherinlaws mistress when the fatherinlaw in question refuses to acknowledge the woman as anything other than a housekeeper mr samuels will be down in a few minutes jocelyn said theres a nice fire going in the study hell meet you there dinner will be in half an hour can i fix you a drink mr samuels the inappropriate formality made kate queasy at seven oclock the woman would serve to mr samuels and his guest the gourmet dinner she had prepared then she would go and eat in the kitchen at eleven or twelve oclock after the house was quiet and dark she would slip into his room and stay as long as she was asked always careful to return to her own quarters before any houseguest awoke mr samuels indeed sure said kate following the woman to the study better make it something stiff as you can tell from your houseguest the last few days things have not been going too well in my world jocelyn smiled understandingly for what its worth she said i dont think jared is very pleased with the arrangement either i appreciate hearing that jocelyn thank you ill tell you on any given sunday in any given ballpark marriage can trounce any team in the league when she could detach the woman from her position kate liked her very much and enjoyed the occasional onetoone conversations they were able to share i know jocelyn said i tried it once myself for me it was all of the responsibility none of the pleasure the words were said lightly but kate heard in them perhaps an explanation of sorts a plea for understanding and acceptance better to be owned than to be used kate took the bourbon and water and watched as jocelyn trent returned to the kitchen the woman had she knew a wardrobe several times the size of her own a remarkable silver fox coat and a stylish alfa coupe if this be slavery she thought with a smile then give me slavery it was as promised several minutes before winfield samuels made his entrance kate waited by the deep wellused fireplace rearranging the fringe on the persian rug with the toe of her shoe and trying to avoid eye contact with any of the biggame heads mounted on the wall samuels had sent jared away on businesspurposely he made it sound so that he and kate could spend some time alone together talking over issues of mutual concern before her marriage they had met on several occasions for such talks but since their time together had always included jared samuels had given no hint over the phone as to what the issues this time might be but the separationcauses and cureswas sure to be high on the list kate was reading a citation of commendation and gratitude from the governor when the recipient entered the room kate welcome win samuels said im so glad you could make it on such short notice they embraced with hands on shoulders and exchanged air kisses sit down please we have he consulted his watch twentythree minutes before dinner twentythree minutes kate had to hand it to the man dinner at seven did not mean dinner at sevenohthree it was expected that the stunning cook cum housekeeper cum mistress would be right on time thank you she said its good to see you again you look great the compliment was not exaggeration in his twill smoking jacket and white silk scarf samuels looked like most men nearing seventy could only dream of looking rejuvenate that drink samuels asked motioning her to one of a pair of matched leather easy chairs by the hearth only if youre prepared to resuscitate me samuels laughed and drew himself a bourbon and soda youre quite a woman kate he said settling in across from her jared is lucky to have nabbed you actually i did most of the nabbing this this little disagreement you two are having it will blow over before you know it probably has already the empty half of my bed wouldnt attest to that kate said samuels slid a cigar from a humidor by his chair considered it for a moment and then returned it bad for the taste buds this close to dinner particularly with jocelyns duck lorange on the menu shes a very nice woman kate ventured samuels nodded does a good job around here he said in an absurdly businesslike tone damn good job he paused im a direct man kate some people say too direct but i dont give a tinkers damn about them suppose i get right to the business at hand you mean this wasnt just a social invitation samuels was leaping to equivocate when he saw the smile in her eyes and at the corners of her mouth do you zing jared like this too he asked kate smiled proudly and nodded they laughed but kate felt no letup in the tension between them kate he continued ive accomplished the things ive accomplished gained the things ive gained because i was brought up to believe that we are never given a wish or a dream without also being given the wherewithal to make that dream that wish a reality do you share that belief kate shrugged i believe there are times when its okay to wish and try and fail perhaps he said thoughtfully perhaps there are anyhow at this stage in my life i have two overriding dreams both of them involve my son and therefore by extension you go on kate i want a grandchild hopefully more than one and i want my son to serve in the united states congress those are my dreams and i am willing to do anything within my power to help them come to pass why kate asked why yes i understand the grandchild wish continuation of the family stability for jareds home life new blood and new energy that sort of thing but why the other one because i feel jared would be a credit to himself to the state and to the country so do i and i think it would be a fulfilling experience for him perhaps samuels hesitated before adding and finally it is a goal i held for myself and never could achieve do you think me horrid for wanting my son to have what i could not no kate responded provided it is something jared wants too for reasons independent of yours the time in life when a father no longer knows what is best for his son is certainly moot isnt it win what you want for jared what you want for me too will always matter but the hardest part about loving someone is letting him figure out whats best for himself especially when you already knowor at least think you know and you think im forcing my will on jared you have a tremendous amount of influence on him she replied i dont think im giving away any great secrets by saying that samuels nodded thoughtfully kate he said finally humor this old man and let me change the subject a bit okay old man give me a break counselor she wanted to snap instead she sat forward smiled and simply said sure why do you want to be the chief of pathology at metro kate met his gaze levelly and said silent thanks for the hours she had spent answering that question for herself because it would be a fascinating experience because i think i could do a credible job because my workand my departmentmean a great deal to me because i feel a person either grows or dies jared tells me you feel accepting the position will delay your being able to start your family for at least two years actually i said one or two years but two seems a reasonable guess samuels rose slowly and walked to the window and then back to the fire if he was preparing to say something dramatic she acknowledged he was doing a laudable job of setting it up kate he said still staring at the fire when i phoned i invited you to stay the night if you could are you going to be able to do that i had planned on it yes actually the invitation had been worded in a way that would have made it nearly impossible for her to refuse good id like to take you for a ride after dinner a ride and a visit i i know i sound mysterious but for the moment youll have to indulge me this is something i never thought i would be doing there was a huskiness an emotion to the mans voice that kate had never heard before was he near crying for half a minute there was silence save for the low hiss of the fire but when her fatherinlaw turned to her his composure had returned kate he said as if the moment by the fire had never happened do you think that you are ready to handle the responsibilities of a whole department she thought for a moment this may sound funny but in a way it doesnt matter what i think you see dr willoughby the only person who knows both me and the job thinks i can handle it its like becoming a doctoror for that matter a lawyer you only decide you want to do it theythe bar or the medical examinersdecide whether or not you can and should from then on your only obligation is to do your best she paused does that sound smug not really i hope not win because actually im scared stiff about a lot of things im frightened of taking the job and im frightened of not taking it im frightened of having children and im frightened of not having them and most of all i am frightened of having to face the dilemma of either losing my husband or losing myself there are other possibilities samuels said i know that but im not sure jared does and to be perfectly honest until this moment i wasnt sure you did either there are always other possibilities he said with a tone that suggested he had voiced that belief before kate you know hospital politics are no different from any other kind of politics theres power involved and theres money involved and that means there are things like this handbill involved he took the garish orange flyer from his desk drawer and held it up for her to see kate shuddered at the sight of it do you think that brilliant effort was aimed at me or at jared she asked the truth is it makes no difference politics is politics the minute you start playing the game you have enemies if they happen to be better at the game than you are you get buried its that simple he held up the flyer again my sense of this whole businessassuming of course that you didnt send bobby gearys autopsy report to the papers is that someone is determined to keep you from becoming head of your department if they have any kind of power or access to power your department could suffer dearly my department certainly your people end up overworked because of staffing cutbacks and outmoded equipment turnover is high morale low quality of work drops sooner or later theres a mistake you may be the best pathologist in the world kate and the bestintentioned administrator but unless you play the politics game and get past the competition to people like the ashburton foundation you will end up an unhappy harried unfulfilled failure and take it from me winning that game means plenty of sacrifice it means that if you know the competition is getting up at six you damn well better be up at fivethirty i appreciate your thoughts she said i really do all i can say is that the final decision hasnt been made yet and that i was hoping to work the whole thing out with jared but you have okayed submission of your name yes she said averting her gaze for the first time yes i have samuels turned and walked again toward the window for a time there was only the fire say win she said hoping to lead them in other directions how much do you know about the ashburton foundation he turned back to her i really dont know anything in the early days of their involvement here my firm handled some of their correspondence with the hospital but i havent dealt with them in years why just some research ive been doing at work nothing really do you by any chance have their address i dont know samuels said somewhat distractedly in the rolodex over there on my desk perhaps i really dont know kate you know it is my way to reason not to beg but for the sake of my son and myself if not for yourself im begging you to put the chairmanship on the back burner and devote yourself for a few years to your family and to helping jared get his foot in the political door at that instant a chime sounded from the kitchen kate glanced instinctively at her watch but she knew that it was exactly seven oclock she rose when is jared due back she asked wednesday or thursday i suspect win i have no response to what you just asked you know that dont you perhaps before too much longer you might let us eat after our meal there is a trip we must take with a faint smile samuels nodded kate toward the dining room and then took her elbow and guided her through the door the iv nurse a squareshouldered woman overweight by at least thirty pounds rubbed alcohol on the back of ellen sandlers left hand slapped the area a dozen times and then swabbed it again now ellen she said in the patronizing demeaning tone ellen had come to label hospitalese youve got to relax your veins are in spasm if you dont relax it will take all night for me to get this iv in relax ellen glared at the woman who was hunched over her hand cant you tell im frightened cant you see im scared out of my wits by all thats happening to me take a minute just a minute and talk to me ask me and ill try to explain ill tell you how it feels to be seven years old i and to learn that your father who entered the hospital for a little operation has been taken to a funeral home in a long box with handles relax why not ask me to float off this bed or better still just demand that i make the blood in my body start clotting so youll be spared the inconvenience of having to plunge that needle into the back of my hand relax i im trying she said meekly good now youre going to feel a little stick ellen grabbed the bedrail with her free hand as electric pain from the little stick shot up her arm got it the nurse said excitedly now dont move dont move until i get it taped down okay you know she continued as she taped the plastic cathe er in place youve got the toughest veins ive seen in a long time ellen didnt answer instead she stared at the ceiling tasting the salt of the tears running over her cheeks and into the corners of her mouth and wondering where it was all going to end apparently blood had begun appearing in her bowel movements the intravenous line was according to the resident who announced she was going to have it merely a precaution he had neglected to tell her what it was a precaution against okay ellen were all set the nurse announced stepping back to admire her handiwork just dont use that hand too much all right ellen pushed the tears off her cheeks with the back of her right hand sure she said the woman managed an uncomfortable smile and backed from the room it isnt fair with no little disgust ellen examined the iv dripping saline into her hand then she shut off the overhead light and lay in the semidarkness listening to the sighs of her own breathing and the still alien sounds of the hospital at night it isnt fair over and over her mind repeated the impotent protest until she was forced to laugh at it in spite of herself betsy eve darcy sandy the business her health why had she never appreciated how fragile it all was had she taken too much for granted asked too few questions dammit there were no answers anyhow what else could she do what else could anyone do here she was almost forty lying in a hospital bed possibly bleeding to death with no real sense of why she had been alive let alone why she should have been singled out to die it just wasnt fair a soft tap from the doorway intruded on her painful reveriestanding there silhouetted by the light from the hall was sandyhe was holding his uniform hat in one hand and a huge bouquet in the otherpermission to come aboard he said ellen could feel more than see or hear his discomfiture come on in she said want the light on i dont think so on second thought id like to see the flowers sandy flipped on the light and brought them to her then he bent over and kissed her on the forehead ellen stiffened for an instant and then relaxed to his gentle hug howre you doing he asked on which level any the flowers are beautiful thank you if you set them over by the sink ill have the nurse get a vase for them later on not so great huh he did as she asked with the bouquet then pulled a green vinyl chair to the bedside and sat down ellen switched off the overhead light you look nice in your uniform have you been home yet just long enough to drop off my things and look in on the girls how do they seem to you concerned confused a little frightened maybe but theyre okay i think it helped when your sister brought them up to see you yesterday ive moved back into the house until youre better you may be there a long time that bad kate says no but her eyes and now thisshe held up her left handsay something else but they dont really know do they no no i guess not well then you just gotta hang in there a day or an hour or if necessary a minute at a time and believe that everythings going to be all right ive taken an loa from the air line to be with the girls so you dont have anything to worry about on that account ill see to it that they get up here every day thanks i im grateful youre here nonsense weve been through a lot these nineteen years well make it through this softly ellen began to cry sandy i feel like such a a clod an oaf i know its dumb but thats how i feel not angry not even sick just helpless and clumsy well youre neither and no one knows that better than i do hey thats the second time youve yawned since i got here are you tired or just bored she smiled weakly not bored a little tired i guess it turns out that lying in bed all day doing nothing is exhausting then how about you dont pay any attention to me and just go to sleep if its okay with you ill sit here for a while thanks sandy its going to be okay you know i know he took her hand kates watching out for you right shes in twice a day and shes doing everything she can to find out why im bleeding her voice drifted off her eyes closed dont be afraid im not he said im not afraid its going to be okay the ride in win samuelss gray seville took most of an hour along a network of dark country roads heading south and east from the city they rode largely in silence samuels seeming to need total concentration to negotiate the narrow turns and kate staring out her window at dark pastures and even darker woods at times wondering about the purpose of their journey and at times allowing disconnected thoughts to careen through her mind jared stan willoughby bobby geary roscoe ellen tom even rosbeekes her elementary school principaleach made an appearance and then quickly faded and was replaced by the image of another were here samuels said at last turning onto a gravel drive stonefield school kate read the name from a discreet sign illuminated only by the headlights of their car what town is this no town really were either in southernmost massachusetts or northwestern rhode island depending on whose survey you use the school has been here for nearly fifty years but it was rebuilt about twentyfive years ago primarily with money from a fund my firm established the school was a low plain brick structure with a small wellkept lawn and a fencedin play area to one side to the other side a wing of unadorned red brick stretched towards the woods they entered the sparsely furnished lobby and were immediately met by a stout matronly woman wearing a navy skirt dull cardigan and an excessive number of gold bracelets and rings mr samuels she said its good to see you again thank you for calling ahead she turned to kate dr bennett im sally bicknell supervisor for the evening shift welcome to stonefield thank you kate said uncertainly im not exactly sure where i am or why were here but thank you anyway sally bicknell smiled knowingly took kate by the arm and led her down the hall to a large blue velvet curtain this is our playroom she said drawing the curtain with some flair to reveal the smoky glass of a oneway mirror the room beyond was large well lit and carpeted there were two tumbling mats a number of inflatable vinyl punching dummies and a stack of large building blocks mo one corner her back toward them a chunky girl with closecropped sandy hair hunched over a row of large cloth dolls shes never in bed much before two or three in the morning sally bicknell explained kate samuels said i brought you here because i thought that seeing this might help you understand some of my urgency as regards your moving forward with starting your family mrs bicknell the evening shift supervisor rapped loudly on the glass three times then three times again the girl in the playroom cocked her head to one side and then slowly turned around kate meet your sisterinlaw lindsey the girl was physically a monster her eyes were low set and narrow her facial features thick and coarse with heavy lips and twisted yellow teeth what little there was of her neck forced her head to the right at an unnatural angle her barrel chest merged with her abdomen and her legs were piteously bowed that cant be kate said softly her attention transfixed by the grotesquery jareds sister lindsey died when she was a child samuels finished the sentence for her im afraid his mother and i chose not to tell him the truth it seemed like the best idea at the time considering that we were assured lindsey would live only a few years she has hunters syndrome you are familiar with that yes kate nodded severe mental retardation and any number of other defects her mother my wife was nearly forty when she gave birth kate continued staring through the glass as the gargoylelike childno woman for she had to be in her thirtieslumbered aimlessly about the playroom reflected in the window kate saw the faces of sally bicknell and her fatherinlaw watching for her reaction you are the monster win samuels not that poor thing her thoughts screamed what do you think i am a piece worker in a factory did you think this this demonstration would frighten me do you think i know nothing of amniocentesis and prenatal diagnosis and counseling did you think i would just brush off the enormous lie you have been telling my husband for the past thirty years why why have you brought me here why havent you included jared take me home she ordered softly take me home now the antique clock on win samuelss huge desk said twofifty it had been nearly two hours since kate had abandoned her efforts to sleep and wandered into the study searching for reading matter distracting enough to close her mind to the events of the evening something was wrong something did not sit right in the bizarre scenario to which her fatherinlaw had treated her but what on the ride home from stonefield samuels had quietly assailed her with statistics relating maternal age to infertility fetal death chromosome abnormalities genetic mutation spontaneous abortions and mental retardation he had over many years apparently done his homework well the few arguments she had managed to give him on the accuracy of intrauterine diagnosis were countered with more facts and more statistics still nothing the man said could dispel her gut feeling that something was not right at one time during his presentationfor that is what it wasshe came close to crying out that their whole discussion was quite possibly a futile exercise because a production error at redding pharmaceuticals might have already cost her any chance of seeing her forties let alone conceiving in them from the direction of samuelss room on the second floor she heard a door open and then close softly seconds later the sound was repeated further down the hall jocelyn trent had returned to her room the study now divested of its fire was chilly and damp kate shuddered and tightened the robe jocelyn had given her it was only around midnight in san diego jared wouldnt mind a call she thought before realizing that she had forgotten to ask win at which hotel he was staying as she reached for a pad and pen to write herself a reminder she noticed samuelss rolodex file she spun it to a the man was right about having a card for the ashburton foundation on it were an address and a number that had been crossed out a second apparently newer address and number were written in below kate copied the new address and added a note to check in the morning on jareds hotel she glanced at the clock threefifteen how many surgicals were scheduled for the day five six too many desperate for sleep she took her note and an anthology of emily dickinson and padded up two flights of stairs to her room fortyfive minutes of reading were necessary before kate trusted the heaviness in her eyes and the impotence in her concentration enough to flip off the light the realization that her drowsiness was continuing to deepen brought a relieved contented smile then in her final moments of consciousness she sensed a troublesome notion it appeared then vanished then appeared again like a faint neon sign it was not the trip or the school or even the girl no it was the addressthe address of the ashburton foundation not the newer washington dc address but the one that was crossed out with each flash the neon grew dimmer the thoughts less distinct there was something she thought at the moment of darkness something special about darlington kentucky something tuesday december soundlessly kate unlocked the heavy oak door and slipped out of her fatherinlaws home into the gray glare of morning the deserted streets sidewalks and stone steps were covered with an immaculate dusting of white over the three days past a blizzard had crushed the midwest and moved unabated into the midatlantic states stepping gingerly down beacon hill toward charles street kate wondered if the feathery snow was perhaps the harbinger of that storm she had slept far too little her eyes were dry and irritated her temples constricted by the ache of exhaustionan ache she had not experienced so acutely since her days as a medical student and intern she thought about the surgicals scheduled to begin at ten oclock and run through most of the rest of the day with tensions thrusting at her life from one direction after another like the spears in some medieval torture she debated asking one of the others to take over for her no way she decided quickly as it was the members of her department were stretched beyond their limits stan willoughbys repeated requests for an additional pathologist had been laughed at no she was expected to do her part and she would find whatever concentration it took to do it right as she made her way toward the cab stand near white memorial kate began her morning ritual of mentally ticking off the events and responsibilities of her day the cab was halfway to metro when she ended the ritual as she inevitably did by scrambling through her purse for her daily calendar certain that she had forgotten something crucial her schedule was abbreviated due largely to a block of time marked simply surgicals penciled in at the bottom was the one item she had forgotten drinks with tom the three words triggered a surprising rush of feelings beginning with the reflex notion to call and cancel and ending with the sense of what her return home to an empty house would be like scattered in between were any number of images of the intense gangly resident who had been her staunchest supporter during the difficult days that had followed the biopsy of beverly vitale tom engleson was a man and a youth enthusiastic at times even to exuberance yet sensitive about people about medicine and especially about what her career involved and meant to her the prospect of an hour or two together in the corner of some dark leather and wood lounge might be just the carrot to get her through the day dammit jared she muttered as the cab rolled to a stop in front of her hospital i need you she began her day as she had each of the last several working days with a visit to room of the berenson building ellen was lying on her back staring at the wall her breakfast was untouched on the formica stand by her bed suspended from a ceiling hook a plastic bag drained saline into her arm hi kate said hi yourself ellens eyes were shadowed her skin seemed lacking in color and turgor bruises large and small lined both arms there was packing in one side of her nose kate set the cosmopolitan and morning globe she had brought on the stand next to the breakfast tray something news been added huh she nodded toward the iv last night a little while after you left kate raised ellen to a sitting position and then settled onto the bed by her knee they say why all theyll tell me is that its a precautionary measurex have you had some new bleeding in my bowel movements and i guess in my urine too she took a glass of orange juice from her tray and sipped at it absently thats probably why the iv kate said in case they have to inject any xray dye or give you any blood how much do you want to hear el give me a sign do you want to know about sudden massive hemorrhage about circulatory collapse sudden and severe enough to make emergency insertion of an intravenous line extremely difficult do you want to know about beverly vitale listen kate as long as youre on top of whats going on im satisfied good thank you my friend thank you for making it a little easier sandys back he flew in late last night and then moved into the house to look after the girls kate motioned to a vase of flowers by the window from him uhhuh so ellen shrugged no significance hes still on his way out i think i hope not are you what on my way out jesus sandler of course not ellen took her hand dont let me die katey okay count on it kate said having to work to keep from breaking down in front of her friend silently she vowed to place her efforts on ellens behalf ahead of every other task every other pressure in her life somewhere there was an answer and somehow she would find it listen ive got to go and get ready for some biopsies ill check on your lab tests and speak with you later this afternoon okay okay the word was spiritless anything i can bring you a cure kate smiled weakly coming right up she said the flowers in a metallic gray box with a red bow were on her desk when kate returned from the berenson building first a huge bouquet for ellen from sandy and now flowers from jared the former dartmouth roommates had come through in the clutch i knew you guys must have learned something at that school besides how to tap a keg she said excitedly opening the box they were longstem roses eleven red and one yellowthe red for love and the yellow for friendship she had once been told she scurried about her office opening and closing doors and drawers until she found a heavy greenglass vase it was not until the roses were arranged to her satisfaction and set on the corner of her desk that she remembered the card taped to the box it would say something at once both witty and tender that was jareds stylehis way to a not so unexceptional pathologist from a not so secret admirer tom kate groaned and sank to her desk chair feeling angry and a little foolish try as she might she could not dispel the irrational reaction that jared had somehow let her down call tom she wrote the reminder on a scrap of paper and taped it in a highvisibility spot on the shade of her desk lamp still she knew from experience that even a location only inches from her eyes gave her at best only a fiftyfifty chance of remembering perhaps now was the time to call it was almost nine if tom wasnt in the or a page would reach him things were beginning to get out of hand and at this point meeting tom for a drink hardly seemed fair kate was reaching for the phone when it rang hello kate bennett she said dr bennett how do you do my name is arlen paquette doctor arlen paquette if you count a phd in chemistry im the director of product safety for redding pharmaceuticals if this is an inopportune time for you please tell me if it is not i would like to speak with you for a few minutes about the report dr william zimmermann phoned in to us yesterday i have a few minutes kate said retaping the tom note to her lampshade fine thank you dr bennett i spent a fair amount of time taking information from dr zimmermann however since you seem to have done most of the legwork as it were i had hoped you might go over exactly what it was that led you to the conclusion there was a problem with one of our redding generics id be happy to dr paquette it was obvious from the few questions paquette asked during her threeminute summary that zimmermanns account to him had been a complete one and further that the director of product safety had studied the data well so the caller said when she had finished as i see it your initial suspicions of trouble at the omnicenter were based on a coincidence of symptoms in three patients of the thousands treated there correct not exactly kate said suddenly perturbed by the tone of the mans voice please he said bear with me a moment longer you then decided to focus your investigation on the pharmaceuticals provided for the omnicenter by my company and dr paquette i dont think its at all fair to suggest that i jumped to the conclusion that the drugs were at fault even now i am not at all sure that is the case however of all the factors i checkedsterilization techniques microbiology and all others common to my three patients the contaminated vitamins were the only finding out of the ordinary ah yes paquette said the vitamins several dozen samples analyzed yet only one containing a painkiller correct dr paquette kate said somewhat angrily i have a busy schedule today and ive told you about all there is to tell you are sounding more and more like a lawyer and less and less like a man concerned with correcting a problem in his companys product now i dont know whether dr zimmermann told you or not but i feel that the need to get to the bottom of all this is urgent critical a woman who happens to be a dear friend of mine is in the hospital right now with her life quite possibly at stake and for all i know there may be others i shall give you two more days to come up with a satisfactory explanation if you dont have one i am going to get the chemist from the state toxicology lab and together we will march straight down to the fda by chemist i assume you mean mr ian toole yes thats exactly who i mean well doctor im a little confused you see i have in front of me a notarized letter copies of which i have just put in the mail to you and dr zimmermann it is a letter from mr ian toole stating categorically that in none of his investigations on your behalf did he find any contamination in any product dispensed at the omnicenter what kates incredulity was almost instantly replaced by a numbing fear thats not true she said weakly shall i read you the letter you bought him off i beg your pardon i gave you the courtesy of reporting this to your comapny instead of going to the fda and you bought off my chemist dr bennett i would caution you against carelessly tossing accusations about paquette said the statement in front of me is as i have said notarized well see about that she said with little force the vitamins she had sent to toole were all she had in a corner of her mind she wondered if arlen paquette knew that i would like to confirm my companys sincere desire to correct any shortcomings in its products and to thank you for allowing us to investigate the situation at your hospital paquette sounded as if he was reading the statement from a card you may think this is the end of things dr paquette kate said but you dont know me please be prepared to hear from the fda we each must do what we must do doctor kate had begun to seethe furthermore you had better hope that whatever you paid ian toole was enough because that man is going to be made to visit a certain hospital bed to see first hand the woman he may be helping to kill she slammed the receiver to its cradle seated in his suite at the ritz arlen paquette hung up gently he was shaking you dont know me paquette snorted at the irony of kate bennetts words splashed some scotch over two ice cubes drank it before it had begun to chill and then set the glass down on the photographs of the woman he had just helped nail to a cross of incompetence mental imbalance and dishonesty cyrus redding had decreed that she be discredited and discredited she would be kate bennett had only herself and a few shaky allies cyrus redding had an unlimited supply of norton reeses winfield samuelses ian tooles and yes arlen paquettes he glanced down at the pad where he had written the words he had rehearsed and then used when talking to the woman and he wondered if he could have come off so selfassured in a facetoface confrontation doubtful he acknowledged extremely doubtful their conversation had lasted just a few minutes with all of the surprises coming from his end yet here he was soaked with sweat and still trembling hed take a dozen inperson encounters with norton reese over the one phone call he had just finished water that was it he needed some water no more goddamn scotch he snatched his empty glass from the coffee table beneath it was one of the fivebyseven blowups of kate bennett this one of her bundled in a sweatsuit scarf and watch cap jogging with her dog along a snowbanked road paquette turned and unsteadily made his way to the bathroom you bastard he said to the thin drawn face staring at him from the mirror you weak little fucking bastard he hurled the glass with all his strength shattering it and the mirror then he dropped to his knees amidst the shards and clutching the ornate toilet retched until he felt his insides were tearing in two dont you see bill someone at redding pharmaceuticals maybe this this paquette bought off ian toole damn i knew i was right not to trust them i knew it i knew it kate still breathless from her run across the snowy street and up three flights of stairs screamed at herself to calm down william zimmermann as relaxed as kate was intense rose from behind his desk and crossed to the automatic coffee maker on a low table by his office door his kneelength clinic coat was perfectly creased and spotless his demeanor as immaculate as his dress how about a few deep breaths and a cup of coffee coffees about the last thing i need in my state thanks but i will try the deep breaths vacation can you believe it one day the man is at his little spectrophotometer running tests and the next hes off on vacation and nobody knows when hell be back now if that isnt a payoff i dont know what is next thing you know ian tooles name will be on a lab door somewhere in redding pharmaceuticals the deep breaths zimmermann asked returning to his desk oh yes im sorry bill but you dont blame me do you no i dont blame you he paused obviously searching for words kate he said finally i want to be as tactful as possible in what i have to ask and if im not please excuse me but go on well since you brought the subject up at our dinner the other night i feel i must ask just how badly do you have it in for the pharmaceutical industry the question startled her then she understood what youre saying is that without ian toole it becomes a matter of my word against theirs is that it if im out of line kate im sorry but remember there is a lot at stake herefor me and my clinic and as far as i know this whole matter was between you and your mr toole i mean i called in the report because it was our facility but the hard data are strictly wait kate interrupted excitedly there is someone else i just remembered who her names millicent shes tooles assistant and i remember him telling me she was put out about having to work late on the stuff i sent him do you have a last name no but how many millicents can there be at the state toxicology lab she was already reaching for the phone and her address book you dont know me dr paquette she murmured as she dialed oh no you dont know me at all the call lasted less than a minute millicent hall is no longer in the employ of the state lab kate said as she hung up her expression and tone an equal mix of embarrassment dejection and anger they wouldnt give out any further information this time it was zimmermann who took a deep breath first the baseball player and now this he said you certainly arent having a very easy time of it kates eyes narrowed an emptiness began to build inside her youre having trouble believing me arent you zimmermann met her gaze and held it kate what i can say in all honesty is that at this moment i believe that you believe he saw her about to protest and held up his hands and at this moment he added reassuringly that is enough there is too much at stake for me to make any hasty moves i shall await reddings formal response to my report meanwhile keeping our pharmacy on backup no redding generics until then however if there have been no further cases or further developments in say a week i plan to reinstate our automated system with redding products we have a contract but they facts kate we need substantiated facts kate sighed and sank back in her seat deflated it was nearly ten and she had done nothing to prepare for the days surgicals have you started working on that list of patients who might be willing to allow me to have their medications analyzed zimmermann smiled patiently you can see how that might be a bit tricky to explain to a patient cant you he handed her a brief list and five omnicenter medication cards these belong to longterm patients of mine who agreed to exchange them as part of what i said was a routine qualitycontrol check it is kate said thanks bill i know this isnt easy for you and im grateful ill try and get you some more today thanks youre being more than fair i know im right and sooner or later im going to prove it she stood to go you know zimmermann said even if you find there was a manufacturing error at redding you have no way of tying it in with the cases you are following the faces of three womentwo dead and one her friendflashed in her thoughts i know she said grimly but its all i its all we have say before i forget have you got the purchase invoices for the redding generics that i asked you about zimmermann opened his file cabinet carl horner does the ordering he gave me these and asked that i convey his desire to cooperate with you as fully as possible he also asked that you return these as soon as youre done of course kate said glancing at the pile of yellow invoice carbons redding pharmaceuticals inc darlington kentucky the words sputtered and sparked in her mind then they exploded kate are you all right zimmermann asked huh oh yes im fine bill something very strange is going on here i mean very strange zimmermann looked at her quizzically i dont know how long ago they moved but at one time the ashburton foundation was located in darlington kentucky how do you know i found their old address in my fatherinlaws rolodex so kate held up an invoice for him to see darlington thats where redding pharmaceuticals is headquartered for the first time william zimmermann seemed perturbed i still dont see what point youre trying to make kate heard the irritation in the mans voice and recalling his oblique reference to the bobby geary letter cautioned herself to tread gently her supporters even skeptical ones were few and far between i i guess i overreacted a little she said with a sheepishness she was not really feeling ellens being in the middle of all this has me grasping at straws i guess she glanced at her watch look ive got to get over to the or thanks for these if i come up with any facts she corrected herself with a raised finger make that substantiated facts ill give you a call fine zimmermann said let me know if theres any further way i can help kate hurried outside and across the street mindless of the wind and snow ashburton and reddingonce both in darlington and now both at the omnicenter a coincidence not likely she thought no not likely at all the lobby clock read two minutes to ten as she sped toward the surgical suite and the small frozensection lab the room was dark taped to the door was a carefully printed note or cryostat inoperative bring biopsy specs to path department cryostat for processing ten seconds to ignition nine eight seven six five four three two one ignition tom engleson struck the wooden match against the edge of an iron trivet and touched the brandysoaked mound of french vanilla ice cream voila he cried bravo kate cheered tom filled two shallow dishes and set kates in front of her with a flourish the evening had been a lowkey delight drinks at the hole in the wall pub dinner at the moon villa in chinatown and finally dessert in toms apartment twenty stories above boston harbor she had forgotten to break their date and for once her poor memory had proven an asset twenty minutes into their conversation at the hole in the wall kate had given up trying to sort out what she wanted from the evening and the man and had begun to relax and enjoy both still she knew thoughts of jared were never far from the surface nor were thoughts of redding pharmaceuticals and the ashburton foundation okay tom said as he poured two cups of coffee and settled into the chair next to her now that my brain is through crying for food and drink and such its ready to try again to understand there is no ashburton foundation no theres something called the ashburton foundation but im not at all certain its anything other than a laundry for money pharmaceutical company money right i called the number i got from my fatherinlaws rolodex and got a receptionist of some sort she referred every question even what street they were located on in dc to someone named dr thompson apparently the director of the socalled foundation but dr thompson was out of the office and never called you back exactly i tried calling the receptionist again and this time she said that thompson was gone for the day and would contact me in the morning it was weird i tell you weird the woman supposedly working for this big foundation didnt have the vaguest idea of how to handle my call did you ask reese about all this he was gone for the day by the time i called but tomorrow after i see ellen i intend to camp out on his doorstep but why what does redding pharmaceuticals get out of funneling all this money into our hospital kate shrugged that thomas is the sixtyfour dollar question at the moment every shred of womans intuition in my body is screaming that the tiein has something to do with the contaminated vitamins our friend dr paquette has gone to such lengths to cover up incredible incredible maybe impossible she took a folded copy of an article from her purse and passed it over i came across this yesterday during one of my sessions in the library its part of a whole book about a drug called mer originally developed and marketed by merrell pharmacouticals thats a big company tom said flipping through the pages not as big as redding but big enough this mer was supposed to lower cholesterol and thereby prevent heart disease only trouble was that other companies were racing to complete work on other products designed to do the same thing the good folks at merrell estimated a potential yearly profit in the billions at just one twenty cent capsule a day for each person over thirtyfive however they also knew that the lions share of that profit would go to the first company whose product could get cleared by the fda and launched into the marketplace im not going to want to hear the rest of this am i tom said not if you have much trust in the pharmaceutical industry remember the fda doesnt evaluate products the pharmaceutical companies do the fda only evaluates the evaluations in its haste to get mer into the bodies of the pharmaceuticalbuying public merrell cut corner after corner in their laboratory and clinical testing but since none of the shortcuts was evident in the massive reports they submitted to the fda in mer was approved by the fda and launched by merrell two years later almost by accident the fda discovered what the company had done and ordered the drug removed by that time a large number of people had gone blind or developed hideous irreversible skin conditions or lost all their hair tom whistled kids with no arms because their mothers took a sleeping pill called thalidomide kids with irreparably yellow teeth because tetracycline was rushed into the marketplace before all its side effects were known the list goes on and on you sound a little angry tom said taking her hand and guiding her to the couch across the room they paid off my chemist tom she said theyve made me look like a fool or worse a liar youre damn right im angry she sighed and leaned back still holding his hand forgive me for popping off like that but i guess i needed to tom slipped his free arm around her shoulders and drew her close together they sat watching fat windwhipped flakes of snow tumble about over the harbor and melt against the huge picture window thank you she whispered thank you for understanding again and again they kissed first her blouse then her bra then toms shirt dropped to the carpet as he bore her gently down on the couch his lips brushing across the hollow of her neck and over the rise of her breasts felt wonderful his hand caressing the smooth inside of her thigh was warm and knowing and patient she felt as excited as frightened as she had during her earliest teenage encounters but even as she sensed her body respond to his hunger even as her nipples grew hard against his darting tongue she sensed her mind begin to pull back kate oh kate tom whispered the words vibrating gently against the skin of her breast tom the word was a soft plea almost a whimper hold me kate please dont stop she took his face in her hands tom she said huskily i just cant her emotions swirling like the snow on the interstate kate took most of an hour and a half to make the drive from boston to essex tom had been hurt and frustrated by her sudden change in attitude but in the end he had done his best to understand and accept i only hope jared knows how goddamn lucky he is he had snapped as she was dressing later he had insisted on driving her back to metro and her car where they had shared a quasiplatonic goodbye kiss the phone was ringing as she opened the door from the garage to her house roscoe who had spent most of the past two days at a sleepover with neighbors and their golden retriever bounded down the hall accepted a quick greeting and then followed her to the den it was jared hi he said i called the house at three a m and no one was home are you okay im fine jared i spent the night at your fathers didnt he tell you he had invited me no there was no mistaking the curiosity in jareds voice did you get my letter kate thumbed through the pile of bills and throwaway journals she had carried in with her jareds letter was sandwiched between the magazines aches and pains and pathologist on the go i just brought it in she said if you want to wait ill read it right now no need kate ive got it memorized kate opened the letter and read along as he said the words it says i love you i miss you and i dont want to not live with you anymore jared kates heart was pounding so much she could barely respond i love you too jared very very much when are you coming home day after tomorrow unless you want me to hitch home now thursdays fine honey just fine ill pick you up at the airport seven p m united perfect i have a lot to tell you about maybe well take a ride in the country theres someone you should visit who youll see let me leave it at that until thursday okay okay but i love you i love you boots sometimes i dont know who the heck you are or where jared samuels is on your list of priorities but i love you and i want to ride it all out with you as long as i can hang on well do just fine honey everything is going to be all right as she hung up kate realized that for the first time in weeks she believed that wednesday december arlen paqueiie stiff and sore from lack of sleep cruised along the treelined drive toward redding pharmaceuticals paralleling the icy roadway were the vestiges of the first december snow in darlington in eleven years his homecoming the evening before had been a fiasco marked by several fights with the children too much to drink before during and after dinner and finally impotence and discord in bedproblems he and his wife had never encountered before he adjusted the rearview mirror to examine his face and plucked off the half dozen tissuepaper patches on the shaving nicks caused by his unsteady hand even without the patches he looked like hell it was the job the job he couldnt quit bribery payoffs deceptions threats ruined lives suddenly he was no longer a chemist suddenly he was no longer even an administrator he was a lieutenant a platoon leader in cyrus reddings army it was an army of specialists held together by coercion blackmail and enormous amounts of moneypoised to strike at anything or anyone who threatened cyrus redding or the corporation he had built the guard greeted him warmly and performed a perfunctory search of the mercedes paquette had once asked the man exactly what it was he was checking for his polite but quite disconcerting reply was anything mr redding doesnt want to be there the executive offices including cyrus reddings were at the hub of the wagon wheel of six long low structures that made up the manufacturing and packaging plants research and other laboratory facilities occupied an underground annex joined to the main structure by tunnels escalators and moving walkways paquette parked in the space marked with his name stopped at his office to leave his coat and then headed directly for reddings suite he was ushered in immediately arlen arlen redding said warmly welcome home he was in his wheelchair behind his desk and was dressed in the only outfit paquette could remember him wearing at work a lightweight bluegray suit white shirt and string tie fastened with a turquoise thunderbird ring so redding said when they had moved to the sitting area with coffee and a sugary pastry you look a bit drawn this boston business has not been so easy has it you told me it might not be paquette said do you remember when we decided to move the mailing address of the ashburton foundation of course a few months after you started working here six no seven years ago right paquette nodded it was an excellent suggestion and the first time i fully appreciated what a winning decision it was to hire you paquette smiled a weak thank you well he said it was my feeling at that time that with the foundation registered as a taxexempt philanthropic organization and located in dc there was no way redding pharmaceuticals could ever be connected to it and yet our tenacious friend dr bennett has done so yes although as i told you last night im not certain she has put it all together but she will the warlock said with certainty she called twice yesterday trying to reach methat is trying to reach dr thompson the foundation director i couldnt even call her back for fear of having her recognize my voice it was a wise decision not to shes got to hear from someone today she will redding said he glanced at his watch at this moment our persuasive legislative liaison charlie wilson is on his way to the foundation office to become dr james thompson office of course we wouldnt want dr bennett to try and locate the ashburton foundation only to find a desk phone and secretary would we paquette shook his head the man was absolutely incredible and efficient in a way that he found quite frightening by eleven oclock this morning the office its staff photographic essays describing its good works testimonial letters and a decade or so of documented service will be in place along with charlie wilson who is i think youll agree as smooth and selfconfident as they come amazing paquette said are you feeling a bit more relaxed about things now yes mr redding yes i am good youll be pleased to know that the company will be taking care of that mirror at the ritz paquette froze he had gone to great pains to pay for the damage himself and to insure that in no way would redding find out about what had happened instability under fire was hardly the sort of trait the man rewarded in his platoon leaders i im sorry about that sir i really am redding gestured to the coffee table before them sealed under thick glass was the emblem of redding pharmaceuticals a skyblue background with white hands opening to release a pure white dove below the dove was the name of the company above it in a rainbow arc the motto the greatest good for the most people at the least cost arlen ever since the day i took over this company i have tried to chart a course that would lead to exactly what this motto says in this businessin any businessthere are always choices to be made always decisions that cannot be avoided in the thirtyfive years since i first came to darlington ive made more gutwrenching decisions and smashed more glasses and more mirrors in anguish than i care to count but always when i needed direction when i needed advice or council it was right in front of me he tapped the motto with his finger the legislators state and federal the competition and especially the goddamn fda are all doing their best to cloud the issue but in the end it always boils down to this again he tapped the glass if the pep talk was meant to buoy paquettes flagging morale it failed miserably the greatest good for the most people at the highest profit was all he could think of the shortcuts and the human testing the clinics in denver and boston the bribery and extortion involving da officialsall had been tolerable for him because all were abstractions kate bennett was flesh and blood a voice a face a reality and worse than that a reality he was growing to admire paquette snapped out of his reverie wondering how long it had lasted a second a minute then he realized that reddings eyes were fixed on him i understand sir he said clearing away the phlegm in his throat and i assure you you have nothing to worry about how did the man know about the stinking mirror spies in boston a bug in the room damn him paquette thought viciously damn him to hell fine arlen redding said now you have a flight back to boston this afternoon two oclock i suspect that our meddlesome pathologist is on the ropes however her fatherinlaw assures me that she is far from out on her feet her discovery regarding the ashburton foundation suggests that he is quite correct i believe norton reese is arranging a surprise for her that may help paquette said vividly recalling the glee in reeses voice as he announced that something was set to fall heavily on kate bennett excellent redding said her fatherinlaw has promised to do what he can to help us as well one final thing yes has anything further surfaced on the cause of the ovary and blood problems in those three women paquette shook his head strange redding said more to himself than to the other man very strange for several seconds he remained lost in thought his eyes closed his head turning from side to side as if he were internally speedreading a page well arlen he said suddenly opening his eyes thank you for the excellent job you are doing i know at times your duties are not easy for you but continue to carry them out the way you have and your rewards will be great yes sir paquette said he sat for nearly half a minute before realizing that the warlock had said all he was going to sheepishly he rose and hurried from the room cyrus redding studied the man as he left the boston business seemed to be having some untoward effects on him particularly in the area of his drinking as he motored from the sitting area to his desk redding made a mental note to arrange a vacation of some sort for paquette and his wife as soon as boston was over that done he put the issue and the man out of his head there was more important business needing attention stephen stein the enigmatic remarkably resourceful investigator had made a discovery that he suspected would unlock the mystery of john ferguson mr nunes redding said through the intercom of his desk would you bring that package to me now at the far end of the office a perfectly camouflaged panel and one way mirror slid open the man nunes emerged from the small soundproof room from which he kept vigil revolver at hand whenever redding was not alone in his office the package containing a book several typewritten pages and an explanatory letter from stein had arrived by messenger only minutes before arlen paquette if you have errands to run mr nunes this would be a good time when you return in say an hour we could well have a new slant on our friend dr ferguson he smiled nearly beside himself at the prospect i think this occasion might call for a pint of that mint chip ice cream i have forbidden you to let me talk you into buying the taciturn bodyguard nodded i cant let you talk me into it he said but perhaps i could purchase some on my own redding waited until his office door had clicked shut then he locked it electronically and spread the contents of the package on his desk my apologies stein wrote for missing this volume during the course of earlier efforts to tie our mysterious dr fergusons background in with the war i borrowed it from the holocaust library at the university here with assurances of its return along with some token of our gratitude its title according to the german professor who did the enclosed translation for us is doctors of the reich the story of hitlers monster kings the work is the product of painstaking research and countless interviews by a jewish journalist named sachs himself a death camp survivor and is believed by my source to be accurate within the limits of the authors prejudices only the chapters dealing with the experiments at the ravensbruck concentration camp for women have been translated the photographs on pages three sixtyseven and three sixtyeight will i believe be of special interest to you for most of the next hour cyrus redding sat transfixed moving only to turn the pages of the translation or to refer to specific photographs in the worn yellowed text john ferguson was a physician and scientist named dr wilhelm becker the photographs though slightly blurred and taken nearly forty years before left no doubt whatsoever amazing redding murmured as he read and reread the biography of his associate absolutely amazing there were two snapshots of wilhelm becker one a fullface identification photo and one a group shot with other physicians at the ravensbruck camp there was also a shot of what remained of the laboratory in which becker was purported to have died with the bodies of the man and his staff sergeant still curled amidst the debris on the floor redding withdrew a large ivoryhandled magnifying glass from his desk and for several minutes studied the detail of the scene the body identified as willi becker was little more than an illdefined charred lump nicely done my friend redding said softly nicely done familiar now with the man and with his spurious death redding turned to the page and a half dealing with beckers research specifically with his research on a substance called estronate much of the information presented was gleaned from transcripts of the war crimes trial of a physician named muller and another named rendl both of whom were sentened to nuremberg prison in large measure because of their association with the supposedly late wilhelm becker redding found the men in the ravensbruck group photo muller had served five years at hard labor before certain ravensbruck survivors were able to document his acts of heroism on their behalf and get his sentence commuted for rendl the revelations of his humanitarianism came too late three years after his incarceration he hanged himself in his cell redding read the estronate material word by word taking careful notes by the time he had finished he was absolutely certain that neither wilhelm becker nor the notebook containing his work on the hormone had perished in the ravensbruck fire a substance harmless in every other way that could render a woman sterile without her knowledge redding was staggered by the potential of such a drug china india the african nations the arabs what would governments be willing to pay for a secret that might selectively thin their populations and thereby solve so many of their economic and political woes what would certain governments pay for a weapon which if delivered properly could decimate their enemies in a single generation without the violent loss of one life reddings thoughts were soaring through the possibilities of estronate when with a soft knock nunes entered the office set a package on the desk and retired to his observation room for another hour redding sat alone savoring his mint chip ice cream and deciding how he might best break the news to dr john ferguson that their fifteenyearold collaboration was about to take on a new dimension i love you i miss you and i dont want to not live with you anymore kate read jareds note again and then again drawing strength and confidence from it each time she had returned to her office following two distressing and frightening visits one was to ellen who was for the first time receiving a transfusion of packed red blood cells the second was to norton reese if the connection between metropolitan hospital of boston the ashburton foundation and redding pharmaceuticals was as intimate as reeses clumsy evasions were leading her to believe she would need all the strength and confidence she could muster thank you jared she thought thank you for pulling me out from under the biggest pressure of all her meeting with reese had started off cordially enough in fact the man had seemed at times to be inappropriately jovial and at ease ever since their confrontation before the board of trustees over his diversion of budgeted pathology department funds to the cardiac surgical program reese had dealt with her with the gingerliness of an apprentice handling high explosives now suddenly he was all smiles his congeniality lasted through several minutes of conversation about her department and stan willoughbys recommendation that she succeed him as chief and ended abruptly with mention of the ashburton foundation whatever fortes the man might have kate mused at that moment they certainly did not include poker faces his eyes narrowed fractionally but enough to deepen the fleshy crows feet at their corners his lips whitened as did the tips of his fingers where they were touching one another im afraid im not at liberty to open the ashburton foundation files to you he had said his eyes struggling to maintain contact with hers and failing however i shall be happy to answer what questions i can okay kate said shrugging my first question is why arent you at liberty to open the ashburton foundation fiies to me its its part of the agreement we signed when we accepted a grant from them it was bizarre in a very literal sense the man was squirming in his seat well suppose i wanted to apply for a grant for my department how would i go about contacting them ill have gina give you the address on your way out you can write them yourself i already have a post office box number in washington dc is that it yes i mean probably well suppose i wanted to visit their offices in person could you ask gina to give me a street address as well reese continued to fidget look he said ill give you their mailing address and phone number im sorry but thats all i can do why do you want to know about the ashburton foundation anyway he managed mr reese kate said calmly if i answer that question will you open their files to me not without written permission from the ashburton foundation well then it appears weve got a mexican standoff doesnt it ill tell you this much her voice grew cold two women have died and a third may be dying if i find out the ashburton foundation is connected in any way with what has happened to them and you have kept significant information from me i promise that i wont rest until everyone who matters knows what you have done is that clear her uncharacteristic anger had she knew been prodded by the sight of ellen sandler mutely watching the plastic bag dripping blood into her arm and by the knowledge that this was in all likelihood just the first of many transfusions to come reese checked his watch in a manner that was as inappropriate as it was unsubtle it was as if he had left a message to be called at precisely ninetwelve and was wondering why the phone hadnt rung mr reese the administrator shifted his gaze back to her his face was pinched and gray with angerno she realized it was something deeper than anger hatred did the poor man actually hate her you really think youre something dont you he rasped in a strained muddy voice i beg your pardon who made you the crusader do you think that just because you have an md degree and all that old family money you can ride all over people what mr reese i nev well let me tell you something you dont intimidate me like you do some around here no sir not one bit so you just ride off on that high horse of yours and let me and the department headsthe official department headsworry about grants and foundations and such kate watched as the man sat there panting from the exertion of his outburst for five seconds ten her green eyes fixed on him then she rose from her chair and left unwilling to dignify reeses eruption with a response now alone in her office kate sat trying to crystallize her thoughts and doodling a calligraphic montage of the words reese and asshole after finishing four versions of each she began adding ashburton and paquette first there was the bribery of ian toole an act which seemed to her equivalent to shooting a chipmunk with an elephant gun she would have been quite satisfied with an admission by redding pharmaceuticals that they had somehow allowed a batch of their generic vitamins to become contaminated and would gladly recall and replace them their illogically excessive response had to have been born out of either arrogance or fear but fear of what omnicenter made its first appearance in the montage the ashburton foundation had endowed an entire obgyn department and subsidized a massive modern womens health center philanthropic acts perhaps she thought but both of her calls to the foundation had gone unanswered by dr thompson the director and her efforts though modest had failed to come up with an address for the place then there was reeses refusal to discuss the organization that had been at least in part responsible for the resurgence of his hospital at that moment almost subconsciously she began adding another name to the paper again and again she wrote it first in the calligraphic forms she knew then in several she made up on the spot horner somehow the cantankerous eccentric computer genius was involved in what was going on the notion fit too well made too much sense but how there really was only one person who could help her find out another minute of speculation and she called william zimmermann fifteen minutes later she was on her way through the tunnel to the omnicenter when tom engleson entered from the cutoff to the surgical building hi she said searching his face for a clue as to how he was handling the abortive end to their evening together hlo his voice was flat she slowed but continued walking going to the omnicenter tom nodded i have a clinic in twenty minutes you all right yeah sure great tom i look kate its my problem not yours dr engleson you werent exactly alone on the couch last night she whispered glancing about to ensure that none of the tunnel traffic was too close i feel awful about giving out such mixed messages but you are an incredibly comfortable and understanding man with all the trouble at the hospital im afraid i just allowed myself to hide out in your arms it was wrong and unfairmore so because i really care very much for you im sorry tom they reached the stairwell leading up to the omnicenter wait tom said please he guided her to a small alcove opposite the staircase you know considering the nature of the metro grapevine well probably be an item by two nurses chattered past them and up the stairs hell she said following them with her eyes we most likely are already do you really mean that about caring for me tom i love my husband very much weve had some trouble getting our lives back in sync since the election but my feelings for him havent changed still youre very special to me believe me if my home situation my marriage were any different we would have been lovers last night yeah the muscles in his face relaxed and some measure of energy returned to his voice yes she said tom engleson might have been nine years jareds junior but they still had much in common including it now appeared the need for strong reassurance about such things i said it last night and ill say it again jared is a very lucky man acceptance had replaced the strain in toms voice i know kate said tom seriously thank you for not making it any harder for me between the wretched business with bobby geary the disappearance of my chemist and some incredible crap from norton reese i feel like i need all the friendsall the helpi can get she glanced at her watch say do you have a few minutes sure why im going to see bill zimmermann to discuss the ashburton foundation id love to have you come along if you can rocket bill i do have a little time if you think he wouldnt mind hardly kate said he knows how much help youve been to me through all this okay during the fourflight climb tom reviewed for her the protocols for patient care in the omnicenter on arrival both new and returning patients met with a specially trained female intake worker who blackened in the appropriate spaces in a detailed computerreadable history sheet medications menstrual history new complaints and side effects of any treatment were carefully recorded the worker then slid the history sheet into a computer terminal on her desk and in thirty seconds or less instructions as to where the patient was to go next would appear on the screen along with if necessary what laboratory tests were to be ordered do you feel the system is a bit impersonal kate asked youre a patient here do you no not really i guess she said i can remember when a visit to the gynecologist consisted of sitting for an hour in a tenfootsquare waiting room with a dozen other women having my name called out stripping in a tiny examining room and finally having the doctor rush in thumbing through my chart for my name and then as often as not telling me to put my heels in the stirrups before he even asked why i was there see tom laughed no system is perfect but seriously the one here is damn good it frees me up to do a careful exam and to answer as many questions as my patients have the system might be great kate thought but something somewhere inside it was rotten something was killing people large colored numbers marked each floor the filling half a wall at the thirdfloor landing was an iridescent orange kate reached for the handle of the door to the corridor but then stopped turned to tom and kissed him gently on the cheek thank you for last night my friend she said tom accepted the kiss and then squeezed her hand and smiled if you need anything at all and i can do it or get it youve got it he said william zimmermann greeted kate warmly and tom with some surprise it was clear from his expression and manner that he was concerned about anything that might affect the reputation of the omnicenter including involvement of one of the ashburton service senior residents kate sought immediately to reassure him bill as you know dr englesons been an enormous help to me in sorting all this out he knows as do i the importance of absolute discretion in discussing these matters with anyone youve spoken to no one at all about this zimmermann asked tom no sir only k only dr bennett good well sit down sit down both of you ill try not to take up too much of your time kate began but i want to keep you abreast of what has been happening since we talked yesterday you were concerned about the ashburton foundation exactly you know how upset i was with redding pharmaceuticals after they bribed my chemist well zimmermann stopped her with a raised hand kate please he said with an edge of irritation she had never heard before i told you how i felt about the situation with the chemist i believe that you believe but no more than that he turned to tom do you have any personal knowledge of this chemist toole tom thought for a moment and then shook his head no not really all right then zimmermann said substantiated facts kate took a breath nodded and settled herself down by smoothing out a pleat in her charcoal gray skirt sorry bill okay heres a substantiated fact she passed a telephone number across to him its the number of the ashburton foundation in washington dc at one time maybe seven or eight years ago the foundation was located in darlington kentucky the same town as redding pharmaceuticals i tried calling them yesterday several times but all i got was a stammering receptionist who promised i would hear from a dr james thompson the director as soon as he returned to the office i never heard then this morning i went to see norton reese and asked to see the ashburton foundation files you would have thought i asked to read his diary he refused and then exploded at me did he give any reason for refusing tom asked kate shook her head not really he seemed frightened of me scared stiff kate zimmermann asked fingering the paper she had given him just what is it youre driving at the edge was still in his voice even before she spoke she sensed her theory would not sit well with the omnicenter director still there was no way to back off well i think redding pharmaceuticals may be investing money in hospitalsor at least this hospitaland using the ashburton foundation as some kind of front sort of a middle man zimmermanns pale eyes widened thats absurd he said absolutely absurd what would they have to gain im not certain i have an idea but im not certain furthermore i think norton reese knows the truth well substantiated facts suddenly kate wished she had taken more time prepared herself more thoughtfully then she remembered ellen time was she felt certain running out for her friend with that reality nothing else really mattered she girded herself for whatever zimmermanns response was to be and pushed on i dont think the anthranilic acid in my vitamins was an accidental contaminant she said forcing a levelness into her voice though she was shaking inside i think it was being tested on me and probably on others as well not tested to see whether or not it worked because i didnt have any symptoms but rather for adverse reactions for side effects if you will zimmermann was incredulous dr bennett if such a thing were going on in the omnicenter in my facility dont you think i would know about it not really kate said it was starting to come together for me but toms description of how the intake process works made it all fit its carl horner downstairs horner and his monkeys you and the other docs here just go on prescribing his medications and then recording his data for him theres no reason you have to know anything as long as the computers know and you think the ashburton foundation is bankrolling his work kate nodded this is getting out of control he turned to tom do you follow what she is saying reluctantly tom nodded and do you believe it i i dont know what to believe well i think its time i checked on some of these things for myself zimmermann said snatching up the telephone and setting the ashburton number on his desk dr william zimmermann access number threeoheightthree he told the operator as kate looked on excitedly id like a watts line please only a few more minutes kate told herself only a few more minutes a few words from the confused stammering receptionist and zimmermann would at least realize that something was not right at the ashburton foundation for the moment that would be enough measured against the fiascoes surrounding bobby geary and ian toole the planting of even a small seed of doubt in the mans mind would be a major victory yes good morning she heard zimmermann say i am dr william zimmermann from boston i should like to speak with the director yes exactly dr thompson kate turned to tom and gave him a conspiratorial smile suddenly she realized that zimmermann was waving to get her attention and pointing to the extension phone on the conference table she came on the line just as did dr james thompson this is dr thompson the man said dr thompson im sorry to disturb you my name is zimmermann im the director of the omnicenter here in boston oh yes dr zimmermann i know of you thompson said you took over for poor dr french what was it four years ago five tragic accident tragic as i recall yes he drowned zimmermann said now looking directly at kate who was beginning to feel sick what can i do for you sir thompson had a deep genteel voice im here with dr kate bennett one of our physicians ah yes her name is right in front of me here on my desk twice in fact she phoned here yesterday and was told i would return her call however my secretary had no way of knowing that my son craig had fallen at school and broken his wrist and that i was going to be tied up in the emergency room for hours hes all right i hope thompson laughed never better that plaster makes him the center of attention now what can i do for you and dr bennett nothing for me actually but dr bennett has a question or two for you one moment certainly zimmermann his expression saying well you asked for it now here it is motioned for her to go ahead kate felt as if she were being bludgeoned she had been sure so sure and now dr thompson she managed my apologies for not being more patient she glanced over at tom who shrugged helplessly i i was calling to find out if there was any connection between the ashburton foundation and redding pharmaceuticals there was no sense in trying anything other than a direct approach she was beaten humiliated again and she knew it connection yes sir isnt it true that the foundation was once located in darlington kentucky the same town as redding as a matter of fact it was john and sylvia ashburton whose estate established the foundation were from lexington their son john jr ran one of their horse farms darlington stables for two years after his parents died john stayed at the farm tidying up affairs and setting up the mechanics of the foundation i was hired in let me see seventynine but by then the center of operations had already been moved to washington im afraid that as far as redding pharmaceuticals goes the geographical connection was pure coincidence thank you kate said meekly that certainly helps clear up my confusion another glance at tom and she grasped at one final straw dr thompson i was trying to find out the street address of your office but theres no ashburton foundation listed in the dc directory by design dr bennett quite by design you see where there is grant money involved there are bound to be how should i say it omewhat less than fully qualified applicants contacting us we prefer o do our own preliminary research and then to encourage only appropriate institutions and agencies to apply our offices are at k street northwest on the seventh floor please feel free to visit any time you are in washington perhaps your pathology department would be interested in applying for a capital equipment grant perhaps kate said distractedly william zimmermann had heard enough dr thompson he said i want to thank you for helping to clear up the confusion here and also for the wonderful support your agency has given my omnicenter our pleasure sir dr james thompson said well zimmermann asked after he had hung up somethings not right she said what he mentioned my pathology department how did he know i was a pathologist i told him you were at the very start of the call im not trying to be difficult billreally im notbut you referred to me as a physician not a pathologist you remember tom dont you a look at the uncertainty in toms eyes and she began having doubts herself well i im not sure was all the resident could say kate stood to go bill i may seem pigheaded to you or even confused but i tell you something still doesnt feel right to me i just have a sense that dr thompson knew exactly who i was and what i wanted before you ever called you must admit kate zimmermann said clinically that when one looks first at the business with the baseball player then at the conflict over whether or not a chemist actually performed tests he swears he never ran and now at what seem to be groundless concerns on your part regarding the ashburton foundation and my longstanding computer engineer it becomes somewhat difficult to get overly enthusiastic about your hunches and senses and theories now if youve nothing further i must get back to work no kate said smarting from the outburst by the usually cordial man nothing really except the promise that no matter how long it takes i will find out who or what is responsible for ellens bleeding disorder thanks for coming tom im sorry it worked out this way with a nod to both men she left fingers of selfdoubt tightening their grip in her gut she bundled her clinic coat against the wind and snow and pushed head down out of the omnicenter and onto the street what if she were wrong totally wrong about redding and horner about the omnicenter and ellens bleeding about reese perhaps despite the critical situation in berenson despite the nagging fears about her own body she should back off and let things simmer down perhaps she should listen to the advice of her fatherinlaw and reorder her priorities away from metropolitan hospital they were waiting for her in her office stan willoughby liu huang and rod green the flamboyant black general surgeon who was it was rumored being groomed for a harvard professorstlp i kate willoughby said i was just writing you a note he held the paper up for her to see kate greeted the other two men and then turned back to wiljj loughby he was tight his stance and the strain in his smile said so well she asked pardon the note stan what would it have said oh im sorry my mind is racing he cleared his throat kate we need to talk with you well sit down then please she felt her heart respond to her sudden apprehension a problem willoughby was totally ill at ease i um kate yesterday you did a frozen section of a needle biopsy on one of dr greens patients yes a breast it was an intraductal adenocarcinoma i reported the results to dr green myself her pulse quickened another notch was there um any question in your mind of the what dr willoughby is trying to say rod green cut in is that i did a masectomy on a woman who it appears has benign breast disease the mans dark eyes flashed thats impossible kate looked first to willoughby and then to liu huang for support but saw only the tightlipped confirmation of the surgeons allegation liu i have examined specimen in great detail the little man said carefully track of biopsy needle enters benign adenoma no cancer there or in any part of breast are are you sure she could barely speak kate willoughby said i reviewed the slides myself theres no cancer but there was i swear there was there was no cancer in my patient green said none his fury at her was clearly under the most marginal control you have made a mistake a terrible terrible mistake kate stared wideeyed at the three men it was a dream a grotesque nightmare from which she would awake at any moment their stone faces blurred in and out of focus as her mind struggled to remember the cells there were three breast biopsies no two there were two greens patient was the first the pathology was a bit tricky but it was nothing she would ever miss in even one case out of a thousand unless she remembered the fatigue and the strain of the previous morning the stress of jareds being away the crank phone calls and the disappearance of ian toole no her thoughts screamed she couldnt have made such a mistake it wasnt as if they were saying she had missed something although even that kind of error would have been hard to believe they were claiming she had read a condition that wasnt there it was impossible there was just no other word did you check the slides from yesterday she managed the frozens willoughby nodded grimly benign adenoma the exact same pathology as in the main specimen he handed her a plastic box of slides green stood up fists clenched i have heard enough dr bennett thanks to you a woman who came to me in trust has had her breast removed unnecessarily when she sues even though i will in all likelihood be one of the defendants i shall also be her best witness he started to leave and then turned back to her you know he said that letter you sent to the papers about bobby geary was a pretty rotten thing to do he slammed the door hard enough to shake the vase of roses on the corner of her desk kate could barely hold the slide as she set it on the stage of her microscope this time the yellowwhite light held no excitement no adventure for her she knew even before she had completed focusing down that the specimen was benign it was that clearcut her mistaking the pattern for a cancer would have been as likely as an olympic diver springing off the wrong end of the board somethings wrong she said her eye still fixed on the cells the words reverberated in her mind somethings wrong she had said that to bill zimmermann not half an hour ago kate willoughby said gently im sorry only after she looked up from the microscope did she realize she was crying stan i swear this is not the slide i read yesterday it cant be but even as she said the words she admitted to herself that as in the situation with bobby geary her only defense was a protestation of innocence youve been under a great deal of stress lately kate do you suppose that no she forced herself to lower her voice i remember the biopsy i saw yesterday it was cancer i didnt make a mistake look willoughby said i want you to take a few days off rest after this coming weekend we can talk but kate im taking you off the schedule for a while now i dont want you coming back into work until after weve had a chance to discuss things next week okay there was uncharacteristic firmness in the mans voice meekly she nodded okay but no buts kate its for your own good ill call you at home and check on how youre doing now off you go kate watched her colleagues leave stan willoughby head down shuffling a few feet ahead of liu huang who turned for a moment and gave her a timid but hopeful thumbsup sign then they were gone for a time she sat uncertainly isolation and selfdoubt constricting every muscle in her body making it difficult to move or even to breathe with great effort she pulled the telephone over and lifted the receiver i want to place a longdistance call please she heard her voice say its personal so charge it to my home phone im calling san diego thursday december it had taken narcotic painkillers and amphetamines along with his usual pharmacopoeia but in the end becker had prevailed now he ached for sleep he could not remember his last meal catnaps at his desk cool showers every six or seven hours bars of chocolate cups of thick coffee for four days or was it five these had been his only succor still he had endured in the morning a messenger would hand deliver his manuscript and box of slides to the editor in chief of the new england journal of medicine the letter accompanying the manuscript would give the man ten days to agree to publish the estronate studies in their entirety within four months and to oversee the appointment of an international commission to assume responsibility for the initiation of beckerian population control the study was in a shambles with reference books scrap paper coffee cups discarded drafts candybar wrappers and dirty glasses covering the furniture and much of the floor like a prizefighter at the moment of triumph willi becker more skeleton than man stood in the midst of the debris and pumped his fists in the air after forty years and through hardship almost unimaginable he had finished now there was only the matter of gaining acceptance it was ironic he acknowledged that decades of the most meticulous research had come down to a few frenetic days but that was the way it had to be with the pathologist bennett snooping about the omnicenter and cyrus reddings antennae up time had become a luxury he could no longer afford studies in estronate becker cleared off his easy chair settled down and indulged in thoughts of the accolades honors and other tributes to his genius and dedication certain to result from the publication and implementation of his work he was nearing receipt of a nobel prize when the phone began ringing it took half a dozen rings to break through his reverie and another four to locate the phone beneath a pile of journals hello john redding here the voice brought a painful emptiness to beckers chest for several seconds he could not speak john becker cleared his throat yes yes cyrus im here good fine well i hope im not disturbing anything important for you not at all i was just doing a little reading before bed did his voice sound as strained as strangled as it felt what can i do for you please he thought let it be some problem related to their myasthenia let it be anything but well john i wanted to speak with you a bit about that business at the omnicenter beckers heart sank you know redding continued the situation with these women having severe scarring of their ovaries and then bleeding to death yes what about it have you learned anything new about the situation since we spoke last no not really becker sensed that he was being toyed with well john you know that the whole matter has piqued my curiosity as well as my concern for the safety of our testing programs too many coincidences too much smoke for there not to be a fire someplace perhaps becker said hanging onto the thread of hope that the man a master at such maneuvers was shooting in the dark for a time there was silence from reddings end becker shifted nervously in his chair cyrus he asked finally im here was there anything else john i wont bandy words with you weve been through too much together accomplished too many remarkable things for me to try and humiliate you by letting you trip over one after another of your own lies i i dont understand of course you understand john he paused i know who you are that is the gist of what i am calling to say i know about wilhelm becker and even more importantly i know about estronate twofifty becker glanced over at his manuscript stacked neatly atop the printer of his word processor and forced himself to calm down there was little he could think of that redding could do to hurt him at this stage of the game still cyrus redding was cyrus redding and no amount of caution was too much stay calm but dont underestimate your resourcefulness is quite impressive he said john tell me truly it was estronate twofifty that caused the problems at the omnicenter wasnt it it was the hemorrhaging is an undesirable side effect becker was about to explain that the problem had been overcome and that his hormone was to all intents perfected he stopped himself at the last moment yes he said a most unfortunate bug that i have not been able to get out of the system you should have told me john redding said you should have trusted me what do you want john come now it is bad enough you didnt respect me enough to take me into your confidence it is bad enough your uncondoned experiments have put my entire company in jeopardy do not try to demean my intelligence i want to extend our partnership to include that remarkable hormone of yours after all it was tested at a facility that i fund work is not complete there are problems serious problems then we shall overcome them you know the potential of this estronate of yours as well as i do i am prepared to make you an onthespot offer of say half a million dollars now and a similar amount when your work is completed to the satisfaction of my biochemists and of course there would be a percentage of all sales sales becker realized that his worst possible scenario was being enacted redding understood not only the chemical nature of estronate but also its limitless value to certain governments how how in hells name had the man learned so much so quickly i i was planning eventually on submitting my work for publication he offered redding laughed that would be bad business john very bad business the value of our product would surely plummet if its existence and unique properties became general knowledge suppose you oversee the scientific end and let me deal with the proprietary if i refuse becker said will you kill me again redding laughed perhaps perhaps i will however there are those i am sure who would pay dearly for information on the physician whom the ravensbruck prisoners called the serpent for a time there was silence how did you learn of all this becker asked finally why dont we save explanations dr becker for a time after our w business arrangement has been consummated i need time to think take it take as much as you need up to say twentyfour hours the intrinsic problems of the hormone may be insurmountable a chance i will take you owe me this for the troubles you have the caused at our testing facility you owe me in fact there is something else you owe me as well oh i wish to know the individual at the omnicenter who has been helping you with your work becker started to protest that there was no such person but decided against testing the mans patience in less than twelve hours a messenger would deliver the estronate paper and slides to the new england journal of medicine making the hormone in essence public domain he had already decided that exposure of his true identity and the risk of spending what little was left of his life in prison was a small price to pay for immortality fortyeight hours he said redding hesitated very well then he said finally fortyeight hours it will be you have the number i shall expect to hear from you within two days the estronate work and the name of your associate goodbye he hung up goodbye becker said to the dial tone as he drew the receiver from his ear he heard a faint but definite click the sound sent fear stabbing beneath his breastbone someone almost certainly william was on the downstairs extension how long how long had he been there in the cluttered semidarkness of his study willi becker strained his compromised hearing for a time there was only silence perhaps he thought there hadnt been a click at all then he heard the unmistakable tread of footsteps on the stairs william again there was silence william yes father it is zimmermann appeared suddenly in the doorway and stood arms folded looking placidly across at him you ah you surprised me how long have you been in the house long enough zimmermann strode to the bookcase and poured himself a drink he was as usual immaculately dressed light from the gooseneck reading lamp sparked off the heavy diamond ring on the small finger of his left hand and highlighted the sheen on his black italiancut loafers you were listening in on my conversation werent you oh perhaps zimmermann snapped a wooden swizzle stick in two and used one edge to clean beneath his nails listening was a rude thing to do me rude why father well if you heard you heard it really makes no difference oh just how long were you listening in zimmermann didnt answer instead he walked to the printer picked up the estronate manuscript and turned it from one side to the other appraisingly a half million dollars and then some it would seem there is some truth about good things coming in small packages give me that becker was too weak too depleted by the drugs even to rise zimmermann ignored him wilhelm w becker md phd he read so thats who my father is please william how good it is to learn that the man john ferguson who so ignored and abused my mother all those years was not my father the serpent of ravensbruck thats my real father i never abused her i did what i had to do father please she knew that you could have come home much more often and didnt she knew about your women your countless women she knew that neither of us would ever mean anything to you compared to your precious research becker stared at his son with wide bloodshot eyes you hate me dont you there was incredulity in his voice not really the truth is i dont feel much for you one way or the other but i was behind you all the way my money sent you through school your position at the omnicenter how do you think that came about do you think harold french just happened to drown accidentally at the moment you were experienced enough to take over for him it was me beckers hoarse muddy voice had become barely audible if you care so little about me william then why have you helped me in my work all these years why zimmermann gazed blandly at his father because of your connections of course your friend redding triples what the hospital pays me you suggested my name and he arranged for me to get my professorship i know he did he got you the position on my sayso and he can have it taken from you the same way can he now zimmermann held up the estronate manuscript you lied to him you told him there were still flaws in the work why are you thinking that once he finds out you have sent this off for publication he will just walk away and leave us alone do you think he vvont find out who i am what i have been helping you do behind his back do you he was screaming well i tell you right here and now father this is mine i have paid for it over the years with countless humiliations cyrus redding will have his estronate and i shall have my proper legacy no even as he shouted the word willi becker felt the tearing pain in his left chest his heart weakened by disease and sorely compromised by amphetamines pounded mercilessly and irregularly my oxygen he rasped in the bedroom oxygen and nitroglycerine the study was beginning a nauseating spin for the first time william zimmermann smiled im afraid i cant hear you father he said benevolently could you please speak up a bit william please beckers final words were muffled by the gurgle of fluid bubbling up from his lungs and vomitus welling from his stomach he clawed impotently in the direction of his son and then toppled over onto the rug his face awash in the products of his own death stepping carefully around his fathers corpse zimmermann slipped the estronate paper into a large envelope then he removed the disc from the word processor and dropped it in as well next he copied a number from the leatherbound address book buried under some papers on one corner of the desk finally he stacked the three worn looseleaf notebooks containing the estronate data and tucked them under his arm he would phone cyrus redding from the extension downstairs the pharmaceutical magnate evinced little surprise at zimmermanns call or at the rapid turn of events in newton instead he listened patiently to the details of willi beckers life as the mans son knew them dr zimmermann he said finally let us stop here to be certain i fully understand your father when he was supervising construction of the omnicenter secretly had a laboratory built for himself in the subbasement correct zimmermann said on the blueprints it is drawn as some sort of dead storage area i think and the only way to get into the laboratory is through an electronic security system the lock is hidden and coded electronically the door is concealed behind a set of shelves does anyone besides you have the combination no at least not as far as i know remarkable dr zimmermann your father was a most brilliant man my father is dead zimmermann said coolly yes redding said yes he is tell me this bleeding problem it has been eliminated father modified his synthesis over a year ago it was taking from six to eighteen months after treatment for the bleeding problem to develop the three patients you know about were all treated a year ago last july there have to our knowledge been no new cases since keep in mind too that there werent that many to begin with and most of those were mild yes i understand it is remarkable to me that you were able to insert your testing program into carl horners computer system without his ever knowing as you said mr redding my father was a brilliant man yes well then i suppose we two should explore the possibility of a new partnership the terms you laid out for my father are quite acceptable to me i have the manuscript and the notebooks since the work is already completed i would be willing to turn them over to you no further questions asked for the amount you promised him that is a lot of money doctor the amazing thing is that until i overheard your conversation with my father i had not fully appreciated the valuable potential of the hormone zimmermann could barely keep from laughing out loud at his good fortune are you a biochemist doctor no not really in that case i should like to reserve my final offer until my own biochemist has had the chance to review the material to see the laboratory and to take himself through the process of synthesizing the hormone when why not tomorrow dr paquette whom you know will meet you at your office at say seven oclock tomorrow night my man nunes will accompany him and will have the authority and the money to consummate our agreement if dr paquette is totally satisfied with what he sees sounds fine ill make certain the side door to the omnicenter is left open that wont be necessary dr zimmermann paquette has keys all right then seven oclock was there something else as a matter of fact dr zimmermann there is its this whole business with the omnicenter and that pathologist you mean bennett she has proven a very resilient young woman do you believe she was convinced by her conversation with our man at the ashburton foundation no not completely she said she was going to continue investigating the woman currently hospitalized here with complications from estronate treatment is a close friend of hers i see you know doctor none of this would have happened if you and your father hadnt conducted your work so recklessly and independently by his voice had a chilling edge dont you feel a responsibility to this company for what you have done responsibility if we are to have a partnership i should like to know that the millions i have spent on the omnicenter will not be lost because we were unable to neutralize one woman but she has been neutralized a serious mistake on a pathology specimen shes been put on leave by her department head isnt that enough to discredit her i am no longer speaking of discrediting her my friend i am speaking of stopping her you heard my conversation with your father you know the importance of keeping estronate a secret it has been bad enough that dr bennett is threatening by her doggedness to bring the omnicenter tumbling down about our ears if she uncovers estronate we stand to lose much much more ill see to it that wont happen excellent but remember i dont handle disappointment well until tomorrow then doctor yes tomorrow william zimmermann made a final inspection of the house taking pains to wipe off anything he had touched the precaution was in all likelihood unnecessary the houseboy was due in at eight in the morning and the death he would discover upstairs would certainly appear due to natural causes as he slipped out the back door of his fathers house a fortune in notebooks and computer printouts under his arm zimmermann was thinking about kate bennett the nightmare was a juggernaut more pervasive more oppressive it seemed with each passing hour its setting had changed from the clutter of her office to the deeppiled firewarmed opulence of win samuelss study but for kate bennett the change meant only more confusion more humiliation more doubt i know what it looks like i know what it sounds like but it isnt true i dont know who did it i dont know dammit all i just dont know jareds return earlier in the evening had started on a positive note an emotional hug and their first kiss in nearly a week for a time as they weaved their way through the crowds to the baggage area he seemed unable to keep his hands or his lips off her it seemed he was reveling in the freedom of at last truly acknowledging his love for her i accept you regardless of what you are involved in regardless of what the impact might be on me i accept you because i believe in you i accept you because i love you but as she shared her nightmare with him she could feel him pulling back sense his enthusiasm erode it showed first in his eyes then in his voice and finally in his touch he was trying kate knew perhaps even trying his best but she also knew that confusion and doubt were taking their toll why would a company as large as redding pharmaceuticals do the things of which she was accusing them the ashburton foundation had an impeccable reputation what evidence was there that they were frauds why would anyone do something as horrible as switching biopsies how did they do it werent there any records of the tests she had run at the state lab how did the letter about bobby geary fit in with all this i know what it looks like i know what it sounds like but it isnt true with each why with each i dont know kate felt jared drifting further and further into her nightmare by the time the subject of his father and sister came up she was feeling isolated as stifled as before perhaps more so they were nearly halfway home to essex that is absolutely incredible jared had said swinging sharply into the breakdown lane and jamming to a stop i i dont believe it it was the first time since his return that he had said those words after all these years why wouldnt he tell me my sister was alive i dont know the phrase reverberated in her mind perhaps he was trying to spare you the ugliness that makes no sense you say he took you to this insititution to convince you to turn down the position at metro and concentrate on having babies thats what he said jared shook his head let me be sure i have this straight my father who has never communicated all that well with my wife to begin with sends me out of town so that he can take her to an institution in the middle of nowhere and introduce her to the sister he had led me to believe died thirtyodd years ago does that make sense to you jared she said her voice beginning to quaver nothing has made sense to me for days all i can do is tell the truth well if thats the case he said finally i think id like to find out first hand why my father has been holding out on me couldnt we at least wait until no i cant think of a damn thing to do about bobby geary or the omnicenter or the ashburton foundation or the runaway technician or the goddamn breast biopsies but i sure as hell can do something about my father without waiting for a reply he had swung off and under the highway and had screeched back onto the southbound lane headed for boston now in the uncomfortably warm study kate sat by a hundredand thirtyyearold leaded glass window watching the fairyland christmas tights of louisburg square and listening to her husband and her fathermlaw argue over whether she was a liar a woman in desperate need of professional help or some combination of the two jared in all fairness was doing his best to give her the benefit of the doubt but it had purely and simply come down to her word against his fathers when taken with the other issues the other confusions she had regaled him with since his landing at logan it was not hard to understand why he was having difficulty taking her side once again jared win samuels said with authoritative calm we dined togetherjocelyns special duck after dinner we talked then we went for a long drive in the country i hadnt been out of the house all day and was getting a severe case of cabin fever we did stop at the stonefield school im on the board of trustees there but i assure you son our visit was quite spur of the moment we were only a few miles from the school when i remembered a set of papers in the back seat that i was planning on mailing off tomorrow to gus leggatt the school administrator while we were there we did look in on some of the children largely because of our visit on the way home i was able to share my fears with kate about what happens to the rate of birth defects in children of older mothers kate explained the advances in amniocentesis to me facts i might add that i found quite reassuring i mentioned your sister certainly but i never implied she was alive im sorry jared and i am sorry for you too kate he looked at her levelly youve been under a great deal of pressure perhaps a rest some time off time of kate sighed winfield had no way of knowing stan willoughby had already seen to that she rose slowly and crossed to jared stonefield school is listed in information she said wearily broderick massachusetts if the snow doesnt get any worse i can drive us there in fortyfive minutes to an hour that should settle this once and for all do you want to come with us dad jared asked there is no reason to go anyplace win samuels said simply kate jareds sister had severe birth defects and died exactly when he thinks she did thirty years ago perhaps you had a dream of some sort strands of fantasy woven into reality it happens especially when one has been under an inordinate amount of stress such as you it is not stress it is not stress it is not a dream it is not the desperate lie of a desperate woman it is not insanity she confronted him her eyes locked on his samuels held his ground his face an expressionless mask it is the truth the truth i dont know why you are doing this i dont know what you hope to accomplish but i do know one thing im not going to break you manipulate the people in your life like they were pieces on some some enormous game board jocelyn to kings knight four jared to queen three not your turn well youll just throw in a few thousand dollars and make it your turn samuels moved to speak but kate stopped him with raised hands im not through i want to tell you something win youve underestimated me badly ive made it through a childhood of total loneliness an education of total aimlessness and a marriage to an alcoholic madman who insisted on picking out my pantyhose for me ive survived and grown in a profession where i am patronized and discriminated against ive dealt with men who couldnt bring their eyes let along their minds above my breasts ive dealt with them and ive succeeded its been hard at times its been downright horrible but for the last five years ive had a secret weapon hes right there win right over there she nodded toward jared when i forget that im okay he reminds me when i have to face the norton reeses and the arlen paquettes and yes the winfield samuelses of this world he gives me strength i love him and i have faith in him sooner or later hes going to see the way you toy with the lives of those around you sooner or later youll go to move him and he wont be there are you done samuels said yes im done and i dont want to hear any more from you unless its an apology and the truth about the other night how could you think i wouldnt tell jared how could you think i wouldnt remember where we went what we did please jared lets get going its late and we have quite a drive ahead of us at that moment there was a noise the clearing of a throat from the doorway the three of them turned to the sound jocelyn trent stood holding a silver tray with coffee and tea how long have you been there samuels demanded the woman did not answer well she hesitated then she set the tray on the nearest table and ran from the room stonefield school kate said see i told you i could find it only two wrong turns she swung into the driveway past the small sign and up to the front door this is almost the exact hour we were here the other night with any luck the nurse who was on duty then will be on again her name was bicknell sally bicknell something like that ill recognize her she wore about eighty gold bracelets and had rings on three or four fingers of each hand what a character her chatter was she knew somewhat nervous jared had said little during their drive his pensiveness was certainly understandable but she found herself wishing he could recapture at least some of the emotion he had shown at the airport no matter she consoled herself two nlinutes at stonehill and he would know that in this arena at least she was telling the truth how foolish of win to think things would not develop the way they had how unlike the man to miss predicting a persons actions as badly as he had missed hers the nurse bicknell was working at her desk in a small office just off the lobby her hair was pulled back in a tight bun and she was wearing only a single gold chain on one wrist hardly the flamboyant eccentric kate had depicted it was an observation kate noted uneasily that was not overlooked by her husband are you sure its the same woman he whispered as they crossed the lobby its her hi miss bicknell remember me the woman took only a second of course you were with mr samuels fourno no three nights ago right exactly you have an excellent memory an elephant sally bicknell said tapping one finger against her temple this is my husband jared miss bicknell mr samuelss son pleased to meet you the woman took the hand jared offered we dont get too many evening visitors here at stonefield in fact we dont get too many visitors at other times either she looked around sort of a forgotten land i guess miss bicknell we came to see my husbands sister the womans expression clouded i im afraid i dont understand kate felt an ugly apprehension set in lindsey samuels she said a note of irritationor was it panic in her voice the girl we saw monday night right over there she pointed to the blue velvet curtain sally bicknell looked at her queerly and then ushered them over and drew back the curtain her the girl was there lumbering about exactly as she had been before yes exactly kate said thats her jared thats lindsey im sorry mrs samuels but youre mistaken that girls name s rochelle coombs she is sixteen years old and has a genetic disease called hunters syndrome kate stopped herself at the last possible moment from calling the woman a liar could i see her medical records please the nurse snapped the curtain shut her medical records are confidential but i assure you her name is rochelle coombs notwhat did you say lindsey jared said lindsey samuels it was kate realized the first time he had spoken since just after their arrival it is not lindsey samuels sally bicknell completed her sentence in that moment kate realized what had bothered her so about the girl the first time she had observed her she was too young to have been jareds sister far too young her thick features and other physical distortions added some years but not twenty of them the girls grote rnlleness had made her too uncomfortable to look very closely had i win samuels counted on that silently she cursed her own stuplulty helpless and beaten she could only shrug and shake her head will there be anything else bicknell asked kate looked over at jared who shook his head no she said huskily were were sorry for the intrusion in that case the woman said i have rounds to make she turned and without showing them out walked away kate felt far more ill than angry as they approached the car she handed jared the keys you drive please im not up to it your father told me it was lindsey jared i swear he did and that woman was right there when he said it there was she realized no sense in discussing the matter further win samuels had set up a nolose situation for himself either she would be impressed by his demonstration in which case she might have agreed to back off at the hospital and as he wished turn her attention to domestic issues or she would be angered enough to do exactly what she had done his son already in doubt about her would be drawn further away from their marriage and toward a political future unencumbered by a wife whose priorities and mental state were so disordered all that for only the price of a tankful of gas and whatever it cost to buy off sally bicknell nice going win she thought nice goddamn going she sank into her seat and stared sightlessly into the night friday december she is out suspended finished i did it norton reese boasted exultantly yesterday afternoon i tried to call you then but there was no answer still in his bed at the ritz arlen paquette squinted at his watch trying to get the numbers in focus seventhirty was that right was goddamn reese waking him up at seventhirty in the morning he fumbled for the bedside lamp wincing at the shellburst in his temples somewhere in the past four hours he had passed from being drunk to emg hung over his mouth tasted like sewage and his muscles felt as if he had lost a gang fight norton just a second here while i wake up a little bit he worked a cigarette from a wrinkled packet and lit it on the third try over the h past week his smoking had gone from his usual four or five cigarettes a ay to three packs for a moment he eyed the halfempty quart of ewarrs on the bureau no goddamn it he muttered at least not yet it took two hands to hold the phone steady against his ear now sir just how did you go about accomplishing this remarkable feat of yours paquette listened to reeses excited recap of the events leading to the unofficial suspension of kate bennett by her chief stan willoughby by the time the administrator had finished paquette had made his way across to the scotch and buried half a water glass full the story was disgusting a woman had lost her breast unnecessarily and another had been professionally destroyed and he as much as the idiot on the other end of the phone was responsible as he listened to reeses crowing a resolve began to grow within him he picked up a picture of kate bennett from the floor by his bed wondering briefly how it had gotten there norton he said cheerfully youve done one hell of a job there our friends gonna be pleased when i tell him real pleased say listen are you going to be at your office for a while good id like to stop by and get some of the details in person probably be ninethirty or so great see you then he hung up and studied the picture in his hand the scotch had stilled the shakes and begun to alleviate the pounding in his head i think youve taken enough shit from us dr bennett he said its time someone helped you fight back a glance at his watch and he called darlington his wife answered on the second ring honey have the kids left for school yet good theyre not going i want you to pack them up and drive to your mothers house honey i know where your mother lives if you step on it you can be there by dinner time thereve been some problems here with old cyrus and i just want to be sure you and the kids are safe maybe a few days maybe a week i dont know please honey trust me on this one for a little while ill explain everything and listen i love you im sorry about the other night and i love you not a word to anyone now just get out and go to your mothers paquette showered and then shaved taking greater pains than usual not to nick himself he dressed in a suit he had just bought eschewing the vest in favor of a light brown cashmere sweater some visine another shot of scotch some breath mints and he was ready on his way to the hospital he would attend to one final item of business stopping at an electronics store to purchase a miniature tape recorder okay doctor he said to kates picture lets go get us some evidence he glanced at the mirror for the first time in nearly two weeks he liked what he saw nothing to do nowhere to go no one to hold the thoughts the futility kept intruding on kates efforts to wring another hour even another half hour of sleep from the morning they had spent the nightwhat was left of it after their return from stonehillin separate beds or perhaps jared hadnt slept at all she had offered him food then company and then sex but his only request had been to be left alone after an hour or so of staring at the darkened ceiling over their bed she had tiptoed down the hall and peeked into the living room he was right where she had left him on the couch chewing on his lower lip and studying the creases in his palm her immediate impulse was to go to him to beg him to believe her to plead for his faith the feeling disappeared as quickly as it had arisen if their marriage had come down to beggings she was beaten aching with thoughts of what he was going through at the choices he was trying to make she had crept quietly back to bed hoping that before long she would feel him nudging his way under the covers nothing to do nowhere to go no one to hold the ringing of the phone interrupted the litany kate glanced at the clock eightthirty not too bad the last time she had looked it was only six hello kate it was ellen hi howre you feeling i got concerned when you didnt stop by this morning and i called your office her voice was quite hoarse her speech distorted when you didnt answer i rang the department secretary kate whats the matter are you sick hey wait a minute now let us not forget who is the patient here and who is the doctor okay kate be serious she said she didnt know what day youd be back i i got frightened theyre giving me more blood and now i have a tube down my nose i think the inside of my rtnmsrh h qft bleeding shit kate said softly what i said shit rcu oh well are you all right kate pulled a lie back at the last possible instant actually no she said physically im fine but theres been trouble at work and here at home ive been asked to take some time off while my department head sorts through some problems with a biopsy oh kate and here i am all wrapped up in my own problems im there anything i can do no just be strong and get well thats all dont talk to me katey talk to these little platelets or whatever the re called theyre the ones who are screwing up you said trouble stop asking about me dammit youre bleeding to death im afraid res wife and his father in all their infinite wisdom have put him in a position where hes going to have to choose between them at the moment she began wondering where he was upstairs in the guest room perhaps maybe still on the couch she listened for a telltale sound but there was only heavy silence you versus win ellen said no contest thank goodness i thought it was something serious her cheer was undermined by the weakness in her voice listen my friend kate said ill see you later today i may be shut out of the pathology department but im not shut out of the library there are two australian journals im expecting in from the nih together were going to beat this i promise you i believe you ellen said i really do see you later doc kate set the receiver down gently then slipped into a blue flannel nightshirt a gift from jared and walked to the living room roscoe who had materialized from under the bed padded along beside her she glanced through the doorway and then systematically checked the rest of the house she had as she feared read the silence well jared had left well old shoe she said scratching her dog behind one ear it looks like you and me how about a run together and then some shirred eggs for breakfast later maybe well make love the letter in jareds careful printing was on the kitchen table he had taken their wedding picture from the mantel and used it as a weight to keep the single sheet in place kate moved the photograph enough to read his words but left it touching the page it sounds so easy so obvious that im not sure i even listened when the minister said the words for better or for worse it all sounds so easy until one day you stop and ask yourself for whose better for whose worse what do i do when her better seems like my worse dammit kate im forty years old and i feel like such a child do you know that in all the time she was alive i never once heard my mother say no to my father some role model huh next came lisabright beautiful and imbued with absolutely no ambition or direction i thought she would make a perfect wife she cooked the soup and pinched back the coleus and i kept her pipe filled with good dope and decided when we could afford to do what and that was that i still dont know why she ran off the way she did and if another lisa had come along i probably would have married her in a snap but another lisa didnt you did almost before i knew it i had fallen in love with and marrsed a woman who had as rich and interesting and complicated a life outside of our marriage as i did probably more so after first mother and then lisa it was like moving to a foreign country for me new customs new mores what do you mean i was wrong to assume wed have the same last name what do you mean i was wrong to assume that you would be free to attend three rallies and a campaign dinner with me what do you mean i should have asked first what do you mean youve been involved in trouble at your job that might affect my career i could go on all night listing my misguided assumptions in this marriage its as though i dont have the programming to adapt well i may not have the programming but i do have the desire its taken most of the night sitting here to feel sure of that if what youve said is all true i want to do whatever i can to help straighten it out if what youve told me is not true then i also want to face that issue and my commitment to you and well get whatever kind of help is necessary if we dont make it it wont be because i ran away ive gone to speak to my father and then who knows perhaps a chat with norton reese bear with me kate it may say five years on the calendar but this marriage business is still new stuff for me i love you i really do jared kate reread the letter laughing and crying at once jareds words she knew meant no more than a temporary reprieve a respite from the nightmare still he had given her the one thing she needed most next to answers time time to work through the events that were steamrolling her life were going to find out rose she said grimly were going to find out who and were going to find out why a sharp bark sounded from the living room and kate realized that she had been talking to herself through the doorway she could see roscoe prancing uncomfortably by the door to the rear deck oh poor baby she laughed im sorry focused on letting the dog out she missed the slight movement outside the kitchen window and failed to sense the eyes watching her she pulled open the slider and roscoe dashed out into a most incredible morning the temperature according to the thermometer by the door was exactly freezing pat lazy flakes falling from a glaring silverwhite sky vanished into a ground fog that was as dense as any kate could remember roscoe dashed across the deck and completely disappeared into the shroud halfway down the steps to the yard kate estimated the height of the fog at three or four feet much of it she guessed was arising off the surface of nearby green pond a small lake that because of warm underground feeders was always late to freeze and early to thaw winter fog was not uncommon on the north shore especially around essex but this was spectacular it was a morning just begging to be run through she dressed and then stretched sorting out the route they would run mixing low spots and high hills and straightaways along five miles of back roads wearing a gold watch cap and a highvisibility red sweatsuit she trotted out the front door and whistled for rosco he was almost at her side before she could see him a fiver this morning dog she said as they moved up the sloping driveway and out of the fog think youre mutt enough to handle it at the end of the drive she turned right had she mapped their route to the left she might have wondered about the bmw parked not particularly near anyones house and perhaps even noticed the blue metropolitan hospital parking sticker on the rear window it was near perfect air for running cold and still to either side of the narrow roadway the fog covered the forest floor like cotton batting race pace today rose she said eightminute miles or less and im not waiting for you so keep up in reality she knew roscoe could maintain her pace all day and still stop from time to time to sniff out a shrub or two after a quarter of a mile they left the pavement and turned onto a plowed dirt road meandering along an active stream named on the maps as marthas brook kate loved crossing the picturesque lowwalled field stone bridges that spanned the water in part she had chosen this route because of them by the end of the first mile her thoughts had begun to separate themselves from the run for the next two or three miles she knew her ideas would flow more freely her imagination more clearly than in any other situation following a kaleidoscope of notions a kind of sorting out process her mind settled on the breast biopsy perhaps under the stress of exhaustion ellens deteriorating condition and the rest of the chaos in her life she actually had made a mistake for a time the grisly thought held sway bringing with it a most unpleasant tightness in her gut gradually though the truth reappeared emerging like a phoenix from the ashes of her selfdoubt the cells she had read had been she was certain cancerous but if they had been then somewhere a switch had been made and later reversed but how who the broken cryostat was she decided part of the puzzle sheila possible but why the images led into those of other tissues other cellsthe ovaries of beverly vitale and ginger rittenhouse ever since the discovery of anthranilic acid in her own vitamins kate had several times a day been checking herself for bruises and wondering if pockets of scar tissue in her ovaries had already made a mockery of their discussions about having children she had to find out the answer almost certainly lay in the omnicenter and more specifically in the data banks of carl horners monkeys kate was heading down a steep grade toward the first of the field stone overpasses when the blue bmw crested the hill behind her and accelerated immersed in the run and her thoughts she lost several precious seconds after hearing the engine before she turned to it the speeding automobile made a sharp unmistakably deliberate swing to the right and headed straight for her there was no time to think there was only time to react the waisthigh wall of the bridge was only a few feet away a single step and she dove for the top of it she was in midair when the bmw hit her just below her right knee the impact spun her in a horizontal pinwheel she struck the edge of the wall midthigh and then tumbled over it as she fell she heard the crunch of metal against stone and the agonizing cry of her dog the fall twelve feet from the top of the wall was over before she could make any physical adjustment whatsoever she landed on her back in a drift of halffrozen snow air exploded from her lungs and a branch from a rotting log tore through her sweatshirt and her right side just below her ribs desperately she tried to draw in a breath for five seconds ten nothing would move finally she felt a whisper of air first in the back of her throat and then in her chest she tried to deepen her effort but a searing pain from her side cut her short she touched the pain and then checked the fingertips of her tan woolen gloves they were soaked with blood frantically she tried to sort out what had happened she had been hit roscoe had been hit too possibly killed it had not been an accident whoever was driving had tried to run them down gingerly she tested her hands and then her legs her right leg throbbed and her right foot which was dangling in the icy water of the brook seemed twisted at an odd angle please god dont let it be broken there was pain but gratefully there was full movement as well at that moment overhead a car door opened and closed she turned toward the noise but could see nothing it took several seconds to realize why she was quite literally buried in the fog from somewhere above and to her left a branch snapped then another the driver of the car was making his way down the steep embanktrlentx more than likely to check the completeness of his work could he see where she was possibly not the fog might well be concealing her at least from farther away than ten feet or so carefully she slipped off her gold cap and stuffed it into the snow the burning rent in her side was making it hard to concentrate should she try crawling away beneath the fog would her battered legs even hold weight her back was hurting should she test it roll to one side could she from farther to her left she heard still another snap and then a soft splash and a groan her pursuer had stepped or slipped into the brook it was definitely a man or perhaps there were two she thought about roscoe was he still alive was he helpless in pain the images sickened her for a time there was silence kate peered into the mist but could see nothing the pain in her legs back and side sent chilly tears down her cheeks then she heard it a soft crunch still downstream from where she was lying but almost certainly moving in her direction she swept her hand over the snow searching for a rock or a stick of some sort her fingers touched and then curled about a dead branch perhaps an inch and a half in diameter she drew it toward her was it too long too unwieldy to use she would get one swing if that and no more again she jiggled the branch it seemed unentangled but she would not know for sure until she made her move suddenly she saw movement to her left the legs and gloved hand of a man not ten feet away dangling from his hand swinging loosely back and forth was a tire wrench kate drew in a breath held it and tensed at any moment she would be seen the legs were just turning toward her when she lunged rising painfully to her knees and swinging the branch in the same motion her weapon three feet long with several protruding wooden spikes came free of the snow and connected with the side of the mans knee he dropped instantly to the water as much from the surprise and location of the blow as from its force ignoring the pain in her legs and side kate stood up readying the branch for another swing it was then she saw her attackers face bill she cried staring at the wildeyed apparition her hesitation was costly zimmermann lashed out with his feet sweeping her legs out from under her and sending her down heavily against the rocks and into the shallow icy water the wrench lay in the snow just to his right zimmermann grabbed at it and still on his knees in the brook swung wildly sparks showered from a small boulder inches from kates hip she rolled to her left as he swung again the blow glancing off her thigh another spin and she was free of the water scrambling for footing on the icy rocks and snow zimmermann still clutching the wrench crawled from the brook and dove at her ankles he grabbed the leg of her sweatpants but she was on her feet with enough leverage to jerk away before he could make another lunge she was off stumbling along the bank and then under the field stone bridge the ground fog once her shield was now her enemy again and again she slipped on rocks she could not see and tripped over fallen logs from the grunts and cries behind her though she could tell that zimmermann was encountering similar difficulties still the man was coming she had been so stupid not to have considered that he might be involved in the evil at the omnicenter so foolish to think that he didnt know what was going on she glanced over her shoulder zimmermann visible from the chest up was bobbing along not thirty yards behind her he was over six feet tall and the deep snow was she feared more difficult for her to negotiate than it was for him in addition she was hobbled by the tightness and pain in her leg where the fender of zimmermanns car had struck she had only two advantages her conditioning and her knowledge of the area if the man caught up with her she knew neither would matter she risked another check behind her he was closer unquestionably closer the snow was slowing her down too much she cut to her left and into the brook there at least zimmermanns longer legs would be no advantage possibly even a hindrance the frigid anklehigh water sloshed in her running shoes and bathe her lower legs in pain could she outrun or at least outlast him it was possible but one slip one misplaced branch and it would be over for her she had to get back to the road either back to the road or or hide she slowed casting about for familiar landmarks somewhere nearby was a culvert a steel tube perhaps three feet across running fifty or so feet through the high embankment on which the road had been built if she could find it and if it were not blocked she could crawl inside hoping that zimmermann would not see her or even if he did would be too broad across the shoulders to follow she glanced downstream just as the man fell in seconds however he was on his feet and arms flailing for balance was again beginning to close on her if she was to do something anything it had to be soon at that moment she saw what she had been seeking it was a huge old elm sheared in two by lightning its upper half forming a natural bridge across marthas brook fifty yards beyond it if her memory hadnt failed her the stream would bend sharply to the left and just beyond the bend at about knee level would be the culvert that roscoe had discovered two or three years before she ducked beneath the elm and ran low to the water her eyes barely above the fog at the bend she dropped to all fours and began crawling along the icy embankment please be there be there frozen chunks of snow scraped her face and rocks tore away the knees of her sweatpants she felt a fullness in her throat and coughed spattering the snow beneath her with blood more than likely she knew from a punctured lung she crawled ahead sliding one hand along the slope at the height where she remembered the culvert her hopes had begun to fade when she saw it the diameter was even less than she had thought nearer two feet than three but it was still wide enough for her to fit a fine trickle of water suggested that the small pond on the other side of the embankment was lower than her exit point from somewhere in the fog not far back came a splash zimmermann was close kate ducked into the dank rusty pipe inches at a time she began to pull herself toward the faint silvergray light at the other end the culvert coarse and corroded was painfully cold with the exertion of her run now past kate was beginning to freeze her feet especially her toes throbbed and the sound of her teeth chattering like castanets was resonating through the metal tube again she coughed again there was the spattering of blood she was perhaps a third of the way along when she heard him crunching about in the snow behind her fearing the noise her movement was making she stopped biting down on the collar of her sweatshirt to stop the chattering kate i know youre hurt he called out i want to help you no more violence we can work things out did he know where she was dammit why couldnt she stop shaking kate you want to know about the drugs about whether or not you are sterile about how you can stop your friends bleeding i can answer all your questions i can get you someplace warm frightened of the bleeding in her chest and numb in those areas of her body that werent in merciless pain kate found herself actually considering the mans offer warm he had promised she would be warm warmth and answers maybe she should try and reason with him she forced her mind to focus on the wrench and bit down on her sweatshirt all the harder you know zimmermann called out even if you make it back no one is going to believe your story i have my whereabouts at this moment completely vouched for youre crazy and a pathological liar every one knows that youre the talk of the hospital half the people think youre on drugs and the other half think youre just plain sick im the only person who can help you kate im the only one who can save your friend im the only one who can get you warm now come on over here and lets talk twenty feet away from where zimmermann stood kate buried her face in the crook of her arm and struggled against the insanity that was telling her the man meant what he was saying about no violence suit yourself she heard him say its your funeral yours and your friends steaming coffee crackling golden fire sunshine white beach flannel down comforter fur slippers stifling her sobs in the sleeve of her sweatshirt kate fought the fear and the pain and the cold with images of anything that was warm cocoa wood stove jacuzzi tea quartz heater electric blanket soup behind her now there was only silence had he left she strained to hear the engine of his car had he found the culvert and crossed over the road to wait by the far end her legs and arms were leadened by the cold could she even make it out damn him she thought forcing herself ahead an inch he knew how to save ellen damn him another inch he even knew whether she herself had been sterilized or not damn him damn him damn him the silvergray hole grew fainter her eyes closed her other senses clouded seconds later what little consciousness remained slipped away it was as if a decade had melted away jared faced his father as he had so many times during the confused years of lisa and vermont struggling to remain reasonably calm and maintain eye contact kate is sick son very sick samuels said i would suggest we make arrangements for her hospitalization as soon as possible and as rann as that is done you should begin to senarate your career from her she will bring you down i promise you that martha mitchell did it to her husband and i assure you kate will do it to youif she hasnt already ive contacted sol creighton at laurel hill he has a bed waiting for her and he says we have grounds for commitment if necessary with some time and perhaps some medication he assures me that even the worst sociopathic personality can be helped dad stop using that word you have no right to diagnose her jared face the facts kate is a lovely woman i care for her very much but she is a liar and quite possibly a liar who completely believes her own fabrications i know she looks perfectly fine and sounds logical but the hallmark of a sociopath is exactly that physical and verbal glibness the only way to realize what one is dealing with is to catch her in lie after lie but io you really think someone other than kate sent that letter to the papers about bobby geary i dont know and the chemist and the ashburton foundation and the nurse at stonefield do you think they were all lying i dont and what about the biopsy you tell me everyone in kates department says she made a mistake the truth is right there in the slides yet there is kate insisting she did nothing wrong samuels withdrew a cigar from his humidor tested the aroma along its full length and then clipped and lit it he motioned for jared to have one if he wished jared glanced at his watch made an expression of distaste and shook his head christ dad its only eightthirty in the morning samuels shrugged its my morning and its my cigar jared looked across the desk at his father trim and confident wearing the trappings of success and power as comfortably as he wore his slippers unable to speak jared stared down at the gilded feet of his fathers desk resting on the exquisite oriental carpet a secret weapon thats what kate had called him a source of strength for her she had spoken the words to his father but they were really meant for him with tremendous effort he brought his eyes up i hear what you are saying dad and i understand what you want and i cant go along with it kate says shes innocent of any lying and i you what jared felt himself wither before the mans glare i believe her and i m going to do what i can to help clear her there was a strength in his words that surprised him he stood up ill tell you something else dad if i find that shes telling the truth youre going to have a hell of a lot of explaining to do samuels rose anger sparking from his eyes i seem to recall a conversation similar to this we were in that matchbox office of yours in vermont i warned you not to marry that rootless hippie you were living with i told you there was nothing to her you stood before me then just as you are now and as much as threw me out of your office two years later your wife and daughter were gone and you were crawling to me for help have you forgotten dad that was then this is have you forgotten no i havent have you forgotten the money and the time i spent trying to find that woman despite my own personal feelings about her look i dont want to fight get out samuels said evenly when you come to your senses when you discover once again that i was right call me dad i i said get out samuels turned his back and stared out the window as jared opened the door he nearly collided with jocelyn trent who was standing up and backing away at the same time quickly he closed the door behind him what were you doing there he asked jared please dont make me explain she took him by the arm led him to the hall closet and began helping him on with his coat meet me in ten minutes she whispered in his ear the little variety store on the corner of charles and mount vernon i have something important for you for kate actually the study door opened just as she was letting jared out winfield samuels stood arms folded tightly across his chest and watched him go even dressed down in pants and a plain wool overcoat jocelyn trent turned heads jared stood by the variety store and watched several drivers slow as they passed where she was waiting to cross charles street he left the shelter of the recessed doorway and met her at the corner their relationship while cordial had never approached a friendship in any sense his father had taken some pains to keep the interaction between them superficial and neither had ever been inclined to push matters further thank you for meeting me like this she said guiding him back to the shadow of the doorway i dont have much time so ill say what i have to say and go fair enough jared im leaving your father i intend to tell him this afternoon im sorry he said i know how much he cares for you does he i think you know as well as i do that caring isnt one of win samuels strong suits its too bad too because strange as it might sound i think i might actually love him then why please jared i really dont have much time and what im doing is very hard for me just know that i have my reasonsfor leaving him and for giving you this she handed him a sealed envelope kates a wonderful woman she doesnt deserve the treatment hes giving her ive been completely loyal to your father that is until now i know how hard it is to stand up to him lord knows ive wanted to enough i think you did the right thing back there jocelyn do you know if my father is lying or not its very important she smiled im aware of how important it is i was listening at the door remember the answer is that i dont know at least not for sure theres a phone number in that envelope jared go someplace quiet and dial it if my suspicions about that number are correct you should be able to decide for yourself which of the two kate or your father is telling the truth i dont understand he said what is this number where did you get it please i dont want to say any more because theres a small chance i might be wrong lets just leave it that the number is one your father has called from time to time since ive known him i handle all of the household bills including the phone bill so i know a year or two ago i accidentally overheard part of a conversation he was having some of what i heard disturbed me so i noted down the exact time of the call thats how i learned this number i dont want to say any more okay okay but i wish you well jared both of you the things i overheard kate say last night have really helped me make some decisions i should have made a long time ago i hope that what ive done will help her she took his hand squeezed it for a moment and was gone jared watched her hurry up mt vernon street then he tore open the plain envelope the phone number printed on a threebyfive card was in the area los angeles he drove to his office trying to imagine what the number might be once at his desk he sat for nearly a minute staring at the card before he finally dialed a woman clearly awakened by the call answered on the third ring hello she said jared struggled for a breath and pressed the receiver so tightly against his ear that it hurt hello the woman said again is anybody there even after so many years he knew lisa he could barely say the word yes who is this who is this please slowly jared set the receiver back in its cradle friday december it was pressure pain from the pipe more than cold that tugged kate free of a sleep that was deeper than sleep in the twilight moment before she was fully conscious she imagined herself buried alive the victim of some twisted vicious kidnapper in just a few hours she would suffocate or freeze to death jared had that little time to raise her ransom and the only one he could turn to she knew was his father the sound of win samuelss laughter echoed in her tomb growing louder and louder until with a scream she came fully awake she was on her back her lips and cheeks were caked with dried and frozen blood dim light from the ends of the culvert barely defined the corroding metal just a foot or so from her face lie still she thought just dont move sleep until jared comes close your eyes again and sleep the thoughts were so comforting so reassuring that she had to struggle to remember that they were no more than the cold lying to her paralyzing her from within for a time all she could think about was sleep sleep and zimmermanns taunting warning that even if she survived no one would believe her story sick crazy drugged up thats what they all believed it was hopeless for her zimmermann said it and he was right over and over again in a voice as soothing as a warm tub the cold spoke to her of hopelessness and sleep kate flexed her hands and her feet struggling against the downy comfort of the lies and the inertia remain still and you will die surrender to the cold and you will never see jared again never get the chance to tell him how much his letter and his decision mean to you she tried pushing herself along with her feet but could not bend her knees enough to get leverage she had to see him she had to tell him that she too was ready to make choices aroused by the aching in her legs and the far deeper pain in her side she twisted and wriggled onto her belly she had been wrong to allow willoughby to nominate her without trying harder to see things from jareds perspective she had been wrong now she could only admit that and hope jared believed it had been he and not the devastating events who had helped her see the true order of her priorities she was less than halfway from the far end of the pipe the fog seemed to have lifted she could now make out the silhouettes of trees against the white sky a few more feet and there was enough light to read the numbers on her watch eleven fifteen she had been entombed for over an hour was zimmermann still out there could he possibly have stayed around in the snow and the cold for over an hour driven by the need to see jared again to set matters straight she worked herself arm over arm along the icy metal a foot from the edge she stopped and listened beyond the soft wisp of her own breathing there was nothing had an hour been long enough wouldnt zimmermann have left concerned about having his car attract attention finally she abandoned her attempts at reasoning through the situation if he was out there waiting there was little she would be able to do if he wasnt she would overcome whatever pain and cold she had to and make it home there were amends to be made with a muted cry of pain she curled her fingers around the edge of the culvert and pulled were sorry but we are unavailable to take your call right now please wait for the tone leave your name number and the time and kate or jared will get back to you as soon as possible kate its just me again ignore the previous two messages im not going to stay at the office and im not going to speak with reese im coming home please dont go anywhere thanks i love you something was wrong in almost five years of marriage jared had never felt so intense a connection to his wife with that heightened sensitivity and three unanswered calls home had come a foreboding that weighed on his chest like an anvil the feeling was irrational he told himself over and over again groundless and foolish she was at a neighborss or on a run with his mg still in the office garage where it had been all week he had taken her volvo but still there were plenty of places to which she could have walked he left the city and crossed the mystic river bridge the rational part of him struggling to keep the volvo under seventy she was fine there was some perfectly logical explanation why she hadnt answered his calls the past hour and a half he just hadnt hit on it certainly his concentration and powers of reason were not all they could be it had been one hell of a morning the call to california the sound of lisas voice had left him at s once elated and sickened his father had lied he had lied about lisa and possibly about stonefield as well jared cringed at the thought of how close he had come to siding with the man silently he gave thanks that he had made his decision set down on paper his commitment to kate before he had learned the truth about his father the man had been paying lisa off all those years that conclusion was as inescapable as it was disgusting they were some pair his exwife and winfield one totally vapid one totally evil some goddamn pair then there was stacy as he weaved along past route is abysmal stretch of fastfood huts factory outlets budget motels garish restaurants and raunchy nightclubs jared ached with thoughts of her what did she believe had become of her father would there ever be a way he could reenter her life without destroying whatever respect she had for her mother possibly thereby destroying the girl herself kate would have a sense of what was right to do together they could decide damn but he had come close so close to blowing it all the house was deserted kates running gear was gone and so was roscoe it had been several hours since his first callfar too long he checked the area around the house and yard nothing there were but two choices wait some more or call the police the heavy sense of apprehension so illdefined while he was in boston seemed more acute there was no sense in waiting as he walked to the phone in the kitchen he glanced out the front window three neighborhood children all around eight were trudging up the driveway pulling a sled on the sled was a cardboard carton the path to the front door only as wide as a shovel was too narrow for the sled two youngsters stayed behind kneeling by the box while the third ran up the walk jared met her at the door mr samuels its roscoe she panted we found him in the snow jared a dreadful emptiness in his gut raced past the girl to the sled roscoe packed in blankets looked up and made a weak attempt to rise his tail wagged free of the cover and slapped excitedly against the cardboard his leg is broke one of the other children a boy said simply jared held the dog down and pulled back the blanket roscoes right leg was fractured the bone protruding from a gash just above the knee come kids he said scooping up the box come inside please and well take care of rose do you think you can take me to where you found him yes i know the little girl said we have teachers conference today so no school we were sledding down the hill to the bridge and there he was just lying in the snow my mom gave us the blankets and it looks like hes been hit by a car jared said kids this is important did any of you see kateyou know my wife the children shook their heads he reached down and stroked the dogs forehead blood trickled from the corner of his mouth where his teeth had torn through well lets get some help for roscoe then well go back to the spot where you found him he felt consumed by feelings of panic and dread and struggled to keep a note of calm in his voice frightened confused children would be no asset to himor to kate minutes later three of them jared and two of the youngsters were in the car the third had been left behind to keep the dog still and await the arrival of the veterinarian okay kids jared said you said you were sledding near a bridge the stone bridge over the little stream both nodded enthusiastically good i know just where that is the short drive over the narrow snowy road seemed endless finally jared parked the volvo at the top of the hill and then half ran half slid to the indentation in the snow where the children assured him they had found roscoe he had thought to take his parka but had not changed his slacks or loafers and the trek from the spot into the surrounding woods was both awkward and cold the snow around him was save for his own footprints smooth and unbroken after a scanning search he made his way back to the road and started down the hill at his request the children followed one on each side of the road checking to be sure he had not missed anything at the stone bridge he stopped there was evidence of some sort of collision at the base of the wall a piece of granite had been sheared off and a gouge perhaps two feet long extended along the wall from that point he searched the roadway and then looked over the wall the snow on one side of the shallow brook seemed disrupted in the very center of the area he saw a flash of bright yellow partially buried in the snow ordering the children to remain where they were he raced down the steep embankment to the water it was kates cap quite deliberately it seemed wedged into the snow then only a few feet from the cap he saw a swatch of another color it was blood almost certainly dried blood smeared across a small stretch of packed snow there had been some kind of struggle the marks around him made that clear had kate been dragged off somewhere he looked for signs of that but instead noticed footprints paralleling the stream just beyond the bridge slipping in and out of the water he ran to the spot there were he was certain two sets he looked overhead the children following his progress had crossed the road and were peering down at him from atop the wall the girl he knew lived just past the end of the road half a mile perhaps a bit more away crystal he called out is your mommy still home can you two make it back home to her yes please do that then tell her kate is lost and may be hurt ask if she can drive out here and help look for her okay okay and crystal you all did a fine job bringing roscoe in the way you did hurry on home now jared stayed where he was until the crunch of the childrens boots had completely vanished then he closed his eyes and listened within the silence for a sound any kind of sign he heard nothing increasingly aware of the cold in his feet and legs he stepped in the deep tracks fearing the worst and expecting with each stride to have his fears become reality a hundred yards from the bridge the tracks turned sharply to the left and vanished into the stream kate he called her name once and then again his voice was instantly swallowed by the forest and the snow kate its me its jared there was a heaviness a fastness to the place and a silence that was hypnotic as he trudged along the side of the stream looking for renewed signs he felt the silence deepen then suddenly he knew he felt it as surely as he felt the cold kate was somewhere nearby she was nearby and she was still he called to her every few feet as he ducked under a huge fallen tree and followed the stream bed in a sharp bend to the left then he stopped there was something different about this place far to his right embedded in the steep slope that he guessed led up to the road was a drainage pipe at the base of the pipe were footprints kate he closed his eyes and almost immediately felt a strange sense of detachment she was not far and she was alive he felt it clearly it was as if their lives their energies were joined by a thin silken strand of awareness jared it was a word but not a word a sound but not a sound his eyes still closed he exhaled slowly and then listened jared help me her voice it seemed was more within him than without he worked his way along the embankment calling her name then he shouted it several times into the long empty culvert finally hoping for a better vantage point he hauled himself up to the road she was there face down a third of the way down the slope on the far side still clawing though feebly at the snow jared leapt over the edge sliding and tumbling down to her gently he turned her onto his lap her hair was matted and frozen her face spattered with blood her warmup suit shredded in spots was stiffened with ice her eyes were closed katey its me he said ive got you youre going to be all right he worked her hair free from where it had frozen to her face her breathing was shallow each expiration accompanied by a soft whimper of pain honey can you hear me her eyes opened and then slowly focused on his face oh jared please roscoe he kissed her hes hurt but hes okay dr finnertys coming to get him what about you have you broken anything ribs she managed in a voice that was half groan half cough lung may be punctured jesus kate im going to lift you up ill try not to hurt you but weve got to get up to the road with strength enhanced by the urgency of the moment he had no trouble lifting her negotiating the steep icy slope however was another matter footing was treacherous and every two or three baby steps upward he was forced to set her down in order to regain purchase inches at a time they moved ahead when he finally heaved over the top of the slope onto the roadside jared fell to his knees clutching her to his chest and gasping for air helplessly he sat there warming her face with his breath and watching the minute but steady rise and fall of her chest then through the silence surrounding their breathing he heard the soft hum of an approaching car moments later a beige station wagon rounded the bend ahead of them in the front seat were a woman and two very excited children way to go crystal jared whispered he put his lips by kates ear help is here honey just hang in there help is here her eyes opened momentarily her lips tightened in a grim attempt at a smile zimmermann did this she said jared paced from the small wellappointed quiet room out to the hall and back mary t henderson hospital was reputed to be among the best community hospitals in the state but it was still a community hospital only a fraction of the size of the boston teaching facilities nearly three hours had passed since the surgeon lee jordan had taken kate into the operating room jordan was according to the emergency room physician the finest surgeon on the hospital staff jared had to laugh at his total surprise when the distinguished graytempled man his mind had projected as lee jordan turned out in fact to be a slender extremely attractive woman in her midforties would he ever truly overcome all the years of programming kates wound was a bad one the gash jordan had explained required debridement in the operating room and in all likelihood an openchest procedure would be needed to repair the laceration to her jared had been allowed to see kate briefly during the wait for the or team to arrive but there had been no real chance to discuss any details of william zimmermanns attempt on her life an officer from the essex police department had come taken what little information was available from him and left with promises of state police involvement as soon as kate could assist them with a statement meanwhile it was doubtful that jareds word would be enough to issue an arrest warrant jared was studying the small plaque proclaiming that the quiet room was the gift of a couple named berman when lee jordan emerged through the glass doors to the surgical suite her face which had been fresh and alert on her arrival in the emergency ward four hours before was gray and drawn and for a moment he feared the worst your wifes okay jordan said as soon as she was close enough to speak without raising her voice she appraised him are you i yes im okay he braced himself against the wall its just that for a moment there i was frightened that jordan patted him on the shoulder you married one tough lady my friend she said theres frostbite on the tips of her toes ears and nose but it looks like she came in from the cold in time to save everything the tear in her lung wasnt too too big i sewed it up and then fixed that gash in her side shes in for a few pretty achy days but i hope nothing worse than that youll be able to see her in half an hour or so ive asked the nurses to come and get you thank you thank you very much im glad shes all right dr lee jordan said it was after five by the time jared arrived home medicated and obviously affected by her anesthesia kate had managed only to squeeze his hand and acknowledge that she knew he was in her hospital room even so dr jordan had warned him that she would in all likelihood remember nothing of the first five or six hours postop roscoe was another story as soon as jared arrived at the veterinarians the dog was up and hopping about his cage mindless of his plaster cast and showing no residual effects from the anesthesia that had allowed a metal plate to be screwed in place across the fracture in his leg after seeing kate with half a dozen tubes running into and out of her body the sight of the battered and broken animal was the last straw zimmermann would pay whatever it took jared vowed the man would pay dearly exhausted from the day and in fact from almost thirtysix hours without sleep jared brought a bottle of lowenbrau dark to the bedroom finished half of it in two long draughts and then stripped to his underwear and stretched out on the bed there was little sense the nurses had told him in returning to the hospital before morning so be it he would rest and read and say a dozen prayers of thanks for kates life and for roscoes and for jocelyn trent and for being allowed to learn the sad truth about his father before it was too late he had bunched up two pillows and was looking through the magazines on the bedside table when he noticed their telephone answering machine it had been on since kate left for her run and there were a number of messages the first three were from jared himself another was from ellen and still another was from one of the firms vip clients who had apparently been assured that winfields son wouldnt mind in the least being called at home the final message was for kate from a man named arlen paquette kate bennett this is arlen paquette from redding the man said in a rushed anxious tone i wont be alone for more than a few seconds i have answers for you many answers come to the subbasement of the omnicenter at precisely eightthirty tonight bring help there may be trouble please trust me i know what weve done to you but please trust me hes coming ive got to go goodbye jared raced for pen and paper then he played the message over and wrote it down verbatim answers at last someone was promising answers he scrambled into a pair of jeans a work shirt and a sweater it was already after seven there would barely be time to get to metro by eightthirty let alone to try and pick up police help on the way he would have to hurry to the subbasement of the omnicenter and rely on himself the omnicenter he threw on his parka and rushed to kates volvo that was zimmermanns place the man would be there he felt certain of it im coming for you you fucker he panted as he skidded out of the drive and down salt marsh road friday december like so many works of greatness the formulas derived by william zimmermanns father were elegant in their simplicity even without zimmermanns help in translating the explanatory notes from the german arlen paquette suspected he should have been able to follow the steps involved in the synthesis of the hormone estronate especially in the subbasement omnicenter laboratory which was specifically equipped for the job the message to call cyrus redding had been waiting at the front desk when paquette returned to the ritz from surreptitiously recording a conversation with norton reese during which the gloating administrator had incriminated himself and a technician named pierce a number of times the compact recorder still hooked to his belt paquette had entered the elevator to his floor i was beginning to think you had run away a mans voice said from behind startled the chemist whirled it was reddings bodyguard a wiry seemingly emotionless man whom paquette had never heard called any name other than nunes why hello paquette said wishing he had stayed at the tavern on the way back for a third drink i just picked up a message from mr redding but it says to call him at the darlington number is he hes there nunes said showing nothing to dispel paquettes image of a gunman whose loyalty to the pharmaceutical magnate had no limits hes waiting for your call from that moment on paquette had barely been out of nuness sight now in the bright fluorescence of the subbasement laboratory paquette glanced first at zimmermann and then at nunes and prayed that the fortyfive minutes until eightthirty would pass without incident a deal had been struck between redding and zimmermannmoney in exchange for a set of formulas redding had let him in on that much however the presence of the taciturn thug suggested that redding anticipated trouble or perhaps he had no intention of honoring his end of the bargainquite possibly both okay thats seven minutes zimmermann said seconds before the mechanical timer rang out theres a shortcut my father used at this juncture but i never did completely understand it dr paquette i suggest you just go on to the next page and continue the steps in order he performed these next reactions over in that corner and he checked the purity of the distillate with that spectrophotometer paquette nodded and moved around the slate workbench to the area zimmermann had indicated the omnicenter director was neither biochemist nor genius but he had observed his father at work enough to be able to oversee each step of the synthesis and oversee he hadeach maneuver and each microdrop of the way the laboratory was quite remarkable hidden behind a virtually invisible electronically controlled door it had no less than three sophisticated spectrophotometers each programmed to assess the consistency of the hormone at various stages of its synthesis and through feedback mechanisms to adjust automatically the chemical reaction where needed it was a small area perhaps fifteen feet by thirty but its designer had paid meticulous attention to the maximum use of space did your father design all this paquette asked be careful doctor your reagent is beginning to overheat zimmermann said ignoring the question as he had most others about his father excuse me but are you timing a reaction i dont know about no why thats the third time youve looked at your watch in the past ten minutes oh that paquette hoped his laugh did not sound too nervous out of the corner of his eye he saw nunes seated on a tall stool at the end of the lab bench adjust his position to hear better a habit dating back to high school perhaps beyond thats all he had made up his mind that there was no way he would complete the estronate synthesis and turn the three notebooks over to nunes that act he suspected would be his last he and zimmermann were not scripted to leave the laboratory alive the more the evening had worn on the more certain he had become of that he glanced at the metal hand plate to the right of the entrance though unmarked it had to be the means of opening the door there were less than thirty minutes to go if kate bennett had gotten his message and if she had taken it seriously she would be waiting with help in the storage area outside the laboratory paquettes plan was simple at eight thirtyfive allowing five minutes for any delay on bennetts part he would announce the need to use the mens room they had passed one a floor above on their way in with surprise on their side whatever muscle bennett had brought with her should have a decent chance at overpowering nunes if there was no one in the storage room when the door slid open he would have to improvise there was one thing of which he was sure once outside the laboratory he was not going back in god but he wished he had a drink traffic into the city was inordinately light for a friday evening and it was clear to jared that barring any monstrous delays he would make it to metro with time to spare still he used his horn and high beams to clear his way down route risks bring help there may be trouble with each mile arlen paquettes warning grew in his thoughts he had made a mistake in not ca ling the boston police before he left essex he could see that now still what would he have said how lengthy an explanation would have been required his father he knew could pick up the phone and with no explanation whatsoever have half a dozen officers waiting for him at the front door to the omnicenter answers paquette had promised answers perhaps for kates sake it was worth swallowing his pride and anger and calling winfield then he realized that the issue went far deeper than pride and anger the man could not be trusted not now not ever again bring help jared pulled off the highway and skidded to a stop by a bank of pay phones it was seven fortyfive he was twenty minutes twentyfive at the most from the omnicenter there was still time to do something but what with no clear idea of what he was going to say he called the boston police department idahid like to speak to detective finn please he heard his own voice say yes thats right martin finn im sorry i dont know what district four maybe finn the thought jared saw now had been in the back of his mind all along tough but fair thats how his father had described the man if that was the case then it would take only the promise of some answers to get him to the omnicenter finn was not at his desk has he gone home for the night jared asked of the officer who answered finns phone well does anyone know samuels jared samuels im a lawyer detective finn knows me what is your name well please sergeant this is very urgent and there isnt much time could you see if you could get a message to lieutenant finn to meet me at eightfifteen at the front entrance to the omnicenter at metropolitan hospital thats right in half an hour and sergeant if you cant locate him could you or some other officer meet me instead i dont know if its a matter of life or death or not listen i dont have time to explain please just try jared hurried back to the volvo wishing he had more of an idea of who arlen paquette was or at least of what was awaiting him at the omnicenter it was exactly eight oclock when he sped over the crest of a long upgrade and saw ahead and to his right the glittering tiara of boston at night perhaps it was the tension of the moment perhaps the six hours since his last drink whatever the reason arlen paquette felt his hands beginning to shake and his concentration beginning to waver he pulled a gnarled handleerchief from his back pocket and dabbed at the cold sweat on his forehead and upper lip it was only ten minutes past the hour the hormone synthesis which had proceeded flawlessly was well over half completed are you all right zimmermann asked fine im fine paquette said clutching a beaker of ice water with two hands to keep its contents from sloshing about i id like to talk with mr nunes for a moment privately why zimmermann asked with a defensiveness in his voice theres no problem with the procedure up to now i assure you of that you are doing an excellent job of following my fathers notes just keep going its not that listen ill be right back nunes he whispered his back turned to zimmermann i need a drink no booze until you finish this work mr reddings orders as nunes leaned forward to respond the coat of his perfectly tailored suit fell away just enough for paquette to see the holstered revolver beneath his left arm any doubt he harbored regarding his fate once the formulas were verified vanished nunes have a heart the gunmans only response was an impatient nod in the direction of the incomplete experiment any problem zimmermann called out no problem nunes said as paquette shuffled back say dr zimmermann wheres the nearest john paquette slowed and listened in less than twenty minutes he planned to ask the same question and wait for nunes to open the door for him then an unexpected push from behind and the man would be in the arms of the police it was perfect provided of course that kate bennett had gotten his message william zimmermann pointed to the wall behind the gunman see that recessed handle in the wall right under that shelf just twist it and pull nunes did as he was instructed and a threefootwide block of shelves pulled away from the wall revealing a fairly large bathroom and stall shower father had this obsession about hidden doorways and the like zimmermann said his next sentence if there was to be one was cut off by the beaker of ice water which slipped from paquettes hands and shattered on the tile floor save for the security light in the front lobby the omnicenter was completely dark jared parked across the street and was beginning a walking inspection of the outside of the building when a blue and white patrol car pulled up martin finn stepped out looking in the gloom like a large block of granite with a homberg perched on top even at a distance jared could sense the mans impatience and irritation i got your message finn said with no more greeting than that whats going on behind him a uniformed officer remained at the wheel of the cruiser the engine was still running thanks for coming so quickly jared said i didnt know well jared checked the time there were thirteen minutes my wife is in henderson hospital someone tried to run her down with a car earlier today while she was jogging finn said nothing shes had to have surgery but shes going to be okay still nothing she couldnt speak much but she said it was dr zimmermann the head of the omnicenter who tried to run her down and then chased her with a tire wrench william zimmermann yes do you know him finn looked at him icily he delivered my daughter inwardly jared groaned well he was involved in something illegal possibly in connection with one of the big pharmaceutical houses kate discovered what was going on so he tried to kill her but he missed there was neither warmth nor the slightest hint of belief in the mans voice yes he missed jared swallowed back his mounting anger there was far too much at stake and hardly time for an argument when i returned home from the hospital a short while ago there was a message on our answering machine for kate from a man named arlen paquette i think he works for the drug house he asked that she meet him here in the subbasement of this building and that she bring help thats why i called you i suspect that zimmermann is in the middle of all this and that hes in there right now in there finn gestured at the darkened building he said the subbasement mr samuels dr zimmermanns office is on the third floor on the corner right up there ive been there several times now what on earth would he be doing in the subbasement i i dont know there were eleven minutes look lieutenant the man said exactly eightthirty there isnt much time so you want me to go busting into a locked hospital building looking to nail my wifes obstetrician because you got some mysterious message on your telephone answering machine if the doors are all locked we can get in through the tunnels we dont have to break in dammit lieutenant my wife was almost killed today do you think shes lying about the broken bones and the punctured lung no finn said only about everything else mr samuels i had a chance to do some checking up on your wife shes in hot water with just about everyone in the city it seems word has it shes just been fired for screwing up here at the hospital too face it counselor youve got a sick woman on your hands you need help all right but not the then you wont come with me jared could feel himself losing control mr samuels because of your wife i still have enough egg on my face to make a fucking omelet ill file a report if you want me to and even get a warrant if you can give me some hard facts to justify that but no commando stuff now if i were you id just go on home and see about lining up some professional help for your woman before he could even weigh the consequences jared hit the mana roundhouse punch that landed squarely on the side of finns face and sent him spinning down into a pile of plowed snow instantly the uniformed officer was out of the cruiser his hand on the butt of his service revolver finn a trickle of blood forming at the corner of his mouth waved him off no jackie he said its all right the counselor here felt he had a score to settle with me and he just settled it he pushed himself to his feet still shaking off the effects of the blow now counselor you just get the fuck out of my sight if i hear of any trouble involving you tonight im going to bust your ass from here to toledo clear jared glared at the detective youre wrong finn about my wife about refusing to help me about everything you dont know how goddamn wrong you are he glanced at his watch then turned and raced down the block toward the main entrance to the hospital and the stairway that would lead to the omnicenter tunnel there were less than five minutes left visiting hours had ended the hospital was quiet jared crossed the lobby as quickly as he dared without calling attention to himself and hurried down the nearest staircase although he used the dreary tunnels infrequently he distinctly remembered seeing a sign indicating that the omnicenter had been tacked onto the system but where the tunnel was deserted and it seemed even less well lighted than usual a caravan of stretchers lined one wall interspersed with empty canvas industrial laundry hampers on the wall opposite was a wooden sign with arrows indicating the direction to various buildings the bottom three names almost certainly including the omnicenter were obscured by a mixture of grime and graffiti kate had once told him that it took a special kind of character to love working at metro intimating that the spirit of the hospital staff and the loyalty of many of its patients were somehow bound to the physical shortcomings of the placethe concept like so much else about his wife was something jared realized he would have to work a little harder at understanding his often far from dependable sense of direction urged him toward the right there was no time to question the impulse his footsteps echoing off the cement floor and walls jared raced that way instinctively casting about for something he could use as a weapon and at the same time cursing his failure to obtain help his sense this time at least was on the mark the spur leading to the omnicenter was fifty yards away it was exactly eightthirty the darkened passageway was illuminated only by the dim glow from the main tunnel sprinting head down jared caught a glimpse of the metal security gate only an instant before he hit it the gate an expanded version of the sort used to childproof stairways was pulled across the tunnel and bolted to the opposite wall stunned he dropped to one knee pawing at the spot just above his right eye that had absorbed most of the impact then he sank to all fours if timing was as critical as arlen paquettes message had made it sound he was beaten the gate with no space below and less than a foot on top was solid exhausted and exasperated jared hauled himself up grabbed the metal slats and like a caged animal rattled them mercilessly im sorry katey was all he could think im sorry i fucked up everything so badly just hold it right there son and turn around very slowly jared froze his hands still tight around the gate ive got a gun pointed in your general direction so dont you go getting too rattled or too adventurous jared did as he was told thirty or forty feet away silhouetted by the light from behind him was a night watchman who are you what are you doin down here the man demanded please youve got to help me jared took a few steps forward thatll be far enough now how can i go about helpin you young man if i dont even know who in the hell you are jared forced himself to calm down my name is samuels my wife is a doctor on the staff here dr bennett dr kathryn bennett do you know her the night watchman lowered his revolver you the lawyer yes yes i am listen youve got to help me he approached the watchman who this time made no attempt to stop him do i now the man said his khaki uniform appeared a size perhaps two too big for him a shock of gray hair protruded from beneath his cap even with the revolver he was hardly a menacing figure please mister macfarlane walter macfarlane known your wife for yearseven before you were married to her well mr macfarlane my wifes in a hospital on the north shore right now someone tried to run her down we know who but not why a few hours ago a man called and promised me answers if i would meet him in the omnicenter subbasement right now subbasement yes he said to bring help because there might be trouble but there just wasnt enough time for me to get any you sure its the subbasement thats the level beneath this one aint nothin down there but a bunch of cartons and spare cylinders of ai i know is what he said please its already past time that kate has been gettin herself into some kinds of trouble lately i know please mr mac people talk and talk you know how it is well ill tell you something mister they have their thoughts and i have mine ten years ive walked that woman to her car when she stayed until late at night ten years shes class i tell you pure class then youll help me walter macfarlane sorted a key out from the huge ring on his belt and opened the security gate if itll help straighten things out for dr bennett count me in he said i arlen paquette was terrified there was no way out of the laboratory except past the killer nunes and yet to stay to complete the estronate synthesis meant he was convinced to die it was twentyfive minutes to nine as yet there had not been even the faintest sound from beyond the electronically controlled door kate bennett either had not received his message or had disregarded it either way he was on his own desperately he tried to sort out the situation and his options there was no way he could buy time by claiming the procedure was inaccurate zimmermann was watching his every step could he somehow enlist zimmermanns help in overpowering nunes doubtful no worse than doubtful impossible nunes had already shown him the money packed neatly in a briefcase that now rested on the benchtop zimmermanns expression had been that of a starving wolf discovering a trapped hare anything the matter zimmermann asked indicating that once again paquette was dawdling no paquette snapped and i want you off my back its my responsibility to verify these formulas and ill take all the time i need to do the job right at the far end of the lab nunes adjusted his position to keep a better eye on the two of them suddenly he waved to get their attention and placed a silencing finger over his lips with his other hand he pointed to the door someone was outside with the sure fluid movements of a professional he slid the revolver from its holster and flattened himself against the wall beside the door paquette decided that he had but one optionand not a very appealing one he had been a wrestler during his freshman and sophomore years in high school but had never been that good and in fact had been grateful when a neck injury forced him to quit since that times he had never had a fight in any physical sense with anyone nunes wvas taller than he by perhaps two inches and certainly more experienced but he had surprise and desperation on his side separated from the gunman by one of the spectrophotometers and a tangle of sophisticated glass distillation tubing paquette eased his way along the slatetopped work bench until he was no more than ten feet from him for several seconds all was quiet then he heard muffled voices at least two of them from the storage room beyond the door he strained to pick up their conversation but could make out only small snatches nunes that much closer was probably hearing more paquette wondered if those outside the door had mentioned his name if so and if nunes had heard it was the final nail in his coffin the voices grew less distinct had they just moved away or were they leaving paquette wondered even if they were to discover the door and that was most unlikelythere was no way they could locate and activate the coded electronic key carefully paquette slid the final few feet to the end of the laboratory bench zimmermann was a good twentyfive feet awayfar enough to keep him from interfering paquette gauged the distance and then focused on his two objectives nuness gun and the electronic plate on the right side of the door a single step and he hurled himself at the man grasping his gun arm at the wrist with both his hands and spinning against the metal plate the door slid open and paquette caught a glimpse of a uniformed man fumbling for the pistol holstered at his hip there was a second figure behind the man whom he recognized as kate bennetts husband in that moment nunes freed his hand and whipped paquette viciously across the face with the barrel of his revolver paquette dropped to his knees clutching at the pain and at the blood spurting from his cheek and temple all right mister drop it right now right there walter macfarlane stood in the doorway his heavy service revolver leveled at nunes whose own gun was a foot or so out of position nunes froze his head turned ever so slightly toward the intruder from his position four feet behind and to the left of macfarlane jared could see the gunmans expression clearly he seemed placid composed and totally confident back up get away from him before jared could verbalize the warning the gunman was in action he flicked his revolver far enough away to draw macfarlanes eyes and then lunged out of the watchmans line of fire and up beneath his arm macfarlanes revolver discharged with a sharp report the bullet splintered several glass beakers ricocheted off a wall and then impacted with a large can of ether on the shelf behind william zimmermann the can exploded the blast shattering most of the glassware in the room jared watched in horror as zimmermanns hair and the skin on the back of his scalp were instantly seared away his clothes set ablaze help he shrieked reeling awayfrom the wall oh god someone help me he flailed impotently at the tongues of flame that were darting upward through the crotch of his trousers and igniting his shirt his struggles sent a shelf of chemicals crashing to the floor there was a second explosion zimmermanns right arm disappeared at the elbow still he stayed on his feet lurching in purposeless circles staring at the bloody remains of his upper arm and screaming again and again a third blast from just to his left sent his body now more corpse than man hurtling across the slate tabletop through what remained of the glassware zimmermanns screeching ended abruptly as he toppled over the edge of the table and onto arlen paquette the chemist though shielded from the force of the explosion by the counter was far too dazed from the blow he had absorbed to react macfarlane and nunes both went down before the blast of heat and flying glass jared still outside the laboratory door was knocked backward but managed to keep his feet he stumbled to the doorway trying frantically to assess the situation intensely colored flames were breaking out along the benchtops filling the air with thick fetid smoke to his right walter macfarlane and the gunman lay amidst shards of glass the side of the watchmans face looked as if it had been mauled by a tiger both men were moving though without much purpose to his left there was also movement the man he assumed was arlen paquette was trying ineffectually to extricate himself from beneath the charred body of william zimmermann crawling to avoid the billows of toxic smoke jared made his way to zimmermann grabbed the corpse by its belt and the front of its smoldering shirt and heaved it onto its back paquette jared gasped are you paquette the man nodded weakly and pawed at the bloodhis and zimmermannsthat was obscuring his vision notebooks he said get the notebooks jared batted at the few spots on paquettes clothing that were still burning pulled him to a sitting position and leaned him against the wall the fumes and smoke were worsening around them ive got to get you out of here can you understand that paquettes head lolled back notebooks he said again jared glanced about on the floor beneath zimmermanns heel was a black looseleaf notebook he tucked the book under his arm and then began dragging paquette toward the doorway several times glass cut through jareds pants and into his leg once he slipped slicing a flap off n off the edge of his hand the wooden cabinets and shelves had gun to blaze making the room unbearably hot paquette was making the task of moving him from the room harder clawing at jared at one point getting his hand entangled in jareds for christs sake let go of me paquette jared shouted im trying to get you out of here can you understand that im trying to get the smoke was blinding his eyes tearing and nearly closed jared hunched low breathe through his parka and with great effort pulled paquettes arm over his shoulder hauling the man to his feet together they staggered from the lab jared was about to set paquette down against a wall in order to return for macfarlane when he remembered the oxygen there were thirty or forty large green cylinders bunched in the far corner of the storage area they possessed he suspected enough explosive potential to level a good portion of the building paquette he hollered im going to help you up the stairs then youve got to get down the tunnel and as far away from here as possible do you understand paquette nodded can you support any more of your own weight i can tly paquette his face a mask of blood forced the words out between coughs one arduous step at a time the two made their way up to the landing on the basement level acrid chemical smoke which had largely filled the storage area below drifted up the stairway around them okay were here jared said loudly ive got to go back down there you head that way through the tunnel understand good here take your book with you and just keep going he shoved the notebook into the mans hands at that instant from below there was a sharp explosion then another jared watched as paquette lurched away from him and then pitched heavily to the floor blood pouring from a wound on the side of his neck jared dropped to one knee beside the man surprised and confused by what was happening paquette notebook kate were all paquette could manage before a torrent of blood sealed his words and closed his eyes it was then jared realized the man had been shot that the explosions he had heard were from a gun not from the lab he turned at the moment nunes fired at him from the base of the stairs the bullet tore through his right thigh and caromed off the floor and wall behind him the man blackened by smoke and bleeding from cuts about his face leveled the revolver for another shot distracted by the burning pain in his leg jared barely reacted in time to drop out of the line of fire behind him and from the mouth of the tunnel alarms had begun to wail below him the man had started up the stairs through the billowing smoke notebook kate jared plucked the black notebook from beside arlen paquettes body tucked it under his arm like a footba and in a gait that was half hop and half sprint raced down the tunnel toward the main hospital zimmermann paquette and probably walter macfarlane as well all dead quite possibly because he had gone to the subbasement rendezvous without enough help the distressing thought took his mind off the pain as he pushed on past the security gate paquette had promised answers for kate and now he was dead silently jared cursed himself a gunshot echoed through the tunnel hunching over to diminish himself as a target jared limped on weaving from side to side across the tunnel and wondering if the evasive maneuver was worth the ground he was losing the main tunnel was less than thirty yards away there would be people therehelpif only he could make it another shot rang out louder than the last the bullet fired jared realized now from macfarlanes heavy service revolver snapped through the sleeve of his parka and clattered off the cement floor he stumbled nearly falling and slammed into the far wall of the main tunnel help he screamed somebody help the dim tunnel was deserted a moment later he was shot again the bullet impacting just above his left buttock spinning him a full three hundred and sixty degrees and sending white pain lancing down his leg and up toward his shoulder blade he tumbled to one knee but just as quickly pulled himself up again clutching the notebook to his chest and rolling along the wall of the tunnel somewhere in the distance he could hear another series of alarms then sirens and finally a muffled explosion he was for the moment at least out of the killers line of fire stumbling in the direction away from the main hospital and toward the boiler room and laundry despite the pain in his leg and back he was determined that nothing short of a killing shot was going to bring him down with paquette and zimmermann dead the black notebook whatever it was might well represent kates only chance the gunman crouching low and poised to fire slid around the corner of the omnicenter tunnel just as jared reached the spur to the laundry jared sensed the man about to shoot but there was no explosion no noise or was there as he pushed on into the darkened laundry he could swear he had heard a sound of some sort then he understood the killer had fired macfarlanes revolver was out of bullets tapped dry now even wounded he had a chance the room he had entered was filled with dozens of rolling industrial hampers some empty some piled high with linen beyond the crowded hamper lot jared could just discern the outlines of rows of huge steam pressers he gave momentary consideration to diving into one of the hampers but rejected the notion partly because of the helpless passive situation in which he would be and partly because his pursuer had already turned into the tunnel and was making his way though cautiously toward the laundry ignoring the pain in his back jared dropped to all fours and inched amp his way between two rows of hampers toward the enormous cluttered x hall housing the laundry itself pressers washers dryers shelves and stacks of linens more hampersif he could make it there would be dozens of places to hide if he could make it there were twenty feet separating the last of the canvas hampers from the first of the steam pressers twenty open feet he had to cross them unnoticed kneeling in the darkness he listened there was not a soundnot a breath not the shuffle of a footstep nothing where in hell was the man was the chance of catching a glimpse of him worth the risk of looking the aching in his back was in crescendo dulling his concentration and his judgment again he listened again there was nothing slowly he brought his head up and turned the killer moving with the control and feline calm of a professional was less than five feet away preparing to hammer him with the butt of macfarlanes heavy revolver jared spun away but still absorbed a glancing blow just above his left ear stunned he stumbled backward pulling first one then another hamper between him and the man who paused to pick up the notebook and set it on the corner of a hamper before matteroffactly advancing on him again its no use pal he said shoving the hampers aside as quickly as jared could pull them in his way but go ahead and make it interesting if you want jared needing the hampers as much for support as for protection knew the man was right wounded and without a weapon jared had no chance against him who are you he asked nunes smiled and shrugged just a man doing a job he said you work for redding pharmaceuticals dont you i think this little dance of ours has gone on long enough pal dont you in that instant jared thought about kate and all she had been through he thought about paquette and the aging watchman macfarlane if he was going to die then dammit it wouldnt be while backing away with no more plan in mind than that he grabbed another hamper feigned pulling it in front of him and instead drove it forward as hard as he could catching the surprised gunman just below the waist nunes lurched backward colliding with another hamper and very nearly going down jared moved as quickly as he could but the advantage he had gained with surprise was lost in the breathtaking pain of trying to push off his left foot the killer his expression one of placid amusement parried the lunge with one hand and with the other brought the barrel of the revolver slicing across jareds head opening a gash just above his temple jared staggered backward a step then came on again this time leading with a kick which connected though not powerfully with the mans groin again nunes lashed out with the gun landing a solid blow to jaredss forearm and then another to the back of his neck jared dropped to one knee as he did nunes stepped behind him and locked one arm expertly beneath his chin sorry pal he said tightening his grip jared flailed with his arms and shoulders and tried to stand but the mans leverage was far too good the pressure against his larynx was excruciating his chest throbbed with the futile effort of trying to breathe blood pounded in his head and the killers grunting breaths grew louder in his ear then the sound began to fade jared knew he was dying every ounce of his strength vanished and he felt the warmth of his bladder letting go im sorry kate im sorry the words tumbled over and over in his mind im sorry through closed eyes he sensed more than saw a bright bluewhite light from far far away he heard a muffled explosion then another suddenly the pressure against his neck diminished the killers forearm shook uncontrollably and then slid away jared fell to one side but looked up in time to see the man totter and then in grotesque slow motion topple over into a hamper jared struggled to sort out what was happening the first thing he saw clearly was that the overhead lights had been turned on the second thing was the stubbled slightly jowled face of martin finn i was halfway back to the station when i decided there was no way you would have chanced popping me like you did unless the situation was really desperate finn said how bad are you hurt jared coughed twice and wasnt sure he was able to speak until he heard his own voice ive been shot twice he rasped once just above my butt and once in my thigh my legs are all cut up from broken glass that lunatic beat the shit out of me with his gun the emergency people are on their way finn said kneeling down it may be a few minutes as you might guess theres a lot of commotion going on around here right now is zimmermann dead jared nodded then he remembered macfarlane finn he said urgently theres a man macfarlane a night watchman he was you mean him the detective motioned to his left walter macfarlane one eye swollen shut and the side of his face a mass of dried and oozing blood stood braced against a hamper thank god jared whispered we would never have known what direction to go in without him inn explained at that moment a team of nurses and residents arrived with two stretchers they helped macfarlane onto one and then gingerly hoisted her onto the other as soon as these people get you fixed up counselor youre going to have a little explaining to do you know that dont you i know ill tell you as much as i can and finn i appreciate your coming back i think i might owe you an apology but ill save it until someone explains to me what the fuck has been going on around here okay one of the residents announced were all set wait please jared said finn theres a notebook around here somewhere a black looseleaf notebook the detective searched for a few moments and then brought it over yours he asked actually no jared tucked the notebook beneath his arm then he smiled it belongs to my wife jared brought his left hand up and gingerly touched the area about his left eye saturday december mr samuels i m here to take you up to your room mr samuels jareds eyes opened from a dreamless sleep he was on a litter staring at the chipped flaking ceiling of the emergency ward where a team of surgical residents had worked on his wounds his last clear memory was of one of the doctors a babyfaced woman with rheumy eyes behind hornrimmed glasses announcing that she was about to give him a little something so that his wounds could be explored cleaned and repaired im cary dunleavy one of the nurses from berenson six the mans voice said from somewhere at the head of the litter jared tried to crane his neck toward the nurse but was prevented by a thick felt cervical collar and a broad leather restraining belt across his chest he ached in a dozen different places and he sensed that he was seeing little or nothing through his left eye dunleavy took several seconds to appreciate his patients predicament then he muttered an apology and moved to a spot by jareds right hand welcome to the land of the living he said his voice was kind but his eyes were sunken and tired youve been out for quite a while apparently they overestimated how much analgesia to give you ii its swollen shut the nurse announced you look like youve been kicked by a mule jared felt his senses begin to focus and he struggled to reconstruct the hazy events following the explosion in the omnicenter his first clear image was of william zimmermann spinning wildly about his clothes ablaze the skin on one side of his face hideously scorched that one was for you katey he thought savagely an imsorryfornot believingyou present from your husband what time is it he asked almost four in the morning the nurse nodded according to the report i got from the er nurses youve been out for about three hours since they finished working on you weve been too busy on the floor for anyone to come and get you until now sorry i need to get out of here jared said fumbling at the restraining strap with his left hand his right hand with an intravenous line taped in place was secured to the railing of the litter hey partner the nurse said setting a hand on his shoulder easy does it ive got to see my wife ive suddenly he remembered the notebook my things where are my things weve got em mr samuels theyre put away safe awaiting the moment when we read a legitimate order from your doctor discharging you rounds are usually at seven until then if you go you go in a johnny jared glared at the man im a lawyer he wanted to shout i can sue you and this whole hospital for violating my civil rights and win instead he assessed his situation in just three hours or so his physicians would make rounds and he could explain to them his need to leave three hours almost certainly kate would be sleeping through them anyhow under the effects of her anesthesia he sank back on the litter you win he said the nurse said silent thanks with a skyward look and started maneuvering the litter out of the small examining room just one thing jared said the man stopped short and again walked around to make eye contact ill listen but no promises his tired voice was less goodnatured than he intended i had a notebook a black looseleaf notebook it should be in with my things get me that and i promise to be a model patient cary dunleavy hesitated but then withdrew the notebook from the patients belongings bag which was stashed on the litter beneath jared i m taking you at your word mr samuels model patient im nearing the end of a double thats over sixteen straight hours of nursing on a floor that would fit right in at the franklin zoo its been one hell of a long night and my usual overabundance of the milk of human kindness is just about dried up so dont cross me jared smiled made a feeble peace sign with his bandaged left hand and tucked the notebook between his arm and his side the exhausted nurse returned to the head of the litter and resumed the slow trek through the tunnels to the berenson building the doors to one of the berenson elevators opened as they approached and a patient was wheeled out by two nurses jared saw the two bags of blood draining into two separate ivs and a womans tousled black hair but little else as cary dunleavy stopped and spoke to the nurses what gives dunleavy asked gi bleeding getting worse shes going to the or for gastroscopy the teams already up there waiting good luck let me know how it goes will do the nurse said the stretchers glided past one another sorry for the delay mrs sandler she continued well be there in just a minute or two mrs sandler several seconds passed before the name registered for jared ellen he called out struggling once again against the leather strap dunleavy stopped hey whatre you doing jared forced himself to calm down ellen was on her way to the operating room hemorrhaging the option of waiting for seven oclock rounds no longer existed kate had to see the notebook as quickly as possible even if the odds were one in a million against finding an answer for ellen she had to see it dunleavy ive got to talk to you he said with exaggerated reason please wearily the nurse again walked to where he could be seen dunleavy you care i can see it in your face youre tired and wasted but you still care so that woman who just went past here on the litter is ellen sandler a friend of my wifes and mine dunleavy shes bleedingmaybe bleeding to death theres a chance the answer to her bleeding problem may be in this notebook but its written half in german and half in english and its technical as hell so my wife is kate bennett a pathologist here do you know her dunleavys acknowledging expression suggested that he might actually know too much well she speaks some german and she knows whats been going on with that woman who just passed us ive got to get this to her shes a patient at henderson hospital in essex mr samuels i cant v dunleavy please theres no time to fuck around undo this strap and help me get to a cab i can move all my extremities see ill be fine i dammit man look at me that woman is dying and we might be able to help her get me an againstmedicaladvice paper and ill sign it ill sign whatever the hell you want but please do it now the nurse hesitated that woman needs us my friend jared said right this minute she needs us both dunleavy reached down and undid the restraint its my ass unless you come back and talk to the nursing office probably my ass anyway ill speak to them i promise so will my wife dunleavys eyes narrowed please mr samuels he said dont do me any favors even through the analgesic mist of demerol and the distracting pain in her chest kate bennett could sense the change in her husband bandaged bruised and needing a crutch to navigate he had made a wonderful theatrical entrance into her room sweeping through the doorway past a protesting night supervisor and announcing loudly the fuckers dead katey dead he wont ever hurt you again then he had crossed to the bed kissed her on the lips and firmly but politely dismissed the supervisor and the special duty nurse now he sat on a low chair by her left hand mindless of his own discomfort watching intently as she opened the black notebookthe sole useful vestige of the fire pain and death in the omnicenter there was a strength about the man an assuredness she had never sensed before the fuckers dead katey he wont ever hurt you again the words on the first page landed like hammer blows studies in estronate volume iii of iii kates heart sank jared she said swallowing at the sandpaper in her mouth and painfully adjusting the plastic tube that was draining bloody fluid from her chest have you looked at this just to flip through why too much german well find someone to translate no actually theres not that much honey it says here volume three of three what he shifted forward and read the page damn i never saw any other books there might have been others but there was so much smoke everything was happening so fast paquette could have explained everything if he had made it kate searched her husbands face as he spoke it was not an excuse not an apology but a statement of fact paquette had held the key to a e deadly mystery but paquette was dead and jared battered bruised clearly in great pain was alive if she could unlock the answers it would be because he had risked his life for her well do the best we can with what we have kate said turning to the first page of what appeared to be a series of clinical tests on a substance called estronate im still foggy as hell from the anesthetic and that last shot so bear with me there were all told one hundred and twenty carefully numbered pages paquette or whoever had conducted this research had been meticulous and precise stability studies dosage modification studies administration experiments in milk in water in solid food investigation of side effects kate plodded through thirty years of terse german and english explanations and lengthy lists of test subjects first from the state mental hospital at wickford and in more recent years from the omnicenter thirty years arlen paquette had not sounded that old over the phone but perhaps he had taken over the estronate research from someone else ten minutes passed then twenty jared shifted anxiously in his seat and stared outside at the sterile gray dawn how long does a gastroscopy take he asked kate unwilling to break her fragile concentration glanced over at him momentarily that depends on what they find and on what they choose to do about it jared im close to figuring out some things i need a few more minutes you look pretty washed out stop if you need to im okay here heres some water she took a sip and then moistened her cracked bleeding lips then she returned her attention to the notebook another ten minutes passed before she looked up despite the pain and the drugs her eyes were sparkling jared she said i think i understand i think i know what estronate twofifty is well this is amazing assuming hes the one who conducted this researchor at least completed itthe late dr paquette was worth his weight in gold to redding pharmaceuticals estronate twofifty is an oral antifertility drug that causes irreversible sterilization it can be given to a woman by pill or even secretly in a glass of milk irreversible kate nodded vigorously wincing at the jab of pain from her side exactly think of it no more tubal ligations fewer vasectomies help for thirdworld countries battling overpopulation then the scarred ovaries werent a mistake hardly if im right the microsclerosis was the desired result not a side effect but what about the bleeding what about ellen e i kate motioned him to wait she was scanning a column marked nebenwirkung look jared she said excitedly see this word it means side effects all these women were apparently given this estronate and monitored for side effects jesus theyre crazy paquette zimmermann hornerall of them absolutely insane they used hundreds of people as guinea pigs e sandler jared said what e sandler there it is right at the bottom of the page kate groaned i may be even worse off than i think i am twice over the page and i missed it completely bless you jared ellens name was next to last in a column of perhaps three dozen halfway down a similar list on the following page kate found the names b vitale and g rittenhouse she pointed them out to jared and then continued a careful linebyline check of the rest of the column and yet another page of subjects i thought those were all the bleeding problems you know about he said they are well whose name are you looking for she looked up and for a moment held his eyes with hers mine she said she checked the pages once and then again before she felt certain im not here jared i may be in some notebook marked anthranilic acid but im not here thank god he whispered at least volume threes given us that much kate did not respond she was again immersed in the columns of data turning from one page to another and then back from where he sat jared studied her face the intensity in her eyes the determination that had taken her through twelve years of the most demanding education and training at that moment more so than at any other time in their marriage he felt pride in heras a physician as a person as his jared she said breathlessly her attention still focused on the notebook i think you did it i think its here show me see these two words thrombocytopenie and hypofibrinogenamie well they mean low platelets and low fibrinogen just what ellen is bleeding from theres a notation here referring to omnicenter study four b modification of thrombocytopenie and hypofibrinogenamie using a combination of nicotinic acid and delta amino caproic acid ive heard of nicotinic acid isnt that a vitamin exactlyanother name for niacin the other is a variant of a drug called epsilon amino caproic acid which is used to reverse certain bleeding disorders see look here all together seven women on these n three pages developed problems with their blood they were picked up early on routine blood tests in the omnicenter but ellen and the other two arent listed as having problems with their blood theres nothing written next to their names in the side effects column she nodded excitedly thats the point jared thats the key ellen and the two women who died were never diagnosed maybe they just didnt have omnicenter appointments at the right time the others were treated kate nodded thats what this study four b is all about they got high doses of nicotinic acid and the other drug and all of them apparently recovered their followup blood counts are listed right here i think you did it i think this is the answer i just hope its not too late and that somebody at metro can get hold of the delta form of this medication if not maybe they can try the epsilon jared handed her the receiver of the bedside telephone just tell me what to dial he said kates hand was shaking visibly as she set the receiver down ellens still in the operating room nearly three hours now who was that you were talking to tom engleson hes a resident on the ashburton service in fact hes the one who callednever mind thats not important anyhow hes been up to the operating room several times to check how its going the gastroscopist has found a bleeding ulcer theyve tried a number of different tricks to get it to stop but so far no dice theyve had to call in a surgical team theyre going to operate kate shook her head not if they cant do something with her clotting disorder and toms gone to round up the hematologist on call and the hospital pharmacist im sure they can come up with the nicotinic acid its that delta version of the eaca im not sure of goddamn redding pharmaceuticals im going to nail them jared if its the last thing i do im going to nail them for what theyve done i know a pretty sharp lawyer whos anxious to help he said im afraid even you may not be that sharp honey what do you mean well weve got this notebook and your word that it belongs to paquette but beyond that all we have is me and im afraid my word isnt worth too much right now it will be when they see this maybe either way were going to try i mean somebodys going to have to come up with a logical explanation for all this that doesnt involve redding pharmaceuticals and i really dont think thats possible do you i hope not how long do you think it will take before we hear from this residentwhats his name kate suddenly recalled a gentle snowy evening high above boston harbor and felt herself blush tom tom engleson did her voice break as she said his name i dont know it shouldnt be long it had better not be she thought they waited in silence finally jared adjusted his cervical collar and rubbed at his open eye with the back of his hand kate theres something else something i have to tell you he said it has a good deal to do with what you were saying before about your word not being worth too much she looked at him queerly he held her hand tightly in his kate yesterday morning i spoke to lisa kate sat in the still light of dawn stroking jareds forehead and feeling little joy in the realization that in his eyes at least she had been vindicated nearly fourteen years that he might have shared in some way with his daughter had been stolen fourteen years his hatred of win samuels was almost palpable to her the man was pitifulnot worth hating she had tried her best to make jared see that and to convince him that whatever the circumstances no matter how much time had gone by he had a right to be a father to his daughter he had listened but it was clear to her that his pain and anger were too acute for any rational planning there would be time she had said as much to herself as to him if nothing else there would be time the telephone rang startling jared from a near sleep kate had the receiver in her hand well before the first ring was complete for several minutes she listened nodding understanding and speaking only as needed to encourage the caller to continue jared searched her expression for a clue to ellens status but saw only intense concentration finally she hung up and turned to him that was the hematologist she said theyve started her on the drugs both of them kate nodded reluctantly they wanted more of a biologic rationale than tom was able to give them but in the end her condition had deteriorated so much that they abandoned the mental gymnastics they have her on high doses of both and she shrugged and theyll let us know as soon as theres any change one way or the other shes still in the or shes going to make it jared murmured his head sinking again to the spot beside her hand less than ten minutes later the phone rang again yes kate answered anxiously then jared its for you someone named dunleavy do you know who that is bewildered jared nodded and took the receiver dunleavy its jared samuels mr samuels im glad you made it all right are you in trouble for letting me go nothing i cant handle thats not why im calling jared glanced at his watch sevenfifty dunleavys sixteenhour double shift had ended almost an hour before go on im at the nurses station in the or mr samuels theyve just started operating on mrs sandler i think theyre going to try and oversew her bleeding ulcer jared put his hand over the mouthpiece kate this is the nurse who took care of me at metro theyre operating on ellen he released the mouthpiece thank you cary thank you for staying and calling to tell me that thats only one of the reasons i called there are two others oh i wanted you and dr bennett to know im going to stay on and special mrs sandler after she gets out of surgery but youve been up for please i was a corpsman in nam i know my limitations i feel part of all this and well i just want to stay part of it for a while longer ill sign off if it gets too much for me thank you jared said aware that the words were not adequate but dunleavy had something more to say i i also wanted to apologize for that last crack i made about your wife he went on it was uncalled for especially since i only know what i know second or third hand im sorry apology accepted jared said for what its worth she didnt do any of the things people are saying she did and no matter how long it takes were going to prove it i hope you do cary dunleavy said that was a curious little exchange kate said after jared had replaced the phone on the bedside table at least the half i got to hear jared recounted his conversation with the nurse for her theyve gone ahead with the surgery thats great she said deliberately ignoring the reference to her situation ellens bleeding must have slowed enough to chance it her words trailed off and jared knew that she was thinking about her own situation katey he said listen to me zimmermann is dead and ellen isnt and youre not and im not and as far as im concerned thats cause for celebration and i meant what i said to dunleavy you are innocentof everything and were going to prove it together he leaned over and kissed her gently then he straightened and said rest ill wait with you until we hear from metro kate settled back on the pillow a moment later as if on cue the day supervisor and another nurse strode into the room dr bennett the supervisor said dr jordan is in the hospital shell be furious if she finds out we havent even done morning signs on her prize patient let alone any other nursing care dont mind me jared said nurse away the supervisor eyed him sternly there are vending machines with coffee and danish just down the hall miss austin will come and get you as soon as were through jared looked over at kate who nodded ill send for you if they call she said very well coffee it is he rose and swung his parka over his shoulder with a flourish as he did something fell from one of its pockets and clattered to the floor by the supervisors feet the woman knelt and came up holding a minature tape cassette did that fall from my parka jared asked examining the cassette which had no label absolutely the supervisor said isnt it yours jared looked over at kate the muscles in his face suddenly drawn and tense ive never seen that tape before his mind was picturing smoke and flames and blood and a hand desperately clawing at the pocket of his parka kate weve got to play this tape now he turned to the nurses im sorry go do whatever else you need to do right now weve got to find a machine and play this the supervisor started to protest but was stopped by the look in jareds eyes i have a machine in my office that will hold that if its that important she said again jared saw the hand pulling at him holding him back for christs sake paquette let go of me im trying to get you out of here let go it just might be he said it just might be so norton first that brilliant letter to the newspapers about the ballplayer and now this biopsy thing we asked you for something creative to stop bennett and you certainly delivered the entire tape a conversation between arlen paquette and norton reese lasted less than fifteen minutes still for the battered audience of two in room of henderson hospital it was more than n enough it was my pleasure doctor really the womans been a thorn in my side from the day she first got here shes as impudent as they come a dogooder always on some goddamn crusade or other know what i mean for kate and jared the excitement of reeses disclosures was tempered by an eerie melancholy paquettes conscience had surfaced but too late for him the man whose smooth easy voice was playing the metro administrator like a master angler was deadbeaten burned and then most violently murdered you know what amazes me norton what amazes me is how quickly and completely you were able to eliminate her as a factor we asked you did simple as that it was as if you were on top of her case all the time in a manner of speaking i was actually i was on top of her chief technicianin every sense of the word if ya know what i mean sheila kate hissed the word you know i tried to believe she was the one who had set me up but i just couldnt easy boots if you squeeze my hand any tighter its going to fall off jared a woman lost her breast her breast you must be some lover sir to command that kind of loyalty maybe you can give me a few pointers some time maybe i can arlen actually it wasnt that tough to get sheila to switch biopsy specimens she had a bone of her own to pick with our dear lamented soontobeex pathologist i just sweetened the pot by letting her pick on my bone for a while beforehand norton reeses laughter reverberated through the silent hospital room while kate pantomimed her visceral reaction to the man i wonder jared mused how the lovely ms pierce is going to respond when a prosecutor from the das office plays this for her and asks for a statement i bet shell try to save herself by turning states evidence she can try anything she wants but shes still going to lose her license shell never work in a hospital again well you really stuck it to her norton with that chemist from the state lab in our pocket bennetts fatherinlaw doing what he can to discredit her even more and now this biopsy coup i doubt shell ever be in a position to cause us trouble at the omnicenter again our friend is going to be very impressed and very grateful i would hope you cant even begin to imagine the things in store for you because of what youve done nort good show thats all i can say damn good show we aim to please the tape ran through a few parting formalities before going dead jared snapped off the machine and sat looking at his wife in absolute wonder i would have broken he said pardon if those things had come down on me like they did on you i would have crackedkilled someone maybe killed myself i dont know what but i know i would have gone under it makes me sick just to think of how isolated you were how totally alone thats where youre wrong you see you may have had doubts about me and justifiably so but i never had doubts about you so i wasnt really as alone as you might think never kate took her husbands hand and smiled whats a doubt or two between friends anyway she asked friday august though it was barely eightthirty in the morning the humidity was close to saturation and the temperature was in the mideighties august in dc it might have been central africa silently kate and jared crossed the mall toward the hubert h humphrey building and what was likely to be the final session regarding her petition to the fda for action against redding pharmaceuticals the hearings had been emotional draining for all concerned terry moreland a lawschool classmate whom jared had recruited to represent them had been doing superb work overcoming one setback after another against a phalanx of opposition lawyers and a surprisingly unsympathetic threeman panel one moment their charges against the pharmaceutical giant would seem as irrefutable as they were terrifying and the next the same allegations were made to sound vindictive capricious and unsubstantiated now the end of the hearings was at hand all that remained were brief closing statements by each side a recess and finally a decision yo kate jared stan willoughby mindless of the sultry morning trotted toward them carrying his briefcase and wearing a tweed jacket that was precisely six months out of phase with the season he had attended all the sessions and had testified at some length as to kates character and qualifications so this is going to be it yes he said kissing kate on the cheek and shaking jareds hand warmly over the months that had followed the arrest and resignation of sheila pierce and norton reese the two men willoughby and jared had formed a friendship based on more than superficial mutual respect in fact it had been jared who suggested a year or two of cochairpersons for the department of pathology and who had then cooked the i dinner over which willoughby and kate had come up with a working arrangement for dividing administrative responsibilities we cant think of anything else that could go wrongi mean go onthis morning jared said you were more correct the first time said kate most of this has been pretty brutal first all the threads connecting that animal nunes to redding pharmaceuticals evaporate like morning dew then suddenly carl horner gets admitted to darlington hospital with chest pains and gets a medical dispensation not to testify i dont know i just dont know we still have the notebook and the tape jared said kate laughed sardonically the notebook the tape andyou neglect to adda dozen earnest barristers asking over and over again where the name cyrus redding or redding pharmaceuticals is mentioned even once come come child willoughby chided wheres that bennett spirit weve made points plenty of them trust this old war horse we may not have nailed them but weve sure stuck em with a bunch of tacks i hope youre right she said as they spotted terry moreland waiting for them by the steps to the humphrey building the gray under morelands eyes and the tense set of his face spoke of the difficult week just past and of the ruling that was perhaps only an hour or two away howre your vibes kate asked after they had exchanged greetings and words of encouragement moreland shook his head no way to tell he said emotionally what with your testimony and ellens account of her ordeal i think weve beaten the pants off them unfortunately it doesnt seem as if we have a very emotionally oriented panel when that fat one blew his nose in the middle of the most agonizing part of ellens testimony i swear i almost hauled off and popped him one watching the indifference creep across his face again and again i couldnt help wondering if he hadnt already made up his mind or had it made up for him jared added absolutely moreland said as they pushed into the airconditioned comfort of the office building and headed up to the second floor that sort of thing doesnt happen too often i dont think but it does happen and all you have to do is look across the room to realize what were up against hell they could buy off st francis of assisi with a fraction of what those legal fees alone come to the hearing room modern in decor stark in atmosphere was largely empty due in part to the surprisingly scant media coverage of the proceedings moreland had called the dearth of press a tribute to the power of cyrus redding and the skill of his pr people reddings battery of lawyers was present as were two stenographers and the counsel for the bureau of drugs the seats for the three hearing officers behind individual tables on a raised dais were still empty moreland and stan willoughby led the way into the chamber kate and jared paused by the door through the windows to the north they could see the american flag hanging limply over the senate wing of the capitol i dont know which is scarier kate said the pharmaceutical industry controlling itself or the government doing it for them i doubt cyrus reddings tactics would make it very far in the soviet union i wouldnt bet on that dr bennett startled they turned cyrus redding was less than five feet from them wheeled in his chair by a blond buck who looked like a weightlifter the words were the first they had heard the man say since the hearings had begun i have many friendsand many business interestsin the ussr he continued believe me businessmen are businessmen the world over thats wonderfully reassuring kate said icily perhaps id better submit an article to the russian medical literature on the reversal of the bleeding complications of estronate twofifty i assure you doctor that all i know of such matters you have taught me at these hearings if you have a moment i was wondering if i might speak with you kate looked at jared who gestured that he would meet her inside and then entered the hall redding motioned his young bodyguard to a bench by the far wall i suspect our hearing to end this morning he said perhaps i just want you to know what high regard i have for you you are a most remarkable a most tenacious young woman mr redding i hope you dont expect a thank you i appreciate compliments only from people i respect redding smiled patiently you are still quite young and most certainly naive about certain facts such as such as the fact that it costs an average of sixty million dollars just to get a new drug on the market often quite a bit more not impressed mr redding because of you and your policies people have suffered and died unnecessarily doesnt that weigh on you because of me and my policies dozens of socalled orphan drugs have found their way to those who need them usually without cost because of me and my policies millions have had the quality of their lives improved and countless more their lives saved altogether the greatest good for the most people at the least cost i guess if you didnt believe that youd have a tough time looking at yourself in the mirror maybe you do anyway i mean a persons denial mechanism can carry him only so far reddings eyes flashed but his demeanor remained calm considering the hardship my late employee has put you through i can understand your anger he said however soon this hearing will be over and soon we both must go on with our lives i would like very much to have you visit me in darlington so that we might discuss a mutually beneficial joint endeavor you are a survivor dr bennett a woman who knows better than to subvert her needs in response to petty pressures from others that makes you a winner and it makes me interested in doing business with you mr redding she said incredulously you seem to be ignoring the fact that the reason were here is so that i can put you out of business reddings smile was painfully patronizing heres my card the number on it will always get through to me if you succeed in putting redding pharmaceuticals out of business you dont have to call kate glared at him he was too smug too confident was terry morelands fear about some sort of payoff justified were going to win she said with too little conviction she turned and disregarding the proffered card entered the hearing room what did dr strange love want jared asked as she slid in between him and terry moreland kate shook her head disparagingly the man is absolutely certifiable she said he told me how little understanding i had for the difficulty trials and tribulations of being a multimilliondollar pharmaceutical industry tycoon and then he offered me a job a job a mutually beneficial endeavor i think he called it lord at that moment without ceremony the door to the right of the dais opened and the three hearing officers shuffled into their seats their expressions suggesting that there were any number of places they would rather have been before he sat down the overweight disheveled chairman pulled a wellused handleerchief from his pocket and blew his bulbous nose kate and jared stood by the stairway apart from the groups of lawyers teporterss and others who filled the corridor outside the hearing room iwhe recess was into its second hour and with each passing minute the tension had grown if over the previous four days the redding forces had held the upper hand the brilliant summation and indictment by terry moreland had placed the final verdict very much in doubt of all those in the hallway only cyrus redding seemed totally composed and at ease i have this ugly feeling he knows something we dont kate said gesturing toward the man i dont see how the panel can ignore the points terry made in there boots hes even better now than he was in law school and he was a miniature clarence darrow then but i will admit that strange love over there looks pretty relaxed say that reminds me you never said what your response was to his offer of a job kate smiled i thought you were never going to ask the truth is i told him i would be unsuitable for employment in his firm because the first thing id have to do is take maternity leave jared stared at her slide that past me one more time i was saving the news until after the verdict but what the heck were due in april jared im very excited and very happy honey are you all right you look a little pale this is for real right kate nodded you sure youre okay i can see where going from having no children to having a fourteenyearold daughter and a pregnant wife might be a bit how should i say trying jared held her tightly i keep thinking i should say something witty but all that wants to come out is thanks thank you for this and for helping me reconnect with stacy thanks accepted but i expect something witty from you as soon as the business in this chamber is over and please dont make it sound like ive done something altruistic im as excited about stacys visit as you are jareds daughter would be in boston in just ten days her first trip east it was a journey that would include visits to cape cod and bunker hill to gloucester and the swan boats and the old north church but there would be no visit to win samuels not now and if jared had his way not ever hey you two theyre coming in terry moreland called from the doorway whats the worst thing the panel could do to redding kate asked grateful that jared had chosen not to distract his friend with the news of her pregnancy i guess turning the case over to the justice department for further investigation and prosecution would be the biggest victory for us a hedge might be the referral of the whole matter to administrative channels within the fda in order to gather more information prior to a followup hearing they settled into their seats either way moreland added well know in a minute kate slid the black notebook off the table before them and held it tightly in her lap ladies and gentleman the chairman announced shuffling through a sheaf of papers and then extracting one sheet to read this panel has reached a unanimous decision regarding the charges brought by dr kathryn bennett against redding pharmaceuticals incorporated of darlington kentucky it is our feeling that the late dr arlen paquette did in fact conduct illegal and dangerous human research on the synthetic hormone estronate twofifty and that he may well have also experimented illegally with other unproven substances however all available evidence indicates that the man though in the employ of redding pharmaceuticals was acting on his own and for his own personal gain there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate prior knowledge of dr paquettes criminal activities by mr cyrus redding or any other director of redding pharmaceuticals therefore it is our recommendation that no further action be taken on this matter and that all charges against redding pharmaceuticals be considered dealt with in a fair and just manner thank you all for your cooperation without another word the panel rose and marched from the chamber kate and the three men with her sat in stunned disbelief while across the room lawyers were congratulating one another boisterously i dont believe it she said not a recommendation for further study not a reprimand for hiring someone as unprincipled as arlen paquette nothing she glanced to one side and almost immediately her eyes locked with cyrus reddings the man favored her with another of his patronizing grins and a shrug that said you have to expect such things when you play hardball with the big boys young lady kate glared at him the battle may be over cyrus she was thinking but not the war somewhere out there is a noose so tight that even you wont be able to wriggle freeand im going to find it reese horner sheila pierce somewhere somehow someones going to come forward with proof of what youve done jared took her hand and together they walked from the hearing room im sorry he said softly me too but mostly jared im frightened frightened i dont think theyd dare try and hurt you she laughed sardonically you heard the verdict in there im sure they dont even think im worth bothering to hurt then what its the damn drugs jared starting with estronate think of how many human guinea pigs there are in this one notebook we contacted as many of the women as we could find but there are others we just couldnt locateand im sure other drugs how many women out there are just starting to bruise how many peoplemen and women are developing weird tumors from medications they are trusting to make them well or keep them healthy jared gestured helplessly kate there are injustices all around youve done what you could do its not enough jared these drugs are like time bombsunpredictable le time bombs capable of exploding inside anyone ive got to keep after redding ive got to find some way to turn some heads around here and if not here then publicly somewhere theres got to be a way theres what is it kate what about an ad an ad in the globe the herald all the boston and suburban papersa classified ad asking women to search through their medicine cabinets for omnicenter medications we can analyze maybe thats where the rope is to hang that bastard and put the other companies on notice right in those medicine cabinets if enough redding products were found contaminating enough omnicenter medications even the fda panel wouldnt be able to ignore the companys involvement im going to do it jared as soon as we get back to boston im going to do it and if it doesnt work ill try something else she glanced back down the corridor just as redding was wheeled into the elevator that sound you keep hearing in your ears is my footsteps cyrus she was thinking you had better get used to it the end
