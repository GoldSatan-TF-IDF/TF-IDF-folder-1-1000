consultant jean reeds social worker critic and fabulous sounding board prologue june dawned a nearperfect latespring day as the suns rays touched the eastern shores of the north american continent most of the united states canada and mexico expected clear sunny skies the only meteorological blips were a band of potential thunderstorms that was expected to extend from the plains into the tennessee valley and some showers that were forecasted to move in from the bering strait over the seward peninsula in alaska in almost every way this june twelfth was like every other june twelfth with one curious phenomenon three incidents occurred that were totally unrelated yet were to cause a tragic intersection of the lives of three of the people involved am deadhorse alaska hey dick over here shouted ron halverton he waved frantically to get his former roommates attention he didnt dare leave his jeep in the brief chaos at the tiny airport the morning from anchorage had just landed and the security people were strict about unattended vehicles in the loading area buses and vans were waiting for the tourists and the returning oil company personnel hearing his name and recognizing ron dick waved back and then began threading his way through the milling crowd ron watched dick as he approached ron hadnt seen him since theyd graduated from college the year before but dick appeared just as he always did the picture of normality with his ralph lauren shirt and windbreaker jacket guess jeans and a small knapsack slung over his shoulder yet ron knew the real dick the ambitious aspiring microbiologist who would think nothing of flying all the way from atlanta to alaska with the hope of finding a new microbe here was a guy who loved bacteria and viruses he collected the stuff the way other people collected baseball cards ron smiled and shook his head as he recalled that dick had even had petri dishes of microbes in their shared refrigerator at the university of colorado when ron had met dick during their freshman year it had taken a bit of time to get used to him although he was an indubitably faithful friend dick had some peculiar and unpredictable quirks on the one hand he was a fierce competitor in intramural sports and surely the guy you wanted with you if you mistakenly wandered into the wrong part of town yet on the other hand hed been unable to sacrifice a frog in firstyear biology lab ron found himself chuckling as he remembered another surprising and embarrassing moment involving dick it was during their sophomore year when a whole group had piled into a car for a weekend ski trip dick was driving and accidentally ran over a rabbit his response had been to break down in tears no one had known what to say as a result some people began to talk behind dicks back especially when it became common knowledge that he would pick up cockroaches at the fraternity house and deposit them outside instead of squishing them and flushing them down the toilet as everybody else did as dick came alongside the jeep he tossed his bag into the backseat before grasping rons outstretched hand they greeted each other enthusiastically i cant believe this ron said i mean youre here in the arctic hey i wouldnt have missed this for the world dick said im really psyched how far is the eskimo site from here ron looked nervously over his shoulder he recognized several of the security people turning back to dick he lowered his voice cool it he murmured i told you people are really sensitive about this oh come on dick scoffed you cant be serious im dead serious ron said i could get fired for leaking this to you no fooling around i mean we got to do this hushhush or we dont do it at all youre to tell no one ever you promised all right all right dick said with a short appeasing laugh youre right i promised i just didnt think it was such a big deal its a very big deal ron said firmly he was beginning to think hed made a mistake inviting dick to visit despite how much fun it was to see him youre the boss dick said he gave his friend a jab on the shoulder my lips are sealed forever now chill out and relax he swung himself into the jeep but lets just buzz out there straightaway and check out this discovery you dont want to see where i live first ron asked i have a feeling ill be seeing that more than i care to he said with a laugh i suppose its not a bad time while everybody is preoccupied with the anchorage flight and screwing around with the tourists he reached forward and started the engine they drove out of the airport and headed northeast on the only road it was gravel to talk they had to shout over the sound of the engine its about eight miles to prudhoe bay ron said but well be turning off to the west in another mile or so remember if anybody stops us im just taking you to the new oilfield dick nodded he couldnt believe his friend was so uptight about this thing looking around at the flat marshy monotonous tundra and the overcast gunmetal gray sky he wondered if the place was getting to ron he guessed life was not easy on the alluvial plain of alaskas north slope to lighten the mood he said weathers not bad whats the temperature youre lucky ron said there was some sun earlier so its in the low fifties this is as warm as it gets up here enjoy it while it lasts itll probably flurry later today it usually does the perpetual joke is whether its the last snow of last winter or the first snow of next winter dick smiled and nodded but couldnt help but think that if the people up there considered that funny they were in sad shape a few minutes later ron turned left onto a smaller newer road heading northwest how did you happen to find this abandoned igloo dick asked it wasnt an igloo ron said it was a house made out of peat blocks reinforced with whalebone igloos were only made as temporary shelters like when people went out hunting on the ice the inupiat eskimos lived in peat huts i stand corrected dick said so howd you come across it totally by accident ron said we found it when we were bulldozing for this road we broke through the entrance tunnel is everything still in it dick asked i worried about that flying up here i mean i dont want this to be a wasted trip have no fear ron said nothings been touched that i can assure you maybe there are more dwellings in the general area dick suggested who knows it could be a village ron shrugged maybe so but no one wants to find out if anybody from the state got wind of this theyd stop construction on our feeder pipeline to the new field that would be one huge disaster because we have to have the feeder line functional before winter and winter starts in august around here ron began to slow down as he scanned the side of the road eventually he pulled to a stop abreast of a small cairn putting a hand on dicks arm to keep him in his seat he turned to look back down the road when he was convinced that no one was coming he climbed from the jeep and motioned for dick to do the same reaching back into the jeep he pulled out two old and soiled anoraks and work gloves he handed a set to dick youll need these he explained well be down below the permafrost then he reached back into the jeep for a heavyduty flashlight all right ron added nervously we cant be here long i dont want anybody coming along the road and wondering what the hell is going on dick followed ron as he headed north away from the road a cloud of mosquitoes mystically materialized and attacked them mercilessly looking ahead dick could see a fog bank about a half mile away and guessed it marked the coast of the arctic ocean in all other directions there was no relief from the monotony of the flat windswept featureless tundra that extended to the horizon overhead seabirds circled and cried raucously a dozen steps from the road ron stopped after one last glance for approaching vehicles he bent down and grabbed the edge of a sheet of plywood that had been painted to match the variegated colors of the surrounding tundra he pulled the wood aside to reveal a hole four feet deep in the north wall of the hole was the entrance to a small tunnel it looks as if the hut was buried by ice dick said ron nodded we think that pack ice was blown up from the beach during one of the ferocious winter storms a natural tomb dick said are you sure you want to do this ron asked dont be silly dick said while he donned the parka and pulled on the gloves ive come thousands of miles lets go ron climbed into the hole and then bent down on all fours lowering himself he entered the tunnel dick followed at his heels as dick crawled he could see very little save for the eerie silhouette of ron ahead of him as he moved away from the entrance the darkness closed in around him like a heavy frigid blanket in the failing light he noticed his breath crystallizing he thanked god that he wasnt claustrophobic after about six feet the walls of the tunnel fell away the floor also slanted downward giving them an additional foot of headroom there were about three and a half feet of clearance ron moved to the side and dick crawled up next to him its colder than a witchs tit down here dick said rons flashlight beam played into the corners to illuminate short vertical struts of beluga rib bones the ice snapped those whalebones like they were toothpicks ron said where are the inhabitants dick asked ron directed his flashlight beam ahead to a large triangular piece of ice that had punched through the ceiling of the hut on the other side of that he said he handed the flashlight to dick dick took the flashlight and started crawling forward as much as he didnt want to admit it he was beginning to feel uncomfortable youre sure this place is safe he questioned im not sure of anything ron said just that its been like this for seventyfive years or so it was a tight squeeze around the block of dirty ice in the center when dick was halfway around he shone the light into the space beyond dick caught his breath while a little gasp issued from his mouth although he thought hed been prepared the image within the flashlight beam was more ghoulish than hed expected staring back at him was the pale visage of a frozen bearded caucasian male dressed in furs he was sitting upright his eyes were open and ice blue and they stared back at dick defiantly around his mouth and nose was frozen pink froth you see all three ron called from the darkness dick allowed the light to play around the room the second body was supine with its lower half completely encased in ice the third body was positioned in a manner similar to the first propped up against a wall in a halfsitting position both were eskimos with characteristic features dark hair and dark eyes both also had frozen pink froth around their mouths and noses dick shuddered through a sudden wave of nausea he hadnt expected such a reaction but it passed quickly you see the newspaper ron called not yet dick said as he trained his light on the floor he saw all sorts of debris frozen together including bird feathers and animal bones its near the bearded guy ron called dick shone the light at the frozen caucasians feet he saw the anchorage paper immediately the headlines were about the war in europe even from where he was he could see the date april dick wriggled back into the antechamber his initial horror had passed now he was excited i think you were right he said it looks like all three died of pneumonia and the date is right on i knew youd find it interesting ron said its more than interesting dick said it could be the chance of a lifetime im going to need a saw the blood drained from rons face a saw he repeated with dismay youve got to be joking you think id pass up this chance dick questioned not on your life i need some lung tissue jesus h christ ron murmured youd better promise again not to say anything about this ever i promised already dick said with exasperation if i find what i think im going to find it will be for my own collection dont worry nobodys going to know ron shook his head sometimes i think youre one weird dude lets get the saw dick said he handed the flashlight to ron and started for the entrance pm ohare airport chicago marilyn stapleton looked at her husband of twelve years and felt torn she knew that the convulsive changes that had racked their family had impacted most on john yet she still had to think about the children she glanced at the two girls who were sitting in the departure lounge and nervously looking in her direction sensing that their life as they knew it was in the balance john wanted them to move to chicago where he was starting a new residency in pathology marilyn redirected her gaze to her husbands pleading face hed changed over the last several years the confident reserved man she had married was now bitter and insecure he had shed twentyfive pounds and his once ruddy full cheeks had hollowed giving him a lean haggard look consistent with his new personality marilyn shook her head it was hard to recall that just two years previously they had been the picture of the successful suburban family with his flourishing ophthalmology practice and her tenured position in english literature at the university of illinois but then the huge healthcare conglomerate americare had appeared on the horizon sweeping through champaign illinois as well as numerous other towns gobbling up practices and hospitals with bewildering speed john had tried to hold out but ultimately lost his patient base it was either surrender or flee and john chose to flee at first hed looked for another ophthalmology position but when it became clear there were too many ophthalmologists and that hed be forced to work for americare or a similar organization hed made the decision to retrain in another medical specialty i think you would enjoy living in chicago john said pleadingly and i miss you all terribly marilyn sighed we miss you too she said but thats not the point if i give up my job the girls would have to go to an innercity public school theres no way we could afford private school with your residents salary the publicaddress system crackled to life and announced that all passengers holding tickets for champaign had to be on board it was last call weve got to go marilyn said well miss the flight john nodded and brushed away a tear i know he said but you will think about it of course ill think about it marilyn snapped then she caught herself she sighed again she didnt mean to sound angry its all im thinking about she added softly marilyn lifted her arms and embraced her husband he hugged her back with ferocity careful she wheezed youll snap one of my ribs i love you john said in a muffled voice hed buried his face in the crook of her neck after echoing his sentiments marilyn broke away and gathered lydia and tamara she gave the boarding passes to the ticket agent and herded the girls down the ramp as she walked she glanced at john through the glass partition as they turned into the jetway she gave a wave it was to be her last are we going to have to move lydia whined she was ten and in the fifth grade im not moving tamara said she was eleven and strongwilled ill move in with connie she said i could stay with her and im sure she discussed that with her mother marilyn said sarcastically she was fighting back tears she didnt want the girls to see marilyn allowed her daughters to precede her onto the small prop plane she directed the girls to their assigned seats and then had to settle an argument about who was going to sit alone the seating was two by two marilyn answered her daughters impassioned entreaties about what the near future would bring with vague generalities in truth she didnt know what was best for the family the planes engines started with a roar that made further conversation difficult as the plane left the terminal and taxied out toward the runway she put her nose to the window she wondered how she would have the strength to make a decision a bolt of lightning to the southwest jolted marilyn from her musing it was an uncomfortable reminder of her disdain for commuter flights she did not have the same confidence in small planes as she did in regular jets unconsciously she cinched her seat belt tighter and again checked her daughters during the takeoff marilyn gripped the armrests with a force that suggested she thought her effort helped the plane get aloft it wasnt until the ground had significantly receded that she realized shed been holding her breath how long is daddy going to live in chicago lydia called across the aisle five years marilyn answered until he finishes his training i told you lydia yelled to tamara well be old by then a sudden bump made marilyn reestablish her death grip on her armrests she glanced around the cabin the fact that no one was panicking gave her some solace looking out the window she saw that they were entirely enveloped in clouds a flash of lightning eerily lit up the sky as they flew south the turbulence increased as did the frequency of the lightning a terse announcement by the pilot that they would try to find smoother air at a different altitude did little to assuage marilyns rising fears she wanted the flight to be over the first sign of real disaster was a strange light that filled the plane followed instantly by a tremendous bump and vibration several of the passengers let out halfsuppressed screams that made marilyns blood run cold instinctively she reached over and pulled tamara closer to her the vibration increased in intensity as the plane began an agonizing roll to the right at the same time the sound of the engines changed from a roar to an earsplitting whine sensing that she was being pressed into her seat and feeling disoriented in space marilyn looked out the window at first she didnt see anything but clouds but then she looked ahead and her heart leaped into her throat the earth was rushing up at them at breakneck speed they were flying straight down pm manhattan general hospital new york city terese hagen tried to swallow but it was difficult her mouth was bone dry a few minutes later her eyes blinked open and for a moment she was disoriented when she realized she was in a surgical recovery room it all came back to her in a flash the problem had started without warning that evening just before she and matthew were about to go out to dinner there had been no pain the first thing she was aware of was wetness particularly on the inside of her thigh going into the bathroom she was dismayed to find that she was bleeding and it wasnt just spotting it was active hemorrhaging since she was five months pregnant she was afraid it spelled trouble events had unfolded rapidly from that point shed been able to reach her physician dr carol glanz who offered to meet her at the manhattan generals emergency room once there tereses suspicions had been confirmed and surgery scheduled the doctor had said that it appeared as if the embryo had implanted in one of her tubes instead of the uterusan ectopic pregnancy within minutes of her regaining consciousness one of the recoveryroom nurses was at her side reassuring her that everything was fine what about my baby terese asked she could feel a bulky dressing over her disturbingly flat abdomen your doctor knows more about that than i do the nurse said ill let her know you are awake i know she wants to talk with you before the nurse left terese complained about her dry throat the nurse gave her some ice chips and the cool fluid was a godsend terese closed her eyes she guessed that she dozed off because the next thing she knew was that dr carol glanz was calling her name how do you feel dr glanz asked terese assured her she was fine thanks to the ice chips she then asked about her baby dr glanz took a deep breath and reached out and put her hand on tereses shoulder im afraid i have double bad news she said terese could feel herself tense it was ectopic dr glanz said falling back on doctor jargon to make a difficult job a bit easier we had to terminate the pregnancy and of course the child was not viable terese nodded ostensibly without emotion she had expected as much and had tried to prepare herself what she wasnt prepared for was what dr glanz said next unfortunately the operation wasnt easy there were some complications which was why you were bleeding so profusely when you came into the emergency room we had to sacrifice your uterus we had to do a hysterectomy at first tereses brain was unable to comprehend what shed been told she nodded and looked expectantly at the doctor as if she anticipated more information im sure this is very upsetting for you dr glanz said i want you to understand that everything was done that could have been done to avoid this unfortunate outcome sudden comprehension of what shed been told jolted terese her silent voice broke free from its bounds and she cried no dr glanz squeezed her shoulder in sympathy since this was to be your first child i know what this means to you she said im terribly sorry terese groaned it was such crushing news that for the moment she was beyond tears she was numb all her life she had assumed she would have children it had been part of her identity the idea that it was impossible was too difficult to grasp what about my husband terese managed has he been told he has dr glanz said i spoke to him as soon as id finished the case hes downstairs in your room where im sure youll be going momentarily there was more conversation with dr glanz but terese remembered little of it the combined realization that shed lost her child and would never be able to have another was devastating a quarter hour later an orderly arrived to wheel her to her room the trip went quickly she was oblivious to her surroundings her mind was in turmoil she needed reassurance and support when she reached her room matthew was on his cellular phone as a stockbroker it was his constant companion the floor nurses expertly transferred terese to her bed and hung her iv on a pole behind her head after making sure all was in order and encouraging her to call if she needed anything they left terese looked over at matthew who had averted his gaze as he finished his call she was concerned about his reaction to this catastrophe they had been married for only three months with a definitive click matthew flipped his phone closed and slipped it into his jacket pocket he turned to terese and stared at her for a moment his tie was loosened and his shirt collar unbuttoned she tried to read his expression but couldnt he was chewing the inside of his cheek how are you he asked finally with little emotion as well as can be expected terese managed she desperately wanted him to come to her and hold her but he kept his distance this is a curious state of affairs he said im not sure i know what you mean terese said simply that the main reason we got married has just evaporated matthew said id say your planning has gone awry tereses mouth slowly dropped open stunned she had to struggle to find her voice i dont like your implication she said i didnt get pregnant on purpose well you have your reality and i have mine matthew said the problem is what are we going to do about it terese closed her eyes she couldnt respond it had been as if matthew had plunged a knife into her heart she knew from that moment that she didnt love him in fact she hated him wednesday am march new york city excuse me jack stapleton said with false civility to the darkly complected pakistani cabdriver would you care to step out of your car so we can discuss this matter fully jack was referring to the fact that the cabdriver had cut him off at the intersection of fortysixth street and second avenue in retaliation jack had kicked the cabs driverside door when they had both stopped at a red light at fortyfourth street jack was on his cannondale mountain bike that he used to commute to work this mornings confrontation was not unusual jacks daily route included a hairraising slalom down second avenue from fiftyninth street to thirtieth street at breakneck speed there were frequent close calls with trucks and taxicabs and the inevitable arguments anyone else would have found the trip nerveracking jack loved it as he explained to his colleagues it got his blood circulating choosing to ignore jack until the light turned green the pakistani cabdriver then cursed him soundly before speeding off and to you too jack yelled back he accelerated standing up until he reached a speed equal to the traffic then he settled onto the seat while his legs pumped furiously eventually he caught up with the offending cabdriver but jack ignored him in fact he whisked past him squeezing between the taxi and a delivery van at thirtieth street jack turned east crossed first avenue and abruptly turned into the loading bay of the office of the chief medical examiner for the city of new york jack had been working there for five months having been offered a position as an associate medical examiner after finishing his pathology residency and a years fellowship in forensics jack wheeled his bike past the security office and waved at the uniformed guard turning left he passed the mortuary office and entered the morgue itself turning left again he passed a bank of the refrigerated compartments used to store bodies prior to autopsy in a corner where simple pine coffins were stored for unclaimed bodies heading for hart island jack parked his bike and secured it with several kryptonite locks the elevator took jack up to the first floor it was well before eight in the morning and few of the daytime employees had arrived even sergeant murphy wasnt in the office assigned to the police passing through the communications room jack entered the id area he said hello to vinnie amendola who returned the greeting without looking up from his newspaper vinnie was one of the mortuary techs who worked with jack frequently jack also said hello to laurie montgomery one of the boardcertified forensic pathologists it was her turn in the rotation to be in charge of assigning the cases that had come in during the night shed been at the office of the chief medical examiner for four and a half years like jack she was usually one of the first to arrive in the morning i see you made it into the office once again without having to come in feet first laurie said teasingly she was referring to jacks dangerous bike ride coming in feet first was office vernacular for arriving dead only one brush with a taxi jack said im accustomed to three or four it was like a ride in the country this morning im sure laurie said without belief personally i think you are foolhardy to ride your bike in this city ive autopsied several of those daredevil bicycle messengers every time i see one in traffic i wonder when ill be seeing him in the pit the pit was office vernacular for the autopsy room jack helped himself to coffee then wandered over to the desk where laurie was working anything particularly interesting jack asked looking over her shoulder the usual gunshot wounds laurie said also a drug overdose ugh jack said you dont like overdoses nah jack said theyre all the same i like surprises and a challenge i had a few overdoses that fit into that category during my first year laurie said how so its a long story laurie said evasively then she pointed to one of the names on her list heres a case you might find interesting donald nodelman the diagnosis is unknown infectious disease that would certainly be better than an overdose jack said not in my book laurie said but its yours if you want it personally i dont care for infectious disease cases never have and never will when i did the external exam earlier it gave me the creeps whatever it was it was an aggressive bug hes got extensive subcutaneous bleeding unknowns can be a challenge jack said he picked up the folder ill be glad to do the case did he die at home or in an institution he was in a hospital laurie said he was brought in from the manhattan general but infectious disease wasnt his admitting diagnosis hed been admitted for diabetes its my recollection that the manhattan general is an americare hospital jack said is that true i think so laurie said why do you ask because it might make this case personally rewarding jack said maybe ill be lucky enough for the diagnosis to be something like legionnaires disease i couldnt think of anything more enjoyable than giving americare heartburn id love to see that corporation squirm whys that laurie asked its a long story jack said with an impish smile one of these days we should have a drink and you can tell me about your overdoses and ill tell you about me and americare laurie didnt know if jacks invitation was sincere or not she didnt know much about jack stapleton beyond his work at the medical examiners office her understanding was that no one else did either jack was a superb forensic pathologist despite the fact that hed only recently finished his training but he didnt socialize much and he was never very personally revealing in his small talk all laurie knew was that he was fortyone unmarried entertainingly flippant and came from the midwest ill let you know what i find jack said as he headed toward the communications room jack excuse me laurie called out jack stopped and turned around would you mind if i gave you a bit of advice she said hesitantly she was speaking impulsively it wasnt like her but she appreciated jack and hoped that he would be working there for some time jacks impish smile returned he stepped back to the desk by all means he said im probably speaking out of turn laurie said quite the contrary jack said i honor your opinion whats on your mind just that you and calvin washington have been at odds laurie said i know its just a clash of personalities but calvin has had a longstanding relationship with the manhattan general as americare does with the mayors office i think you should be careful being careful hasnt been one of my strong points for five years jack said i have utmost respect for the deputy chief our only disagreement is that he believes rules to be carved in stone while i see them as guidelines as for americare i dont care for their goals or methods well its not my business laurie said but calvin keeps saying he doesnt see you as a team player hes got a point there jack said the problem is that ive developed an aversion to mediocrity im honored to work with most people around here especially you however there are a few whom i cant deal with and i dont hide it its as simple as that ill take that as a compliment laurie said it was meant as one jack said well let me know what you find on nodelman laurie said then ill have at least one more case for you to do my pleasure jack said he turned and headed for the communications room as he walked past vinnie he snatched away his paper come on vinnie jack said were going to get a jump on the day vinnie complained but followed while trying to retrieve his paper he collided with jack who had abruptly stopped outside of janice jaegers office janice was one of the forensic investigators frequently referred to as pas or physicians assistants her tour of duty was the graveyard shift from eleven to seven jack was surprised to find her still in her office a petite woman with dark hair and dark eyes she was obviously tired what are you still doing here jack asked ive got one more report to finish jack held up the folder in his hand did you or curt handle nodelman i did janice said is there a problem not that i know about yet jack said with a chuckle he knew janice to be extremely conscientious which made her ideal for teasing was it your impression the cause of death was a nosocomial infection what the hell is a nosocomial infection vinnie asked its an infection acquired in a hospital jack explained it certainly seems so janice said the man had been in the hospital five days for his diabetes before developing symptoms of an infectious disease once he got them he died within thirtysix hours jack whistled in respect whatever the bug was it certainly was virulent thats what worried the doctors i spoke with janice said any laboratory results from microbiology jack questioned nothing has grown out janice said blood cultures were negative as of four oclock this morning the terminal event was acute respiratory distress syndrome or ards but sputum cultures have been negative as well the only positive thing was the gram stain of the sputum that showed gramnegative bacilli that made people think of pseudomonas but it hasnt been confirmed any question of the patient being immunologically compromised jack asked did he have aids or had he been treated with antimetabolites not that i could ascertain janice said the only problem he had listed was diabetes and some of the usual sequelae anyway its all in the investigative report if youd care to read it hey why read when i can get it from the horses mouth jack said with a laugh he thanked janice and headed for the elevator i hope you are planning to wear your moon suit vinnie said the moon suit the completely enclosed impervious outfit complete with a clear plastic face mask was designed for maximum protection air was forced into the suit by a fan worn at the small of the back pulling air through a filter before circulating it within the headpiece that provided enough ventilation to breathe but guaranteed saunalike temperatures inside jack detested the setup as far as jack was concerned the moon suit was bulky restrictive uncomfortable hot and unnecessary hed not worn one throughout his training the problem was that the new york chief dr harold bingham had decreed that the suits be used calvin the deputy chief was intent on enforcing it jack had endured several confrontations as a result this might be the first time the suit is indicated jack said to vinnies relief until we know what we are dealing with we have to take all precautions after all it could be something like ebola virus vinnie stopped in his tracks you really think its possible he asked his eyes opened wide not a chance jack said he slapped him on the back just kidding thank god vinnie said they started walking again but maybe plague jack added vinnie stopped again that would be just as bad he said jack shrugged his shoulders all in a days work he said come on lets get it over with they changed into scrubs and then while vinnie put on his moon suit and went into the autopsy room jack went through the contents of nodelmans folder it had a case work sheet a partially completed death certificate an inventory of medicallegal case records two sheets for autopsy notes a telephone notice of death as received that night by communications a completed identification sheet janices investigative report a sheet for the autopsy report and a lab slip for hiv antibody analysis despite having spoken with janice jack read her report carefully as he always did when he was finished he went into the room next to the pine coffins and put on his moon suit he took his ventilation unit from where it had been charging and hooked himself up then he set out for the autopsy room on the other side of the morgue jack cursed the suit as he walked past most of the refrigerated compartments for bodies being encased in the contraption put him in a bad mood and he eyed his surroundings with a jaundiced eye the morgue had been state of the art at one time but it was now in need of repair and upgrading with its aged blue tile walls and stained cement floor it looked like a set for an old horror movie there was an entrance to the autopsy room directly from the hallway but that wasnt used any longer except to bring bodies in and out instead jack entered through a small anteroom with a washbasin by the time jack entered the autopsy room vinnie had nodelmans body on one of the eight tables and had assembled all the necessary equipment and paraphernalia necessary to do the case jack positioned himself on the patients right vinnie on the left he doesnt look so good jack said i dont think hes going to make it to the prom it was hard to talk in the moon suit and he was already perspiring vinnie who never quite knew how to react to jacks irreverent comments didnt respond even though the corpse did look terrible this is gangrene on his fingers jack said he lifted one of the hands and examined the almostblack fingertips closely then he pointed to the mans shriveled genitals thats gangrene on the end of his penis ouch that must have hurt can you imagine vinnie held his tongue jack carefully examined every inch of the mans exterior for vinnies benefit he pointed out the extensive subcutaneous hemorrhages on the mans abdomen and legs he told him it was called purpura then jack mentioned there were no obvious insect bites thats important he added a lot of serious diseases are transmitted by arthropods arthropods vinnie questioned he never knew when jack was joking insects jack said crustaceans arent much of a problem as disease vectors vinnie nodded appreciatively although he didnt know any more than he had when hed asked his question he made a mental note to try to remember to look up the meaning of arthropods when he had an opportunity what are the chances whatever killed this man is contagious vinnie asked excellent im afraid jack said excellent the door to the hallway opened and sal dambrosio another mortuary tech wheeled in another body totally absorbed in the external exam of mr nodelman jack did not look up he was already beginning to form a differential diagnosis a half hour later six of the eight tables were occupied by corpses awaiting autopsies one by one the other medical examiners on duty that day began to arrive laurie was the first and she came over to jacks table any ideas yet she asked lots of ideas but nothing definitive jack said but i can assure you this is one virulent organism i was teasing vinnie earlier about its being ebola theres a lot of disseminated intravascular coagulation my god laurie exclaimed are you serious no not really jack said but from what ive seen so far its still possible just not probable of course ive never seen a case of ebola so that should tell you something do you think we ought to isolate this case laurie asked nervously i cant see any reason to jack said besides ive already started and ill be careful to avoid throwing any of the organs around the room but ill tell you what we should do alert the lab to be mighty careful with the specimens until we have a diagnosis maybe id better ask binghams opinion laurie said oh that would be helpful jack said sarcastically then well have the blind leading the blind dont be disrespectful laurie said he is the chief i dont care if hes the pope jack said i think i should just get it done the sooner the better if bingham or even calvin gets involved it will drag on all morning all right laurie said maybe youre right but let me see any abnormality ill be on table three laurie left to do her own case jack took a scalpel from vinnie and was about to make the incision when he noticed that vinnie had moved away where are you going to watch this from queens jack asked youre supposed to be helping im a little nervous vinnie admitted oh come on man jack said youve been at more autopsies than i have get your italian ass over here weve got work to do jack worked quickly but smoothly he handled the internal organs gently and was meticulously careful about the use of instruments when either his or vinnies hands were in the field whatcha got chet mcgovern asked looking over jacks shoulder chet was also an associate medical examiner having been hired in the same month as jack of all the colleagues hed become the closest to jack since they shared both a common office and the social circumstance of being single males but chet had never been married and at thirtysix he was five years jacks junior something interesting jack said the mystery disease of the week and its a humdinger this poor bastard didnt have a chance any ideas chet asked his trained eye took in the gangrene and the hemorrhages under the skin i got a lot of ideas jack said but let me show you the internal id appreciate your opinion is there something i should see laurie called from table three shed noticed jack conversing with chet yeah come on over jack said no use going through this more than once laurie sent sal to the sink to wash out the intestines on her case then stepped over to table one the first thing i want you to look at is the lymphatics i dissected in the throat jack said he had retracted the skin of the neck from the chin to the collarbone no wonder autopsies take so long around here a voice boomed in the confined space all eyes turned toward dr calvin washington the deputy chief he was an intimidating sixfootseven twohundredandfiftypound africanamerican man whod passed up a chance to play nfl football to go to medical school what the hell is going on around here he demanded half in jest what do you people think this is a holiday just pooling resources laurie said weve got an unknown infectious case that appears to be quite an aggressive microbe so i heard calvin said i already got a call from the administrator over at the manhattan general hes justly concerned whats the verdict a bit too soon to tell jack said but weve got a lot of pathology here jack quickly summarized for calvin what was known of the history and pointed out the positive findings on the external exam then he started back on the internal indicating the spread of the disease along the lymphatics of the neck some of these nodes are necrotic calvin said exactly jack said in fact most of them are necrotic the disease was spreading rapidly through the lymphatics presumably from the throat and bronchial tree airborne then calvin said it would be my first guess jack admitted now look at the internal organs jack presented the lungs and opened the areas where hed made slices as you can see this is pretty extensive lobar pneumonia jack said theres a lot of consolidation but there is also some necrosis and i believe early cavitation if the patient had lived longer i think we would be seeing some abscess formation calvin whistled wow he said all this was happening in the face of massive iv antibiotics its worrisome jack agreed he carefully slid the lungs back into the pan he didnt want them sloshing around potentially throwing infective particles into the air next he picked up the liver and gently separated its cut surface same process he announced pointing with his fingers to areas of early abscess formation just not as extensive as with the lungs jack put the liver down and picked up the spleen there were similar lesions throughout the organ he made sure everyone saw them so much for the gross jack said as he carefully replaced the spleen in the pan well have to see what the microscopic shows but i actually think well be relying on the lab to give us the definitive answer whats your guess at this point calvin asked jack let out a short laugh a guess it would have to be he said i havent seen anything pathognomonic yet but its fulminant character should tell us something whats your differential diagnosis calvin asked come on wonderboy lets hear it ummmm jack said youre kinda putting me on the spot but okay ill tell you whats been going through my head first i dont think it could be pseudomonas as suspected at the hospital its too aggressive it could have been something atypical like strep group a or even staph with toxic shock but i kinda doubt it especially with the gram stain suggesting it was a bacillus so id have to say it is something like tularemia or plague whoa calvin exclaimed youre coming up with some pretty arcane illnesses for what was apparently a hospitalbased infection havent you heard the phrase about when you hear hoofbeats you should think of horses not zebras im just telling you whats going through my mind its just a differential diagnosis im trying to keep an open mind all right calvin said soothingly is that it no thats not it jack said id also consider that the gram stain could have been wrong and that would let in not only strep and staph but meningococcemia as well and i might as well throw in rocky mountain spotted fever and hantavirus hell i could even throw in the viral hemorrhagic fevers like ebola now youre getting out in the stratosphere calvin said lets come back to reality if i made you guess which one it is right now with what you know what would you say jack clucked his tongue he had the irritated feeling he was being put back in medical school and that calvin like many of his medicalschool professors was trying to make him look bad plague jack said to a stunned audience plague calvin questioned with surprise bordering on disdain in march in new york city in a hospitalized patient you got to be out of your mind hey you asked me for one diagnosis jack said so i gave it to you i wasnt responding by probabilities just pathology you werent considering the other epidemiological aspects calvin asked with obvious condescension he laughed then talking more to the others than jack he said what the hell did they teach you out there in the chicago boonies there are too many unknowns in this case for me to put a lot of weight on unsubstantiated information jack said i didnt visit the site i dont know anything about the deceaseds pets travel or contact with visitors there are a lot of people coming and going in this city even in and out of a hospital and there are certainly more than enough rats around here to support the diagnosis for a moment a heavy silence hung over the autopsy room neither laurie nor chet knew what to say jacks tone made them both uncomfortable especially knowing calvins stormy temperament a clever comment calvin said finally youre quite good at double entendre i have to give you credit there perhaps thats part of pathology training in the midwest both laurie and chet laughed nervously all right smartass calvin continued how much are you willing to put on your diagnosis of plague i didnt know it was customary to gamble around here jack said no its not common to gamble but when you come up with a diagnosis of plague i think its worthwhile to make a point of it how about ten dollars i can afford ten dollars jack said fine calvin said with that settled wheres paul plodgett and that gunshot wound from the world trade center hes down on table six laurie said calvin lumbered away and for a moment the others watched him laurie broke the silence why do you try to provoke him she asked jack i dont understand youre making it more difficult for yourself i cant help it jack said he provoked me yeah but hes the deputy chief and its his prerogative chet said besides you were pushing things with a diagnosis of plague it certainly wouldnt be on the top of my list are you sure jack asked look at the black fingers and toes on this patient remember it was called the black death back in the fourteenth century a lot of diseases can cause such thrombotic phenomena chet said true jack said thats why i almost said tularemia and why didnt you laurie asked in her mind tularemia was equally improbable i thought plague sounded better jack said its more dramatic i never know when you are serious laurie said hey i feel the same way jack said laurie shook her head in frustration at times it was hard to have a serious discussion with jack anyway she said are you finished with nodelman if you are ive got another case for you i havent done the brain yet jack said then get to it laurie said she walked back to table three to finish her own case wednesday am march new york city terese hagen stopped abruptly and looked at the closed door to the cabin the name given to the main conference room it was called the cabin because the interior was a reproduction of taylor heaths squam lake house up in the wilds of new hampshire taylor heath was the ceo of the hot upandcoming advertising firm willow and heath which was threatening to break into the rarefied ranks of the advertising big leagues after making sure she was not observed terese leaned toward the door and put her ear against it she heard voices with her pulse quickening terese hurried down the hall to her own office it never took long for her anxiety to soar shed only been in the office five minutes and already her heart was pounding she didnt like the idea of a meeting she didnt know about being held in the cabin the ceos habitual domain in her position as the creative director of the firm she felt she had to know everything that was going on the problem was that a lot was going on taylor heath had shocked everybody with his previous months announcement that he planned to retire as ceo and was designating brian wilson the current president to succeed him that left a big question mark about who would succeed wilson terese was in the running that was for sure but so was robert barker the firms executive director of accounts and on top of that there was always the worry that taylor would pick someone from outside terese pulled off her coat and stuffed it into the closet her secretary marsha devons was on the phone so terese dashed to her desk and scanned the surface for any telltale message but there was nothing except a pile of unrelated phone messages theres a meeting in the cabin marsha called from the other room after hanging up the phone she appeared in the doorway she was a petite woman with ravenblack hair terese appreciated her because she was intelligent efficient and intuitiveall the qualities lacking in the years previous four secretaries terese was tough on her assistants since she expected commitment and performance equivalent to her own why didnt you call me at home terese demanded i did but youd already left marsha said whos at the meeting terese barked it was mr heaths secretary who called marsha said she didnt say who would be attending just that your presence was requested was there any indication what the meeting is about terese asked no marsha said simply when did it start the call came through at nine marsha said terese snatched up her phone and punched in colleen andersons number colleen was tereses most trusted art director she was currently heading up a team for the national health care account you know anything about this meeting in the cabin terese asked as soon as colleen was on the line colleen didnt only that it was going on damn terese said as she hung up is there a problem marsha asked solicitously if robert barker has been in there all this time with taylor theres a problem terese said that prick never misses a beat to put me down terese snatched the phone again and redialed colleen whats the status on national health do we have any comps or anything i can show right now im afraid not colleen said weve been brainstorming but we dont have anything zippy like i know you want im looking for a home run well goose your team terese said i have a sneaking suspicion im most vulnerable with national health no ones been sleeping down here colleen said i can assure you of that terese hung up without saying goodbye snatching up her purse she ran down the hall to the ladies room and positioned herself in front of the mirror she pushed her medusas head of highlighted tight curls into a semblance of order then reapplied some lipstick and a bit of blush stepping back she surveyed herself luckily shed chosen to wear one of her favorite suits it was dark blue wool gabardine and seriously severe hugging her narrow frame like a second skin satisfied with her appearance terese hustled to the cabin door after a deep breath she grasped the knob turned it and entered ah miss hagen brian wilson said glancing at his watch he was sitting at the head of a roughhewn plank table that dominated the room i see youre now indulging in bankers hours brian was a short man with thinning hair he vainly tried to camouflage his bald spot by combing his side hair over it as per usual he was attired in a white shirt and tie loosened at the neck giving him the appearance of a harried newspaper publisher to complete the journalistic look his sleeves were rolled up above his elbows and a yellow dixon pencil was tucked behind his right ear despite the catty comment terese liked and respected brian he was an able administrator he had a patented derogatory style but he was equally demanding of himself i was in the office last night until one am terese said i certainly would have been here for this meeting if someone had been kind enough to have let me know about it it was an impromptu meeting taylor called out he was standing near the window in keeping with his laissezfaire management style he preferred to hover above the group like an olympian god watching his demigods and mere mortals hammer out decisions taylor and brian were opposite in most ways where brian was short taylor was tall where brian was balding taylor had a dense halo of silvergray hair where brian appeared as the harried newspaper columnist always with his back against the wall taylor was the picture of sophisticated tranquillity and sartorial splendor yet no one doubted taylors encyclopedic grasp of the business and his uncanny ability to maintain strategic goals in the face of daily tactical disaster and controversy terese took a seat at the table directly across from her nemesis robert barker he was a tall thinfaced man with narrow lips who seemed to take a cue from taylor in regard to his dress he was always attired nattily in dark silk suits and colorful silk ties the ties were his trademark terese could not remember ever having seen the same tie twice next to robert was helen robinson whose presence made tereses racing heart beat even a little faster helen worked under robert as the account executive assigned specifically to national health she was a strikingly attractive twentyfiveyearold woman with long chestnutcolored hair that cascaded to her shoulders tanned skin even in march and full sensuous features between her intelligence and looks she was a formidable adversary also sitting at the table was phil atkins the chief financial officer and carlene desalvo the corporate director of account planning phil was an impeccably precise man with his perennial threepiece suit and wirerimmed glasses carlene was a bright fullfigured woman who always dressed in white terese was mildly surprised to see both of them at the meeting weve got a big problem with the national health account brian said thats why this meeting was called tereses mouth went dry she glanced at robert and detected a slight but infuriating smile terese wished to god shed been there since the beginning of the meeting so she could have known everything that had been said terese was aware of trouble with national health the company had called for an internal review a month ago which meant that willow and heath had to come up with a new advertising campaign if they expected to keep the account and everybody knew they had to keep the account it had mushroomed to somewhere around forty million annually and was still growing healthcare advertising was in the ascendancy and would hopefully fill the hole vacated by cigarettes brian turned to robert perhaps you could fill terese in on the latest developments he said i defer to my able assistant helen robert said giving terese one of his condescending smiles helen moved forward in her seat as you know national health has had misgivings about its advertising campaign unfortunately their displeasure has increased just yesterday their figures came in for the last open subscriber period the results werent good their loss of market share to americare in the new york metropolitan area has increased after building the new hospital this is a terrible blow and they blame our ad campaign for that terese blurted out thats absurd they only made a twentyfivepoint buy with our sixtysecond commercial that was not adequate no way that may be your opinion helen said evenly but i know it is not national healths i know you are fond of your health care for the modern era campaign and it is a good tag line robert said but the fact of the matter is that national health has been losing market share from the campaigns inception these latest figures are just consistent with the previous trend the sixtysecond spot has been nominated for a clio terese countered its a damn good commercial its wonderfully creative im proud of my team for having put it together and indeed you should be brian interjected but it is roberts feeling that the client is not interested in our winning a clio and remember as the benton and bowles agency held if it doesnt sell it isnt creative thats equally absurd terese snapped the campaign is solid its just that the account people couldnt get the client to buy adequate exposure there should have been flights on multiple local stations at a bare minimum with all due respect they would have bought more time if theyd liked the commercial robert said i dont think they were ever sold on this idea of them versus us ancient medicine versus modern medicine i mean it was humorous but i dont know if they were convinced the viewer truly associated the ancient methods with national health cares competitors particularly americare my personal opinion is that it went over peoples heads your real point is that national health care has a very specific type of advertising it wants brian said tell terese what you told me just before she came in here its simple robert said making an open gesture with his hands they want either talking heads discussing actual patient experiences or a celebrity spokesperson they couldnt care less whether their ad wins a clio or any of the other awards they want results they want market share and i want to give it to them am i hearing that willow and heath wants to turn its back on its successes and become a mere vendor shop terese asked were on the edge of becoming one of the bigleague firms and how did we get here we got here by doing quality advertising weve carried on in the doyledanebernback tradition if we start letting clients dictate that we turn out slop were doomed what im hearing is the usual conflict between the account executive and the creative taylor said interrupting the increasingly heated discussion robert you think terese is this selfindulgent child who is bent on alienating the client terese you think robert is this shortsighted pragmatist who wants to throw out the baby with the bathwater the trouble is you are both right and both wrong at the same time you have to use each other as a team stop arguing and deal with the problem at hand for a moment everyone was quiet zeus had spoken and everyone knew he was on target as usual all right brian said finally heres our reality national health is a vital client to our longterm stability thirtyodd days ago it asked for an internal review which we expected in a couple of months they now have told us they want it next week next week terese all but shouted my god it took months to put together a new campaign and pitch it i know that will put the creatives under a lot of pressure brian said but the reality is national health is the boss the problem is that after our pitch if they are not satisfied theyll set up an outside review the account will then be up for grabs and i dont have to remind you that these healthcare giants are going to be the advertising cash cows of the next decade all the agencies are interested as chief financial officer i think i should make it clear what the loss of the national health account would do to our bottom line phil atkins said well have to put off the restructuring because we wont have the funds to buy back our junk bonds obviously it is in all our best interests that we not lose the account brian said i dont know if it is possible to put together a pitch for next week terese said you have anything you can show us at the moment brian asked terese shook her head you must have something robert said i assume you have a team working on it the smile had returned to the corners of his mouth of course we have a team on national health terese said but we havent had any big ideas to date obviously we thought we had several more months perhaps you might assign some additional personnel brian said but ill leave that up to your judgment then to the rest of the group he said for now well adjourn this meeting until we have something from creative to look at he stood up everybody else did the same dazed terese stumbled out of the cabin and descended to the agencys main studio on the floor below willow and heath had reversed a trend that began during the seventies and eighties when new york advertising firms had experienced a diaspora to varying chic sections of the city like tribeca and chelsea the agency returned to the old stamping ground of madison avenue taking over several floors of a modestsized building terese found colleen at her drawing board whats the scoop colleen asked you look pale trouble terese exclaimed colleen had been tereses first hire she was her most reliable art director they got along famously both professionally and socially colleen was a milkywhiteskinned strawberry blonde with a smattering of pale freckles over an upturned nose her eyes were a deep blue a much stronger hue than tereses she favored oversized sweatshirts that somehow seemed to accentuate rather than hide her enviable figure let me guess colleen said has national health pushed up the deadline for the review howd you know intuition colleen said when you said trouble thats the worst thing i could think of the robertandhelen sideshow brought in information that national health has lost more market share to americare despite our campaign damn colleen said its a good campaign and a great sixtysecond commercial you know it and i know it terese said problem is that it wasnt shown enough i have an uncomfortable suspicion that helen undermined us and talked them out of the twohundred to threehundredpoint tv commercial buy they had initially intended to make that would have been saturation i know it would have worked i thought you told me you had pulled out the stops to guarantee national healths market share would go up colleen said i did terese said ive done everything i could think of and then some i mean its my best sixtysecond spot you told me yourself terese rubbed her forehead she was getting a headache she could still feel her pulse clanging away at her temples you might as well tell me the bad news colleen said she put down her drawing pencil and swung around to face terese whats the new time frame national health wants us to pitch a new campaign next week good lord colleen said what do we have so far terese asked not a lot you must have some tissues or some preliminary executions terese said i know i havent been giving you any attention lately since weve had deadlines with three other clients but you have had a team working on this for almost a month weve been having strategy session after strategy session colleen said a lot of brainstorming but no big idea nothings jumped out and grabbed us i mean i have a sense of what you are looking for well i want to see what you have terese said i dont care how sketchy or preliminary i want to see what the team has been doing i want to see it today all right colleen said without enthusiasm ill get everybody together wednesday am march susanne hard had never liked hospitals a scoliotic back had kept her in and out of them as a child hospitals made her nervous she hated the sense that she was not in control and that she was surrounded by the sick and the dying susanne was a firm believer in the adage if something can go wrong it will go wrong she felt this way particularly in relation to hospitals indeed on her last admission shed been carted off to urology to face some frightful procedure before shed finally been able to convince a reluctant technician to read the name on her wristband theyd had the wrong patient on her present admission susanne wasnt sick the previous night her labor had started with her second child in addition to her back problem her pelvis was distorted making a normal vaginal delivery impossible as with her first child she had to have a cesarean section since shed just undergone abdominal surgery her doctor insisted that she stay at least a few days no amount of cajoling on susannes part had been successful in convincing the doctor otherwise susanne tried to relax by wondering what kind of child shed just birthed would he be like his brother allen who had been a wonderful baby allen had slept through the night almost from day one hed been a delight and now that he was three and already exerting independence susanne was looking forward to a new baby she thought of herself as a natural mother with a start susanne awoke shed surprised herself by nodding off what had awakened her was a whiteclad figure fiddling with the iv bottles that hung from a pole at the head of her bed what are you doing susanne asked she felt paranoid about anybody doing anything she didnt know about sorry to have awakened you mrs hard a nurse said i was just hanging up a new bottle of fluid yours is just about out susanne glanced at the iv snaking into the back of her hand as an experienced hospital patient she suggested that it was time for the iv to come out maybe i should check on that the nurse said she then waltzed out of the room tilting her head back susanne looked at the iv bottle to see what it was it was upside down so she couldnt read the label she started to turn over but a sharp pain reminded her of her recently sutured incision she decided to stay on her back gingerly she took a deep breath she didnt feel any discomfort until right at the end of inspiration closing her eyes susanne tried again to calm down she knew that she still had a significant amount of drugs on board from the anesthesia so sleep should be easy the trouble was she didnt know if she wanted to be asleep with so many people coming in and out of her room a very soft clank of plastic hitting plastic drifted out of the background noise of the hospital and caught susannes attention her eyes blinked open she saw an orderly off to the side by the bureau excuse me susanne called the man turned around he was a handsome fellow in a white coat over scrubs from where he was standing susanne could not read his name tag he appeared surprised to be addressed i hope i didnt disturb you maam the young man said everybody is disturbing me susanne said without malice its like grand central station in here im terribly sorry the man said i can always return later if it would be more convenient what are you doing susanne asked just filling your humidifier the man said what do i have a humidifier for susanne said i didnt have one after my last cesarean the anesthesiologists frequently order them this time of year the man said right after surgery patients throats are often irritated from the endotracheal tube its usually helpful to use a humidifier for the first day or even the first few hours in what month did you have your last cesarean may susanne said thats probably the reason you didnt have one then the man said would you like me to return do what you have to do susanne said no sooner had the man left than the original nurse returned you were right she said the orders were to pull the iv as soon as the bottle was through susanne merely nodded she felt like asking the nurse if missing orders was something she did on a regular basis susanne sighed she wanted out of there after the nurse had removed the iv susanne managed to calm herself enough to fall back asleep but it didnt last long someone was nudging her arm susanne opened her eyes and looked into the face of another smiling nurse in the foreground and between them was a fivecc syringe ive got something for you the nurse said as if susanne were a toddler and the syringe candy what is it susanne demanded she instinctively pulled away its the pain shot you requested the nurse said so roll over and ill give it to you i didnt request a pain shot susanne said but of course you did the nurse said but i didnt susanne said the nurses expression changed to exasperation like a cloud passing over the sun well then its doctors orders you are supposed to have a pain shot every six hours but i dont have much pain susanne said only when i move or breathe deeply there you are the nurse said you have to breathe deeply otherwise youll get pneumonia come on now be a good girl susanne thought for a moment on the one hand she felt like being contrary on the other hand she wanted to be taken care of and there was nothing inherently wrong with a pain shot it might even make her sleep better okay susanne said gritting her teeth she managed to roll to the side as the nurse bared her bottom wednesday pm march you know lauries right chet mcgovern said chet and jack were sitting in the narrow office they shared on the fifth floor of the medical examiners building they both had their feet up on their respective gray metal desks theyd finished their autopsies for the day eaten lunch and were now supposedly doing their paperwork of course shes right jack agreed but if you know that why do you provoke calvin its not rational youre not doing yourself any favors its going to affect your promotion up through the system i dont want to rise up in the system jack said come again chet asked in the grand scheme of medicine the concept of not wanting to get ahead was heresy jack let his feet fall off the desk and thump onto the floor he stood up stretched and yawned loudly jack was a stocky sixfoot man accustomed to serious physical activity he found that standing at the autopsy table and sitting at a desk tended to cause his muscles to cramp particularly his quadriceps im happy being a low man on the totem pole jack said cracking his knuckles you dont want to become board certified chet asked with surprise ah of course i want to be board certified jack said but thats not the same issue as far as im concerned becoming board certified is a personal thing what i dont care about is having supervisory responsibility i just want to do forensic pathology to hell with bureaucracy and red tape jesus chet remarked letting his own feet fall to the floor every time i think i get to know you a little you throw me a curveball i mean weve been sharing this office for almost five months youre still a mystery i dont even know where the hell you live i didnt know you cared jack teased come on chet said you know what i mean i live on the upper west side jack said its no secret in the seventies chet asked a bit higher jack said eighties higher youre not going to tell me higher than the nineties are you chet asked a tad jack said i live on a hundred and sixth street good grief chet exclaimed youre living in harlem jack shrugged he sat down at his desk and pulled out one of his unfinished files whats in a name he said why in the world live in harlem chet asked of all the neat places to live in and around the city why live there it cant be a nice neighborhood besides it must be dangerous i dont see it that way jack said plus there are a lot of playgrounds in the area and a particularly good one right next door im kind of a pickup basketball nut now i know you are crazy chet said those playgrounds and those pickup games are controlled by neighborhood gangs thats like having a death wish im afraid we might see you in here on one of the slabs even without the mountain bike heroics i havent had any trouble jack said after all i paid for new backboards and lights and i buy the balls the neighborhood gang is actually quite appreciative and even solicitous chet eyed his officemate with a touch of awe he tried to imagine what jack would look like out running around on a harlem neighborhood blacktop he imagined jack would certainly stand out racially with his light brown hair cut in a peculiar julius caesarlike shag chet wondered if any of the other players had any idea about jack like the fact that he was a doctor but then chet acknowledged that he didnt know much more what did you do before you went to medical school chet asked i went to college jack said like most people who went to medical school dont tell me you didnt go to college of course i went to college chet said calvin is right you are a smartass you know what i mean if you just finished a pathology residency what did you do in the interim chet had wanted to ask the question for months but there had never been an opportune moment i became an ophthalmologist jack said i even had a practice out in champaign illinois i was a conventional conservative suburbanite yeah sure just like i was a buddhist monk chet laughed i mean i suppose i can see you as an ophthalmologist after all i was an emergencyroom physician for a few years until i saw the light but you conservative no way i was jack insisted and my name was john not jack of course you wouldnt have recognized me i was heavier i also had longer hair and i parted it along the right side of my head the way i did in high school and as far as dress was concerned i favored glenplaid suits what happened chet asked chet glanced at jacks black jeans blue sports shirt and dark blue knitted tie a knock on the doorjamb caught both jacks and chets attention they turned to see agnes finn head of the micro lab standing in the doorway she was a small serious woman with thick glasses and stringy hair we just got something a little surprising she said to jack she was clutching a sheet of paper in her hand she hesitated on the threshold her dour expression didnt change are you going to make us guess or what jack asked his curiosity had been titillated since agnes did not make it a point to deliver lab results agnes pushed her glasses higher onto her nose and handed jack the paper its the fluorescein antibody screen you requested on nodelman my word jack said after glancing at the page he handed it to chet chet looked at the paper and then leaped to his feet holy crap he exclaimed nodelman had the goddamn plague obviously we were taken aback by the result agnes said in her usual monotone is there anything else you want us to do jack pinched his lower lip while he thought lets try to culture some of the incipient abscesses he said and lets try some of the usual stains whats recommended for plague giemsas or waysons agnes said they usually make it possible to see the typical bipolar safety pin morphology okay lets do that jack said of course the most important thing is to grow the bug until we do that the case is only presumptive plague i understand agnes said she started from the room i guess i dont have to warn you to be careful jack said no need agnes assured him we have a classthree hood and i intend to use it this is incredible chet said when they were alone how the hell did you know i didnt jack said calvin forced me to make a diagnosis to tell the truth i thought i was being facetious of course the signs were all consistent but i still didnt imagine i had a snowballs chance in hell of being right but now that i am its no laughing matter the only positive aspect is that i win that ten dollars from calvin hes going to hate you for that chet said thats the least of my worries jack said im stunned a case of pneumonic plague in march in new york city supposedly contracted in a hospital of course that cant be true unless the manhattan general is supporting a horde of infected rats and their fleas nodelman had to have had contact with some sort of infected animal its my guess he was traveling recently jack snatched up the phone who are you calling chet asked bingham of course jack said as he punched the numbers there cant be any delay this is a hot potato i want out of my hands mrs sanford picked up the extension but informed chet that dr bingham was at city hall and would be all day he had left specific instructions he was not to be bothered since hed be closeted with the mayor so much for our chief jack said without putting down the receiver he dialed calvins number he didnt have any better luck calvins secretary told him that calvin had had to leave for the day there was an illness in the family jack hung up the phone and drummed his fingers on the surface of the desk no luck chet asked the entire general staff is indisposed jack said we grunts are on our own jack suddenly pushed back his chair got up and started out of the office chet bounded out of his own chair and followed where are you going he asked he had to run to catch up with jack down to talk to bart arnold jack said he got to the elevator and hit the down button i need more information somebody has to figure out where this plague came from or this citys in for some trouble hadnt you better wait for bingham chet asked that look in your eye disturbs me i didnt know i was so transparent jack said with a laugh i guess this incident has caught my interest its got me excited the elevator door opened and jack got on chet held the door from closing jack do me a favor and be careful i like sharing the office with you dont ruffle too many feathers me jack questioned innocently im mister diplomacy and im muammar el qaddafi chet said he let the elevator door slide closed jack hummed a perky tune while the elevator descended he was definitely keyed up and he was enjoying himself he smiled when he remembered telling laurie that hed hoped nodelman turned out to have something with serious institutional consequences like legionnaires disease so he could give americare some heartburn plague was ten times better and on top of sticking it to americare hed have the pleasure of collecting his ten bucks from calvin jack exited on the first floor and went directly to bart arnolds office bart was the chief of the pas or physicians assistants jack was pleased to catch him at his desk weve got a presumptive diagnosis of plague ive got to talk with janice jaeger right away jack said shell be sleeping bart said cant it wait no jack said bingham or calvin know about this bart asked both are out and i dont know when theyll be back jack said bart hesitated a moment then opened up the side drawer of his desk after looking up janices number he made the call when she was on the line he apologized for having awakened her and explained that dr stapleton needed to speak with her he handed the phone to jack jack apologized as well and then told her about the results on nodelman any sign of sleepiness in janices voice disappeared instantly what can i do to help she asked did you find any reference to travel in any of the hospital records jack asked not that i recall janice said any reference to contact with pets or wild animals jack asked negative janice said but i can go back there tonight those questions were never specifically asked jack thanked her and told her that hed be looking into it himself he handed the phone back to bart and hurried back to his own office chet looked up as jack dashed in learn anything he asked not a thing jack said happily he pulled out nodelmans folder and rapidly shuffled through the pages until he found the completed identification sheet on it were phone numbers for the next of kin with his index finger marking nodelmans wifes number jack made the call it was an exchange in the bronx mrs nodelman answered on the second ring im dr stapleton jack said im a medical examiner for the city of new york at that point jack had to explain the role of a medical examiner because even the archaic term coroner didnt register with mrs nodelman id like to ask you a few questions jack said once mrs nodelman understood who he was it was so sudden mrs nodelman said she had started to cry he had diabetes thats true but he wasnt supposed to die im very sorry for your loss jack said but did your late husband do any recent traveling he went to new jersey a week or so ago mrs nodelman said jack could hear her blow her nose i was thinking of travel to more distant destinations jack said like to the southwest or maybe india just to manhattan every day mrs nodelman said how about a visitor from some exotic locale jack asked donalds aunt visited in december mrs nodelman said and where is she from queens mrs nodelman said queens jack repeated thats not quite what i had in mind how about contact with any wild animals like rabbits no mrs nodelman said donald hated rabbits how about pets jack asked we have a cat mrs nodelman said is the cat sick jack asked or has the cat brought home any rodents the cat is fine mrs nodelman said shes a house cat and never goes outside how about rats jack asked do you see many rats around your house have you seen any dead ones lately we dont have any rats mrs nodelman said indignantly we live in a nice clean apartment jack tried to think of something else to ask but for the moment nothing came to mind mrs nodelman he said youve been most kind the reason im asking you these questions is because we have reason to believe that your husband died of a serious infectious disease we think he died of plague there was a brief silence you mean bubonic plague like they had in europe long ago mrs nodelman asked sort of jack said plague comes in two clinical forms bubonic and pneumonic your husband seems to have had the pneumonic form which happens to be the more contagious i would advise you to go to your doctor and inform him of your potential exposure im sure hell want you to take some precautionary antibiotics i would also advise you to take your pet to your vet and tell him the same thing is this serious mrs nodelman asked its very serious jack said he then gave her his phone number in case she had any questions later he also asked her to call him if the vet found anything suspicious with the cat jack hung up the phone and turned to chet the mystery is deepening he said then he added cheerfully americare is going to have some severe indigestion over this theres that facial expression again that scares me chet said jack laughed got up and started out of the room where are you going now chet asked nervously to tell laurie montgomery whats going on jack said shes supposed to be our supervisor for today she has to be apprised a few minutes later jack returned whatd she say chet asked she was as stunned as we were jack said he grabbed the phone directory before taking his seat he flipped open the pages to the city listings did she want you to do anything in particular chet asked no jack said she told me to tread water until bingham is informed in fact she tried to call our illustrious chief but hes still incommunicado with the mayor jack picked up the phone and dialed who are you calling now chet asked the commissioner of health patricia markham jack said i aint waiting good grief chet exclaimed rolling his eyes hadnt you better let bingham do that youll be calling his boss behind his back jack didnt respond he was busy giving his name to the commissioners secretary when she told him to hold on he covered the mouthpiece with his hand and whispered to chet surprise surprise shes in i guarantee bingham is not going to like this chet whispered back jack held up his hand to silence chet hello commissioner jack said into the phone howya doing this is jack stapleton here from over at the mes office chet winced at jacks breezy informality sorry to spoil your day jack continued but i felt i had to call dr bingham and dr washington are momentarily unavailable and a situation has developed that i believe you should know about weve just made a presumptive diagnosis of plague in a patient from the manhattan general hospital good lord dr markham exclaimed loud enough for chet to hear thats frightening but only one case i trust so far jack said all right ill alert the city board of health dr markham said theyll take over and contact the cdc thanks for the warning what was your name again stapleton jack said jack stapleton jack hung up with a selfsatisfied smile on his lips maybe you should sell short your americare stock he told chet the commissioner sounds concerned maybe youd better brush off your résumé chet said bingham is going to be pissed jack whistled while he leafed through nodelmans file until he came up with the investigative report once he had located the name of the attending physician dr carl wainwright he wrote it down then he got up and put on his leather bomber jacket uh oh chet said now what im going over to the manhattan general jack said i think ill make a site visit this case is too important to leave up to the generals chet swung around in his chair as jack went through the door of course you know that bingham doesnt encourage us mes doing site work chet said youll be adding insult to injury ill take my chances jack said where i was trained it was considered necessary bingham thinks its the job of the pas chet said hes told us that time and again this case is too interesting for me to pass up jack called from down the hall hold down the fort i wont be long wednesday pm march it was overcast and threatening rain but jack didnt mind regardless of the weather the vigorous bike ride uptown to the manhattan general was a pleasure after having stood all morning in the autopsy room imprisoned inside his moon suit near the hospitals front entrance jack located a sturdy street sign to lock his mountain bike to he even locked up his helmet and bomber jacket with a separate wire lock that also secured the seat standing within the shadow of the hospital jack glanced up at its soaring facade it had been an old respected universityaffiliated proprietary hospital in its previous life americare had gobbled it up during the fiscally difficult times the government had unwittingly created in health care in the early s although jack knew revenge was far from a noble emotion he savored the knowledge that he was about to hand americare a public relations bomb inside jack went to the information booth and asked about dr carl wainwright he learned that the man was an americare internist whose office was in the attached professional building the receptionist gave jack careful directions fifteen minutes later jack was in the mans waiting room after jack flashed his medical examiners badge which looked for all intents and purposes like a police badge the receptionist wasted no time in letting dr wainwright know he was there jack was immediately shown into the doctors private office and within minutes the doctor himself appeared dr carl wainwright was prematurely whitehaired and slightly stooped over his face however was youthful with bright blue eyes he shook hands with jack and motioned for him to sit down its not every day were visited by someone from the medical examiners office dr wainwright said id be concerned if it were jack said dr wainwright looked confused until he realized jack was kidding dr wainwright tittered right you are he said ive come about your patient donald nodelman jack said getting right to the point we have a presumptive diagnosis of plague dr wainwrights mouth dropped open thats impossible he said when hed recovered enough to speak jack shrugged i guess its not he said fluorescein antibody for plague is quite reliable of course we havent yet grown it out my goodness dr wainwright managed he rubbed a nervous palm across his face what a shock it is surprising jack agreed especially since the patient had been in the hospital for five days before his symptoms started ive never heard of nosocomial plague dr wainwright said nor have i jack said but it was pneumonic plague not bubonic and as you know the incubation period is shorter for pneumonic probably only two to three days i still cant believe it dr wainwright said plague never entered my thoughts anybody else sick with similar symptoms jack asked not that i know of dr wainwright said but you can rest assured that we will find out immediately im curious about this mans lifestyle jack said his wife denied any recent travel or visitors from areas endemic to plague she also doubted hed come in contact with wild animals is that your understanding as well the patient worked in the garment district dr wainwright said he did bookkeeping he never traveled he wasnt a hunter id been seeing him frequently over the last month trying to get his diabetes under control where was he in the hospital jack asked on the medical ward on the seventh floor dr wainwright said room sevenohseven i remember the number specifically single room jack asked all our rooms are singles dr wainwright said thats a help jack said can i see the room of course dr wainwright said but i think i should call dr mary zimmerman whos our infectioncontrol officer shes got to know about this immediately by all means jack said meanwhile would you mind if i went up to the seventh floor and looked around please dr wainwright said as he gestured toward the door ill call dr zimmerman and well meet you up there he reached for the phone jack retraced his route back to the main hospital building he took the elevator to the seventh floor which he found was divided by the elevator lobby into two wings the north wing housed internal medicine while the south wing was reserved for obgyn jack pushed through the doors that led into the internalmedicine division as soon as the swinging door closed behind jack he knew that word of the contagion had arrived a nervous bustle was apparent and all the personnel were wearing newly distributed masks obviously wainwright had wasted no time no one paid jack any attention as he wandered down to room pausing at the door jack watched as two masked orderlies wheeled out a masked and confused patient clutching her belongings who was apparently being transferred as soon as they were gone jack walked in sevenohseven was a nondescript hospital room of modern design the interior of the old hospital had been renovated in the nottoodistant past the metal furniture was typical hospital issue and included a bed a bureau a vinylcovered chair a night table and a variableheight bed table a tv hung from an arm attached to the ceiling the airconditioning apparatus was beneath the window jack went over to it lifted the top and looked inside a hotwater and a chillwater pipe poked up through the concrete floor and entered a thermostated fan unit that recirculated room air jack detected no holes large enough for any type of rodent much less a rat stepping into the bathroom jack glanced around at the sink toilet and shower the room was newly tiled there was an air return in the ceiling bending down he opened the cabinet below the sink again there were no holes hearing voices in the other room jack stepped back through the door it was dr wainwright clutching a mask to his face he was accompanied by two women and a man all of whom were wearing masks the women were attired in the long white professorial coats jack associated with medicalschool professors after handing jack a mask dr wainwright made the introductions the taller woman was dr mary zimmerman the hospitals infectioncontrol officer and head of the likenamed committee jack sensed she was a serious woman who felt defensive under the circumstances as she was introduced she informed him that she was a boardcertified internist with subspecialty training in infectious disease not knowing how to respond to this revelation jack complimented her i did not have an opportunity to examine mr nodelman she added im certain you would have made the diagnosis instantly had you done so jack said consciously trying to keep sarcasm out of his voice no doubt she said the second woman was kathy mcbane and jack was happy to turn his attention to her especially since ms mcbane had a warmer demeanor than her committee chairwoman he learned she was an rn supervisor and a member of the infection control committee it was usual for such a committee to have representatives from most if not all the hospital departments the man was george eversharp he was dressed in a heavy cotton twill blue uniform as jack suspected he was the supervisor of the department of engineering and was also a member of the infection control committee we certainly are indebted to dr stapleton for his rapid diagnosis dr wainwright said trying to lighten the atmosphere just a lucky guess jack said weve already begun to react dr zimmerman said in a deadpan voice ive ordered a list to be drawn up of possible contacts to start chemoprophylaxis i think that is wise jack said and as we speak the clinical computer is searching our current patient database for symptom complexes suggestive of plague she continued commendable jack said meanwhile we have to discover the origin of the current case she said you and i are thinking along the same lines jack said id advise you to wear your mask she added okay jack said agreeably he held it up to his face dr zimmerman turned to mr eversharp please continue with what you were saying about the air flow jack listened as the engineer explained that the ventilation system in the hospital was designed so that there was a flow from the hall into each room and then its bathroom the air was then filtered he also explained that there were a few rooms where the air flow could be reversed for patients with compromised immune systems is this one of those rooms dr zimmerman asked it is not mr eversharp said so there is no freak way plague bacteria could have gotten into the ventilation system and infected just this room dr zimmerman asked no mr eversharp said the air induction in the hall goes into all these rooms equally and the chances of bacteria floating out of this room into the hall would be low dr zimmerman said impossible mr eversharp said the only way it could leave would be on some sort of vector excuse me a voice called everyone turned to see a nurse standing in the doorway she too had a mask pressed against her face mr kelley would like you all to come to the nurses station dutifully everyone started from the room as kathy mcbane stepped in front of him jack got her attention whos mr kelley he asked hes the hospital president ms mcbane said jack nodded as he walked he nostalgically reminisced that the head of the hospital used to be called an administrator and was frequently a person whod had medical training that was back when patient care was paramount now that business was king and the goal was profit the name had changed to president jack was looking forward to meeting mr kelley the hospital president was the onsite representative of americare and giving him a headache was the equivalent of giving americare a headache the atmosphere at the nurses station was tense word of the plague had spread like wildfire everyone who worked on the floor and even some of the ambulatory patients now knew they had been potentially exposed charles kelley was doing his best to reassure them he told them there was no risk and that everything was under control yeah sure jack scoffed under his breath jack looked with disgust at this man who had the gall to utter such patently false platitudes he was intimidatingly tall a good eight inches taller than jacks six feet his handsome face was tanned and his sandycolored hair was streaked with pure golden blond as if hed just returned from a caribbean vacation from jacks perspective he looked and sounded more like an unctuous car salesman than the business manager that he was as soon as kelley saw jack and the others approach he motioned for them to follow him breaking off his consoling speech he made a beeline for the safety of the utility room behind the nurses station as jack squeezed in behind kathy mcbane he noticed kelley wasnt alone he was being shadowed by a slightly built man with a lantern jaw and thinning hair in sharp contrast to kelleys sartorial splendor this second man was dressed in a threadbare cheap sports coat over slacks that appeared never to have been pressed god what a mess kelley said angrily to no one in particular his demeanor had metamorphosed instantly from slippery salesman to sardonic administrator he took a paper towel and wiped his perspiring brow this is not what this hospital needs he crumpled the towel and threw it into the trash turning to dr zimmerman and in contrast to what hed just said out in the nurses station he asked her if they were taking a risk just being on the floor i sincerely doubt it dr zimmerman said but well have to make certain turning to dr wainwright kelley said no sooner had i heard about this disaster than i learned you already knew about it why didnt you inform me dr wainwright explained that hed just heard the news from jack and had not had time to call he explained he thought it was more important to call dr zimmerman to get corrective measures instituted he then proceeded to introduce jack jack stepped forward and gave a little wave he was unable to suppress a smile this was the moment he knew hed savor kelley took in the chambray shirt the knitted tie and the black jeans it was a far cry from his own valentino silk suit seems to me the commissioner of health mentioned your name when she called me kelley said as i recall she was impressed youd made the diagnosis so quickly we city employees are always glad to be of service jack said kelley gave a short derisive laugh perhaps youd like to meet one of your dedicated fellow city employees kelley said this is dr clint abelard hes the epidemiologist for the new york city board of health jack nodded to his mousy colleague but the epidemiologist didnt return the greeting jack got the sense that jacks presence was not wholly appreciated interdepartmental rivalry was a fact of bureaucratic life he was just beginning to appreciate kelley cleared his throat and then spoke to wainwright and zimmerman i want this whole episode kept as lowkey as possible the less thats in the media the better if any reporter tries to talk with either of you send them to me ill be gearing up the pr office to do damage control excuse me jack said unable to restrain himself from interrupting corporate interests aside i think you should concentrate on prevention that means treating contacts and ascertaining where the plague bacteria came from i think you have a mystery on your hands here and until thats solved the media is going to have a field day no matter what damage control you attempt i wasnt aware anyone asked your opinion kelley said scornfully i just felt you could use a little direction jack said you seemed to be wandering a bit far afield kelleys face reddened he shook his head in disbelief all right he said struggling to control himself with your clairvoyance i suppose you already have an idea of its origin id guess rats jack said im sure there are lots of rats around here jack had been waiting to use that comment since it had had such a good effect with calvin that morning we have no rats here at the manhattan general kelley sputtered and if i hear that youve said anything like that to the media ill have your head rats are the classical reservoir for the plague jack said im sure theyre around here if you know how to recognize them i mean find them kelley turned to clint abelard do you think rats had anything to do with this case of plague he demanded i have yet to begin my investigation dr abelard said i wouldnt want to hazard a guess but i find it hard to believe that rats could have been involved were on the seventh floor id suggest you start trapping rats jack said start in the immediate neighborhood the first thing to find out is if plague has infiltrated the local urban rodent population id like to switch the conversation away from rats kelley said i would like to hear about what we should do for people who had direct contact with the deceased thats my department dr zimmerman said heres what i propose while dr zimmerman spoke clint abelard motioned for jack to accompany him out to the nurses station im the epidemiologist clint said in an angry forced whisper ive never disputed that fact jack said he was surprised and confused by the vehemence of clints reaction im trained to investigate the origin of diseases in the human community he said its my job you on the other hand are a coroner correction jack said im a medical examiner with training in pathology you as a physician should know that medical examiner or coroner i couldnt care less what term you guys use for yourselves clint said hey but i do jack said the point is that your training and your responsibility involve the dead not the origin of disease wrong again jack said we deal with the dead so that they speak to the living our goal is to prevent death i dont know how to make it much plainer to you clint said with exasperation you told us a man died of plague we appreciate that and we didnt interfere in your work now it is for me to figure out how he got it im just trying to help jack said thank you but if i need your help ill ask for it clint said and strode off toward room jack watched clints figure recede when a commotion behind him attracted his attention kelley had emerged from the utility room and was immediately besieged by the people hed been speaking with earlier jack was impressed by how quickly his plastic smile returned and with what ease he sidestepped all questions within seconds he was on his way down the hall toward the elevators and the safety of the administrative offices dr zimmerman and dr wainwright stepped out of the utility room deep in conversation when kathy mcbane appeared she was alone jack intercepted her sorry to have been the bearer of bad news jack offered dont be sorry kathy said from my point of view we owe you a vote of thanks well its an unfortunate problem jack said id guess its the worst since ive been on the infection control committee she said i thought last years outbreak of hepatitis b was bad i never dreamed wed ever see plague what is the manhattan generals experience in regard to nosocomial infections jack asked kathy shrugged pretty much the equivalent of any large tertiarycare hospital she said weve had our methicillinresistant staph of course thats an ongoing problem we even had klebsiella growing in a canister of surgical scrub soap a year ago that resulted in a whole series of postoperative wound infections until it was discovered how about pneumonias jack asked like this case oh yeah weve had our share of them too kathy said with a sigh mostly its been pseudomonas but two years ago we had an outbreak of legionella i hadnt heard about that jack said it was kept quiet kathy said luckily no one died of course i cant say that about the problem we had just five months ago in the surgical intensive care we lost three patients to enterobacterial pneumonia we had to close the unit until it was discovered that some of our nebulizers had become contaminated kathy a voice called out sharply both jack and kathy abruptly turned to see that dr zimmerman had come up behind them that is confidential information dr zimmerman lectured kathy started to say something but then thought better of it we have work to do kathy dr zimmerman said lets go to my office suddenly abandoned jack debated what he should do for a moment he considered going back to room but after clints tirade he thought it best to leave the man alone after all jack had intended to provoke kelley not clint then he got an idea it might be instructive to visit the lab as defensively as dr zimmerman had responded jack thought it was the lab that should have been chagrined they were the ones who missed the diagnosis after inquiring about the location of the lab jack took the elevator down to the second floor flashing his medical examiners badge again produced immediate results dr martin cheveau the lab director materialized and welcomed jack into his office he was a short fellow with a full head of dark hair and pencilline mustache have you heard about the case of plague jack asked once they were seated no where martin questioned here at the manhattan general jack said room sevenohseven i posted the patient this morning oh no martin moaned he sighed loudly that doesnt sound good for us what was the name donald nodelman jack said martin swung around in his seat and accessed his computer the screen flashed all nodelmans laboratory results for the duration of his admission martin scrolled through until he got to the microbiology section i see we had a sputum gram stain showing weakly gramnegative bacilli martin said theres also a culture pending that was negative for growth at thirtysix hours i guess that should have told us something especially where i see pseudomonas was suspected i mean pseudomonas would have grown out without any trouble way before thirtysix hours it would have been helpful if giemsas or waysons stain had been used jack said the diagnosis could have been made exactly martin said he turned back to jack this is terrible im embarrassed unfortunately its an example of the kind of thing thats going to happen more and more often administration has been forcing us to cut costs and downsize even though our workload has gone up its a deadly combination as this case of plague proves and its happening all over the country youve had to let people go jack asked he thought that the clinical lab was one place hospitals actually made money about twenty percent martin said others weve had to demote in microbiology we dont have a supervisor any longer if we had he probably would have caught this case of plague with the operating budget weve been allotted we cant afford it our old supervisor got demoted to head tech its discouraging it used to be we strove for excellence in the lab now we strive for adequate whatever that means does your computer say which tech did the gram stain jack asked if nothing else we could turn this episode into a teaching experience good idea martin said he faced the computer and accessed data the techs identity was in code suddenly he turned back to jack i just remembered something he said my head tech thought of plague in relation to a patient just yesterday and asked me what i thought im afraid i discouraged him by telling him the chances were somewhere on the order of a billion to one jack perked up i wonder what made him think of plague i wonder too martin said reaching over to his intercom system he paged richard overstreet while they waited for the man to arrive martin determined that nancy wiggens had signed out on the original gram stain martin paged her as well richard overstreet appeared within minutes he was a boyish athleticlooking individual with a shock of auburn hair that fell across his forehead the hair had a habit of slipping over his eyes richard was ever pushing it back with his hand or throwing it back with a snap of his head he wore a white jacket over surgical scrubs his jacket pockets were crammed with test tubes tourniquets gauze pads lab chits and syringes martin introduced richard to jack then asked him about the short discussion theyd had about plague the day before richard seemed embarrassed it was just my imagination getting the best of me he said with a laugh but what made you think of it martin asked richard swept his hair from his face and for a moment left his hand on the top of his head while he thought oh i remember he said nancy wiggens had gone up to get a sputum culture and draw the mans blood she told me how sick he was and that he appeared to have some gangrene on the tips of his fingers she said his fingers were black richard shrugged it made me think of the black death jack was impressed did you follow up on it at all martin asked no richard said not after what youd said about the probability as behind as we are in the lab i couldnt take the time all of us including me have been out drawing blood is there some kind of problem richard asked a big problem martin said the man did have plague not only that but hes already dead richard literally staggered my god he exclaimed i hope you encourage safety with your techs jack said absolutely richard said regaining his composure we have biosafety cabinets both type two and three i try to encourage my techs to use one or the other especially with obviously serious infectious cases personally i like the type three but some people find using the thick rubber gloves too clumsy at that moment nancy wiggens appeared she was a shy woman who appeared more like a teenager than a college graduate she could barely look jack in the eye as they were introduced she wore her dark hair parted down the middle of her head and like that of her immediate boss richard it constantly fell across her eyes martin explained to her what had happened she was as shocked as richard had been martin assured her she was not being blamed but that they should all try to learn from the experience what should i do about my exposure she questioned i was the one who got the specimen as well as the one who processed it youll probably be taking tetracycline by mouth or streptomycin im jack said the hospital infectioncontrol officer is working on that at the moment uh oh martin voiced under his breath but loud enough for the others to hear here comes our fearless leader and the chief of the medical staff and both look unhappy kelley swept into the room like an irate general after a military defeat he towered over martin with his hands on his hips and his reddened face thrust forward dr cheveau he began with a scornful tone dr arnold here tells me you should have made this diagnosis before kelley stopped midsentence although he was content to ignore the two microbiology techs jack was a different story what in gods name are you doing down here he demanded just helping out jack replied arent you overstepping your mandate he suggested venomously we like to be thorough in our investigations jack said i think you have more than exhausted your official capacity kelley snapped i want you out of here after all this is a private institution jack got to his feet vainly trying to look the towering kelley in the eye if americare thinks it can do without me i think ill run along kelleys face turned purple he started to say something else but changed his mind instead he merely pointed toward the door jack smiled and waved to the others before taking his leave he was pleased with his visit as far as he was concerned it couldnt have gone better wednesday pm march susanne hard was looking through the small round window of the door to the elevator lobby with rapt attention the end of the corridor was as far as she was allowed to go on her ambulation shed been walking with little steps while supporting her freshly sutured abdomen as unpleasant as the exercise was she knew from experience that the sooner she mobilized herself the sooner shed be in a position to demand release what had caught her attention out in the elevator lobby was the disturbing amount of traffic coming in and out of the medical ward as well as the nervous demeanor of the staff susannes sixth sense told her that something was wrong especially with most of the people wearing masks before she could put a finger on the cause of the apparent stir a literal chill passed through her like an icy arctic wind turning around she expected to feel a draft there wasnt any then the chill returned causing her to tense and shiver until it had passed susanne looked down at her hands they had turned bone white increasingly anxious susanne started back to her room such a chill could not be a good sign as an experienced patient she knew there was always the fear of a wound infection by the time she entered her room she had a headache behind her eyes as she climbed back into bed the headache spread over the top of her head it wasnt like any headache shed ever had before it felt as if someone were pushing an awl into the depths of her brain for a few panicky moments susanne lay perfectly still hoping that whatever had seemed wrong was now all right but instead a new symptom developed the muscles of her legs began to ache within minutes she found herself writhing in the bed vainly trying to find a position that afforded relief close on the heels of the leg pain came an overall malaise that settled over her like a stifling blanket it was so enervating that she could barely reach across her chest for the nurses call button she pressed it and let her arm fall limply back to the bed by the time the nurse came into the room susanne had developed a cough that chafed her already irritated throat i feel sick susanne croaked how so the nurse questioned susanne shook her head it was even hard to talk she felt so terrible she didnt know where to begin i have a headache she managed i believe you have a standing order of pain medication the nurse said ill get it for you i need my doctor susanne whispered her throat felt as bad as when shed first awakened from the anesthesia i think we should try the pain medicine before we call your doctor the nurse said i feel cold susanne said terribly cold the nurse put a practiced hand on susannes forehead then pulled it back in alarm susanne was burning up the nurse took the thermometer from its container on the bedside table and stuck it into susannes mouth while she waited for the thermometer to equilibrate she wrapped a bloodpressure cuff around susannes arm the blood pressure was low she then took the thermometer out of susannes mouth when she saw what the reading was she let out a little gasp of surprise it was fahrenheit do i have a fever susanne questioned a little one the nurse said but everything is going to be fine ill go and give your doctor a call susanne nodded a tear came to the corner of her eye she didnt want this kind of complication she wanted to go home wednesday pm march do you honestly think that robert barker deliberately sabotaged our ad campaign colleen asked terese as they descended the stairs they were on their way to the studio where colleen wanted to show terese what the creative team had put together for a new national health campaign theres not a doubt in my mind terese said of course he didnt do it himself he had helen do it by talking national health out of buying adequate exposure time but hed be shooting himself in the foot if we lose the national health account and we cant restructure then his employee participation units are worth the same as ours zilch screw his employee participation units terese said he wants the presidency and hell do anything to get it god bureaucratic infighting disgusts me colleen said are you sure you want the presidency terese stopped dead on the stairs and looked at colleen as if shed just blasphemed i cant believe you said that but youve complained yourself that the more administrative duties you have the less time you can spend on creativity if barker gets the presidency hell screw up the whole company terese said indignantly well start kowtowing to clients and there goes creativity and quality in one fell swoop besides i want to be president its been my goal for five years this is my chance and if i dont get it now ill never get it i dont know why youre not happy with what youve already accomplished colleen said youre only thirtyone and youre already creative director you should be content and do what you are good at doing great ads oh come on terese said you know we advertising people are never satisfied even if i make president ill probably start eyeing ceo i think you should cool it colleen said youre going to burn out before youre thirtyfive ill cool it when im president terese said yeah sure colleen said once in the studio colleen directed her friend into the small separate room that was affectionately called the arena this was where pitches were rehearsed the name came from the arenas of ancient rome where christians were thrown to the lions at willow and heath the christians were the lowlevel creatives you got a film terese questioned in the front of the room a screen had been pulled down over the chalkboards at best she thought shed be looking at sketchy storyboards we threw together a ripomatic colleen explained a ripomatic was a roughly spliced together amalgam of previously shot video that had been stolen from other projects to give a sense of a commercial terese was encouraged shed not expected video now im warning you this is all very preliminary colleen added save the disclaimers terese said run what you have colleen waved to one of her underlings the lights dimmed and the video started it ran for a hundred seconds it depicted a darling fouryearold girl with a broken doll terese recognized the footage immediately it was part of a spot theyd done the year before for a national toy chain to promote the companys generous return policy colleen had cleverly made it appear as if the child were bringing the doll to the new national health hospital the tag line was we cure anything anytime as soon as the video stopped the lights came on for a few moments no one spoke finally colleen broke the silence you dont like it she said its cute terese admitted the idea is to make the doll reflect different illnesses and injuries in different commercials colleen said of course wed have the child speak and extol the virtues of national health in the video versions in print wed make sure the picture told the story the problem is its too cute terese said even if i think it has some merit im sure the client wont like it since helen via robert would certainly trivialize it its the best that weve come up with so far colleen said youll have to give us some direction we need a creative brief from you otherwise well just keep wandering all over the conceptual landscape then there will be no chance to put anything together for next week we have to come up with something that sets national health apart from americare even though we know they are equivalent the challenge is finding that one idea terese said colleen motioned for her assistant to leave once she had colleen took a chair and put it in front of tereses we need more of your direct involvement she said terese nodded she knew colleen was right but terese felt mentally paralyzed the problem is that its hard to think with this presidency situation hanging over me like the sword of damocles i think youve got yourself in overdrive colleen said youre a ball of nerves so what else is new terese said when was the last time you went out for dinner and a few drinks colleen said terese laughed i havent had time for anything like that for months thats my point colleen said no wonder your creative juices arent flowing you need to relax even if its just for a few hours you really think so terese asked absolutely colleen said in fact were going out tonight well go to dinner and well have a few drinks well even try not to talk about advertising for one night i dont know terese voiced weve got this deadline thats exactly my point colleen said we need to blow the tubes and clear out the cobwebs maybe then well come up with that big idea so dont argue im not taking no for an answer wednesday pm march jack navigated his mountain bike between the two health and hospital corporation mortuary vans parked at the receiving bay at the medical examiners office and rode directly into the morgue under normal circumstances hed have dismounted by then and walked the bike but he was in too good a mood jack parked his bike by the hart island coffins locked it up then whistled on his way to the elevators he waved to sal dambrosio as he passed the mortuary office chet my boy how are you jack asked as he breezed into their shared fifthfloor office chet laid his pen down on his desk and turned to face his officemate the worlds been in here looking for you what have you been doing indulging myself jack said he peeled off his leather jacket and draped it over the back of his desk chair before sitting down he surveyed his row of files deciding which one to attack first his inbasket had a newly replenished pile of lab results and pa reports i wouldnt get too comfortable chet said one of those looking for you was bingham himself he told me to tell you to come directly to his office how nice jack said i was afraid hed forgotten about me i wouldnt be so flippant about it chet said bingham was not happy and calvin stopped by as well hed like to see you too and smoke was coming out of his ears undoubtedly hes eager to pay me my ten dollars jack said he got up from his desk and patted chet on the shoulder dont worry about me i have a strong survival instinct you could have fooled me chet said as jack descended in the elevator he was curious how bingham would handle the current situation since jack had started working at the mes office hed had only sporadic contact with the chief the daytoday administrative problems were all handled by calvin you can go right in mrs sanford said without even looking up from her typing jack wondered how she knew it was him close the door dr harold bingham commanded jack did as he was told binghams office was spacious with a large desk set back under high windows covered with ancient venetian blinds at the opposite end of the room was a library table with a teaching microscope a glassfronted bookcase lined the far wall sit down bingham said dutifully jack sat im not sure i understand you bingham said in his deep husky voice you apparently made a rather brilliant diagnosis of plague today and then foolishly took it upon yourself to call my boss the commissioner of health either you are a completely apolitical creature or you have a selfdestructive streak its probably a combination of the two jack said youre also impertinent bingham said thats part of the selfdestructive streak jack said on the positive side im honest he smiled bingham shook his head jack was testing his ability to control himself just so i can try to understand he said as he entwined the fingers of his shovellike hands did you not think that i would find it inappropriate for you to call the commissioner before talking with me chet mcgovern suggested as much jack said but i was more concerned about getting the word out ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure especially if were looking at a potential epidemic there was a moment of silence while bingham considered jacks statement which he had to admit contained a modicum of validity the second thing i wanted to discuss was your visit to the manhattan general frankly your decision to do this surprises me during your orientation i know you were told that our policy is to rely on our excellent pas to do site work you do remember that dont you certainly i remember jack said but i felt that the appearance of plague was unique enough to demand a unique response besides i was curious curious bingham blurted out he momentarily lost control thats the lamest excuse for ignoring established policy ive heard in years well there was more jack admitted knowing the general was an americare hospital i wanted to go over there and rub it in a little im not fond of americare what in heavens name do you have against americare bingham asked its a personal thing jack said would you care to elaborate bingham asked id rather not jack said its a long story suit yourself bingham said irritably but im not going to tolerate your going over there flashing your medical examiners badge for some personal vendetta thats an egregious misuse of official authority i thought our mandate was to get involved in anything that could affect public health jack said certainly a case of plague falls under that rubric indeed bingham pronounced but you had already alerted the commissioner of health she in turn alerted the city board of health who immediately dispatched the chief epidemiologist you had no business being over there much less causing trouble what kind of trouble did i cause jack asked you managed to irritate hell out of both the administrator and the city epidemiologist bingham roared both of them were mad enough to lodge official complaints the administrator called the mayors office and the epidemiologist called the commissioner both of these public servants can be considered my bosses and neither one of them was pleased and both of them let me know about it i was just trying to be helpful jack said innocently well do me a favor and dont try to be helpful bingham snapped instead i want you to stay around here where you belong and do the work you were hired to do calvin informed me that you have a lot of cases pending is that it jack asked when bingham paused for now bingham said jack got up and headed for the door one last thing bingham said remember that you are on probation for the first year ill keep that in mind jack said leaving binghams office jack passed mrs sanford and went directly across to calvin washingtons office the door was ajar calvin was busy at his microscope excuse me jack called out i understand you were looking for me calvin turned around and eyed jack have you been in to see the chief yet he growled just came from there jack said its reassuring to be in such demand around here dispense with your smartass talk calvin said what did dr bingham say jack told calvin what had been said and that bingham had concluded by reminding him that he was on probation damn straight calvin said i think youd better shape up or youll be out looking for work meanwhile i have one request jack said what is it calvin asked how about that ten dollars you owe me jack said calvin stared back at jack amazed that under the circumstances jack had the gall to ask for the money finally calvin rolled to the side in his seat withdrew his wallet and pulled out a tendollar bill ill get this back calvin vowed sure you will jack said as he took the bill with the money comfortably in his pocket jack returned upstairs to his office as he entered he was surprised to find laurie leaning against chets desk both she and chet looked at jack with expectant concern well chet questioned well what jack asked he squeezed by the others to plop down in his seat are you still employed chet asked seems that way jack said he started going through the lab reports in his inbasket youd better be careful laurie advised as she started for the door they can fire you at their pleasure during your first year so bingham reminded me jack said pausing at the threshold laurie turned back to face jack i almost got fired my first year she admitted jack looked up at her how come he asked it had to do with those challenging overdose cases i mentioned this morning laurie said unfortunately while i followed up on them i got on the wrong side of bingham is that part of that long story you alluded to jack asked thats the one laurie said i came this close to being fired she held up her thumb and index finger about a quarter inch apart it was all because i didnt take binghams threats seriously dont make the same mistake as soon as laurie had gone chet wanted a verbatim recounting of everything bingham had said jack related what he could remember including the part about the mayor and the commissioner of health calling bingham to complain about him the complaints were about you specifically chet asked apparently jack said and here i was being the good samaritan what in gods name did you do chet asked i was just being my usual diplomatic self jack said asking questions and offering suggestions youre crazy chet said you almost got yourself fired for what i mean what were you trying to prove i wasnt trying to prove anything jack said i dont understand you chet said that seems to be a universal opinion jack said all i know about you is that you were an ophthalmologist in a former life and you live in harlem to play street basketball what else do you do that about sums it up jack said apart from working here that is what do you do for fun chet asked i mean what kind of social life do you have i dont mean to pry but do you have a girlfriend no not really jack said are you gay nope ive just sorta been out of commission for a while well no wonder youre acting so weird i tell you what were going out tonight well have some dinner maybe have a few drinks theres a comfortable bar in the neighborhood where i live it will give us time to talk i havent felt like talking much about myself jack said all right you dont have to talk chet said but were going out i think you need some normal human contact whats normal jack questioned wednesday pm march chet turned out to be extraordinarily resolute no matter what jack said he insisted that they have dinner together finally jack relented and just before eight hed ridden his bike across central park to meet chet in an italian restaurant on second avenue after dinner chet had been equally insistent about jacks accompanying him for a few drinks feeling beholden to his officemate since chet had insisted on paying for the dinner jack had gone along now as they mounted the steps to the bar jack was having second thoughts for the past several years hed been in bed by ten and up by five at tenfifteen after a half bottle of wine he was fading fast im not sure im up for this jack said were already here chet complained come on in well just have one beer jack leaned back to look at the facade of the bar he didnt see a name whats this place called he asked the auction house chet said get your ass in here he was holding open the door to jack the interior looked vaguely like his grandmothers living room back in des moines iowa except for the mahogany bar itself the furniture was an odd mishmash of victorian and the drapes were long and droopy the high ceiling was brightly colored embossed tin how about sitting here chet suggested he pointed toward a small table set in the window overlooking eightyninth street jack complied from where he was sitting jack had a good view of the room which he now noted had a highgloss hardwood floor not the usual for a bar there were about fifty people in the room either standing at the bar or sitting on the couches they were all well dressed and appeared professional there was not one backward baseball cap in the group the mix was about even between male and female jack mused that perhaps chet had been right to have encouraged him to come out jack had not been in such a normal social environment in several years maybe it was good for him having become a loner carried its burdens he wondered what these attractive people were saying to one another as their easy conversations drifted back to him in a babble of voices the problem was he had zero confidence he could add to any of the discussions jacks eyes wandered to chet who was at the bar supposedly getting them each a beer actually he was in a conversation with a wellendowed longhaired blonde in a stylish sweatshirt over tight jeans accompanying her was a svelte woman in a revealingly simple dark suit she was not participating in the conversation preferring to concentrate on her glass of wine jack envied chets outgoing personality and the ease with which he indulged in social intercourse during dinner hed spoken of himself with utter ease among the things jack learned was that chet had recently broken off a longterm relationship with a pediatrician and hence was what he called in between and available while jack was eyeing his officemate chet turned toward him almost simultaneously the two women did the same and then they all laughed jack felt his face flush they were obviously talking about him chet broke away from the bar and headed in jacks direction jack wondered if he should flee or merely dig his fingernails into the tabletop it was obvious what was coming hey sport chet whispered he purposefully positioned himself directly between jack and the women see those two chicks at the bar he pointed into his own abdomen to shield the gesture from his new acquaintances what do you think pretty good huh theyre both knockouts and guess what they want to meet you chet this has been fun but jack began dont even think about it chet said dont let me down now im after the one in the sweatshirt sensing that resistance would have required considerably more energy than capitulation jack allowed himself to be dragged to the bar chet made the introductions jack could immediately see what chet saw in colleen she was chets equal in terms of blithe repartee terese on the other hand was a foil for them both after the introductions shed given jack a onceover with her pale blue eyes before turning back to the bar and her glass of wine chet and colleen fell into spirited conversation jack looked at the back of tereses head and wondered what the hell he was doing he wanted to be home in bed and instead he was being abused by someone as unsociable as himself chet jack called out after a few minutes this is a waste of time terese spun around waste of time for whom for me jack said he gazed curiously at the rawboned yet sensuously lipped woman standing in front of him he was taken aback by her vehemence what about for me terese snapped do you think its a rewarding experience to be pestered by men on the prowl wait just one tiny second jack said with his own ire rising dont flatter yourself i aint on the prowl you can be damn sure about that and if i were i sure wouldnt hey jack chet called out cool it you too terese colleen said relax were out here to enjoy ourselves i didnt say boo to this lady and shes jumping all over me jack explained you didnt have to say anything terese said calm down you guys chet stepped between jack and terese but eyed jack were out here for some normal contact with fellow human beings actually i think i should go home terese said youre staying right here colleen ordered she turned to chet shes wound up like a piano wire thats why i insisted she come out try to get her to relax shes consumed by her work sounds like jack here chet said he has some definite antisocial tendencies chet and colleen were talking as if jack and terese couldnt hear yet they were standing right next to them staring off in different directions both were irritated but both felt foolish at the same time chet and colleen got a round of drinks and handed them out as they continued to talk about their respective friends jacks social life revolves around living in a crack neighborhood and playing basketball with killers chet said at least he has a social life colleen said terese lives in a coop with a bunch of octogenarians going to the garbage chute is the high point of a sunday afternoon at home chet and colleen laughed heartily took long pulls on their respective beers and then launched into a conversation about a play both of them had seen on broadway jack and terese ventured a few fleeting looks at each other as they nursed their own drinks chet mentioned you were a doctor are you a specialist terese asked finally her tone had mellowed significantly jack explained about forensic pathology overhearing this part of the conversation chet joined in were in the presence of one of the futures best and brightest jack here made the diagnosis of the day against everyone elses impression he diagnosed a case of plague here in new york colleen asked with alarm at the manhattan general chet said my god terese exclaimed i was a patient there once plague is awfully rare isnt it most definitely jack said a few cases are reported each year in the us but they usually occur in the wilds of the west and during the summer months is it terribly contagious colleen asked it can be jack said especially in the pneumonic form which this patient had are you worried about having gotten it terese asked unconsciously she and colleen had moved a step backward no jack said and even if we had we wouldnt be communicative until after we got pneumonia so you dont have to stand across the room from us feeling embarrassed both women stepped closer is there any chance this could turn into an epidemic here in the city terese asked if plague bacteria has infected the urban rodent population particularly the rats and if there are adequate rat fleas it could develop into a problem in the ghetto areas of the city jack said but chances are it would be selflimited the last real outbreak of plague in the us occurred in and there were only twelve cases and that was before the antibiotic era i dont anticipate there is going to be a current epidemic especially since the manhattan general is taking the episode extremely seriously i trust you contacted the media about this case of plague terese said not me jack said thats not my job shouldnt the public be alerted terese asked i dont think so jack said by sensationalizing it the media could make things worse the mere mention of the word plague can evoke panic and panic would be counterproductive maybe terese said but i bet people would feel differently if there was a chance they could avoid coming down with plague if they were forewarned well the question is academic jack said theres no way that the media could avoid hearing about this itll be all over the news trust me lets change the subject chet said what about you guys what do you do were art directors in a relatively large ad agency colleen said at least im an art director terese was an art director now shes part of the front office shes creative director impressive chet said and in a strange way were currently tangentially involved with medicine she added what do you mean you are involved with medicine jack asked one of our big accounts is national health terese said i imagine youve heard of them unfortunately jack said his tone was flat you have a problem with our working with them terese asked probably jack said can i ask why im against advertising in medicine jack said especially the kind of advertising these new healthcare conglomerates are engaged in why terese asked first of all the ads have no legitimate function except to increase profits by expanding enrollment theyre nothing but exaggerations halftruths or the hyping of superficial amenities they have nothing to do with the quality of health care secondly the advertising costs a ton of money and its being lumped into administrative costs thats the real crime its taking money away from patient care are you finished terese asked i could probably think up some more reasons if i gave it some thought jack said i happen to disagree with you terese said with a fervor that matched jacks i think all advertising draws distinctions and fosters a competitive environment which ultimately benefits the consumer thats pure rationalization jack said time out you guys chet said stepping between jack and terese for the second time you two are getting out of control again lets switch the topic of conversation why dont we talk about something neutral like sex or religion colleen laughed and gave chet a playful swat on the shoulder im serious chet said while laughing with colleen lets discuss religion its been getting short shrift lately in bars lets have everybody tell what they grew up as ill be first for the next half hour they indeed did discuss religion and jack and terese forgot their emotional outburst they even found themselves laughing since chet was a raconteur of some wit at elevenfifteen jack happened to glance at his watch and did a double take he couldnt believe it was so late im sorry he said interrupting the conversation ive got to go ive got a bicycle ride ahead of me a bike terese questioned you ride a bike around this city hes got a death wish chet said where do you live terese asked upper west side jack said ask him how upper chet dared exactly where terese asked oneohsix a hundred and sixth street jack said to be precise but thats in harlem colleen said i told you he has a death wish chet said dont tell me youre going to ride across the park at this hour terese said i move pretty quickly jack said well i think its asking for trouble terese said she bent down and picked up her briefcase which shed set on the floor by her feet i dont have a bike but i do have a date with my bed wait a second you guys chet said colleen and i are in charge right colleen he put his arm loosely around colleens shoulder right colleen said to be agreeable weve decided chet said with feigned authority that you two cant go home unless you agree to have dinner tomorrow night colleen shook her head as she ducked away from chets arm im afraid were not available she said weve got an impossible deadline so well be putting in some serious overtime where were you thinking of having dinner terese asked colleen looked at her friend with surprise how about right around the corner at elaines chet said about eight oclock we might even see a couple of celebrities i dont think i can jack began im not listening to any excuses from you chet said interrupting you can bowl with that group of nuns another night tomorrow youre having dinner with us jack was too tired to think he shrugged its decided then chet said everyone nodded outside of the bar the women climbed into a cab they offered chet a ride home but he said he lived in the neighborhood are you sure you dont want to leave that bike here for the night terese asked jack whod finished removing his panoply of locks not a chance jack said he threw a leg over his bike and powered out across second avenue waving over his head terese gave the cabdriver the address of the first stop and the taxi made a left onto second avenue and accelerated southward colleen whod kept her eye on chet out the back window turned to face her boss what a surprise she said imagine meeting two decent men at a bar it always seems to happen when you least expect it they were nice guys terese agreed i suppose i was wrong about them being out at the meat market and thank god they didnt spout off about sports or the stock market generally thats all men in this city can talk about what tweaks my funny bone is that my mother has forever been encouraging me to meet a doctor colleen said with a laugh i dont think either one of them is a typical doctor terese said especially jack hes got a strange attitude hes awfully bitter about something and seems a bit foolhardy can you imagine riding a bike around this city its easier than thinking about what they do can you imagine dealing with dead people all day i dont know terese said mustnt be too different than dealing with account executives i have to say you shocked me when you agreed to have dinner tomorrow night colleen said especially with this national health disaster staring us in the face but thats exactly why i did agree terese said she flashed colleen a conspiratorial smile i want to talk some more with jack stapleton believe it or not he actually gave me a great idea for a new ad campaign for national health i cant imagine what his reaction would be if he knew with his philistine attitude about advertising hed probably have a stroke whats the idea colleen asked eagerly it involves this plague thing terese said since americare is national healths only real rival our ad campaign merely has to take advantage of the fact that americare got plague in its main hospital as creepy as the situation is people should want to flock to national health colleens face fell we cant use plague she said hell im not thinking of using plague specifically terese said just emphasizing the idea of national healths hospital being so new and clean the contrary will be evoked by inference and it will be the public who will make the association with this plague episode i know what the manhattan general is like ive been there it might have been renovated but its still an old structure the national health hospital is the antithesis i can see ads where people are eating off the floor at national health suggesting its that clean i mean people like the idea that their hospital is new and clean especially now with all the hullabaloo about bacteria making a comeback and becoming antibioticresistant i like it colleen said if that doesnt increase national health cares market share visàvis americare nothing will i even have thought up a tag line terese said smugly listen we deserve your trust health is our middle name excellent i love it colleen exclaimed ill get the whole team working on it bright and early the cab pulled up to tereses apartment the women did a highfive before terese got out leaning back into the cab terese said thanks for getting me to go out tonight it was a good idea for lots of reasons youre welcome colleen said flashing a thumbsup sign thursday am march as a man of habit jack arrived in the vicinity of the medical examiners office at the same time each day give or take five minutes this particular morning he was ten minutes late since hed awakened with a slight hangover hed not had a hangover in so long hed completely forgotten how miserable it made him feel consequently hed stayed in the shower a few minutes longer than usual and on the slalom down second avenue hed kept his speed to a more reasonable level crossing first avenue jack saw something hed never seen before at that time of day there was a tv truck with its main antennae extended sitting in front of the medical examiners building changing his direction a little he cruised around the truck no one was in it looking up at the front door to the mes office he saw a group of newspeople clustered just over the threshold curious as to what was going on jack hustled around to the entrance bay stashed his bike in the usual place and went up to the id room as usual laurie and vinnie were in their respective seats jack said hello but continued through the room to peek out into the lobby area it was as crowded as hed ever seen it what the hells going on jack asked turning back to laurie you of all people should know she said she was busy making up the days autopsy schedule its all about the plague epidemic epidemic jack questioned have there been more cases you havent heard laurie questioned dont you watch morning tv i dont have a tv jack admitted in my neighborhood owning one is just inviting trouble well two victims came in to us during the night laurie said one is for sure plague or at least presumptive since the hospital did its own fluorescein antibody and it was positive the other is suspected since clinically it seemed to be plague despite a negative fluorescein antibody in addition to that as i understand it there are several febrile patients who have been quarantined this is all happening at the manhattan general jack asked apparently laurie said were these cases direct contacts with nodelman jack asked i havent had time to look into that laurie said are you interested if you are ill assign them to you of course jack said which one is the presumptive plague katherine mueller laurie said she pushed the patients folder toward jack sitting on the edge of the desk where laurie was working jack opened the folder he leafed through the papers until he found the investigative report he pulled it out and began reading he learned the woman had been brought into the manhattan general emergency room at four oclock in the afternoon acutely ill with what was diagnosed to be a fulminant case of plague shed died nine hours later despite massive antibiotics jack checked on the womans place of employment and wasnt surprised with what he learned the woman worked at the manhattan general jack assumed she had to have been a direct contact of nodelman unfortunately the report did not indicate in what department she worked jack guessed either nursing or lab reading on in the report jack silently complimented janice jaegers work after the conversation hed had with her the day before by phone she added information about travel pets and visitors in the case of mueller it was all negative wheres the suspected plague jack asked laurie laurie pushed a second folder toward him jack opened the second file and was immediately surprised the victim neither worked at the manhattan general nor had obvious contact with nodelman her name was susanne hard like nodelman shed been a patient in the general but not on the same ward as nodelman hard had been on the obgyn ward after giving birth jack was mystified reading further jack learned that hard had been in the hospital for twentyfour hours when shed experienced sudden high fever myalgia headache overwhelming malaise and progressive cough these symptoms had come on about eighteen hours after undergoing a cesarean section during which she delivered a healthy child eight hours after the symptoms appeared the patient was dead out of curiosity jack looked up hards address remembering that nodelman had lived in the bronx but hard had not lived in the bronx she had lived in manhattan on sutton place south hardly a ghetto neighborhood reading on jack learned that hard had not traveled since shed become pregnant as far as pets were concerned she owned an elderly but healthy poodle concerning visitors she had entertained a business associate of her husbands from india three weeks previously who was described as being healthy and well is janice jaeger still here this morning jack asked laurie she was about fifteen minutes ago when i passed her office laurie said jack found janice where shed been the previous morning you are a dedicated civil servant jack called out from the threshold janice looked up from her work her eyes were red from fatigue too many people dying lately im swamped but tell me did i ask the right questions on the infectious cases last night absolutely jack said i was impressed but i do have a couple more shoot janice said wheres the obgyn ward in relation to the medical ward theyre right next to each other janice said both are on the seventh floor no kidding jack said is that significant janice asked i havent the slightest idea jack admitted do patients from the ob ward mix with those on the medical ward you got me there janice admitted i dont know but i wouldnt imagine so nor would i jack said but if they didnt then how did susanne hard manage to get sick something seemed screwy about this plague outbreak facetiously he wondered if a bunch of infected rats could be living in the ventilation system on the seventh floor any other questions janice asked i want to get out of here and i have this last report to finish one more jack said you indicated that katherine mueller was employed by the general but you didnt say for what department do you know if she worked for nursing or for the lab janice leafed through her nights notes and came up with the sheet on which shed recorded muellers information she quickly glanced through it and then looked back up at jack neither she said she worked in central supply oh come on jack said he sounded disappointed im sorry janice said thats what i was told im not blaming you jack said with a wave of his hand its just that id like there to be some sort of logic to all this how would a woman in central supply get into contact with a sick patient on the seventh floor wheres central supply i believe its on the same floor with the operating rooms janice said that would be the third floor okay thanks jack said now get out of here and get some sleep i intend to janice said jack wandered back toward the id room thinking that nothing seemed to be making much sense usually the course of a contagious illness could be easily plotted sequentially through a family or a community there was the index case and the subsequent cases extended from it by contact either directly or through a vector like an insect there wasnt a lot of mystery that wasnt the case so far with this plague outbreak the only unifying factor was that they all involved the manhattan general jack absently waved to sergeant murphy whod apparently just arrived in his cubbyhole office off the communications room the ebullient irish policeman waved back with great enthusiasm jack slowed his walk while his mind churned susanne hard had come down with symptoms after only being in the hospital for a day since the incubation period for plague was generally thought to be two days at a minimum she would have been exposed prior to coming into the hospital jack went back to janices office one more question jack called out to her do you happen to know whether the hard woman visited the hospital in the days prior to her admission her husband said no janice said i asked that question specifically apparently she hated the hospital and only came in at the very last minute jack nodded thanks he said even more preoccupied he turned and started back toward the id room that information made the situation more baffling requiring him to postulate that the outbreak had occurred almost simultaneously in two maybe three locations that wasnt probable the other possibility was that the incubation period was extremely short less than twentyfour hours that would mean hards illness was a nosocomial infection as he suspected nodelmans was as well as muellers the problem with that idea was that it would suggest a huge overwhelming infecting dose which also seemed unlikely after all how many sick rats could be in a ventilation duct all coughing at the same time in the id room jack wrestled the sports page of the daily news away from a reluctant vinnie and dragged him down to the pit to begin the day how come you always start so early vinnie complained youre the only one dont you have a life jack swatted him in the chest with katherine muellers folder remember the saying the early bird gets the worm oh barf vinnie said he took the folder from jack and opened it is this the one were doing first he asked might as well move from the known to the unknown jack said this one had a positive fluorescein antibody test to plague so zip up tight in your moon suit fifteen minutes later jack began the autopsy he spent a good deal of time on the external exam looking for any signs of insect bites it wasnt an easy job since katherine mueller was an overweight fortyfouryearold with hundreds of moles freckles and other minor skin blemishes jack found nothing he was sure was a bite although a few lesions looked mildly suspicious to be on the safe side he photographed them no gangrene on this body vinnie commented nor purpura jack said by the time jack started on the internal exam a number of the other staff had arrived in the autopsy room and half of the tables were in use there were a few comments about jack becoming the local plague expert but jack ignored them he was too engrossed muellers lungs appeared quite similar to nodelmans with extensive lobar pneumonia consolidation and early stages of tissue death the womans cervical lymphatics were also generally involved as were the lymph nodes along the bronchial tree this is just as bad or worse than nodelman jack said its frightening you dont have to tell me vinnie said these infectious cases are the kind that make me wish id gone into gardening jack was nearing the end of the internal exam when calvin came through the door there was no mistaking his huge silhouette he was accompanied by another figure who was half his size calvin came directly to jacks table anything out of the ordinary calvin asked while peering into the pan of internal organs internally this case is a repeat of yesterdays jack said good calvin said straightening up he then introduced jack to his guest it was clint abelard the city epidemiologist jack could make out the mans prominent jaw but because of the reflection off the plastic face mask he couldnt see the fellows squirrelly eyes he wondered if he was still as cantankerous as hed been the day before according to dr bingham you two have already met calvin said indeed jack said the epidemiologist did not respond dr abelard is trying to discern the origin of this plague outbreak calvin explained commendable jack said hes come to us to see if we can add any significant information calvin said perhaps you could run through your positive findings my pleasure jack said he started with the external exam indicating skin abnormalities he thought could have been insect bites then he showed all the gross internal pathology concentrating on the lungs lymphatics liver and spleen throughout the entire discourse clint abelard stayed silent there you have it jack said as he finished he put the liver back into the pan as you can see its a severe case as was nodelmans and its no wonder both patients died so quickly what about hard clint asked shes next jack said mind if i watch clint asked jack shrugged thats up to dr washington he said no problem calvin said if i may ask jack said have you come up with a theory where this plague came from not really clint said gruffly not yet any ideas jack asked trying to keep sarcasm out of his voice it seemed clint was in no better humor than he had been the day before were looking for plague in the areas rodent population clint said condescendingly splendid idea jack said and just how are you doing that clint paused as if he didnt want to divulge any state secrets the cdc is helping he said finally they sent someone up here from their plague division hes in charge of the trapping and analysis any luck so far jack asked some of the rats caught last night were ill clint said but none with plague what about the hospital jack asked he persisted despite clints apparent reluctance to talk this woman weve just autopsied worked in central supply seems likely her illness was nosocomial like nodelmans do you think she got it from some primary source in and around the hospital or do you think she got it from nodelman we dont know clint admitted if she got it from nodelman jack asked any ideas of a possible route of transmission weve checked the hospitals ventilation and airconditioning system carefully clint said all the hepa filters were in place and had been changed appropriately what about the lab situation jack asked what do you mean clint said did you know that the chief tech in micro actually suggested plague to the director of the lab purely from his clinical impression but the director talked him out of following up on it i didnt know that clint mumbled if the chief tech had followed up on it he would have made the diagnosis and appropriate therapy could have been started jack said who knows it could have saved a life the problem is that the lab has been downsizing because of pressure from americare to save a few bucks and they dont have a microbiology supervisor position it got eliminated i dont know anything about all that clint said besides the case of plague still would have occurred youre right jack said one way or the other you still have to come up with the origin unfortunately you dont know any more than you did yesterday jack smiled inside his mask he was getting a bit of perverse pleasure out of putting the epidemiologist on the spot i wouldnt go that far clint muttered any sign of illness in the hospital staff jack asked there are several nurses who are febrile and who are quarantined clint said as of yet there is no confirmation of them having plague but it is suspected they were directly exposed to nodelman when will you be doing hard calvin asked in about twenty minutes jack said as soon as vinnie gets things turned around im going around to check on some other cases calvin said to clint you want to stay here with dr stapleton or do you want to come with me i think ill go with you if you dont mind clint said by the way jack calvin said before leaving theres a bevy of media people upstairs crawling all over the outer office like bloodhounds i dont want you giving any unauthorized press conferences any information coming from the mes office comes from mrs donnatello and her pr assistant i wouldnt dream of talking to the press jack assured him calvin wandered to the next table clint stayed at his heels it didnt sound as if that guy wanted to talk with you vinnie said to jack when calvin and clint were far enough away not that i can blame him that little mouse has been spleeny since i first met him jack said i dont know what his problem is hes kinda a weird duck if you ask me now theres the pot calling the kettle black vinnie said thursday am march new york city mr lagenthorpe can you hear me dr doyle called to his patient donald lagenthorpe was a thirtyeightyearold africanamerican oil engineer who had a chronic problem with asthma that morning just after three am hed awakened with progressive difficulty breathing his prescribed home remedies had not interrupted the attack and hed come into the emergency room of the manhattan general at four dr doyle had been called at quarter to five after the usual emergency medications had had no effect donalds eyes blinked open he hadnt been sleeping just trying to rest the ordeal had been exhausting and frightening the feeling of not being able to catch his breath was torture and this episode had been the worst hed ever experienced how are you doing dr doyle inquired i know what you have been through you must be very tired dr doyle was one of those rare physicians who were able to empathize with all his patients with a depth of understanding suggesting he suffered from all the same conditions donald nodded his head indicating that he was okay he was breathing through a face mask that made conversation difficult i want you to stay in the hospital for a few days dr doyle said this was a difficult attack to break donald nodded again no one had to tell him that i want to keep you on the iv steroids for a little while longer dr doyle explained donald lifted the face mask off his face couldnt i get the steroids at home he suggested as thankful as he was about the hospitals having been there in his hour of need he much preferred the idea of going home now that his breathing had returned to normal at home he knew he could at least get some work done as was always the case this asthma attack had come at a particularly inconvenient time he was supposed to go back to texas the following week for more fieldwork i know you dont want to be in the hospital dr doyle said id feel the same way but i think it is best under the circumstances well get you out just as soon as possible not only do i want to continue giving you iv steroids but i want you breathing humidified clean nonirritating air i also want to follow your peak expiratory flow rate carefully as i explained to you earlier it is still not completely back to normal how many days do you estimate ill have to be in here donald asked im sure it will only be a couple dr doyle said ive got to go back to texas donald explained oh dr doyle said when were you there last just last week donald said hmm dr doyle said while he thought were you exposed to anything abnormal while you were there just texmex cuisine donald said managing a smile you havent gotten any new pets or anything like that have you dr doyle asked one of the difficulties of managing someone with chronic asthma was determining the factors responsible for triggering attacks frequently it was allergenic my girlfriend got a new cat donald said it has made me itch a bit the last few times ive been over there when was the last time dr doyle asked last night donald admitted but i was home just a little after eleven and i felt fine i didnt have any trouble falling asleep well have to look into it dr doyle said meanwhile i want you in the hospital what do you say youre the doctor donald said reluctantly thank you dr doyle said thursday am march for chrissake jack murmured under his breath as he was about to start the autopsy on susanne hard clint abelard was hovering behind him like a gnat constantly switching his weight from one leg to the other clint why dont you step around the table and stand on the other side jack suggested youll be able to see much better clint took the suggestion and stood with his arms behind his back opposite from jack now dont move jack mumbled to himself jack didnt like clint hanging around but he had no choice its sad when you see a young woman like this clint said suddenly jack looked up he hadnt expected such a comment from clint it seemed too human he had struck jack as an unfeeling moody bureaucrat how old is she clint asked twentyeight vinnie said from the head of the table from the looks of her spine she didnt have an easy life clint said she had several major back surgeries jack said its a double tragedy since shed just given birth clint said now the child is motherless it was her second child vinnie said i suppose i shouldnt forget her husband clint said it must be upsetting to lose your spouse a knifelike stab of emotion went down jacks spine he had to fight to keep from reaching across the table and yanking clint off his feet abruptly he left the table and exited to the washroom he heard vinnie call after him but he ignored him instead jack leaned on the edge of the sink and tried to calm himself he knew that getting angry with clint was an unreasonable reaction it was nothing but pure unadulterated transference but understanding the origin did not lessen the irritation it always irked jack when he heard such clichés from people who truly had no idea is there a problem vinnie asked hed stuck his head through the door ill be there in a second jack said vinnie let the door close as long as he was there jack washed and regloved his hands when he was finished he returned to the table lets get this show on the road he said ive looked the body over clint said i dont see anything that looks like an insect bite do you jack had to restrain himself from subjecting clint to a lecture like the one clint had given to him instead he merely proceeded with his external exam only after hed finished did he speak no gangrene no purpura and no insect bites as far as i can see jack said but by just looking at her i can see some of her cervical lymph nodes are swollen jack pointed out the finding to clint who then nodded in agreement thats certainly consistent with plague clint said jack didnt answer instead he took a scalpel from vinnie and quickly made the typical yshaped autopsy incision the bold cruelty of the move jolted clint he took a step back jack worked quickly but with great care he knew that the less the internal organs were disturbed the less chance that any of the infecting microbes would be aerosolized when jack had the organs out he turned his attention first to the lungs calvin had drifted over at this point and towered behind jack as he made his initial cuts into the obviously diseased organ jack spread open the lung like a butterfly lots of bronchopneumonia and early tissue necrosis calvin said looks pretty similar to nodelman i dont know jack said seems to me there is an equal amount of pathology but less consolidation and look at these nodal areas they almost look like early granulomas with caseation clint listened to this pathological jargon with little interest or comprehension he remembered the terms from medical school but had long since forgotten their meaning does it look like plague he asked consistent calvin said lets look at the liver and the spleen jack carefully pulled these organs from the pan and sliced into them as hed done with the lung he spread open their cut surfaces so everyone could see even laurie had stepped over from her table lots of necrosis jack said certainly just as virulent a case as with nodelman or with the case i did earlier looks like plague to me calvin said but why was the fluorescein antibody negative jack said thats telling me something especially combined with the lung appearance whats with the lungs laurie asked jack moved the liver and the spleen aside and showed laurie the cut surface of the lung he explained what he thought of the pathology i see what you mean now that you mention it laurie said it is different from nodelman his lungs definitely had more consolidation this looks more like some sort of horribly aggressive tb whoa calvin said this isnt tb no way i dont think laurie was suggesting it was jack said i wasnt laurie agreed i was just using tb as a way of describing these infected areas i think it is plague calvin said i mean i wouldnt if we hadnt just had a case from the same hospital yesterday chances are it is plague regardless of what their lab said i dont think it is jack said but lets see what our lab says how about double or nothing with that ten dollars calvin said are you that sure no but ill take you up on it i know how much the money means to you are we finished here clint asked if so i think ill be going im essentially finished jack said ill do a little more on the lymphatics and then ill be obtaining samples for the microscopic you wont be missing anything if you take off now ill head out with you calvin said calvin and clint disappeared through the door to the washroom if you dont think this case is plague what do you think it is laurie asked looking back at the womans corpse im embarrassed to tell you jack said come on laurie urged i wont tell anybody jack looked at vinnie vinnie held up his hands my lips are sealed well id have to fall back on my original differential i had for nodelman jack said to narrow it down more than that i have to again go out on thin ice if it isnt plague the nearest infectious disease both pathologically and clinically is tularemia laurie laughed tularemia in a twentyeightyearold postpartum female in manhattan she questioned that would be pretty rare although not as rare as your diagnosis yesterday of plague after all she could have a hobby of rabbit hunting on weekends i know its not very probable jack said once again im relying totally on the pathology and the fact that the test for plague was negative id be willing to bet a quarter laurie said such a spender jack joked fine well bet a quarter laurie returned to her own case jack and vinnie turned their attention back to susanne hard while vinnie did his tasks jack finished the lymphatic dissection he wanted to do then took the tissue samples he felt appropriate for microscopic study when the samples were all in the proper preservatives and appropriately labeled he helped vinnie suture the corpse leaving the autopsy room jack properly dealt with his isolation equipment after plugging in his rechargeable ventilator battery he took the elevator up to the third floor to see agnes finn he found her sitting in front of a stack of petri dishes examining bacterial cultures ive just finished another infectious case thats suspected plague he told her all the samples will be coming up shortly but there is a problem the lab over at the manhattan general claims the patient tested negative of course i want to repeat that but at the same time i want you to rule out tularemia and i want it done as quickly as possible thats not easy she said handling francisella tularensis is hazardous its very contagious to laboratory workers if it gets into the air there is a fluorescein antibody stain for tularemia but we dont have it how do you make the diagnosis then jack asked we have to send any samples out she said because of the risk of handling the bacteria the reagents are generally kept only at reference labs where the personnel are accustomed to dealing with the microbe there is such a lab here in the city can you send it right away jack asked well messenger it over as soon as it gets here she said if i call and put a rush on it well have a preliminary result in less than twentyfour hours perfect jack said ill be waiting ive got ten dollars and twentyfive cents riding on the outcome agnes gave jack a look he considered explaining but feared hed sound even more foolish instead he fled upstairs to his office thursday am march new york city im liking it more and more terese said she straightened up from colleens drawing board colleen was showing her tissues that her team had comped up just that morning using the theme theyd discussed the night before the best thing is that the concept is consistent with the hippocratic oath colleen said particularly the part about never doing harm to anyone i love it i dont know why we didnt think about it before terese said its such a natural its almost embarrassing that it took this damn plague epidemic to make us think of it did you catch whats happening on morning tv three deaths colleen said and several people sick its terrible in fact it scares me to death i had a headache from the wine last night when i woke up this morning terese said the first thing that went through my mind was whether i had the plague or not i thought the same thing colleen said im glad you admitted it i was too embarrassed i hope to hell those guys were right last night terese said they seemed pretty damn confident it wasnt going to be a big problem are you worried being around them colleen asked oh its gone through my mind terese admitted but as i said they were so confident i cant imagine their acting that way if there were any risk are we still on for dinner tonight colleen asked by all means terese said i have a sneaking suspicion that jack stapleton will turn out to be an unknowing fountain of ad ideas he might be bitter about something but hes sharp and opinionated and he certainly knows the business i cant believe how well this is working out colleen said i was a lot more drawn to chet hes fun and open and easy to talk with i have enough problems of my own so im not attracted to the anguished brooding type i didnt say anything about being attracted to jack stapleton terese said thats something else entirely whats your gut reaction to this idea of using hippocrates himself in one of our ads i think it has fantastic potential terese said run with it meanwhile im going to head upstairs and talk with helen robinson why colleen asked i thought she was the enemy im taking to heart taylors admonition that we creatives and the account people should work together terese said breezily yeah sure likely story seriously terese said theres something id like her to do i need a fifth column i want helen to confirm that national health is clean when it comes to nosocomial or hospitalbased infections if their record is atrocious the whole campaign could backfire then not only would i lose my bid for the presidency but you and i would probably be out selling pencils wouldnt we have heard by this time colleen asked i mean theyve been clients for a number of years i doubt it terese said these healthcare giants are loath to publicize anything that might adversely affect their stock price surely a bad record in regard to nosocomial infections would do that terese gave colleen a pat on the shoulder and told her to keep cracking the whip then headed for the stairwell terese emerged breathless onto the administrative floor having taken the stairs two at a time from there she marched directly toward the carpeted realm of the account executives her mood was soaring it was the absolute antithesis of the anxiety and dread of the day before her intuition told her she was onto something big with national health and would soon be scoring a deserved triumph as soon as the impromptu meeting with terese had ended and terese had disappeared around the corner helen returned to her desk and put a call in to her main contact at national health care the woman wasnt immediately available but helen didnt expect her to be helen merely left her name and number with a request to be called as soon as possible with the call accomplished helen took a brush from her desk and ran it through her hair several times in front of a small mirror on the inside of her closet door once she was satisfied with her appearance she walked out of her office and headed down to robert barkers you have a minute helen called to him from his open door for you i have all day robert said he leaned back in his chair helen stepped into the room and turned to close the door as she did so robert surreptitiously turned over the photo of his wife that stood on the corner of the desk his wifes stern stare made him feel guilty whenever helen was in his office i just had a visitor helen said as she came into the room as was her custom she sat crosslegged on the arm of one of the two chairs facing roberts desk robert felt perspiration appear along his hairline in keeping with his quickening pulse from his vantage point helens short skirt afforded him a view of her thigh that didnt stop it was our creative director helen continued she was very conscious of the effect she was having on her boss and it pleased her she asked me to get some information for her what kind of information robert asked his eyes didnt move nor did he blink it was as if he were hypnotized helen explained what terese wanted and described the brief conversation about the plague outbreak when robert didnt respond immediately she stood up that broke the trance i tried to tell her not to use it as the basis of an ad campaign helen added but she thinks its going to work maybe you shouldnt have said anything robert remarked he loosened his shirt and took a breath but its a terrible idea helen said i couldnt think of anything more tasteless exactly robert said id like her to propose a tasteless campaign i see your point helen said i didnt think of that on the spur of the moment of course not robert said youre not as devious as i am but youre a quick study the problem with the idea about nosocomial infection in general is that it could be a good one there might possibly be a legitimate difference between national health and americare i could always tell her the information wasnt available helen said after all it might not be there is always risk in lying robert said she might already have the information and be testing us to make us look bad no go ahead and see what you can find out but let me know what you learn and what you pass on to terese hagen i want to keep a step ahead of her thursday pm march hey sport how the hell are you chet asked jack as jack scooted into their shared office and dumped several folders onto his cluttered desk couldnt be better jack said thursday had been a paper day for chet meaning hed been at his desk and not in the autopsy room generally the associate medical examiners only did autopsies three days a week the other days they spent collating the voluminous paperwork necessary to sign out a case there was always material that needed to be gathered from pa investigators the lab the hospital or local doctors or the police plus each doctor had to read the microscopic slides the histology lab processed on every case jack sat down and pushed some of the paper debris away from the center of the desk to give him some room to work you feel all right this morning chet asked a little wobbly jack admitted he rescued his phone from beneath lab reports then he opened up one of the folders hed just brought in with him and began searching through the contents and you perfect chet said but im accustomed to a little wine and such remembering those chicks helped particularly colleen hey we still on for tonight i was going to talk to you about that jack said you promised chet said i didnt exactly promise jack said come on chet pleaded dont let me down theyre expecting both of us they might not stay if only i show up jack glanced over at his officemate come on chet repeated please all right for chrissake jack said just this once but i truly dont understand why you think you need me you do fine by yourself thanks buddy chet said i owe you one jack found the id sheet that had the phone numbers for maurice hard susannes husband there was both a home number and an office number he dialed the home who you calling chet asked you are a nosy bastard jack said jokingly ive got to watch over you so you dont get yourself fired chet said im calling the spouse of another curious infectious case jack said i just did the post and its got me bewildered clinically it looked like plague but i dont think it was a housekeeper picked up the phone when jack asked for mr hard he was told mr hard was at the office jack dialed the second number this time it was answered by a secretary jack had to explain who he was and was then put on hold im amazed jack said to chet his hand over the receiver the mans wife just died and hes at work only in america maurice hard came on the line his voice was strained he was obviously under great stress jack was tempted to tell the man he knew something of what he was feeling but something made him hold back instead he explained who he was and why he was calling do you think i should talk to my lawyer first maurice asked lawyer why your lawyer my wifes family is making ridiculous accusations maurice said theyre suggesting i had something to do with susannes death theyre crazy rich but crazy i mean susanne and i had our ups and downs but we never would have hurt each other no way do they know your wife died of an infectious disease jack questioned ive tried to tell them maurice said i dont know what to say jack said its really not my position to advise you about your personal legal situation well hell go ahead and ask your questions maurice said i cant imagine it would make any difference but let me ask you a question first was it plague that still has not been determined jack said but ill call you as soon as we know for sure id appreciate that maurice said now what are your questions i believe you have a dog jack said is the dog healthy for a seventeenyearold dog hes healthy maurice said id like to encourage you to take the pet to your vet and explain that your wife died of a serious infectious disease i want to be sure the dog isnt carrying the illness whatever it was is there a chance of that maurice asked with alarm its small but there is a chance jack said why didnt the hospital tell me that he demanded that i cant answer jack said i assume they talked to you about taking antibiotics yeah ive already started maurice said but it bums me out about the dog i should have been informed theres also the issue of travel jack said i was told your wife didnt do any recent traveling thats right maurice said she was pretty uncomfortable with her pregnancy especially with her back problem we havent gone anywhere except to our house up in connecticut when was the last visit to connecticut jack asked about a week and a half ago maurice said she liked it up there is it rural jack asked seventy acres of fields and forest land maurice said proudly beautiful spot we have our own pond did your wife ever go out into the woods jack asked all the time maurice said that was her main enjoyment she liked to feed the deer and the rabbits were there many rabbits jack asked you know rabbits maurice said every time we went up there there were more of them i actually thought they were a pain in the neck in the spring and summer they ate all the goddamn flowers any problem with rats not that i know of maurice said are you sure this is all significant we never know jack said what about your visitor from india that was mr svinashan maurice said hes a business acquaintance from bombay he stayed with us for almost a week hmm jack said remembering the plague outbreak in in bombay as far as you know hes healthy and well as far as i know maurice said how about giving him a call jack suggested if hes been sick let me know no problem maurice said you dont think he could have been involved do you after all his visit was three weeks ago this episode has baffled me jack admitted im not ruling anything out what about donald nodelman did you or your wife know him whos he maurice asked he was the first victim in this plague outbreak jack said he was a patient in the manhattan general id be curious if your wife might have visited him he was on the same floor in obgyn maurice questioned with surprise he was on the medical ward on the opposite side of the building he was in the hospital for diabetes where did he live the bronx jack said i doubt it maurice said we dont know anyone from the bronx one last question jack said did your wife happen to visit the hospital during the week prior to her admission she hated hospitals maurice said it was difficult to get her to go even when she was in labor jack thanked maurice and hung up now who are you calling chet asked as jack dialed again the husband of my first case this morning jack said at least we know this case had plague for sure why dont you let the pas make these calls chet asked because i cant tell them what to ask jack said i dont know what im looking for i just have this suspicion that there is some missing piece of information also im just plain interested the more i think about this episode of plague in new york in march the more unique i think it is mr harry mueller was a far cry from mr maurice hard he was devastated by his loss and had trouble speaking despite a professed willingness to be cooperative not wishing to add to the mans burden jack tried to be quick after corroborating janices report of no pets or travel and no recent visitors jack went through the same questions concerning donald nodelman as he had with maurice im certain my wife did not know this individual harry said and she rarely met any patients directly especially sick patients did your wife work in central supply for a long time jack asked twentyone years harry said did she ever come down with any illness that she thought shed contracted at the hospital jack asked maybe if one of her coworkers had a cold harry said but nothing more than that thank you mr mueller jack said youve been most kind katherine would have wanted me to help harry said she was a good person jack hung up the phone but left his hands drumming on the receiver he was agitated nobody including me has any idea what the hell is going on here he said true chet said but its not your worry the cavalry has already arrived i heard that the city epidemiologist was over here observing this morning he was here all right jack said but it was in desperation that little twerp hasnt the foggiest notion of whats going on if it werent for the cdcs sending someone up here from atlanta nothing would be happening at least someones out there trapping rats and looking for a reservoir suddenly jack pushed back from the desk got up and pulled on his bomber jacket uhoh chet said i sense trouble where are you going im heading back to the general jack said my gut sense tells me the missing information is over there at the hospital and by god im going to find it what about bingham chet said nervously cover for me jack said if im late for thursday conference tell him jack paused as he tried to think up some appropriate excuse but nothing came to mind oh screw it he said i wont be that long ill be back way before conference if anybody calls tell them im in the john ignoring further pleas to reconsider jack left and rode uptown he arrived in less than fifteen minutes and locked his bike to the same signpost as the day before the first thing jack did was take the hospital elevator up to the seventh floor and reconnoiter he saw how the obgyn and medical wards were completely separate without sharing any common facilities like lounges or lavatories he also saw that the ventilation system was designed so as to preclude any movement of air from one ward to the other pushing through the swinging doors into the obgyn area jack walked down to the central desk excuse me he said to a ward secretary does this ward share any personnel with the medical ward across the elevator lobby no not that i know of the young man said he looked about fifteen with a complexion that suggested he had yet to shave except of course cleaning people but they clean all over the hospital good point jack said he hadnt thought of the housekeeping department it was something to consider jack then asked which room susanne hard had occupied can i ask what this is in reference to the ward clerk asked he had finally noticed that jack was not wearing a hospital id hospitals all require identification badges of their employees but then frequently do not have the personnel to enforce compliance jack took out his mes badge and flashed it it had the desired effect the ward secretary told jack that mrs hard had been in room jack started out for the room but the ward clerk called out to him that it was quarantined and temporarily sealed believing that viewing the room would not have been enlightening anyway jack left the seventh floor and descended to the third which housed the surgical suites the recovery room the intensivecare units and central supply it was a busy area with a lot of patient traffic jack pushed through a pair of swinging doors into central supply and was confronted by an unmanned counter beyond the counter was an immense maze of floortoceiling metal shelving laden with all the sundry equipment and supplies needed by a large busy hospital in and out of the maze moved a team of people attired in scrubs white coats and hats that looked like shower caps a radio played somewhere in the distance after jack had stood at the counter for a few minutes a robust and vigorous woman caught sight of him and came over her name tag said gladys zarelli supervisor she asked if he needed some help i wanted to inquire about katherine mueller jack said god rest her soul gladys said she made the sign of the cross it was a terrible thing jack introduced himself by displaying his badge then questioned whether she and her coworkers were concerned that katherine had died of an infectious disease of course were concerned she said who wouldnt be we all work closely with one another but what can you do at least the hospital is concerned as well they have us all on antibiotics and thank god no one is sick has anything like this ever happened before jack asked what i mean is a patient died of plague just the day before katherine that suggests that katherine could very well have caught it here at the hospital i dont mean to scare you but those are the facts were all aware of it gladys said but its never happened before i imagine its happened in nursing but not here in central supply do you people have any patient contact jack asked not really gladys said occasionally we might run up to the wards but its never to see a patient directly what was katherine doing the week before she died jack asked ill have to look that up gladys said she motioned for jack to follow her she led jack into a tiny windowless office where she cracked open a large clothbound daily ledger assignments are never too strict gladys said her finger ran down a row of names we all kinda pitch in as needed but i give some basic responsibility to some of the more senior people her finger stopped then moved across the page okay katherine was more or less in charge of supplies to the wards what does that mean jack asked whatever they needed gladys said everything except drugs and that sort of stuff that comes from pharmacy you mean like things for the patients rooms jack asked sure for the rooms for the nurses station everything gladys said this is where it all comes from without us the hospital would grind to a halt in twentyfour hours give me an example of the things you deal with for the rooms jack said im telling you everything gladys said with a touch of irritation in her voice bedpans thermometers humidifiers pillows pitchers soap everything you wouldnt have any record of katherine going up to the seventh floor during the last week or so would you no gladys said we dont keep records like that i could print out for you everything sent up there though that we have a record of okay jack said ill take what i can get its going to be a lot of stuff gladys warned as she made an entry into her computer terminal do you want obgyn or medical or both she asked medical jack said gladys nodded pecked at a few more keys on her terminal and soon her printer was cranking away in a few minutes she handed jack a stack of papers he glanced through them as gladys had suggested there were a lot of items the length of the list gave jack respect for the logistics of running the institution leaving central supply jack descended a floor and wandered into the lab he did not feel he was making any progress but he refused to give up his conviction remained that there was some major missing piece of information he just didnt know where he would find it jack asked the same receptionist to whom hed shown his badge the day before for directions to microbiology which she gave him without question jack walked unchallenged through the extensive lab it was an odd feeling to see so much impressive equipment running unattended it reminded jack of the directors lament the day before that hed been forced to cut his personnel by twenty percent jack found nancy wiggens working at a lab bench plating bacterial cultures howdy jack said remember me nancy glanced up and then back at her work of course she said you guys made the diagnosis on the second plague case just fine he said its easy when you suspect it nancy said but we didnt do so well on the third case i was going to ask you about that jack said what did the gram stain look like i didnt do it nancy said beth holderness did do you want to talk with her i would jack said nancy slid off her stool and disappeared jack took the opportunity to glance around at the microbiology section of the lab he was impressed most labs particularly microbiology labs had an invariable clutter this lab was different it appeared highly efficient with everything crystalclean and in its place hi im beth jack turned to find himself before a smiling outgoing woman in her midtwenties she exuded a cheerleaderlike zeal that was infectious her hair was tightly permed and radiated away from her face as if charged with static electricity jack introduced himself and was immediately charmed by beths natural conversation she was one of the friendliest women hed ever met well im sure you didnt come here to gab beth said i understand you are interested in the gram stain on susanne hard come on its waiting for you beth literally grabbed jack by the sleeve and pulled him around to her work area her microscope was set up with hards slide positioned on its platform and the illuminator switched on sit yourself right here beth said as she guided jacks lower half onto her stool how is that low enough its perfect jack said he leaned forward and peered into the eyepieces it took a moment for his eyes to adapt when they did he could see the field was filled with reddishstained bacteria notice how pleomorphic the microbes are a male voice commented jack looked up richard the head tech had materialized and was standing to jacks immediate left almost touching him i didnt mean to be such a bother jack said no bother richard said in fact im interested in your opinion we still havent made a diagnosis on this case nothing has grown out and i presume you know that the test for plague was negative so i heard jack said he put his eyes back to the microscope and peered in again i dont think you want my opinion im not so good at this stuff he admitted but you do see the pleomorphism richard said i suppose jack said theyre pretty small bacilli some of them almost look spherical or am i looking at them on end i believe you are seeing them as they are richard said thats more pleomorphism than you see with plague thats why beth and i doubted it was plague of course we werent sure until the fluorescein antibody was negative jack looked up from the scope if its not plague what do you think it is richard gave a little embarrassed laugh i dont know jack looked at beth what about you care to take a chance beth shook her head not if richard wont she said diplomatically cant someone even hazard a guess jack asked richard shook his head not me im always wrong when i guess you werent wrong about plague jack reminded him that was just lucky richard said he flushed whats going on here an irritated voice called out jacks head swung around in the opposite direction beyond beth was the director of the lab martin cheveau he was standing with his legs apart his hands on his hips and his mustache quivering behind him was dr mary zimmerman and behind her was charles kelley jack got to his feet the lab techs slunk back the atmosphere was suddenly tense the lab director was clearly irate are you here in an official capacity martin demanded if so id like to know why you didnt have the common courtesy to come to my office instead of sneaking in here we have a crisis unfolding in this hospital and this lab is in the middle of it i am not about to brook interference from anyone whoa jack said calm down he hadnt expected this blowup especially from martin who had been so hospitable the day before dont tell me to calm down martin snapped what the devil are you doing here anyway im just doing my job investigating the deaths of katherine mueller and susanne hard jack said i hardly think im interfering in fact i thought i was being rather discreet is there something in particular you are looking for in my lab martin demanded i was just going over a gram stain with your capable staff jack said your official mandate is to determine the cause and the manner of death dr zimmerman said pushing her way in front of martin youve done that not quite jack corrected we havent made a diagnosis on susanne hard he returned the infectioncontrol officers beady stare since she wasnt wearing the mask shed had on the day before jack was able to appreciate how stern her thinlipped face was you havent made a specific diagnosis in the hard case dr zimmerman corrected but you have made a diagnosis of a fatal infectious disease under the circumstances i think that is adequate adequate has never been my goal in medicine jack said nor mine dr zimmerman shot back nor is it for the centers for disease control or the city board of health who are actively investigating this unfortunate incident frankly your presence here is disruptive are you sure they dont need a little help jack asked he couldnt hold back the sarcasm id say your presence is more than disruptive kelley said in fact youve been downright slanderous you could very well be hearing from our lawyers whoa jack said again lifting his hands as if to fend off a bodily attack disruptive i can at least comprehend slanderous is ridiculous not from my point of view kelley said the supervisor in central supply said you told her katherine mueller had contracted her illness on the job and that has not been established dr zimmerman added uttering such an unsubstantiated statement is defamatory to this institution and injurious to its reputation kelley snapped and could have a negative impact on its stock value jack said and that too kelley agreed the trouble is i didnt say mueller had contracted her illness on the job jack said i said she could have done so theres a big difference mrs zarelli told us you told her it was a fact kelley said i told her those were the facts referring to the possibility jack said but look were quibbling the real fact is that you people are overly defensive it makes me wonder about your nosocomial infection history whats the story there kelley turned purple given the mans intimidating size advantage jack took a protective step backward our nosocomial infection experience is none of your business kelley sputtered thats something im beginning to question jack said but ill save looking into it for another time its been nice seeing you all again bye jack broke off from the group and strode away he heard sudden movement behind him and cringed half expecting a beaker or some other handy piece of laboratory paraphernalia to sail past his ear but he reached the door to the hallway without incident descending a floor he unlocked his bike and headed south jack weaved in and out of the traffic marveling at his latest brush with americare most confusing was the sensitivity of the people involved even martin whod been friendly the day before now acted as if jack were the enemy what could they all be hiding and why hide it from jack jack didnt know who at the hospital had alerted the administration of his presence but he had a good idea who would be informing bingham that hed been there jack entertained no illusions about kelley complaining about him again jack wasnt disappointed as soon as he came in the receiving bay the security man stopped him i was told to tell you to go directly to the chiefs office the man said dr washington himself gave me the message as jack locked his bike he tried to think of what he was going to say to bingham nothing came to mind while ascending in the elevator jack decided hed switch to offense since he couldnt think of any defense he was still formulating an idea when he presented himself in front of mrs sanfords desk youre to go right in mrs sanford said as usual she didnt look up from her work jack stepped around her desk and entered binghams office immediately he saw that bingham wasnt alone calvins huge hulk was hovering near the glassfronted bookcase chief we have a problem jack said earnestly he moved over to binghams desk and gave it a tap with his fist for emphasis we dont have a diagnosis on the hard case and we got to give it to them asap if we dont were going to look bad especially the way the press is all stirred up about the plague i even went all the way over to the general to take a look at the gram stain unfortunately it didnt help bingham regarded jack curiously with his rheumy eyes hed been about to lambaste jack now he demurred instead of speaking he removed his wirerimmed spectacles and absently cleaned them while he considered jacks words he glanced over at calvin calvin responded by stepping up to the desk he wasnt fooled by jacks ruse what the hell are you talking about calvin demanded susanne hard jack said you remember the case you and i have the tendollar doubleornothing bet on a bet bingham questioned is there gambling going on in this office not really chief calvin said it was just a way of making a point its not routine i should hope not bingham snapped i dont want any wagering around here especially not in regard to diagnoses thats not the kind of thing id like to see in the press our critics would have a field day getting back to susanne hard jack said im at a loss as to how to proceed id hoped that by talking directly to the hospital lab people i might have made some headway but it didnt work what do you think i should do now jack wanted the conversation to move away from the gambling issue it might divert bingham but jack knew hed have hell to pay with calvin later on im a little confused bingham said just yesterday i specifically told you to stay around here and get your backload of cases signed out i especially told you to stay the hell away from the manhattan general hospital that was if i were going there for personal reasons jack said i wasnt this was all business then how the hell did you manage to get the administrator all bent out of shape again bingham demanded he called the damn mayors office for the second day in a row the mayor wants to know if you have some sort of mental problem or whether i have a mental problem for hiring you i hope you reassured him were both normal jack said dont be impertinent on top of everything else bingham said to tell you the honest truth jack said i havent the slightest idea why the administrator got upset maybe the pressure of this plague episode has gotten to everybody over there because theyre all acting weird so now everyone seems weird to you bingham said well not everyone jack admitted but theres something strange going on im sure of it bingham looked up at calvin who shrugged and rolled his eyes he didnt understand what jack was talking about binghams attention returned to jack listen bingham said i dont want to fire you so dont make me youre a smart man you have a future in this field but im warning you if you willfully disobey me and continue to embarrass us in the community ill have no other recourse tell me you understand perfectly jack said fine bingham said then get back to your work and well see you later in conference jack took the cue and instantly disappeared for a moment bingham and calvin remained silent each lost in his own thoughts hes an odd duck bingham said finally i cant read him nor can i calvin said his saving grace is that he is smart and truly a hard worker hes very committed whenever hes on autopsy hes always the first one in the pit i know bingham said thats why i didnt fire him on the spot but where does this brashness come from he has to know it rubs people the wrong way yet he doesnt seem to care hes reckless almost selfdestructive as he admitted himself yesterday why i dont know calvin said sometimes i get the feeling its anger but directed at what i havent the foggiest ive tried to talk with him a few times on a personal level but its like squeezing water out of a rock thursday pm march terese and colleen climbed out of the cab on second avenue between eightyninth and eightyeighth streets a few doors away from elaines and walked to the restaurant they couldnt get out right in front because of several limos inconveniently doubleparked how do i look colleen asked as they paused under the canvas awning shed pulled off her coat for tereses inspection too good terese said and she meant it colleen had discarded her signature sweatshirt and jeans for a simple black dress that revealed her ample bust to perfection terese felt dowdy by comparison she still had on her tailored suit that shed worn to work that day not having found time to go home to change i dont know why im so nervous colleen admitted relax terese said with that dress dr mcgovern doesnt stand a chance colleen gave their names to the maître d who immediately indicated recognition he motioned for the women to follow him he started to the rear it was an obstacle course of sorts to weave among the densely packed tables and scurrying waiters terese had the sensation of being in a fishbowl everyone male and female alike gave them the onceover as they passed the men were at a tiny table squeezed into the far corner they got to their feet as the women approached chet held out colleens chair jack did the same for terese the women draped their coats over the backs of the chairs before sitting down you men must know the owner to have gotten such a great table terese said chet who misinterpreted tereses remark as a compliment bragged hed been introduced to elaine a year previously he explained she was the woman seated at the cash register at the end of the bar they tried to seat us up in the front jack said but we declined we thought you women wouldnt like the draft from the door how thoughtful terese said besides this is so much more intimate you think so chet questioned his face visibly brightened they were in reality packed in like proverbial sardines how could you question her jack asked chet shes so sincere all right enough chet said goodnaturedly i might be dense but eventually i catch on they ordered wine and appetizers from the waiter whod immediately appeared after the women had arrived colleen and chet fell into easy conversation terese and jack continued to be teasingly sarcastic with each other but eventually the wine blunted their witticisms by the time the main course was served they were conversing congenially whats the inside scoop on the plague situation terese asked there were two more deaths at the general jack said plus a couple of febrile nurses are being treated that was in the morning news terese said anything new only one of the deaths was actually plague jack said the other resembled plague clinically but i personally dont think it was terese stopped a forkful of pasta midway to her mouth no she questioned if it wasnt plague what was it jack shrugged i wish i knew he said im hoping the lab can tell me the manhattan general must be in an uproar terese said im glad im not a patient there now being in the hospital is scary enough under the best of circumstances with the worry of diseases like plague around it must be terrible the administration is definitely agitated jack said and for good reason if it turns out the plague originated there it will be the first modern episode of nosocomial plague thats hardly an accolade as far as the hospital is concerned this concept of nosocomial infections is new to me terese said id never thought much about it before you and chet talked about this current plague problem last night do all hospitals have such problems absolutely jack said its not common knowledge but usually five to ten percent of hospitalized patients fall victim to infections contracted while they are in the hospital my god terese said i had no idea it was such a widespread phenomenon its all over chet agreed every hospital has it from the academic ivory tower to the smallest community hospital what makes it so bad is that the hospital is the worst place to get an infection because many of the bugs hanging out there are resistant to antibiotics oh great terese said cynically after she thought for a moment she asked do hospitals differ significantly in their infection rates for sure chet said are these rates known terese said yes and no chet said hospitals are required by the joint commission of accreditation to keep records of their infection rates but the rates arent released to the public thats a travesty terese said with a surreptitious wink at colleen if the rates go over a certain amount the hospital loses its accreditation chet said so all is not lost but its hardly fair to the public terese said by not having access to those rates people cant make their own decisions about which hospitals to patronize chet opened his hands palms up like a supplicant priest thats politics he said i think its awful terese said lifes not fair jack said after dessert and coffee chet and colleen began campaigning to go someplace where there was dancing like the china club both terese and jack were disinclined chet and colleen tried their best to change their minds but they soon gave up you guys go terese said are you sure colleen asked we wouldnt want to hold you back jack said colleen looked at chet lets go for it chet said outside the restaurant chet and colleen happily piled into a cab jack and terese waved as they drove off i hope they enjoy themselves terese said i couldnt have thought of anything worse sitting in a smokefilled nightclub assaulted by music loud enough to damage my ears is not my idea of pleasure at least weve finally found something we can agree on jack said terese laughed she was beginning to appreciate jacks sense of humor it wasnt too dissimilar from her own for a moment of selfconscious indecision they stood at the curbside each looking in a different direction second avenue was alive with revelers despite a nippy temperature in the high thirties the air was clear and the sky cloudless i think the weatherman forgot it was the first day of spring terese said she jammed her hands into her coat pockets and hunched up her shoulders we could walk around the corner to that bar where we were last night jack suggested we could terese said but i have a better idea my agency is over on madison its not too far away how about a quick visit youre inviting me to your office despite knowing how i feel about advertising jack asked i thought it was only medical advertising you were against terese said the truth is im not particularly fond of advertising in general jack said last night chet jumped in before i had a chance to say it but youre not opposed to it per se terese questioned just the medical kind jack said for the reasons i gave then how about a quick visit we do a lot more than just medical advertising you might find it enlightening jack tried to read the woman behind the soft pale blue eyes and sensuous mouth he was confused because the vulnerability they suggested wasnt in sync with the nononsense goaloriented driven woman he suspected she was terese met his stare headon and smiled back coquettishly be adventuresome she challenged why do i have the feeling you have an ulterior motive jack asked probably because i do terese freely admitted id like your advice on a new ad campaign i wasnt going to admit youd been a stimulus for a new idea but tonight during dinner i changed my mind about telling you i dont know whether to feel used or complimented jack said how did i happen to give you an idea for an ad all this talk about plague at the manhattan general hospital terese said it made me think seriously about the issue of nosocomial infection jack considered this statement for a moment then he asked and why did you change your mind about telling me and asking my advice because it suddenly dawned on me that you might actually approve of the campaign terese said you told me the reason you were against advertising in medicine was because it didnt address issues of quality well ads concerning nosocomial infections certainly would i suppose jack said oh come on terese said of course it would if a hospital was proud of its record why not let the public know all right jack said i give up lets see this office of yours having made the decision to go there was the problem of jacks bike at that moment it was locked to a nearby no parking sign after a short discussion they decided to leave the bike and go together in a cab jack would rescue the bike later on his way home with little traffic and a wildly fast and reckless russianémigré taxi driver they arrived at willow and heaths building in minutes jack staggered out of the rear of the taxi god he said people accuse me of taking a risk riding my bike in this city its nothing like riding with that maniac as if to underline jacks statement the cab shot away from the curb and disappeared up madison avenue with its tires screeching at tenthirty the office building was locked up tight terese used her night key and they entered their heels echoed noisily in the lonely marble hallway even the whine of the elevator seemed loud in the stillness are you here often after hours jack asked terese laughed cynically all the time she said i practically live here they rode up in silence when the doors opened jack was shocked to find the floor brightly illuminated and bustling with activity as if it were midday toiling figures bent over many of the innumerable drawing boards what do you have two shifts jack asked terese laughed again of course not she said these people have been here since early this morning advertising is a competitive world if you want to make it you have to put in your time we have several reviews coming up terese excused herself and walked over to a woman at a nearby drawing table while they conversed jacks eyes roamed the expansive space he was surprised there were so few partitions there was only a handful of separate rooms which shared a common wall with the bank of elevators alice is going to bring in some material terese said when she rejoined jack why dont we go into colleens office terese led him into one of the rooms and turned on the lights it was tiny windowless and claustrophobic when compared to the vast undivided space it was also cluttered with papers books magazines and videotapes there were several easels set up with thick pads of drawing paper im sure colleen wont mind if i clear away a little area on her desk terese said as she moved aside stacks of orangecolored tracing paper gathering up an armload of books she set them on the floor no sooner had she finished than alice gerber another of tereses associates appeared after making introductions terese had alice run through a number of the potential commercial ideas theyd comped up that day jack found himself interested more in the process than the content hed never stopped to think about how tv commercials were made and he came to appreciate the creativity involved and the amount of work it took alice a quarter hour to present what shed brought in when she was finished she gathered up the tissues and looked at terese for further instructions terese thanked her and sent her back to her drawing board so there you have it terese said to jack thosere some of the ideas stemming from this nosocomial infection issue what do you think im impressed with how hard you work on this sort of thing jack said im more interested in your reaction to the content terese said what do you think of the idea of hippocrates coming into the hospital to award it the do no harm medal jack shrugged i dont flatter myself to think i have the ability to intelligently critique a commercial oh give me a break terese said rolling her eyes to the ceiling i just want your opinion as a human being this isnt an intellectual quiz what would you think if you saw this commercial on the tv say when you were watching the super bowl id think it was cute jack admitted would it make you think the national health hospital might be a good place to go since its nosocomial infection rates were low i suppose jack said all right terese said trying to keep herself calm maybe you have some other ideas what else could we do jack pondered for a few minutes you could do something about oliver wendell holmes and joseph lister wasnt holmes a poet terese asked he was also a doctor jack said he and lister probably did more for getting doctors to wash their hands when going from patient to patient than anybody well semmelweis helped too anyway handwashing was probably the most important lesson that needed to be learned to prevent hospitalbased infections hmm terese said that sounds interesting personally i love period pieces let me tell alice to get someone to research it jack followed terese out of colleens office and watched her talk with alice it only took her a few minutes okay terese said rejoining jack shell start the ball rolling lets get out of here in the elevator terese had another suggestion why dont we take a run over to your office she said its only fair now that you have seen mine you dont want to see it jack said trust me try me its the truth jack said its not a pretty place i think it would be interesting terese persisted ive only seen a morgue in the movies who knows maybe it will give me some ideas besides seeing where you work might help me understand you a little more im not sure i want to be understood jack said the elevator stopped and the doors opened they walked outside they paused at the curb what do you say i cant imagine it would take too long and its not terribly late you are a persistent sort jack commented tell me do you always get your way usually terese admitted then she laughed but i prefer to think of myself as tenacious all right jack said finally but dont say i didnt warn you they caught a taxi after jack gave the destination the driver looped around and headed south on park avenue you give me the impression of being a loner terese said youre very perspicacious jack said you dont have to be so caustic terese said for once i wasnt jack said the lambent reflections of the streetlights played over their faces as they regarded each other in the halflight of the taxi its difficult for a woman to know how to feel around you terese said i could say the same jack said have you ever been married terese said that is if you dont mind me asking yes i was married jack said but it didnt work out terese said leadingly there was a problem jack admitted but i dont really care to talk about it how about you were you ever married yes i was terese said she sighed and looked out her window but i dont like talking about it either now we have two things we agree on jack said we both feel the same about nightclubs and talking about our former marriages jack had given directions to be dropped off at the thirtieth street entrance of the medical examiners office he was glad to see that both mortuary vans were gone he thought their absence was a sign that there wouldnt be any fresh corpses lying around on gurneys although terese had insisted on the visit he was afraid of offending her sensibilities unnecessarily terese said nothing as jack led her past the banks of refrigerated compartments it wasnt until she saw all the simple pine coffins that she spoke she asked why they were there theyre for the unclaimed and unidentified dead jack said they are buried at city expense does that happen often terese asked all the time jack said jack took her back to the area of the autopsy room he opened the door to the washroom terese leaned in but didnt enter the autopsy room was visible through a windowed door the stainlesssteel dissecting tables glistened ominously in the halflight i expected this place to be more modern she said she was hugging herself to keep from touching anything at one time it was jack said it was supposed to have been renovated but it didnt happen unfortunately the city is always in some kind of budgetary crisis and few politicians balk at pulling money away from here adequate funding for normal operating expenses is hard to come by much less money to update the facility on the other hand we do have a new stateoftheart dna lab wheres your office terese asked up on the fifth floor jack said can i see it she asked why not jack said weve come this far they walked back past the mortuary office and waited for the elevator this place is a little hard to take isnt it jack said it has its gruesome side terese admitted we who work here often forget the effect it has on laypeople jack said though he was impressed with the degree of equanimity terese had demonstrated the elevator arrived and they got on jack pressed the fifth floor and they started up how did you ever decide on this kind of career terese asked did you know back in medical school heavens no jack said i wanted something clean technically demanding emotionally fulfilling and lucrative i became an ophthalmologist what happened terese asked my practice got taken over by americare jack said since i didnt want to work for them or any similar corporation i retrained its the buzzword these days for superfluous medical specialists was it difficult terese asked jack didnt answer immediately the elevator arrived on the fifth floor and the doors opened it was very difficult jack said as he started down the hall mostly because it was so lonely terese hazarded a glance in jacks direction shed not expected him to be the type to complain of loneliness shed assumed he was a loner by choice while she was looking jack furtively wiped the corner of an eye with his knuckle could there have been a tear terese was mystified here we are jack announced he opened his office door with his key and flipped on the light the interior was worse than terese had expected it was tiny and narrow the furniture was gray metal and old and the walls were in need of paint there was a single filthy window positioned high on the wall two desks terese questioned chet and i share this space jack explained which desk is yours the messy one jack said this plague episode has put me further behind than ususal im generally behind because im rather compulsive about my reports dr stapleton a voice called out it was janice jaeger the pa investigator security told me you were here when i just came through the receiving bay she said after being introduced to terese ive been trying to reach you at home whats the problem jack asked the reference lab called this evening janice said they ran the fluorescein antibody on susanne hards lung tissue as you requested it was positive for tularemia are you kidding jack took the paper from janice and stared at it with disbelief whats tularemia terese asked its another infectious disease jack said its similar in some ways to plague where was this patient terese asked although she suspected the answer also at the general jack said he shook his head i truly cant believe it this is extraordinary ive got to get back to work janice said if you need me to do anything just let me know im sorry jack said i didnt mean to have you stand here thanks for getting this to me no problem janice said she waved and headed back to the elevators is tularemia as bad as plague terese asked its hard to make comparisons jack said but its bad particularly the pneumonic form which is highly contagious if susanne hard were still here she could tell us exactly how bad it is why are you so surprised terese asked is it as rare as plague probably not jack said its seen in a wider area in the us than plague particularly in southern states like arkansas but like plague its not seen much in the winter at least not up here in the north here its a latespring and summer problem if it exists at all it needs a vector just like plague instead of the rat flea its usually spread by ticks and deerflies any tick or deerfly terese asked her parents had a cabin up in the catskills where she liked to go in the summer it was isolated and surrounded by forest and fields there were plenty of ticks and deerflies the reservoir for the bacteria is small mammals like rodents and especially rabbits jack said he started to elaborate but quickly stopped hed suddenly recalled that afternoons conversation with susannes husband maurice jack remembered being told that susanne liked to go to connecticut walk in the woods and feed wild rabbits maybe it was the rabbits jack mumbled what are you talking about terese asked jack apologized for thinking out loud shaking himself out of a momentary daze he motioned for terese to follow him into his office and to take chets chair he described his phone conversation with susannes husband and explained about the importance of wild rabbits in relation to tularemia sounds incriminating to me terese said the only problem is that her exposure to the connecticut rabbits was almost two weeks ago jack mused he drummed his fingers on his telephone receiver thats a long incubation period especially for the pneumonic form of course if she didnt catch it in connecticut then she had to catch it here in the city possibly at the general of course nosocomial tularemia doesnt make any more sense than nosocomial plague one way or the other the public has to know about this terese said she nodded toward his hand on the phone i hope you are calling the media as well as the hospital neither jack said he glanced at his watch it was still before midnight he picked up the phone and dialed im calling my immediate boss the politics of all this are his bailiwick calvin picked up on the first ring but mumbled as if hed been asleep jack cheerfully identified himself this better be important calvin growled it is to me jack said i wanted you to be first to know you owe me another ten dollars get outta here calvin boomed the grogginess had disappeared from his voice i hope to god this isnt some kind of sick joke no joke jack assured him the lab just reported it in tonight the manhattan general had a case of tularemia in addition to its two cases of plague im as surprised as anyone the lab called you directly calvin said nope jack said one of the pas just gave it to me are you in the office calvin asked sure am jack said working my fingers to the bone tularemia calvin questioned id better read up on it i dont think ive ever seen a case i read up on it just this afternoon jack admitted make sure there are no leaks from our office calvin said i wont call bingham tonight because theres nothing to be done at the moment ill let him know first thing in the morning and he can call the commissioner and she can call the board of health okay jack said so you are going to keep it a secret terese said angrily as jack hung up the receiver its not my doing jack said yeah i know terese said sarcastically its not your job i already got myself in trouble over the plague episode for calling the commissioner on my own jack said i dont see any benefit by doing it again word will be out in the morning through the proper channels what about people over at the general who are suspected of having plague terese questioned they might have this new disease i think you should let everyone know tonight thats a good point jack said but it doesnt really matter the treatment for tularemia is the same as the treatment for plague well wait until morning besides its only a few hours away what if i alerted the press terese asked ill have to ask you not to do that jack said you heard what my boss said if it were investigated the source would come back to me you dont like advertising in medicine and i dont like politics in medicine terese said amen jack said friday am march despite having gone to bed much later than usual for the second night in a row jack was wide awake at fivethirty friday morning he began mulling over the irony of a case of tularemia appearing in the middle of a plague outbreak it was a curious coincidence especially since hed made the diagnosis it was a feat certainly worth the ten dollars and twentyfive cents that he stood to win from calvin and laurie with his mind churning jack recognized the futility of trying to go back to sleep consequently he got up ate breakfast and was on his bike before six with less traffic than usual he got to work in record time the first thing jack did was to visit the id room to look for laurie and vinnie both had yet to arrive passing back through communications he knocked on janices door she appeared even more beleaguered than usual what a night she said busy jack asked thats an understatement she said especially with these added infectious cases whats going on over there at the general how many today jack asked three janice said and not one of them tested positive for plague even though thats their presumed diagnosis also all three were fulminant cases the people all died within twelve or so hours after their first symptoms its very scary all of these recent infectious cases have been fulminant jack commented do you think these three new ones are tularemia janice asked theres a good chance jack said especially if they tested negative for plague as you say you didnt mention susannes diagnosis to anyone did you i had to bite my tongue but i didnt janice said id learned in the past by sore experience that my role is to gather information not give it out i had to learn the same lesson jack said are you finished with these three folders theyre all yours janice said jack carried the folders back to the id room since vinnie had not arrived jack made the coffee in the communal pot mug in hand he sat down and began going through the material almost immediately he stumbled onto something curious the first case was a fortytwoyearold woman by the name of maria lopez what was surprising was that she worked in central supply of the manhattan general hospital not only that but she had worked on the same shift as katherine mueller jack closed his eyes and tried to think of how two people from central supply could possibly have come down with two different fatal infectious diseases as far as he was concerned it could not be a coincidence he was convinced their illnesses had to be workrelated the question was how in his minds eye jack revisited central supply he could picture the shelving and the aisles even the outfits the employees wore but nothing came to mind as a way for the employees to come in contact with contagious bacteria central supply had nothing to do with the disposal of hospital waste or even soiled linen and as the supervisor had mentioned workers there had little or no contact with patients jack read the rest of janices investigative report as shed done with the cases since nodelman she included information about pets travel and visitors for maria lopez none of the three seemed a factor jack opened the second folder the patients name was joy hester in this case jack felt there was little mystery shed been an obgyn nurse and had had significant exposure to susanne hard just prior to and after the onset of susannes symptoms the only thing that bothered jack was recalling that hed read that persontoperson transmission of tularemia rarely occurred the third case was donald lagenthorpe a thirtyeightyearold petroleum engineer whod been admitted to the hospital the previous morning hed come in through the er with a refractory bout of asthma hed been treated with iv steroids and bronchodilators as well as humidified air and bed rest according to janices notes hed shown steady improvement and had even been campaigning to be released when hed had the sudden onset of a severe frontal headache the headache had started in the late afternoon and was followed by shaking chills and fever there was also an increase in cough and exacerbation of his asthmatic symptoms despite the continued treatment at that point he was diagnosed to have pneumonia which was confirmed by x ray curiously enough however a gram stain of his sputum was negative for bacteria myalgia also had become prominent sudden abdominal pain and deep tenderness had suggested a possible appendicitis at seventhirty in the evening lagenthorpe had undergone an appendectomy but the appendix proved to be normal after the surgery his situation became progressively grave with apparent multisystem failure his blood pressure dropped and became unresponsive to treatment urine output became negligible reading on in janices report jack learned that the patient had visited isolated oil rigs in texas the previous week and had literally been tramping around in desert conditions jack also learned that mr lagenthorpes girlfriend had recently obtained a pet burmese cat but hed not been exposed to any visitors from exotic places wow youre here early laurie montgomery exclaimed jack was shocked out of his concentration in time to see laurie sweep into the id room and drape her coat over the desk she used for her earlymorning duties it was the last day of her current rotation as supervisor in charge of determining which of the previous nights cases should be autopsied and who would do them it was a thankless task that none of the boardcertified doctors enjoyed ive got some bad news for you jack said laurie paused on her way into communications a shadow passed over her usually bright honeycomplected face jack laughed hey relax he said its not that bad its just that you owe me a quarter are you serious she asked the hard case was tularemia the lab reported a positive fluorescein antibody last night jack said i think its a firm diagnosis its a good thing i didnt bet any more than a quarter laurie said you are amassing some impressive statistics in the infectious arena whats your secret beginners luck jack said by the way i have three of last nights cases here theyre all infectious and all from the general id like to do at least two of them i cant think of any reason why not laurie said but let me run over to communications and get the rest the moment laurie left vinnie made his appearance his face was a pasty color and his heavily lidded eyes were red from jacks perspective he appeared as if he belonged in one of the coolers downstairs you look like death warmed over jack said hangover vinnie remarked i went to a buddys bachelor party we all got whacked vinnie tossed his newspaper on a desk and went over to the cupboard where the coffee was stored in case you havent noticed jack said the coffee is already made vinnie had to stare at the coffee machine with its full pot for several beats until his tired mind comprehended that his current efforts were superfluous how about starting on this instead jack said he pushed the maria lopez folder over to vinnie might as well get set up remember the early bird hold the clichés vinnie said he took the folder and let it fall open in his hands frankly im not in the mood for any of your sappy sayings what bugs me is that you cant come in here when everybody else does lauries here jack reminded him yeah but this is her week for scheduling you dont have any excuse he briefly read portions of the folder wonderful another infectious case my favorite i should have stayed in bed ill be down in a few minutes jack said vinnie irritably snapped up his newspaper and headed downstairs laurie reappeared with an armful of folders and dumped them on her desk my my but we do have a lot of work to do today she said ive already sent vinnie down to get prepared for one of these infectious cases jack said i hope im not overstepping my authority i know you havent looked at them yet but all of them are suspected plague but tested negative at a minimum i think we have to make a diagnosis no question laurie said but i should still go downstairs and do my external come on ill do it right away and you can get started she grabbed the master list of all the previous nights deaths whats the story on this first case you want to do laurie asked as they walked jack gave her a quick synopsis of what he knew about maria lopez he emphasized the coincidence of her being employed in central supply at the general he reminded her that the plague victim from the day before had also worked in that department they boarded the elevator thats kinda strange isnt it laurie asked it is to me jack agreed do you think its significant laurie asked the elevator bumped to a stop and they got off my intuition tells me it is jack said thats why im eager to do the post for the life of me i cant figure out what the association could be as they passed the mortuary office laurie beckoned to sal he caught up to them and she handed him her master list lets see the lopez body first she said sal took the list referred to his own then stopped at compartment opened the door and slid out the tray maria lopez like her late coworker katherine mueller was an overweight female her hair was stringy and dyed a peculiar reddish orange several ivs were still in place one was taped to the right side of her neck the other to her left arm a fairly young woman laurie commented jack nodded she was only fortytwo laurie held maria lopezs fullbody x ray up to the ceiling light its only abnormality was patchy infiltration in her lungs go to it laurie said jack turned on his heels and headed toward the room where his moonsuit ventilator was charging of the other two cases you had upstairs which one would you want to do if you only do one laurie called after him lagenthorpe jack said laurie gave him a thumbsup despite his hangover vinnie had been his usual efficient self in setting up the autopsy on maria lopez by the time jack read over the material in marias folder for the second time and had climbed into his moon suit all was ready with no distractions from anyone in the pit besides himself and vinnie jack was able to concentrate he spent an inordinate amount of time on the external exam he was determined to find an insect bite if there had been one he was not successful as with mueller there were a few questionable blemishes which he photographed but none he felt were bites jacks concentration was inadvertently aided by vinnies hangover preferring to nurse his headache vinnie remained silent sparing jack his usual quips and running commentary on sports trivia jack reveled in the thoughtprovoking silence jack handled the internal exam the same way hed handled those of the previous infectious cases he was extraordinarily careful to avoid unnecessary movement of the organs to keep bacterial aerosolization to a minimum as the autopsy progressed jacks overall impression was that lopezs case mirrored that of susanne hard not katherine mueller hence his preliminary diagnosis remained tularemia not plague this only highlighted his confusion of how two women from central supply had managed to catch these illnesses while other more exposed hospital workers had avoided them when he finished with the internal exam and had taken the samples he wanted he put aside a special sample of lung to take up to agnes finn once he had similar samples from joy hester and donald lagenthorpe he planned to have them all sent immediately to the reference lab to be tested for tularemia by the time jack and vinnie had commenced stitching up maria lopez they began to hear voices in the washroom and out in the hall here come the normal civilized people vinnie commented jack didnt respond presently the door to the washroom opened two figures entered in their moon suits and ambled over to jacks table it was laurie and chet are you guys finished already chet said its not my doing vinnie said the mad biker has to start before the sun is up what do you think laurie asked plague or tularemia my guess is tularemia jack said that will be four cases if these other two are tularemia as well laurie said i know jack said its weird persontoperson spread is supposed to be rare it doesnt make a lot of sense but that seems par for the course with these recent cases how is tularemia spread chet asked ive never seen a case its spread by ticks or direct contact with an infected animal like a rabbit jack said ive got you scheduled for lagenthorpe next laurie told jack im going to do hester myself im happy to do hester as well jack said no need laurie said there arent that many autopsies today a lot of last nights deaths didnt need to be posted i cant let you have all the fun bodies began arriving they were being pushed into the autopsy room by other mortuary techs and lifted onto their designated tables laurie and chet moved off to do their own cases jack and vinnie returned to their suturing when they were finished jack helped vinnie move the body onto a gurney then jack asked how quickly vinnie could have lagenthorpe ready to go what a slave driver vinnie complained arent we going to have coffee like everybody else id rather get it over with jack said then you can have coffee for the rest of the day bull vinnie said ill be reassigned back in here helping someone else still complaining vinnie pushed maria lopez out of the autopsy room jack wandered over to lauries table laurie was engrossed in the external exam but straightened up when she caught sight of jack this poor woman was thirtysix laurie said wistfully what a waste what have you found any insect bites or cat scratches nothing except a shaving nick on her lower leg laurie said but its not inflamed so im convinced its incidental there is something interesting she has definite eye infections laurie carefully lifted the womans eyelids both eyes were deeply inflamed although the corneas were clear i can also feel enlarged preauricular lymph nodes laurie said she pointed to visible lumps in front of the patients ears interesting jack commented thats consistent with tularemia but i didnt see it on the other cases give a yell if you come across anything else unusual jack stepped over to chets table he was happily engrossed in a multiple gunshot wound case at the moment he was busy photographing the entrance and exit wounds when he saw jack he handed the camera to sal who was helping him and pulled jack aside how was your time last night chet asked this is hardly the best time to discuss it jack said conversation in the moon suits was difficult at best oh come on chet said i had a blast with colleen after the china club we went back to her pad on east sixtysixth im happy for you jack said what did you guys end up doing chet asked you wouldnt believe me if i told you jack said try me chet challenged he leaned closer to jack we went over to her office and then we came over here to ours jack said youre right chet said i dont believe you the truth is often difficult to accept jack said jack used vinnies arrival with lagenthorpes corpse as an excuse to return to his table jack pitched in to help set up the case because it was preferable to further grilling by chet besides it made it possible to start the case that much sooner on the external exam the most obvious abnormality was the freshly sutured twoinchlong appendectomy incision but jack quickly discovered more pathology when he examined the corpses hands he found subtle evidence of early gangrene on the tips of the fingers he found some even fainter evidence of the same process on the mans earlobes reminds me of nodelman vinnie said its just less and he doesnt have any on his pecker do you think its plague again i dont know jack said nodelman didnt have an appendectomy jack spent twenty minutes diligently searching the rest of the body for any signs of insect or animal bites since lagenthorpe was a moderately darkskinned africanamerican this was more difficult than it had been with the considerably lighterskinned lopez although jacks diligence didnt reward him with any bite marks it did make it possible for him to appreciate another subtle abnormality on lagenthorpes palms and soles there was a faint rash jack pointed it out to vinnie but vinnie said he couldnt see it tell me what im looking for vinnie said flat pinkish blotches jack said heres more on the underside of the wrist jack held up lagenthorpes right arm im sorry vinnie said i dont see it no matter jack said he took several photographs even though he doubted the rash would show up the flash often washed out such subtle findings as jack continued the external exam he found himself progressively mystified the patient had come in with a presumed diagnosis of pneumonic plague and externally he resembled a plague victim as vinnie had pointed out yet there were discrepancies the record indicated hed had a negative test for plague which made jack suspect tularemia but tularemia seemed implausible because the patients sputum test had shown no free bacteria to complicate things further the patient had had severe enough abdominal symptoms to suggest appendicitis which he proved not to have and on top of that he had a rash on his palms and soles at that point jack had no idea what he was dealing with as far as he was concerned he doubted the case was either plague or tularemia starting the internal exam he immediately came across strong presumptive evidence that substantiated his belief the lymphatics were minimally involved slicing open the lung jack also detected a difference even on gross from what hed expect to see in either plague or tularemia to jacks eye lagenthorpes lung resembled heart failure more than it did infection there was plenty of fluid but little consolidation turning to the other internal organs jack found almost all of them involved in the pathological process the heart seemed acutely enlarged as were the liver the spleen and the kidneys even the intestines were engorged as if they had stopped functioning got something interesting a husky voice demanded jack had been so absorbed he hadnt noticed that calvin had nudged vinnie aside i believe i do jack managed another infectious case another gruff voice asked jacks head swung around to his left hed recognized the voice immediately but he had to confirm his suspicion he was right it was the chief it came in as a presumed plague jack said he was surprised to see bingham the chief rarely came into the pit unless it was a highly unusual case or one that had immediate political ramifications your tone suggests you dont think it is bingham said he leaned over the open body and glanced in at the swollen glistening organs you are very perceptive sir jack said he made a specific effort to keep his patented sarcasm from his voice this was one time he meant the compliment what do you think you have bingham asked he poked the swollen spleen gingerly with his gloved hand this spleen looks huge i havent the faintest idea jack said dr washington informed me this morning that youd made an impressive diagnosis on a case of tularemia yesterday bingham said a lucky guess jack said not according to dr washington bingham said id like to compliment you following on the heels of your astute and rapid diagnosis of the case of plague im impressed im also impressed you left it up to me to inform the proper authorities keep up the good work you make me happy i didnt fire you yesterday now thats a backhanded compliment jack said he chuckled and so did bingham wheres the martin case bingham asked calvin calvin pointed table three sir he said dr mcgoverns doing it ill be over in a second jack watched bingham long enough to see chets double take when he recognized the chief jack turned back to calvin my feelings are hurt he said jokingly for a moment i thought the chief came all the way down here and suited up just to pay me a compliment dream on calvin said you were an afterthought he really came down about that gunshot wound dr mcgovern is doing is it a problem case jack asked potentially calvin said the police claim the victim was resisting arrest thats not so uncommon jack said the problem is whether the bullets went in the front or the back calvin said also there were five of them thats a bit heavyhanded jack nodded he understood all too well and was glad he wasnt doing the case the chief didnt come down here to compliment you but he did it just the same calvin said he was impressed about the tularemia and i have to admit i was too that was a rapid and clever diagnosis its worth ten bucks but ill tell you something i didnt appreciate that little ruse you pulled in the chiefs office yesterday about our bet you might have confused the chief for a moment but you didnt fool me i assumed as much jack said thats why i changed the subject so quickly i just wanted you to know calvin said leaning over lagenthorpes open corpse he pushed on the spleen just as bingham had done the chief was right he said this thing is swollen sos the heart and just about everything else jack said whats your guess calvin asked this time i dont even have a guess jack admitted its another infectious disease but im only willing to bet its not plague or tularemia im really starting to question what they are doing over there at the general dont get carried away calvin said new york is a big city and the general is a big hospital the way people move around today and with all the flights coming into kennedy day in and day out we can see any disease here any time of the year youve got a point jack conceded well when you have an idea what it is let me know calvin said i want to win that twenty dollars back after calvin left vinnie moved back into place jack took samples from all the organs and vinnie saw to it that they were placed in preservative and properly labeled after all the samples had been taken they both sutured lagenthorpes incision leaving vinnie to take care of the body jack wandered over to lauries table he had her show him the cut surfaces of the lungs liver and spleen the pathology mirrored that of lopez and hard there were hundreds of incipient abscesses with granuloma formation looks like another case of tularemia laurie said i cant argue with you jack said but this issue of persontoperson spread being so rare bugs me i dont know how to explain it unless they all were exposed to the same source laurie said oh sure jack exclaimed scornfully they all happened to go to the same spot in connecticut and feed the same sick rabbit im just suggesting the possibility laurie complained im sorry jack said youre right i shouldnt jump on you its just that these infectious disease cases are driving me bananas i feel like im missing something important and yet i have no idea what it could be what about lagenthorpe laurie asked do you think he had tularemia as well no jack said he seems to have had something completely different and i have no idea what maybe you are getting too emotionally involved laurie suggested could be jack said he was feeling a bit guilty about wishing the worst for americare regarding the first case ill try to calm down maybe i should go do more reading on infectious diseases thats the spirit laurie said instead of stressing yourself out you should treat these cases as an opportunity to learn after all thats part of the fun of this job jack tried vainly to peer through lauries plastic face mask to get an idea of whether she was being serious or just mocking him unfortunately with all the reflections from the overhead lights he couldnt tell leaving laurie jack stopped briefly at chets table chet was not in a good mood hell he said its going to take me all day to trace these bullet paths the way bingham suggested if he wants to be this particular i wonder why he doesnt do the case himself yell if you need any help jack said ill be happy to come down and lend a hand i might do that chet said jack disposed of his protective gear changed into his street clothes and made sure his ventilation charger was plugged in then he got the autopsy folders for lopez and lagenthorpe from hesters folder he looked up her next of kin a sister was listed whose address was the same as the deceased jack surmised they were roommates he copied down the phone number next jack sought out vinnie whom he found coming out of the walkin cooler where hed just deposited lagenthorpes corpse where are all the samples from our two cases jack asked i got em all under control vinnie said i want to take them upstairs myself jack said are you sure vinnie asked running up the samples to the various labs was always an excuse for a coffee break im positive jack said once he was armed with all the samples plus the autopsy folders jack set out for his office but he made two detours the first was to the microbiology lab where he sought out agnes finn i was impressed with your diagnosis of tularemia agnes said im getting a lot of compliments out of that one jack said got something for me today agnes asked eyeing jacks armful of samples i do indeed jack said he found the appropriate sample from lopez and put it on the corner of agness desk this is another probable tularemia another sample will come up from a case laurie montgomery is doing as we speak i want them both tested for tularemia the reference lab is very eager to follow up on the hard case so that wont be difficult i should have results back today what else well this one is a mystery jack said he put several samples from lagenthorpe on agness desk i dont have any idea what this patient had all i know is that its not plague and its not tularemia jack went on to describe the lagenthorpe case giving agnes all the positive findings she was especially interested that no bacteria had been reported on the gram stain of the sputum have you thought of virus agnes asked as much as my limited infectious disease knowledge would allow jack admitted hantavirus crossed my mind but there was not a lot of hemorrhage ill start some viral screening with tissue cultures agnes said i plan to do some reading and maybe ill have another idea jack said ill be here agnes assured him leaving microbiology jack went up to the fifthfloor histology lab wake up girls we have a visitor one of the histology techs shouted laughter echoed around the room jack smiled he always enjoyed visiting histology the entire group of women who worked there always seemed to be in the best of moods jack was particularly fond of maureen oconner a busty redhead with a devilish twinkle in her eye he was pleased when he saw her round the corner of the lab bench wiping her hands on a towel the front of her lab coat was stained a rainbow of colors well now dr stapleton she said in her pleasant brogue what can we do for the likes of you i need a favor jack said a favor he says maureen repeated you hear that girls what should we ask in return more laughter erupted it was common knowledge that jack and chet were the only two unmarried male doctors and the histology women liked to tease them jack unloaded his armful of sample bottles separating lagenthorpes from lopezs id like to do frozen sections on lagenthorpe he said just a few slides from each organ of course i want a set of the regular slides as well what about stains maureen asked just the usual jack said are you looking for anything in particular maureen inquired some sort of microbe jack said but thats all i can tell you well give you a call maureen said ill get right on it back in his office jack went through his messages there was nothing of interest clearing a space in front of himself he set down lopezs and lagenthorpes folders intending to dictate the autopsy findings and then call the next of kin he even intended to call the next of kin of the case laurie was doing but instead his eye caught sight of his copy of harrisons textbook of medicine pulling out the book jack cracked it open to the section on infectious disease and began reading there was a lot of material almost five hundred pages but he was able to scan quickly since much of it was information hed committed to memory at some point in his professional career jack had gotten to the chapters on specific bacterial infections when maureen called she said that the frozen section slides were ready jack immediately walked down to the lab to retrieve them he carried them back to his office and moved his microscope to the center of the desk the slides were organized by organ jack looked at the sections of the lung first what impressed him most was the amount of swelling of the lung tissue and the fact that he saw no bacteria looking at the heart sections he could immediately see why the heart had appeared swollen there was a massive amount of inflammation and the spaces between the heart muscle cells were filled with fluid switching to a higher power of magnification jack immediately appreciated the primary pathology the cells lining the blood vessels that coursed through the heart were severely damaged as a result many of these blood vessels had become occluded with blood clots causing multiple tiny heart attacks with a shot of adrenaline coursing through his own circulation from the excitement of discovery jack quickly switched back to the section of lung using the same high power he saw identical pathology in the walls of the tiny blood vessels a finding he hadnt noticed on his first examination jack exchanged the lung section with one from the spleen adjusting the focus he saw the same pathology obviously it was a significant finding one that immediately suggested a possible diagnosis jack pushed back from his desk and made a quick trip back to the micro lab and sought out agnes he found her at one of the labs many incubators hold up on the tissue cultures on lagenthorpe he said breathlessly i got some new information youre going to love agnes regarded him curiously through her thick glasses its an endothelial disease jack said excitedly the patient had an acute infectious disease without bacteria seen or cultured that should have given it away he also had the faintest beginnings of a rash that included his palms and soles plus hed been suspected of having appendicitis guess why muscle tenderness agnes said exactly jack said so what does that make you think of rickettsia agnes said bingo jack said and he punched the air for emphasis good old rocky mountain spotted fever now can you confirm it its as difficult as tularemia agnes said well have to send it out again there is a direct immunofluorescent technique but we dont have the reagent but i know the city reference lab has it because thered been an outbreak of rocky mountain spotted fever in the bronx in eightyseven get it over there right away jack said tell them we want a reading as soon as they can get it to us will do agnes said youre a doll jack said he started for the door before he got there agnes called out to him i appreciate you letting me know about this as soon as you did she said rickettsias are extremely dangerous for us lab workers in an aerosol form it is highly contagious its as bad or worse than tularemia needless to say be careful jack told her friday pm march helen robinson brushed her hair with quick strokes she was excited having just hung up the phone with her main contact at national healths home office she wanted to get in to see robert barker as soon as possible she knew he was going to love what she had to tell him stepping back from the mirror helen surveyed herself from both the right and the left satisfied she closed the closet door and headed out of her office her usual method of contacting robert was merely to drop in on him but she thought the information she now had justified a more formal approach shed asked one of the secretaries to call ahead the secretary had reported back that robert was available at that very moment not that helen was surprised helen had been cultivating robert for the last year she started when it became apparent to her that robert could ascend to the presidency sensing the man had a salacious streak shed deliberately fanned the fires of his imagination it was easy although she knew she treaded a fine line she wanted to encourage him but not to the point where she would have to openly deny him in reality she found him physically unpleasant at best helens goal was roberts position she wanted to be executive director of accounts and could see no reason why she shouldnt be her only problem was that she was younger than the others in the department she felt that was the handicap that her cultivation of robert could overcome ah helen my dear robert said as helen demurely stepped into his office he leaped to his feet and closed the door behind her helen perched on the arm of the chair as was her custom she crossed her legs and her skirt hiked up well above her knee she noticed the photo of roberts wife was lying facedown as usual how about some coffee robert offered taking his seat and assuming his customary hypnotic stare ive just spoken with gertrude wilson over at national health helen began im sure you know her of course robert said shes one of the more senior vice presidents shes also one of my most trusted contacts helen said and she is a fan of willow and heath uhhuh robert said she told me two very interesting things helen said first of all national healths main hospital here in the city compares very favorably with other similar hospitals when it comes to hospitalbased infections or what they like to call nosocomial infections uhhuh robert repeated national health has followed all the recommendations of the cdc and the joint commission on accreditation helen said robert shook his head slightly as if waking up it had taken a moment for helens comments to penetrate his preoccupied brain wait a second he said he looked away to organize his thoughts this doesnt sound like good news to me i thought my secretary told me you had good news hear me out helen said although they have an overall good nosocomial record theyve had some recent troubles in their new york facility that theyre very sensitive about and would hate to be made public there were three episodes in particular one involved an extended outbreak of staph in the intensivecare units that gave them a real problem until it was discovered a number of the nursing staff were carriers and had to be given courses of antibiotics i tell you this stuff is frightening when you hear about it what were the other problems robert asked for the moment he tried to avoid looking at helen they had another kind of bacterial problem originate in their kitchen helen said a lot of patients got serious diarrhea a few even died and the last problem was an outbreak of hospitalbased hepatitis that killed several as well that doesnt sound like such a good record to me robert said it is when you compare it with some of the other hospitals helen said i tell you its scary but the point is that national health is sensitive about this nosocomial infection issue gertrude specifically told me that national health would never in a million years consider running an ad campaign based on it perfect robert exclaimed that is good news what have you told terese hagen nothing of course helen said you told me to brief you first excellent job robert said he pushed himself up onto his long thin legs and paced this couldnt be better ive got terese just where i want her what do you want me to tell her helen asked just tell her that you have confirmed national health has an excellent record visàvis nosocomial infection robert said i want to encourage her to go ahead with her campaign because it will surely bomb but well lose the account helen said not necessarily robert said youve found out in the past that they are interested in talking heads spots with celebrities weve communicated that to terese time and time again and she has ignored it im going to go behind her back and line up a few of the stars from some of the current hospitalbased tv dramas theyd be perfect for testimonials terese hagen will bomb and well be able to step in with our own campaign ingenious helen said she slid off the arm of her chair ill start the ball rolling by calling terese hagen immediately helen scooted back to her own office and had a secretary put in a call to terese as she waited she complimented herself on the conversation shed just had with robert it couldnt have gone any better had she scripted it her position in the firm was looking better and better miss hagen is downstairs in the arena the secretary reported do you want me to call down there no helen said ill head down there in person leaving the carpeted tranquillity of the account executive area helen descended the stairs to the studio floor her pumps echoed loudly on the metal steps she liked the idea of talking with terese in person although shed not wanted to go to tereses office where shed feel intimidated helen rapped loudly on the doorjamb before entering terese was sitting at a large table covered with storyboards and tissues also present were colleen anderson alice gerber and a man helen did not know he was introduced as nelson friedman ive got the information you requested helen said to terese she forced her face into a broad smile good news or bad terese asked id say very good helen said lets have it terese said she leaned back in her chair helen described national healths positive nosocomial record she even told terese something she hadnt told robert national healths hospital infection rates were better than americares at the general fabulous terese said thats just what i wanted to know youve been a big help thank you glad to be of service helen said how are you coming with the campaign i feel good about it terese said by monday well have something for taylor and brian to see excellent helen said well if i can do anything else just let me know certainly terese said she walked helen to the door then waved as helen disappeared into the stairwell terese returned to the table and sat back down do you believe her colleen asked i do terese said accounts wouldnt risk lying about stats that we could presumably get elsewhere i dont see how you can trust her colleen said i hate that plastic smile its unnatural hey i said i believed her terese said i didnt say i trusted her thats why i didnt share with her what we are doing here speaking of what we are doing here colleen said you havent exactly said you like it terese sighed as her eyes ranged around at the scattered storyboards i like the hippocrates sequence she said but i dont know about this oliver wendell holmes and this joseph lister material i understand how important washing hands is even in a modern hospital but its not zippy what about that doctor who was up here with you last night alice asked since he suggested this handwashing stuff maybe hell have more of an idea now that weve sketched it out colleen glanced up at terese she was dumbfounded you and jack came here last night she asked yeah we stopped by terese said casually she reached out and adjusted one of the storyboards so she could see it better you didnt tell me that colleen said you didnt ask terese said but its no secret if thats what you are implying my relationship with jack is not romantic and you guys talked about this ad campaign colleen asked i didnt think you wanted him to know about it especially since hed been kinda responsible for the idea i changed my mind terese said i thought he might like it since it deals with the quality of medical care youre full of surprises colleen commented having jack and chet take a look at this is not a bad idea terese said a professional response might be helpful id be happy to make the call colleen offered friday pm march jack had been on the phone for over an hour calling the next of kin of that days three infectious disease cases hed talked with laurie before calling joy hesters sister and roommate jack didnt want laurie to think he was trying to take over her case but she assured him she didnt mind unfortunately jack did not learn anything positive all he was able to do was to confirm a series of negatives such as that none of the patients had had contact with wild animals in general or wild rabbits in particular only donald lagenthorpe had had contact with a pet and that was his girlfriends newly acquired cat which was alive and well hanging up at the end of the final call jack slouched down in his chair and stared moodily at the blank wall the adrenaline rush hed felt earlier with the tentative diagnosis of rocky mountain spotted fever had given way to frustration he seemed to be making no headway the phone startled jack and pulled him out of his gloom the caller identified himself as dr gary eckhart a microbiologist at the city reference lab are you dr stapleton yes i am jack said im reporting a positive reaction for rickettsia rickettsii dr eckhart said your patient had rocky mountain spotted fever will you be reporting this to the board of health or do you want me to do it you do it jack said im not even sure id know whom to call consider it done dr eckhart said he hung up jack slowly replaced the receiver that his diagnosis had been confirmed was as much of a shock as it had been when his diagnoses of the plague and tularemia had been confirmed these developments were incredible within three days hed seen three relatively rare infectious diseases only in new york he thought in his minds eye he saw all those planes calvin had made reference to arriving at kennedy airport from all over the world but jacks shock began to metamorphose to disbelief even with all the planes and all the people arriving from exotic locales carrying all manner of vermin bugs and microbes it seemed too much of a coincidence to see backtoback cases of plague tularemia and now rocky mountain spotted fever jacks analytical mind tried to imagine what the probability of such an occurrence would be id say about zero he said out loud suddenly jack pushed back from his desk and stormed out of his office his disbelief was now changing to something akin to anger jack was sure something weird was going on and for the moment he was taking it personally believing that something had to be done he headed downstairs and presented himself to mrs sanford he demanded to talk with the chief im afraid dr bingham is over at city hall meeting with the mayor and the chief of police mrs sanford said oh hell jack exclaimed is he moving in over there or what theres a lot of controversy surrounding that gunshot case this morning mrs sanford said warily when will he be back jack demanded binghams being unavailable was adding to his frustration i just dont know mrs sanford said but ill be sure to tell him you want to speak with him what about dr washington hes at the same meeting mrs sanford said oh great is there something i can help you with mrs sanford asked jack thought for a moment how about a piece of paper he said i think ill leave a note mrs sanford handed him a sheet of typing paper in block letters jack wrote lagenthorpe had rocky mountain spotted fever then he drew a half dozen large question marks and exclamation points beneath that he wrote the city board of health has been notified by the city microbiological reference lab jack handed the sheet to mrs sanford who promised that shed personally see to it that dr bingham got it as soon as he came in then she asked jack where hed be if the chief wanted to speak with him depends on when he gets back jack said i plan to be out of the office for a while of course he might hear about me before he hears from me mrs sanford regarded him quizzically but jack didnt elaborate jack returned to his office and grabbed his jacket then he descended to the morgue and unlocked his bike binghams exhortations notwithstanding jack was on his way to the manhattan general hospital for two days hed had the suspicion that something unusual was going on over there now he was sure of it after a quick ride jack locked his bike to the same sign hed used on his previous visits and entered the hospital with visiting hours just beginning the lobby was jammed with people particularly around the information booth jack wormed his way through the crowd and climbed the stairs to the second floor he went directly to the lab and waited in line to speak with the receptionist this time he asked to see the director even though his impulse was to march right in martin cheveau made jack wait for a half hour before seeing him jack tried to use the time to calm himself he recognized that over the last four or five years hed become less than tactful in the best of circumstances when he was upset as he was now he could be abrasive a laboratory tech eventually came out and informed jack that dr martin cheveau would see him now thanks for seeing me so promptly jack said as he entered the office despite his best intentions he couldnt avoid a touch of sarcasm im a busy man martin said not bothering to stand up i can well imagine jack said with the string of rare infectious diseases emanating from this hospital on a daily basis id think youd be putting in overtime dr stapleton martin said in a controlled voice i have to tell you that i find your attitude distinctly disagreeable i find yours confusing jack said on my first visit you were the picture of hospitality on my second visit you were just the opposite unfortunately i dont have time for this conversation martin said is there something in particular you wanted to say to me obviously jack said i didnt come over here just for abuse i wanted to ask your professional opinion about how you think three rare arthropodborne diseases have mysteriously occurred in this hospital ive been cultivating my own opinion but as the director of the lab im curious about yours what do you mean three diseases martin asked i just got confirmation that a patient named lagenthorpe who expired here in the general last night had rocky mountain spotted fever i dont believe you martin said jack eyed the man and tried to decide if he was a good actor or truly surprised well then let me ask you a question jack said what would i accomplish by coming over here and telling you something that wasnt true do you think of me as some sort of healthcare provocateur martin didnt answer instead he picked up the phone and paged dr mary zimmerman calling in reinforcements jack asked why cant you and i have a talk im not sure you are capable of normal conversation martin said good technique jack commented when defense doesnt work switch to offense the problem is strategies wont change the facts rickettsias are extremely dangerous in the laboratory maybe we should make sure whoever handled lagenthorpes specimens did so with proper precautions martin pressed his intercom button and paged his chief microbiology tech richard overstreet another thing id like to discuss jack said on my first visit here you told me how discouraging it was to run your lab with the budgets foisted on you by americare on a scale of one to ten how disgruntled are you what are you implying martin demanded ominously at the moment im not implying anything jack said im just asking the phone rang and martin picked it up it was dr mary zimmerman martin asked her if she could come down to the lab since something important had just come up the problem as i see it is that the probability of these three illnesses popping up as they have is close to zero jack said how would you explain it i dont have to listen to this martin snarled but i think you have to consider it jack said richard overstreet appeared in the doorway dressed as hed been before in a white lab coat over surgical scrubs he appeared harried what is it chief he asked he nodded a greeting to jack who returned the gesture ive just learned a patient by the name of lagenthorpe expired from rocky mountain spotted fever martin said gruffly find out who got the samples and who processed them richard stood for a moment obviously shocked by the news that means we had rickettsia in the lab he said im afraid so martin said get right back to me richard vanished and martin turned back to jack now that you have brought us this happy news perhaps you could do us the favor and leave id prefer to hear your opinion as to the origin of these diseases jack said martins face flushed but before he could respond dr mary zimmerman appeared at his door what can i do for you martin she asked she started to tell him that shed just been paged to the er when she caught sight of jack her eyes narrowed she was obviously no happier than martin to see jack howdy doctor jack said cheerfully i was assured we would not see you again dr zimmerman said you can never believe everything you hear jack said just then richard returned clearly distraught it was nancy wiggens he blurted out shes the one who got the sample and processed it herself she called in sick this morning dr zimmerman consulted a note she held in her hand wiggens is one of the patients ive just been called to see in the er she said apparently shes suffering from some sort of fulminant infection oh no richard said whats going on here dr zimmerman demanded dr stapleton just brought news that a patient of ours died from rocky mountain spotted fever martin said nancy was exposed not here in the lab richard said ive been a bear about safety ever since the plague case i have insisted all infectious material be handled in the biosafety iii cabinet if she were exposed it had to be from the patient thats not likely jack said the only other possibility is that the hospital is lousy with ticks dr stapleton your comments are tasteless and inappropriate dr zimmerman said they are a lot worse than that martin said just before you got here dr zimmerman he slanderously suggested that i had something to do with the spread of these latest illnesses thats not true jack corrected i was merely implying that the idea of deliberate spread has to be considered when the probability of them occurring by chance is so negligible it only makes sense whats wrong with you people i think such thoughts are the product of a paranoid mind dr zimmerman said and frankly i dont have time for this nonsense ive got to get to the er in addition to miss wiggens there are two other employees with the same severe symptoms goodbye dr stapleton just a minute jack said let me guess what areas these two other stricken employees work in could they be from nursing and central supply dr zimmerman who was already several steps away from martins door paused and looked back at jack how did you know that she asked im beginning to see a pattern jack said i cant explain it but its there i mean the nurse is regrettable but understandable but someone from central supply listen dr stapleton dr zimmerman said perhaps were in your debt for once again having alerted us to a dangerous disease but we will take over from here and we certainly dont need any of your paranoid delusions good day dr stapleton hold on a minute martin called out to dr zimmerman ill come with you to the er if this is rickettsial disease i want to be sure all samples are handled safely martin grabbed his long white lab coat from a hook behind the door and ran after dr zimmerman jack shook his head in disbelief every visit hed made to the general had been strange and this one was no exception on previous occasions hed been chased out this time hed been all but deserted do you really think these illnesses could have been spread deliberately richard asked jack shrugged to tell you the truth i dont know what to think but there certainly has been some defensive behavior particularly on the part of those two who just left tell me is dr cheveau generally mercurial he seemed to turn on me rather suddenly hes always been a gentleman with me richard said jack got to his feet it must be me then he said and i suppose our relations wont improve after today such is life anyway id better be going i sure hope nancy is okay you and me both richard said jack wandered out of the lab debating what to do next he thought about either going to the emergency room to see about the three sick patients or heading up to central supply for another visit he decided on the emergency room even though dr zimmerman and dr cheveau had headed down there jack thought the chance of another runin was remote given the size of the er and the constant activity there as soon as he arrived he detected a general panic charles kelley was anxiously conferring with several other administrators then clint abelard came dashing through the main ambulance entry only to disappear down the central corridor jack went over to one of the nurses who was busy behind the main counter he introduced himself and asked if the hubbub was about the three sick hospital staff it most certainly is she said theyre trying to decide how best to isolate them any diagnosis jack asked i just heard they suspect rocky mountain spotted fever the nurse said pretty scary jack said very the nurse said one of the patients is a nurse out of the corner of his eye jack saw kelley approaching jack quickly faced away kelley came to the desk and asked the nurse for the phone jack left the bustling er he thought about going up to central supply but decided against it having come close to another confrontation with charles kelley he thought it best to head back to the office although he hadnt accomplished anything at least he was leaving on his own volition uhoh where have you been chet asked as jack came into their office over at the general jack admitted he started organizing the clutter on his desk at least you must have behaved yourself there havent been any frantic calls from the front office i was a good boy jack said well reasonably good the place is in an uproar they have another outbreak this one is rocky mountain spotted fever can you believe it thats incredible chet said thats my feeling exactly jack said he went on to tell chet how hed implied to the head of the lab that outbreaks of three rare infectious arthropodborne diseases in as many days couldnt occur naturally i bet that went over well chet said oh he was indignant jack said but then he got preoccupied with some fresh cases and forgot about me im surprised you werent thrown out again chet said why do you do this to yourself because im convinced that theres something rotten in the state of denmark jack said but enough about me how did your case go chet gave a short scornful laugh and to think i used to like gunshot cases he said this one is kicking up a storm three of the five bullets entered through the back thats going to give the police department a headache jack said and me too chet said oh by the way i got a call from colleen she wants you and me to come by their studio when we leave work tonight listen to this they want our opinion about some ads what do you say you go jack said ive got to get some of these cases of mine signed out im so far behind its scaring me but they want both of us chet said colleen specifically said that in fact she said they particularly wanted you there because you had helped already come on it will be fun they are going to show us a bunch of sketches outlining some potential tv commercials is that really your idea of fun jack asked okay chet admitted ive an ulterior motive im enjoying spending time with colleen but they want both of us help me out all right jack said but for the life of me i dont understand why you think you need me friday pm march jack had insisted on working late chet had obliged by fetching chinese takeout so jack could continue once jack got started he hated to stop by eightthirty colleen had called wondering where they were chet had to nag jack to get him to turn off his microscope and lay down his pen the next problem was jacks bike after much discussion it was decided that chet would take a taxi and jack would ride as he normally did they then met in front of willow and heath after having arrived almost simultaneously a night watchman opened the door for them and made them sign in they boarded the only functioning elevator and jack promptly pressed the eleventh floor you really were here chet said i told you i was jack said i thought you were pulling my leg chet remarked when the doors opened chet was as surprised as jack had been the night before the studio was in full swing as if it were still sometime between nine and five instead of almost nine in the evening the two men stood for a few minutes watching the bustle they were totally ignored some welcoming party jack commented maybe someone should tell them its after quitting time chet said jack peered into colleens office the lights were on but no one was there turning around he recognized alice toiling at her drawing board he walked over to her but she didnt look up excuse me jack said she was working with such concentration he hated to bother her hello hello finally alices head bobbed up and when she caught sight of him her face reflected instant recognition oh gosh sorry she said wiping her hands on a towel welcome she acted selfconscious shed not seen them arrive as she stood and motioned for them to follow her come on im supposed to take you down to the arena uhoh chet said that doesnt sound good they must think were christians alice laughed creatives are sacrificed in the arena not christians she explained terese and colleen greeted them with air kisses the mere touching of cheeks accompanied by a smacking sound it was the kind of ritual that made jack feel distinctly uncomfortable terese got right to business she had the men sit at the table while she and colleen began putting storyboards in front of them maintaining a running commentary on what the storyboards represented both jack and chet were entertained from the start they were particularly taken by the humorous sketches involving oliver wendell holmes and joseph lister visiting the national health hospital and inspecting the hospitals handwashing protocols at the conclusion of each commercial these famous characters in the history of medicine commented on how much more scrupulously the national health hospital followed their teachings than that other hospital well there you have it terese said after the last storyboard was explained and withdrawn what do you men think theyre cute jack admitted and probably effective but they are hardly worth the money thats going to be spent on them but they deal with something associated with the quality of care terese said defensively barely jack said the national health subscribers would be better off if the millions spent on this were put into actual health care well i love them chet said theyre so fresh and delightfully humorous i think theyre great i assume the other hospital refers to the competition jack said most assuredly terese said we feel it would be in bad taste to mention the general by name especially in light of the problems its been having their problems are getting worse jack said theyve had an outbreak of another serious disease this makes three in three days good god terese exclaimed thats awful i certainly hope this gets to the media or is this one going to be a secret i dont know why you keep making this an issue jack snapped theres no way it can be kept a secret it would be if americare had its way terese said heatedly hey are you guys at it again chet said its an ongoing argument terese said i just cant get over the fact that jack does not feel it is his job as a public servant to let the media and hence the public know about these awful diseases i told you ive been specifically informed it is not my job jack shot back wait time out chet called out listen terese jack is right we cant go to the media ourselves thats the chiefs domain via the pr office but jack is no slouch in all this today he went flying over to the general and implied right to their faces that these recent outbreaks arent natural what do you mean not natural terese asked exactly that chet said if they are not natural then they are deliberate somebody is causing them is that true terese asked jack she was shocked its gone through my mind jack admitted im having trouble explaining scientifically everything that has been going on over there why would someone do that terese wondered its absurd is it jack asked could it be the work of some crazy person colleen offered that id doubt jack said there is too much expertise involved and these bugs are dangerous to handle one of the current victims is a lab technician what about a disgruntled employee chet suggested someone with the knowledge and a grudge whos snapped that i think is more likely than some madman jack said in fact the director of the hospital lab is unhappy with the management of the hospital he told me so himself hes had to lay off twenty percent of his workforce oh my god colleen exclaimed do you think it could be him actually i dont jack said frankly too many arrows would point to the director of the lab hed be the first suspect hes been acting defensive but hes not stupid i think that if this series of diseases has been spread deliberately it has to be for a more venal reason like what terese said i think were all jumping off the deep end here maybe so jack said but we have to remember that americare is first and foremost a business i even know something about their philosophy believe me it is bottomline oriented all the way youre suggesting that americare might be spreading disease in its own facility terese asked incredulously that doesnt make any sense im just thinking out loud jack explained for the sake of argument lets assume these illnesses have been deliberately spread now lets look at the index case in each incidence first there was nodelman who had diabetes second there was hard who had a chronic orthopedic problem and lastly there was lagenthorpe who suffered from chronic asthma i see what youre suggesting chet said all of the index cases were the type of patient prepaid plans hate because they lose money on them they simply use too much medical care oh come on terese complained this is ridiculous no wonder you doctors make such horrid businessmen americare would never risk this kind of public relations disaster to rid itself of three problem patients it would make no sense give me a break terese is probably right jack admitted if americare was behind all this they certainly could have done it more expeditiously what truly worries me is that infectious agents are involved if these outbreaks have been deliberate the individual behind them wants to start epidemics not just eliminate specific patients thats even more diabolical terese said i agree jack said it kind of forces us back to considering the improbable idea of a crazy person but if someone is trying to start epidemics why hasnt there been one colleen asked for several reasons jack said first of all the diagnosis has been made relatively rapidly in all three cases second the general has taken these outbreaks seriously and has taken appropriate steps to control them and third the agents involved are poor choices for creating an epidemic here in new york in march youll have to explain colleen said plague tularemia and rocky mountain spotted fever can be transmitted by airborne spread but it is not their usual route the usual route is through an arthropod vector and those specific bugs are not available this time of year especially not in a hospital what do you think of all this terese asked chet me chet asked with a selfconscious laugh i dont know what to think come on terese prodded dont try to protect your friend here whats your gut reaction well it is new york chet said we see a lot of infectious diseases so i suppose im dubious about this notion of a deliberate spread i guess id have to say it sounds a little paranoid to me i do know that jack dislikes americare is that true terese asked jack i hate them jack admitted why id rather not talk about it jack said its personal well terese said she put her hand on top of the stack of storyboards dr stapletons disdain for medical advertising aside you men think these sketches are okay i told you i think theyre great chet said i imagine they will be effective jack grudgingly agreed do either of you have any other suggestions we could use regarding preventing hospital infections terese asked maybe you could do something concerning steam sterilization for instruments and devices jack said hospitals differ in their protocols robert koch was involved with that advance and he was a colorful character terese wrote down the suggestion anything else she asked im afraid im not very good at this chet admitted but why dont we all head over to the auction house for a couple of drinks with the proper lubricant who knows what i might come up with the women declined terese explained that they had to continue working on the sketches she said that by monday they had to have something significant to show to the president and the ceo how about tomorrow night chet suggested well see terese said five minutes later jack and chet were heading down in the elevator that was the bums rush chet complained they are driven women jack said how about you chet asked want to stop for a beer i think ill head home and see if the guys are playing basketball jack said i could use some exercise i feel wired basketball at this hour chet questioned friday night is a big night in the neighborhood jack said the two men parted company in front of the willow and heath building chet jumped into a cab and jack undid his medley of locks climbing on his bike jack pedaled north on madison then crossed over to fifth avenue at fiftyninth street from there he entered central park although his usual style was to ride fast jack kept his pace slow he was mulling over the conversation hed just had it had been the first time that hed put his suspicions into words he felt anxious as a result chet had suggested he was paranoid and jack had to admit there had to be some truth in it ever since americare had effectively gobbled up his practice jack felt that death had been stalking him first it had robbed him of his family then it had threatened his own life with depression it had even filled his daily routine with the second specialty hed chosen and now death seemed to be teasing him with these outbreaks even mocking him with inexplicable details as jack rode deeper into the dark deserted park its gloomy and somber views added to his disquietude in areas where hed seen beauty that morning on his way to work now he saw ghastly skeletons of leafless trees silhouetted against an eerily bleached sky even the distant sawtooth skyline of the city seemed ominous jack put muscle into his pedaling and his bike gained speed for an irrational moment he was afraid to look back over his shoulder he had the creepy feeling that something was bearing down on him jack streaked into a puddle of light beneath a lonely streetlight braked and skidded to a stop he forced himself to turn around and face his pursuer but there was nothing there jack strained to see into the distant shadows and as he did he understood that what was threatening him was coming from inside his own head it was the depression that had paralyzed him after his familys tragedy angry with himself jack began pedaling again he was embarrassed by his childlike fear he thought he had more control obviously he was letting this episode with the outbreaks affect him far too much laurie had been right he was too emotionally involved having faced his fears jack felt better but he noticed that the park still looked sinister people had warned him about riding in the park at night but jack had always ignored their admonitions now for the first time he wondered if he was being foolish emerging from the park onto central park west was like escaping from a nightmare from the dark scary loneliness of the parks interior he was instantly thrust into a rallylike bustle of yellow cabs racing northward the city had come alive there were even people calmly walking on the sidewalks the farther north jack rode the more the environment deteriorated beyond th street the buildings became noticeably shabbier some were even boarded up and appeared abandoned there was more litter in the street stray dogs plundered overturned trash cans jack turned left onto th street as he rode along his street the neighborhood seemed more depressed than usual to him the minor epiphany in the park had opened jacks eyes to just how dilapidated the area was jack stopped at the playground where he played basketball by grabbing onto the chainlink fence that separated it from the street his feet remained snug in his toe clips as jack had expected the court was in full use the mercury vapor lights that hed paid to be installed were ablaze jack recognized many of the players as they surged up and down the court warren by far the best player was there and jack could hear him urging his teammates to greater effort the team that lost would have to sit out since a bevy of other players waited impatiently on the sidelines the competition was always fierce while jack was watching warren sank the final basket of the game and the losing team slunk off the court momentarily disgraced as the new game was being organized warren caught sight of jack he waved and strutted over it was the winning team walk hey doc whatcha know warren asked you coming out to run or what warren was a handsome africanamerican with a shaved head a groomed mustache and a body like one of the greek statues in the metropolitan museum it had taken jack several months to cultivate warrens acquaintance they had developed a friendship of sorts but it was based more on a shared love of street basketball than anything else jack didnt know much about warren except that he was the best basketball player and also the de facto leader of the local gang jack suspected that the two positions went hand in hand i was thinking about coming out for a run jack said whos got winners getting into the game could be a tricky business when jack had first moved to the neighborhood it had taken him a month of coming to the court and patiently waiting until hed been invited to play then hed had to prove himself once hed demonstrated he was capable of putting the ball in the basket on a consistent basis hed been tolerated things got a bit better when jack had paid to have the lights installed and the backboards refurbished but not a lot there were only two other honkies besides jack who were allowed to play being caucasian was a definite disadvantage on the neighborhood playground you had to know the rules rons got winners and then jake warren said but i can get you on my team flashs old lady wants him home ill be out jack said he pushed off from the fence and rode the rest of the way to his building jack got off his bike and hefted it up onto his shoulder before he entered his building he looked up at its facade in his current critical state of mind he had to admit it wasnt pretty in fact it was a downright sorry structure although at one time it must have been rather fancy because a small segment of highly decorative cornice still clung precariously to the roofline two of the windows on the third floor were boarded up the building was six stories constructed of brick and had two apartments per floor jack shared the fourth floor with denise a husbandless teenager with two children jack pushed the front door open with his foot it had no lock he started up the stairs careful to avoid any debris as jack passed the second floor he heard the sorry sounds of a vehement argument followed by the noise of breaking glass unfortunately this was a nightly occurrence with the bike balanced on his shoulder it took jack some maneuvering to get himself situated in front of his apartment door he was fumbling in his pocket for his key when he noticed he didnt need it the doorjamb opposite his lock was splintered jack pushed his door open it was dark inside he listened but only heard renewed yelling from a and the traffic out in the street his apartment was eerily quiet he put his bike down and reached in and turned on the overhead light the living room was in shambles jack didnt have much furniture but what he had was either tipped over emptied or broken he noticed that a small radio that usually stood on the desk was gone jack wheeled the bike into the room and leaned it against the wall he took off his jacket and draped it over the bike then he walked over to the desk the drawers had been pulled out and dumped amid the rubble on the floor was a photo album jack bent down and picked it up he opened the cover and breathed a sigh of relief it was unscathed it was the only possession he cared about jack placed the photo album on the windowsill and walked into the bedroom he switched on the light and saw a similar scene most of his clothes had been pulled from his closet and from his bureau and tossed onto the floor the condition of the bathroom mirrored that of the living room and the bedroom the contents of the medicine cabinet had been dumped into the bathtub jack walked from the bedroom to the kitchen expecting more of the same he flipped on the light a slight gasp escaped from his lips we were beginning to wonder about you a large africanamerican male said he was sitting at jacks table dressed totally in black leather including gloves and a visorless hat wed run out of your beer and we were getting antsy there were three other men dressed in identical fashion to the first one was half sitting on the windowsill the two others were to jacks immediate right leaning against the kitchen cabinet on the table was an impressive array of weaponry including machine pistols jack didnt recognize any of these men he was shocked that they were still there hed been robbed before but nobody had stayed to drink his beer how about coming over and sitting yourself down the large black man said jack hesitated he knew the door to the hall was open could he make it before they picked up their guns jack doubted it and he wasnt about to try come on man the black man said get your white ass over here reluctantly jack did as he was told warily he sat down and faced his uninvited visitor we might as well be civilized about this the black man said my name is twin this heres reginald twin pointed to the man at the window jack glanced in reginalds direction he was toying with a toothpick and sucking his teeth he regarded jack with obvious disdain although he wasnt quite as muscular as warren he was in the same category jack could see he had the words black kings tattooed on the volar surface of his right forearm now reginald is pissed twin continued because you aint got shit here in this apartment i mean there isnt even a tv you see part of the deal was that wed have pickings over your stuff what kind of deal are you talking about jack asked lets put it this way twin said me and my brothers are being paid some small change to come way the hell over here to rough you up a bit nothing major despite the artillery you see on the table its supposed to be some kind of warning now i dont know the details but apparently youve been making a pain of yourself at some hospital and got a bunch of people all riled up im supposed to remind you to do your job and let them do theirs does that make any more sense to you than it does to me i mean ive never done anything like this before i think i catch your drift jack said im glad twin said otherwise wed have to break a few fingers or something we werent supposed to hurt you bad but when reginald starts its hard to stop him especially when hes pissed he needs something are you sure you dont have a tv or something hidden around here he just came in with a bike one of the other men said what about that reginald twin asked you want a new bike reginald leaned forward so he could see into the living room he shrugged his shoulders i think you got yourself a deal twin said he stood up whos paying you to do this jack asked twin raised his eyebrows and laughed now it wouldnt be kosher of me to tell you that now would it but at least youve got the balls to ask jack was about to ask another question when he was viciously coldcocked by twin the force of the sucker punch knocked jack over backward and he sprawled limply on the floor the room swam before his eyes hovering close to unconsciousness he felt his wallet being pulled from his trousers there was muffled laughter followed by a final agonizing kick in the stomach then there was absolute blackness friday pm march the first thing jack was aware of was a ringing in his head slowly he opened his eyes and found himself staring directly up at the ceiling fixture in the kitchen wondering what he was doing on the kitchen floor he tried to get up when he moved he felt a sharp pain in his jaw that made him lie back down that was when he realized the ringing was intermittent and it wasnt in his head it was the wall phone directly above him jack rolled over onto his stomach from that position he pushed himself up onto his knees hed never been knocked out before and he couldnt believe how weak he felt gingerly he felt along his jawline thankfully he didnt feel any jagged edges of broken bones equally carefully he palpated his tender abdomen that was less painful than the jaw so he assumed thered been no internal damage the phone continued to ring insistently finally jack reached up and took it off the hook as he said hello he eased himself into a sitting position on the floor with his back against the kitchen cabinets his voice sounded strange even to himself oh no im sorry terese said when she heard his voice youve been asleep i shouldnt have called so late what time is it jack asked its almost twelve terese said were still here in the studio and sometimes we forget that the rest of the world sleeps normal hours i wanted to ask a question about sterilization but ill call you tomorrow im sorry to have awakened you actually ive been unconscious on my kitchen floor jack said is that some kind of joke terese asked i wish jack said i came home to a ransacked apartment and unfortunately the ransackers were still here to add insult to injury they also kind of beat me up are you all right terese asked urgently i think so jack said but i think i chipped a tooth were you really unconscious terese asked im afraid so jack said i still feel weak listen terese said decisively i want you to call the police immediately and im coming over wait a sec jack said first of all the police wont do anything i mean what can they do it was four gang members and theres a million of them in the city i dont care i want you to call the police terese said ill be over there in fifteen minutes terese this isnt the best neighborhood jack said he could tell shed made up her mind but he persisted you dont have to come im okay honest i dont want to hear any excuses about not calling the police terese said i should be there in fifteen minutes jack found himself holding a dead telephone terese had hung up dutifully jack dialed and gave the information when he was asked if he was in any current danger he said no the operator said the officers would be there as soon as possible jack pushed himself up onto wobbly legs and walked out into his living room briefly he looked for his bike but then vaguely remembered something about his attackers wanting it in the bathroom he bared his teeth and examined them as hed suspected from touching it with his tongue his left front tooth had a small chip twin must have had something like brass knuckles under his gloves to jacks surprise the police arrived within ten minutes there were two officers an africanamerican by the name of david jefferson and a latino juan sanchez they listened politely to jacks tale of woe wrote down the particulars including the make of the missing bike and asked jack if hed care to come to the precinct to look at mug shots of various local gang members jack declined through warren he understood that the gangs did not fear the police consequently jack knew the police could not protect him from the gangs so he decided not to tell the police everything but at least hed satisfied tereses demand and would be able to collect insurance on his bike excuse me doc david jefferson said as the police were leaving jack had informed them he was a medical examiner how come you live in this neighborhood arent you asking for trouble i ask myself the same question jack said after the police had left jack closed his splintered door and leaned against it while surveying his apartment somehow he would have to find the energy to clean it up at the moment it seemed like an overwhelming task a knock that he could feel more than hear made him reopen the door it was terese ah thank god its you terese said she came into the apartment you werent kidding when you said this wasnt the best neighborhood just climbing these stairs was a trauma if it hadnt been you opening the door i might have screamed i tried to warn you jack said let me look at you terese said wheres the best light jack shrugged you choose he said maybe the bathroom terese dragged jack into the bathroom and examined his face you have a tiny cut over your jawbone she said im not surprised jack said he then showed her the chipped tooth why did they beat you up terese said i hope you werent playing hero quite the contrary jack said i was terrified into total immobility i was suckerpunched this was evidently some kind of warning for me to stay out of the manhattan general what on earth are you talking about terese demanded jack told her all the things he hadnt told the police he even told her why he hadnt told the police this is getting more and more unbelievable terese said what are you going to do to tell the truth i havent had a lot of time to think about it jack said well i know one thing you are going to do terese said you are going to the emergency room come on jack complained im fine my jaw is sore but big deal you were knocked out terese reminded him you should be seen im not even a doctor and i know that much jack opened his mouth to protest further but he didnt he knew she was right he should be seen after a head injury serious enough to render him unconscious there was the worry of intracranial hemorrhage he should have a basic neurological exam jack rescued his jacket from the floor then he followed terese down the stairs to the street to catch a cab they walked to columbus avenue where do you want to go terese asked once they were in the taxi i think ill stay away from the general for the time being jack said with a smile lets go uptown to columbiapresbyterian fine terese said she gave directions to the cabdriver and settled back in her seat terese i really appreciate your coming over jack said you didnt have to and i certainly didnt expect it im touched you would have done it for me terese said would he have jack wondered he didnt know the whole day had been confusing the visit to the emergency room went smoothly they had to wait as auto accidents knife wounds and heart attacks were given priority but eventually jack was seen terese insisted on staying the whole time and even accompanied him into the examining room when the er resident learned jack was a medical examiner he insisted jack be seen by the neurology consult the neurology resident went over jack with utmost care he declared him fit and said he didnt even think an x ray was indicated unless jack felt strongly otherwise jack didnt the one thing i do recommend is that you be observed overnight the neurology resident said he then turned to terese and said mrs stapleton just wake him up occasionally and make sure he behaves normally also check that his pupils remain the same size okay okay terese said later as they were walking out of the hospital jack commented that he was impressed with her equanimity when shed been addressed as mrs stapleton i thought it would have embarrassed the man to have corrected him terese said but im going to take his recommendations quite seriously you are coming home with me terese jack complained no arguments terese commanded you heard the doctor theres no way id allow you to go back to that hellhole of yours tonight with his head mildly throbbing and his jaw aching and his stomach sore jack surrendered okay he said but this is all far beyond the call of duty jack felt truly grateful as they rode up in the elevator in tereses posh highrise no one had been as gracious to him as terese in years between her concern and generosity he felt that hed misjudged her ive a guest room that im confident youll find comfortable she said as they walked down a carpeted hallway whenever my folks come to town it is hard to get them to leave tereses apartment was picture perfect jack was amazed how neat it was even the magazines were arranged carefully on the coffee table as if she expected architectural digest to do a photo shoot the guest room was quaint with flowerprint drapes carpet and bedspread that all matched jack joked that he hoped he didnt get disoriented since he might have trouble finding the bed after providing jack with a bottle of aspirin terese left him to shower after hed finished he donned a terrycloth bathrobe which shed laid out thus attired he poked his head out into the living room and saw her sitting on the couch reading he walked out and sat across from her arent you going to bed he asked i wanted to be sure you were okay she said she leaned forward to stare directly into his face your pupils look equal to me to me too jack said he laughed you are taking those doctors orders seriously youd better believe it she said ill be coming in to wake you up so be prepared i know better than to argue jack said how do you feel in general terese asked physically or mentally mentally terese said physically i have a pretty good idea to be truthful the experience has scared me jack admitted i know enough about these gangs to be afraid of them thats why i wanted you to call the police terese said you dont understand jack said the police cant really help me i mean i didnt even bother to tell them the possible name of the gang or the first names of the intruders even if the police picked them up all theyd do is slap their wrists then theyll be back on the street so what are you going to do terese asked i suppose im going to stay the hell away from the general jack said seems like thats going to make everybody happy even my own boss told me not to go i suppose i can do my job without going over there im relieved terese said i was worried youd try to be a hero and take the warning as a challenge you said that before jack said but dont worry im no hero what about this bikeriding around this city terese asked and riding through the park at night and what about living where you do the fact is i do worry i worry that youre either oblivious to danger or courting it which is it jack looked into tereses pale blue eyes she was asking questions that he strictly avoided the answers were too personal but after the concern that shed demonstrated that evening and the effort shed expended on his behalf he felt she deserved some explanation i suppose i have been courting danger he said can i ask why i guess i havent been worried about dying jack said in fact there was a time when i felt dying would be a relief a few years back i had trouble with depression and i suppose its always going to be there in the background i can relate to that terese said i had a bout with depression as well was yours associated with a particular event if i may ask jack bit the inside of his lip he felt uncomfortable talking about such issues but now that hed started it was hard to turn back my wife died jack managed he couldnt get himself to mention the children im sorry terese said empathetically she paused a moment and then said mine was due to the death of my only child jack turned his head away tereses admission brought instant tears to his eyes he took a deep breath and then looked back at this complicated woman she was a harddriving executive of that he was sure from the moment hed met her but now he knew there was more i guess we have more in common than just disliking discos he said in an attempt to lighten the atmosphere i think weve both been emotionally scarred terese said and weve both overly invested ourselves in our careers im not so sure we share that jack said im not as committed to my career as i once was nor as i think you are the changes that have come to medicine have robbed me of some of that terese stood up jack did the same they were standing close enough to appreciate each other physically i guess i meant more that we both are afraid of emotional commitment terese said weve both been wounded that i can agree to jack said terese kissed the tips of her fingers and then touched them gently to jacks lips ill be in to wake you in a few hours she said so be prepared i hate to be putting you through all this jack said im enjoying this little bit of mothering terese said sleep well they parted jack walked back toward the guest room but before he got to the door terese called out one more question why do you live in that awful slum i guess i dont feel as if i deserve to be all that happy jack said terese thought about that for a moment then smiled well i shouldnt imagine id understand everything she said good night good night jack echoed saturday am march true to her word terese had come into jacks room and awakened him several times during the night each time theyd talked for a few minutes by the time jack awakened in the morning he felt conflicted he was still thankful for tereses ministrations but he felt embarrassed by how much of himself hed revealed as terese made him breakfast it became apparent that she felt as awkward as he at eightthirty with mutual relief they parted company in front of tereses building she was off to the studio for what she thought would be a marathon session he headed for his apartment jack spent a few hours cleaning up the debris left by the black kings with some rudimentary tools he even repaired his door as best he could with his apartment taken care of jack headed to the morgue he wasnt scheduled to work that weekend but he wanted to spend more time on his backlog of autopsies that had yet to be signed out he also wanted to check on any infectious cases that might have come in during the night from the general knowing that there had been three reportedly fulminant cases of rocky mountain spotted fever in the emergency room the day before he was afraid of what he might find jack missed his bike and thought about getting another one to get to work he took the subway but it wasnt convenient he had to change trains twice the new york subway system was fine for getting from north to south but west to east was another story entirely even with the multiple train changing jack still had to walk six blocks with a light rain falling and no umbrella he was wet by the time he got to the medical examiners office at noon weekends were far different than weekdays at the morgue there was much less commotion jack used the front entrance and had the receptionist buzz him into the id area a distraught family was in one of the identification rooms jack could hear sobbing as he passed by jack found the schedule that listed the doctors on call for the weekend and was pleased to see that laurie was among them he also found the master list of cases that had come in the previous night scanning it he was sickened to see a familiar name nancy wiggens had been brought in at four am the provisional diagnosis was rocky mountain spotted fever jack found two more cases with the same diagnosis valerie schafer aged thirtythree and carmen chavez aged fortyseven jack assumed they were the other two cases in the generals emergency room the day before jack went downstairs and peeked into the autopsy room two tables were in use jack couldnt tell who the doctors were but judging by height he guessed one of them was laurie after changing into scrubs and donning protective gear jack entered through the washroom what are you doing here laurie asked when she caught sight of jack youre supposed to be off enjoying yourself just cant keep away jack quipped he leaned over to see the face of the patient laurie was working on and his heart sank staring up at him with lifeless eyes was nancy wiggens in death she appeared even younger than she had in life jack quickly looked away did you know this individual laurie asked her own emotional antennae had instantly picked up jacks reaction vaguely jack admitted its a terrible thing when healthcare workers succumb to their patients illnesses laurie remarked the patient i did before this one was a nurse whod ministered to the patient you did yesterday id assumed as much jack said what about the third case i did her first laurie said she was from central supply i couldnt quite figure how she contracted it tell me about it jack said ive done two other people from central supply one with plague and one with tularemia i cant understand it either somebody better figure it out laurie said i couldnt agree more jack said then he pointed to nancys organs whatd you find its all been consistent with rocky mountain spotted fever laurie said are you interested to see i sure am jack said laurie took time out to show all the relevant pathology to jack jack told her the findings were the mirror image of those hed seen with lagenthorpe it makes you wonder why just three got sick since they were so sick laurie said the interval from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was a lot shorter than usual it suggests that the microbes were particularly pathogenic yet if they were where are the other patients janice told me that as far as the hospital knows there are no more cases there was a similar pattern with the other diseases jack said i cant explain it just like i cant explain so many other aspects of these outbreaks thats why theyve been driving me crazy laurie glanced up at the clock and was surprised by the time ive got to get a move on here she said sal has to leave early why dont i help jack offered tell sal he can go now are you serious laurie asked absolutely jack said lets get it done sal was happy to leave a little early laurie and jack worked well together and finished up the case in good time they walked out of the autopsy room together how about a bite up in the lunchroom laurie asked my treat youre on jack said they disposed of their isolation gear and disappeared into their respective locker rooms when jack was dressed he went out into the hall and waited for laurie to appear you didnt have to wait for laurie began to say but stopped your jaw is swollen she said thats not all jack said he bared his teeth and pointed to his left incisor see the chip he asked of course i do laurie said her hands went onto her hips and her eyes narrowed she looked like an irate mother confronting a naughty child did you fall off of that bike she asked i wish jack said with a mirthless laugh he then told her the whole story minus the part about terese lauries expression changed from mock anger to disbelief thats extortion she said indignantly i suppose it is in a way jack said but come on lets not let it upset our gourmet lunch they did the best they could with the vending machines on the second floor laurie got a soup while jack settled on a tunafish salad sandwich they took their food to a table and sat down the more i think about what youve told me the crazier i think it sounds laurie said hows your apartment a bit dilapidated jack said but it wasnt so great before this happened so it doesnt much matter the worst thing is that they took my bike i think you should move laurie said you shouldnt be living there anyway its only the second breakin jack said i hope youre not planning on staying in tonight laurie said how depressing no im busy tonight jack said ive got a group of nuns coming into town who im supposed to show around laurie laughed hey my folks are having a little dinner party tonight would you care to come along it would be a lot more cheerful than sitting in your plundered apartment thats very thoughtful of you jack said as with tereses actions the night before this invitation was totally unexpected jack was moved i would enjoy your company laurie said what do you say you do realize that im not particularly social jack said im aware of that laurie said i dont mean to put you on the spot you dont even have to tell me now the dinner is at eight and you can call me a half hour before if you decide to come heres my number she wrote it on a napkin and handed it to him im afraid im not such good company at dinner parties jack said well its up to you laurie said the invitation stands now if youll excuse me ive got two more cases to do jack watched laurie leave hed been impressed with her from the first day but hed always thought of her as one of his more talented colleagues nothing more but now suddenly he saw how strikingly attractive she was with her sculptured features soft skin and beautiful auburn hair laurie waved before slipping out the door and jack waved back disconcertedly he stood up discarded his trash and headed up to his office in the elevator he wondered what was happening to him it had taken him years to stabilize his life and now his wellconstructed cocoon seemed to be unraveling once inside his office jack sat down at his desk he rubbed his temples to try to calm himself he was becoming agitated again and he knew that when he became agitated he could be impulsive as soon as he felt capable of concentrating he pulled the closest folder toward him and flipped it open then he went to work by four oclock jack had accomplished as much paperwork as he could handle leaving the medical examiners office he took the subway as he sat in the bouncing rail cars with the other silent zombielike people he told himself he had to get another bike commuting underground like a mole was not going to work for him arriving home jack lost no time he took his stairs two at a time finding a drunk homeless person asleep on the first landing didnt faze him he just stepped over the man and continued with his anxiety jack needed exercise and the sooner he got out on the basketball court the happier hed be jack hesitated briefly at his door it seemed to be in the same shape as hed left it he unlocked it and peered into the apartment it too seemed undisturbed somewhat superstitiously jack walked over to the kitchen and looked in he was relieved to see that no one was there in the bedroom jack pulled out his basketball gear oversized sweatpants a turtleneck and a sweater he quickly changed after lacing up his hightops he grabbed a headband a basketball and was back out the door saturday afternoon was always a big day at the playground provided the weather cooperated usually twenty to thirty people showed up ready to run and this particular saturday was no exception the morning rain had long since stopped as jack approached the court he counted fourteen people waiting to play that meant hed probably have to wait through two more games beyond the present match before he could hope to join jack nodded subdued greetings to some of the people he recognized the etiquette required that no emotion be shown after hed stood on the sidelines for the appropriate amount of time he asked who had winners he was told that david had winners jack was acquainted with david careful to suppress the eagerness he felt jack sidled up to david you got winners jack asked pretending to be uninterested yeah i got winners david said he went through some minor ducking and weaving that jack had learned to recognize as posturing jack had also learned by sore experience not to imitate it you got five jack asked david already had his team lined up so jack had to go through the same process with the next fellow who had winners that was spit whose nickname was based on one of his less endearing mannerisms luckily for jack spit only had four players and since he knew jacks outside shooting ability he agreed to add jack to his roster with his entrance into the game now assured jack took his ball to one of the unused side baskets and began warming up he had a mild headache and his jaw ached but otherwise he felt better than hed expected hed been more concerned about his stomach once he started running around but that didnt bother him in the slightest while jack was busy shooting foul shots warren showed up after hed gone through the same process that jack had done in order to get into the game he wandered over to where jack was practicing hey doc whats happening warren asked he snatched the ball from jacks hands and quickly tossed in a shot that hit nothing but net warrens movements were uncannily fast not much jack said which was the correct reply warrens question was really a greeting in disguise they shot for a while in a ritual fashion first warren would shoot until he missed which wasnt often then jack would do the same while one was shooting the other rebounded warren let me ask you a question jack said during one of his turns shooting you ever hear of a gang by the name of the black kings yeah i think so warren said he fed jack the ball after jack had put in one of his patented longdistance jump shots i think theyre a bunch of losers from down near the bowery how come youre asking just curious jack said he sank another long jump shot he was feeling good warren snatched the ball out of the air as it came through the basket but he didnt pass it back to jack instead he walked it to jack what do you mean curious warren asked he drilled jack with his gunbarrel eyes you aint been curious about any gangs before one of the other things that jack knew about warren was that he was keenly intelligent had he had the opportunity jack was sure hed be a doctor or a lawyer or some other professional i happened to see it tattooed on a guys forearm jack said the guy dead warren asked he was aware of what jack did for a living not yet jack said he rarely risked sarcasm with his playground acquaintances but on this occasion it had just slipped out warren regarded him warily and continued to hold the ball you pulling my chain or what hell no jack said i may be white but i aint stupid warren smiled how come you got banged up on your jaw warren didnt miss a trick just caught an elbow jack said i was in the wrong place at the wrong time warren handed over the ball lets warm up with a little oneonone he said hitormiss for the ball warren got in the game before jack but jack eventually played and played well spits players seemed unbeatable to the chagrin of warren who had to play against them on several occasions by six oclock jack was exhausted and soaked to the skin jack was perfectly happy to leave when everyone else departed en masse for dinner and their usual saturdaynight revelry the basketball court would be empty until the following afternoon a long hot postgame shower was a distinct pleasure for jack when he was finished he dressed in clean clothes and looked into his refrigerator it was a sad scene all his beer had been drunk by the black kings as far as food was concerned he was limited to an old wedge of cheddar cheese and two eggs of dubious age jack closed the refrigerator he wasnt all that hungry anyway in the living room jack sat on his threadbare couch and picked up one of his medical journals his usual evening routine was to read until ninethirty or ten and then fall asleep but tonight he was still restless despite the exercise and he found he couldnt concentrate jack tossed the journal aside and stared at the wall he was lonely and although he was lonely almost every night he felt it more keenly at that moment he kept thinking about terese and how compassionate shed been the night before jack impulsively went to the desk got out the phone book and called willow and heath he wasnt sure if the phones would be manned after hours but eventually someone answered after several wrong extensions he finally got terese on the phone with his heart inexplicably pounding in his chest jack casually told her he was thinking of getting something to eat is this an invitation terese questioned well jack said hesitantly maybe youd like to come along provided you havent eaten yet this is the most roundabout invitation ive gotten since marty berman asked me to the junior prom terese said with a laugh you know what he did he used the conditional he said what would you say if i asked you i guess marty and i have some things in common jack said hardly terese said marty was a skinny runt but as for dinner ill have to take a rain check id love to see you but you know about this deadline we have were hoping that we can get it under control tonight i hope you understand absolutely jack said no problem call me tomorrow terese said maybe in the afternoon we can get together for coffee or something jack promised hed call and wished her good luck then he hung up the phone feeling even lonelier for having made an effort to be sociable after so many years and having been turned down surprising himself anew jack found lauries number and called her trying to cover his nervousness with humor he told her that the group of nuns he was expecting had to cancel does that mean youd like to come to dinner laurie asked if youll have me jack said id be delighted laurie said sunday am march jack was poring over one of his forensic science journals when his phone rang since he had yet to speak that morning his voice was gravelly when he answered i didnt wake you did i laurie asked ive been up for hours jack assured her im calling because you asked me to laurie said otherwise i wouldnt call this early on a sunday morning its not early for me jack said but it was late when you went home laurie said it wasnt that late jack said besides no matter what time i go to bed i always wake up early anyway you wanted me to let you know if there were any infectious deaths from the general last night laurie said there werent janice even told me before she left that there wasnt even anyone ill with rocky mountain spotted fever in the hospital thats good news isnt it very good news jack agreed my parents were quite impressed with you last night laurie added i hope you enjoyed yourself it was a delightful evening jack said frankly im embarrassed i stayed so long thank you for inviting me and thank your parents they couldnt have been more hospitable well have to do it again sometime laurie said absolutely jack said after they had said goodbyes jack hung up the phone and tried to go back to reading but he was momentarily distracted by thoughts of the previous evening he had enjoyed himself in fact hed enjoyed himself much more than he could have imagined and that confused him hed purposefully kept to himself for five years and now without warning he found himself enjoying the company of two very different women what he liked about laurie was how easy she was to be with terese on the other hand could be overbearing even while she was being warmly caring terese was more intimidating than laurie but she was also challenging in a way that was more consistent with jacks reckless lifestyle but now that hed had the opportunity to see laurie interact with her parents he appreciated her open warm personality all the more he imagined having a pompous cardiovascular surgeon for a father couldnt have been easy laurie had tried to engage jack in personal conversation after the older generation had retired but jack had resisted as was his habit yet hed been tempted having opened up a little with terese the night before it had surprised him how good it felt to talk with someone caring but jack had fallen back on his usual stratagem of turning the conversation back to laurie and hed learned some unexpected things most surprising was that she was unattached jack had just assumed someone as desirable and sensitive as laurie would have been involved with someone but laurie insisted she didnt even date much shed explained that shed had a relationship with a police detective for a time but it hadnt worked out eventually jack got back to his journal he read until hunger drove him to a neighborhood deli on his way home from lunch he saw that a group of guys was already beginning to appear on the basketball court eager for more physical activity jack dashed home changed and joined them jack played for several hours unfortunately his shot wasnt as smooth or accurate as on the previous day warren teased him unmercifully especially when he guarded jack during several of the games warren was making up for the ignominy of the previous days defeats at three oclock after another loss which meant jack would be sitting out for at least three games maybe more he gave up and returned to his apartment after a shower he sat down to try to read again but found himself thinking about terese concerned about being rejected a second time jack had not planned on calling her but by four he relented after all she had asked him to call more important he truly wanted to talk with her having partially opened up to her he felt curiously disturbed not to have told her the whole story he felt he owed her more even more anxious than he had been the evening before jack dialed the number this time terese was much more receptive in fact she was ebullient we made great progress last night she announced proudly tomorrow were going to knock the socks off the president and the ceo thanks to you this idea of hospital cleanliness and low infection rate is a great hook were even having some fun with your sterilization idea finally jack got around to asking her if shed like to get together for some coffee he reminded her it had been her suggestion id love it terese said without hesitation when how about right now jack said fine by me terese said they met at a small frenchstyle café on madison avenue between sixtyfirst and sixtysecond conveniently close to the willow and heath building jack got there ahead of terese and took a table in the window and ordered an espresso terese arrived soon after she waved through the window and after entering she forced jack into a repeat of the cheekpressing routine she was vibrant she ordered a decaf cappuccino from the attentive waiter as soon as they were alone she leaned across the table and grasped jacks hand how are you she asked she looked directly into his eyes and then at his jawline your pupils are equal and you look okay i thought youd be black and blue im better than i would have expected jack admitted terese then launched into an excited monologue about her upcoming review and how wonderfully everything was falling into place she explained what a ripomatic was and how they had managed to put one together with tape sequences from their previous national health campaign she said it was terrific and gave a good impression of the donoharm hippocrates idea jack let her carry on until shed exhausted the subject after taking a few gulps of her cappuccino she asked him what hed been doing ive been thinking a lot about the conversation we had friday night he said its been bothering me how so terese asked we were being open with each other but i wasnt completely forthright jack said im not accustomed to talking about my problems the truth is i didnt tell you the whole story terese put her coffee cup down and studied jacks face his dark blue eyes were intense his face was stubbled hed obviously not shaved that day she thought that under different circumstances jack could appear intimidating maybe even scary my wife wasnt the only person who died jack said haltingly i lost my two daughters as well it was a commuter plane crash terese swallowed with difficulty shed felt a welling of emotion clog her throat jacks story was hardly what shed expected the problem is ive always felt so damn responsible he continued if it hadnt been for me they wouldnt have been on that plane terese felt an intense stab of empathy after a few moments she said i wasnt entirely forthright either i told you id lost my child what i didnt say is that it was an unborn child and at the same time i lost the child i lost my ability to have any more to add insult to injury the man id married deserted me for a few emotionally choked minutes neither jack nor terese spoke finally jack broke the silence it sounds like were trying to outdo each other with our personal tragedies he said managing a smile just like a couple of depressives terese agreed my therapist would love this of course what ive told you is for your ears only jack said dont be silly terese assured him same goes for you i havent told my story to anyone but my therapist i havent told anybody jack said not even a therapist feeling a sense of relief from having both bared their innermost secrets jack and terese went on to talk about happier things terese whod grown up in the city was shocked to hear how little of the area jack had visited since hed been there she talked about taking him to the cloisters when spring had truly arrived youll love it she promised ill look forward to it jack said monday am march jack was irritated at himself hed had time to buy a new bike on saturday but hed failed to do so consequently he had to use the subway again to commute to work although hed considered jogging the problem with jogging was that hed have to have a change of clothes in his office to give him the option in the future he brought some to work in a small shoulder bag coming in from first avenue jack again entered the medical examiners facility through the front entrance as he passed through the glass door he was impressed with the number of families waiting in the outer reception area it was highly unusual for so many people to be there that early something must be up he surmised jack had himself buzzed in he walked into the scheduling room and saw george fontworth sitting at the desk laurie had occupied each morning the previous week jack was sorry lauries week as supervisor was over george had rotated to the position he was a short moderately overweight doctor of whom jack had a low opinion he was perfunctory and often missed important findings ignoring george jack headed over to vinnie and pushed down the edge of his newspaper why are there so many people out in the id area jack asked because theres a minor disaster over at the general george said answering for vinnie vinnie treated jack to a jaunty but disdainful expression and went back to his paper what kind of disaster jack asked george patted the top of a stack of folders a whole bunch of meningococcal deaths he said could be an epidemic in the making weve got eight so far jack rushed over to georges desk and snapped up a folder at random he opened it and shuffled through its contents until he came to the investigative report scanning it quickly he learned that the patients name was robert caruso and that he had been a nurse on the orthopedic floor at the general jack tossed the folder back onto the desk and literally ran through communications to the offices of the pas he was relieved to see janice was still there putting in overtime as usual she looked terrible the dark circles under her eyes were so distinct she resembled a battered woman she put her pen down and leaned back she shook her head i might have to get another job she said i cant keep this up thank god i have tomorrow and the next day off what happened jack asked it started on the shift before mine janice said the first case was called in around sixthirty apparently the patient had died about six pm an orthopedic patient jack asked howd you know i just saw a folder from an orthopedic nurse jack said oh yeah that was mr caruso janice said with a yawn she excused herself before continuing anyway i started getting called shortly after i arrived at eleven since then its been nonstop ive been back and forth all night in fact i just got back here twenty minutes ago i tell you this is worse than the the other outbreaks one of the patients is a nineyearold girl what a tragedy was she related to the first case jack asked she was a niece janice said had she been in to visit her uncle jack asked around noon yesterday janice said you dont think that could have contributed to her death do you i mean that was only about twelve hours before her death under certain circumstances meningococcus has a frightful capacity to kill and kill incredibly swiftly jack said in fact it can kill in just a few hours well the hospital is in a panic i can imagine jack said what was the name of the first case carlo pacini janice said but thats about all i know he came in on the shift before mine steve mariott handled it could i ask a favor jack asked that depends janice said im awfully tired just leave word for bart that i want you pas to get all the charts of the index case in each of these outbreaks lets see thats nodelman with the plague hard with tularemia lagenthorpe with rocky mountain spotted fever and pacini with meningococcus do you think that will be a problem not at all janice said they are all active me cases jack stood up and gave janice a pat on the back maybe you should go over to the clinic on your way home he said some chemoprophylaxis might not be a bad idea janices eyes widened you think that is necessary better safe than sorry jack said anyway discuss it with one of the infectious disease gurus they know better than i theres even a tetravalent vaccine but that takes a few days to kick in jack dashed back to the id room and asked george for carlo pacinis folder its not here george said laurie came in early and when she heard about what was going on she requested the case shes got the folder where is she jack asked up in her office vinnie responded from behind his paper jack hustled up to lauries office contrary to the way jack worked she liked to go over each folder in her office before doing the autopsy pretty frightening id say laurie said as soon as she saw jack its terrifying jack said he grabbed lauries officemates chair pulled it over to lauries desk and sat down this is just what ive been worrying about this could be a real epidemic what have you learned about this index case not much laurie admitted hed been admitted saturday evening with a fractured hip apparently hed had a brittle bone problem hed had a whole string of fractures over the last few years fits the pattern jack said what pattern laurie asked all the index cases from these recent outbreaks have had some sort of chronic illness jack said a lot of people who are hospitalized have chronic illnesses laurie said in fact most of them what does that have to do with anything ill tell you whats on his paranoid sick mind chet said chet had appeared at lauries door he stepped into the room and leaned against the second desk hes got this thing about americare and wants to see conspiracy behind all this trouble is that true laurie asked i think its less that i want to see conspiracy than its staring me in the face jack said what do you mean by conspiracy laurie asked he has this notion that these unusual illnesses are being spread deliberately chet said chet summarized jacks theory that the culprit was either someone at americare trying to protect its bottom line or some crazy person with terrorist inclinations laurie looked questioningly at jack jack shrugged there are a lot of unanswered questions jack offered as there are in just about any outbreak laurie said but really this is all a bit farfetched i hope you didnt mention this theory to the powers that be over at the general yeah i did jack said in fact i sort of asked the director of the lab if he was involved hes rather disgruntled with his budget he immediately informed the infectioncontrol officer i imagine theyve let the administration know laurie let out a short cynical laugh oh brother she said no wonder youve become persona non grata around there you have to admit theres been an awful lot of questionable nosocomial infection at the general jack said im not even so sure about that laurie said both the tularemic patient and the patient with rocky mountain spotted fever developed their illnesses within fortyeight hours of admission by definition they are not nosocomial infections technically thats true jack admitted but besides all these illnesses have been seen in new york laurie said ive done some recent reading myself there was a serious outbreak of rocky mountain spotted fever in eightyseven thank you laurie chet said i tried to tell jack the same thing even calvin has told him what about the series of cases coming from central supply jack asked laurie and what about the rapidity with which the patients with rocky mountain spotted fever developed their illnesses you were questioning that just this saturday of course id question those things laurie said theyre the type of questions that have to be asked in any epidemiological situation jack sighed im sorry he said but im convinced something highly unusual is going on all along ive been worried that we might see a real epidemic crop up this outbreak of meningococcus may be it if it peters out like the other outbreaks ill be relieved of course in human terms but it will only add to my suspicions this pattern of multiple fulminant cases then nothing is highly unusual in itself but this is the season for meningococcus laurie said its not so unusual lauries right chet said but regardless my concern is that youre going to get yourself into real trouble youre like a dog with a bone calm down i dont want to see you fired at least reassure me youre not going back to the general i cant say that jack said not with this new outbreak this one doesnt depend on some arthropods that arent around this is an airborne problem and as far as im concerned it changes the rules just a moment laurie said what about that warning you got from those thugs now what chet questioned what thugs jack had a cozy visit from some charming members of a gang laurie said it seems that at least one of the new york gangs is going into the extortion business somebody has to explain chet said laurie told chet what she knew of jacks beating and youre still thinking of going over there chet asked when she was through ill be careful jack said besides i havent exactly decided to go yet chet rolled his eyes to the ceiling i think i would have preferred you as a suburbanite ophthalmologist what do you mean ophthalmologist laurie questioned come on you guys jack said he stood up enough is enough weve got work to do jack laurie and chet did not emerge from the autopsy room until after one in the afternoon although george had questioned the need to post all the meningococcal cases the triumvirate had insisted george relented in the end doing some on their own and some together they autopsied the initial patient one orthopedic resident two nurses one orderly two people whod visited the patient including the nineyearold girl and particularly important as far as jack was concerned one woman from central supply after the marathon they all changed back to their street clothes and met up in the lunchroom relieved to be away from the mayhem and a bit overwhelmed by the findings they didnt talk at first they merely got their selections from the vending machines and sat down at one of the free tables i havent done many meningococcal cases in the past laurie said finally but these today were a lot more impressive than the ones i did do you wont see a more dramatic case of the waterhousefriderichsen syndrome chet said none of these people had a chance the bacteria marched through them like a mongol horde the amount of internal hemorrhage was extraordinary i tell you it scares the pants off me it was one time that i actually didnt mind being in the moon suit jack agreed i couldnt get over the amount of gangrene on the extremities it was even more than on the recent plague cases what surprised me was how little meningitis was involved laurie said even the child had very little and i would have thought at least she would have had extensive involvement what puzzles me jack said is the amount of pneumonitis obviously it is an airborne infection but it usually invades the upper part of the respiratory tree not the lungs it can get there easily enough once it gets into the blood chet said obviously all these people had high levels coursing through their vascular systems have either of you heard if any more cases have come in today jack asked chet and laurie exchanged glances both shook their heads jack scraped back his chair and went to a wall phone he called down to communications and posed the same question to one of the operators the answer was no jack walked back to the table and reclaimed his seat well well he said isnt this curious no new cases id say it was good news laurie said id second that chet said does either of you know any of the internists over at the general jack asked i do laurie said one of my classmates from medical school is over there how about giving her a call and seeing if they have many meningococcal cases under treatment jack asked laurie shrugged and went to use the same phone jack had just used i dont like that look in your eye chet said i cant help it jack said just like with the other outbreaks little disturbing facts are beginning to appear weve just autopsied some of the sickest meningococcal patients any of us has ever seen and then boom no more cases as if a faucet had been turned off its just what i was talking about earlier isnt that characteristic of the disease chet asked peaks and valleys not this fast jack said then he paused wait a second he added i just thought of something else we know who the first person was to die in this outbreak but who was the last i dont know but weve got all the folders chet said laurie returned no meningococcal cases presently she said but the hospital doesnt consider itself out of the woods theyve instituted a massive campaign of vaccination and chemoprophylaxis apparently the place is in an uproar both jack and chet merely grunted at this news they were preoccupied with going through the eight folders and jotting down notations on their napkins what on earth are you guys doing laurie asked were trying to figure out who was the last to die jack said what on earth for laurie asked im not sure jack said this is it chet said it was imogene philbertson honest jack questioned let me see chet turned around the partially filledout death certificate that listed the time of death ill be damned jack said now what laurie asked she was the one who worked in central supply jack said is that significant laurie asked jack pondered for a few minutes then shook his head i dont know he said ill have to look back at the other outbreaks as you know each outbreak has included someone from central supply ill see if it is a pattern id missed you guys werent particularly impressed with my news that there are currently no more cases of meningococcal disease over at the general i am chet said jack sees it as confirmation of his theories im worried it is going to frustrate our hypothetical terrorist jack said its also going to teach him an unfortunate lesson both laurie and chet rolled their eyes to the ceiling and let out audible groans come on you guys jack said hear me out lets just say for the sake of argument that im right about some weirdo spreading these microbes in hopes of starting an epidemic at first he picks the scariest most exotic diseases he can think of but he doesnt know that they wont really spread patient to patient they are spread by arthropods having access to an infected reservoir but after a few flops he figures this out and turns to a disease that is spread airborne but he picks meningococcus the problem with meningococcus is that it really isnt a patienttopatient disease either its a carrier disease thats mainly spread by an immune individual walking around and giving it to others so now our weirdo is really frustrated but he truly knows what he needs he needs a disease that is spread mainly patienttopatient by aerosol and what would you choose in this hypothetical scenario chet asked superciliously lets see jack said he pondered for a moment id use drugresistant diphtheria or maybe even drugresistant pertussis those old standbys are making some devastating comebacks or you know what else would be perfect influenza a pathological strain of influenza what an imagination chet commented laurie stood up ive got to get back to work she said this conversation is too hypothetical for me chet did the same hey isnt anybody going to comment jack said you know how we feel chet said this is just mental masturbation it seems like the more you think and talk about this stuff the more you believe it i mean really if it were one disease okay but now were up to four where would someone get these microbes they are not the kind of thing you can go into your neighborhood deli and order ill see you upstairs jack watched laurie and chet dispose of their trash and leave the lunchroom he sat for a few moments and considered what chet had said chet had a good point one that jack had not even considered where would someone get pathological bacteria he really had no idea jack got up and stretched his legs after discarding his tray and sandwich wrappings he followed the others up to the fifth floor by the time he got to the office chet was already engrossed and didnt look up sitting down at his desk jack got all the folders together plus his notes and looked up the time of death of each of the women victims from central supply to date central supply had lost four people jack imagined that the department head would have to be actively recruiting to keep up with that type of attrition next jack looked up the time of death of each of the other infectious cases for the times of death of the few hed not autopsied he called down to bart arnold the chief pa when jack had all the information it became immediately apparent that with each outbreak it had been the woman from central supply to be the last to succumb that suggested but certainly didnt prove that in each instance those from central supply were the last to become infected jack asked himself what that meant but couldnt come up with an answer still it was an extremely curious detail i have to go back to the general jack said suddenly he stood up chet didnt even bother to look up do what you have to do he said with resignation not that my opinion counts jack pulled on his bomber jacket dont take it personally he said i appreciate your concern but ive got to go ive got to look into this strange central supply connection it could just be a coincidence i agree but it seems unlikely what about bingham and what about those gang members laurie mentioned chet asked youre taking a lot of risk such is life jack said he gave chet a tap on the shoulder on his way to the hallway jack had just reached the threshold when his phone rang he debated whether to take the time to answer it it was usually someone from one of the labs want me to get it chet offered when he saw jack hesitate no im here and i might as well jack said he returned to his desk and picked up the receiver thank god you are there terese said with obvious relief i was terrified i wouldnt get you at least not in time what on earth is the matter jack asked his pulse quickened he could tell by the sound of her voice that she was acutely upset theres been a catastrophe she said i have to see you immediately can i come over to your office what happened jack asked i cant talk now terese said i cant risk it with everything that has happened ive just got to see you were sort of in the middle of an emergency ourselves jack said and im just on my way out its very important terese said please jack immediately relented especially with tereses selfless response to his emergency friday night all right jack said since i was just leaving ill come to you where would you like to meet were you going uptown or downtown terese asked uptown jack said then lets meet at the café where we had coffee on sunday terese said ill be right there jack said wonderful terese asserted ill be waiting then she hung up jack replaced the receiver and selfconsciously looked over at chet did you hear any of that jack asked it was hard not to chet said what do you think happened i havent the faintest idea jack said true to his word jack left immediately exiting from the front of the medical examiner facility he caught a cab on first avenue despite the normal afternoon traffic he made it uptown in reasonable time the café was crowded he found terese sitting toward the rear at a small banquette he took the seat opposite her she didnt make any motion to get up she was dressed as usual in a smart suit her jaw was clenched she looked angry she leaned forward you are not going to believe this she said in a forced whisper did the president and the ceo not like your presentation jack asked it was the only thing he could think of terese made a motion of dismissal with her hand i canceled the presentation she said why jack asked because id had the sense to schedule an early breakfast with a woman acquaintance at national health terese said shes a vice president in marketing who i happened to have gone to smith college with id had a brainstorm about leaking the campaign to some higherups through her i was so confident but she shocked me by telling me that under no circumstances would the campaign fly but why jack asked as much as he disliked medical advertising hed considered the ads terese had come up with the best hed seen because national health is deathly afraid of any reference to nosocomial infections terese said angrily then she leaned forward again and whispered apparently they have had some of their own trouble lately what kind of trouble jack asked nothing like the manhattan general terese said but serious nonetheless even with a few deaths but the real point is that our own account executive people specifically helen robinson and her boss robert barker knew all this and didnt tell me thats counterproductive jack said i thought you corporate types were all working toward the same end counterproductive terese practically shouted causing the nearby diners to turn their heads terese closed her eyes for a moment to collect herself counterproductive is not the term id use terese said keeping her voice down the way id describe it would make a sailor blush you see this was not an oversight it was done deliberately to make me look bad im sorry to hear this jack said i can see its upsetting for you thats an understatement terese said its the death of my presidential aspirations if i dont come up with an alternative campaign in the next couple of days a couple of days jack questioned from what youve shown me about how this process works thats a mighty tall order exactly terese said thats why i had to see you i need another hook you came up with this infection idea or at least you were the source of it can you come up with another concept something that i can construct an ad campaign around im desperate jack looked off and tried to think the irony of the situation didnt escape him as much as he despised medical advertising here he was racking his brains for some sort of an idea he wanted to help after all terese had been so willing to help him the reason i think medical advertising is such a waste of money is that it ultimately has to rely on superficial amenities he said the problem is that without quality being an issue there just isnt enough difference between americare and national health or any of the other big conglomerates i dont care terese said just give me something i can use well the only thing that comes to my mind at the moment is the issue about waiting jack said what do you mean waiting terese asked you know jack said nobody likes waiting for the doctor but everybody does its one of those irritating universal annoyances youre right terese said excitedly i love it i can already see a tag line like no waiting with national health or even better we wait for you you dont wait for us god thats great youre a genius at this how about a job jack chuckled wouldnt that be a trip he said but im having enough trouble with the one i have is there something wrong terese asked what did you mean when you said you were in the middle of an emergency theres more trouble at the manhattan general jack said this time its an illness caused by meningococcus bacteria it can be extremely deadly as it has been in this instance how many cases eight jack said including a child how awful terese said she was appalled do you think it will spread i was worried at first jack said i thought we were going to have a bona fide epidemic on our hands but the cases just stopped so far it hasnt spread beyond the initial cohort i hope this isnt going to be kept a secret like whatever killed the people at national health terese said no worry on that account jack said this episode is no secret ive heard the hospital is in an uproar but ill find out firsthand im on my way over there oh no youre not terese commanded is your memory so short that friday night is already a blur you sound like several of my colleagues jack said i appreciate your concern but i cant stay away i have a sense that these outbreaks are deliberate and my conscience wont let me ignore them what about those people who beat you up she demanded ill have to be careful jack said terese made a disparaging sound being careful hardly sounds adequate she said its certainly not consistent with how you described those hoodlums friday night ill just have to take my chances and improvise jack said im going over to the general no matter what anybody says what i cant understand is why you are so agitated about these infections ive read that infectious diseases are generally on the rise thats true jack said but thats not due to deliberate spread thats from the injudicious use of antibiotics urbanization and the invasion of primeval habitats give me a break terese commented im concerned about you getting yourself hurt or worse and youre giving me a lecture jack shrugged im going to the general he said fine go terese said she stood up youre being that ridiculous hero i was afraid youd be then she softened do what you must but if you need me call me i will jack said he watched her hurry out of the restaurant thinking that she was a bewildering blend of ambition and solicitude it was no wonder he was confused by her one minute attracted the next minute mildly put off jack tossed down the remains of his coffee and stood up after leaving an appropriate tip he too hurried out of the café monday pm march jack walked rapidly toward the general after the conversation with terese he needed some fresh air she had a way of agitating him not only was she emotionally confusing but she was also right about the black kings as much as jack didnt want to think about it he was taking a chance defying their threat the questions were whom had he irritated enough to send a gang to threaten him and did the threat confirm his suspicions unfortunately there was no way to know as hed told terese he would have to be careful the problem with that flippant answer of course was that he had no idea with whom he had to be careful he assumed it would have to be kelley zimmerman cheveau or abelard because those were the people hed irritated the trick was to avoid them all as jack rounded the final corner it was immediately apparent that things were abnormal at the hospital several wooden police sawhorses stood on the sidewalk and two new york city uniformed policemen lounged on either side of the main door jack stopped to watch them for a moment since they seemed to be spending more time talking with each other than anything else feeling confused about their role jack went up to them and asked we were supposed to discourage people from going into the hospital one officer said there was some kind of epidemic in there but they think its under control were really here more for crowd control the other officer admitted they were expecting trouble earlier when they were toying with the idea of quarantining the facility but things have settled down for that we can all be thankful jack said he started forward but one of the officers restrained him you sure you want to go in he asked afraid so jack said the officer shrugged and let jack pass the minute jack entered through the door he was confronted by a uniformed hospital security officer wearing a surgical mask im sorry the officer said no visitors today jack pulled out his medical examiners badge sorry doctor the officer said he stepped aside although calm outside the inside of the hospital was still in a minor furor the lobby was filled with people what gave the scene a surrealistic aura was that everyone was wearing a mask with the sudden cessation of new meningococcal cases some twelve hours earlier jack was reasonably confident that a mask was superfluous yet he wanted one not so much for protection as for disguise he asked the security officer if they were available he was directed to the unmanned information desk where he found several boxes jack took one out and put it on next he located the doctors coatroom he entered when one of the staff doctors was exiting inside he took off his bomber jacket and searched for an appropriately sized long white coat when he found one he put it on then returned to the lobby jacks destination was central supply he felt that if he was to learn anything on this visit it would be there he got off the elevator on the third floor and was impressed with how much less patient traffic there was than there had been on his visit the previous thursday a glance through the glass portal on the or suite doors told him why apparently the ors had been temporarily shut down with some knowledge of hospital cash flow jack surmised that americare must be having a financial stroke jack pushed through the swinging doors into central supply even there the level of activity was a quarter of what it had been on his first visit he only saw two women near the end of one of the long aisles between the floortoceiling shelving like everyone else hed seen so far they were wearing masks obviously the hospital was taking this last outbreak particularly seriously avoiding the aisle with the women jack set off for gladys zarellis office shed been receptive on his first visit and she was the supervisor jack couldnt think of a better person with whom to talk as he walked through the department jack eyed the myriad hospital supplies and equipment stacked on the shelves seeing such a profusion of items made him wonder if there had been anything unique sent from central supply to the index cases it was an interesting thought he reasoned but he couldnt imagine how it would matter there was still the question of how the women in central supply could have come in contact with the patient and the infecting bacteria as hed been told the employees rarely if ever even saw a patient jack found gladys in her office she was on the phone but when she saw him standing at her door she motioned exuberantly for him to come in jack sat down on a straightback chair opposite her narrow desk with the size of the office he could not help overhearing both sides of gladyss conversation as he might have imagined she was busy recruiting sorry to keep you waiting she said when she finished her call despite her problems she was as affable as the last time jack had talked with her but im in desperate need of more help jack reintroduced himself but gladys said shed recognized him despite the mask so much for the disguise jack thought glumly im sorry about whats happened jack said it must be difficult for you for all sorts of reasons its been terrible she admitted just terrible who would have guessed four wonderful people its shocking jack said especially since its so unusual as you said last time i was here no one in this department had ever caught anything serious before gladys raised her uplifted hands what can you do she said its in gods hands it might be in gods hands jack said but usually there is some way to explain this kind of contagion have you given it any thought at all gladys nodded vigorously ive thought about it until i was blue in the face she said i dont have a clue even if i didnt want to think about it ive had to because everybody has been asking me the same question really jack said with a twinge of disappointment hed had the idea he was exploring virginal territory dr zimmerman was in here right after you on thursday gladys said she came with this cute little man who kept sticking his chin out as if his collar button were too tight that sounds like dr clint abelard jack said realizing he truly was strolling a beaten path that was his name gladys said he sure could ask a lot of questions and theyve been back each time someone else has gotten sick thats why were all wearing our masks they even had mr eversharp down here from engineering thinking there might have been something messed up with our airconditioning system but apparently thats fine so they havent come up with any explanation jack said nope gladys said unless they havent told me but i doubt that its been like grand central in here used to be no one came some of these doctors though theyre a little strange how so jack asked just weird gladys said like the doctor from the lab hes come down here plenty of times lately is that dr cheveau jack asked i think so gladys said in what way was he strange jack asked just unfriendly gladys said she lowered her voice as if telling a secret i asked him if i could help him a couple of times and he bites my head off he says he just wants to be left alone but you know this is my department im responsible for all this inventory i dont like people wandering around even doctors i had to tell him who else has been around jack asked a bunch of the bigwigs gladys said even mr kelley usually id only see him at the christmas party last couple of days hes been down here three or four times always with a bunch of people once with that little doctor dr abelard jack asked thats the one gladys said i can never remember his name i hate to ask you the same questions as the others jack said but did the women who died perform similar tasks i mean did they share some specific job like i told you last time gladys said we all pitch in none of them went up to the patients rooms who died of the same illnesses jack asked no nothing like that gladys said that was the first thing that dr zimmerman checked last time i was here you printed out a big list of all the stuff that youd sent up to the seventh floor jack said could you make the same list for an individual patient that would be more difficult gladys said the order usually comes from the floor and then it is the floor that enters it into the patients data is there any way you could come up with such a list jack asked i suppose gladys said when we do inventory there is a way of doublechecking through billing i could tell billing im doing that kind of check even though were not officially doing inventory id appreciate it jack said he took out one of his cards you could either call me or just send it over gladys took the card and examined it ill do anything that might help she said one other thing jack said ive had my own runin with mr cheveau and even a few of the other people around here id appreciate it if this was just between you and me isnt he weird gladys said sure i wont tell anybody easing out from in front of gladyss desk jack bid goodbye to the robust woman and exited central supply he wasnt in the best of moods after beginning with high expectations the only thing of note hed been told was something he already knew martin cheveau was irascible jack pushed the down button at the bank of elevators while he pondered his next move he had two choices either he could just leave and minimize his risk or he could make a careful visit to the lab ultimately he decided in favor of the lab chets comment about the lack of availability of pathological bacteria carried the day since it had raised a question jack needed to answer when the elevator doors opened jack started to board but then he hesitated standing directly in front of the crowded car was charles kelley jack recognized him instantly despite his mask jacks first impulse was to back away and let the elevator go but such a move would have only drawn attention instead he put his head down proceeded onto the elevator and immediately turned to face the closing door the administrator was standing right behind him jack half expected a tap on the shoulder luckily kelley had not recognized him the administrator was deep in conversation with a colleague about how much it was costing the hospital to transport the er patients by ambulance and the clinic patients by bus to their nearest facility kelleys agitation was palpable he said their selfimposed semiquarantine would have to end kelleys companion assured him that everything was being done that could be done since the city and state regulatory people were all there making an evaluation when the doors opened on the second floor jack exited with great relief especially when kelley didnt get off as well with such a close call jack wondered if he was doing the right thing but after a moment of indecision he elected to continue with a quick visit to the lab after all he was right there in contrast to the rest of the hospital the lab was in full swing the outer lobby area was thronged with hospital personnel all of whom were masked jack was confused as to why so many hospital employees were there but thankful because it was easy to blend in with the crowd with his mask and white lab coat he fit in perfectly since martins office was just off this main reception jack had worried that hed be apt to run into him now he felt the chances were next to nil at the far end of the room was a series of cubicles used by the technicians to draw blood or obtain other samples from clinic patients near them the crowd concentrated as jack wormed his way past this area it dawned on him what was going on the entire hospital staff was having throat cultures taken jack was impressed it was an appropriate response to the current outbreak since most meningococcal epidemics resulted from a carrier state there was always a chance the carrier was a hospital employee it had happened in the past a glance into the last cubicle made jack do a double take despite a mask and even a surgical cap jack recognized martin he literally had his sleeves rolled up as he worked as a technician swabbing throat after throat next to him on a tray the used swabs were piling up in an impressive pyramid obviously everyone in the lab was pitching in feeling even more confident jack slipped through the doors into the lab itself no one paid him any attention in sharp contrast to the comparative pandemonium in reception the labs interior was a study in automated solitude the only sounds were a muted chorus of mechanical clicks and lowpitched beeps there were no technicians in sight jack made a beeline for the microbiology section his hope was to run across either the head tech richard or the vivacious beth holderness but when he arrived he found no one the micro area appeared as deserted as the rest of the lab jack approached the spot where beth had been working on his last visit there he found something encouraging a bunsen burner was aflame next to it was a tray of throat culture swabs and a large stack of fresh agar plates on the floor stood a plastic trash barrel brimming with discarded culture tubes sensing that beth must be in the immediate area jack began to explore the microbiology section was a room about thirty feet square divided by two rows of countertop jack walked down the center aisle along the back wall were several biosafety cabinets jack rounded the lab bench to his right and glanced into a small office it had a desk and a file cabinet on a bulletin board he could see some photos without going into the room jack recognized richard the head tech in several of them moving on jack came abreast of several polished aluminum insulated doors that looked like walkin refrigerators glancing over to the opposite side of the room he saw a regular door that he thought could lead into a storeroom as he was about to head in that direction one of the insulated doors opened with a loud click that made him jump beth holderness emerged along with a waft of warm moist air and nearly collided with jack you scared me to death she said pressing a hand to her chest im not sure who scared whom more jack said he then reintroduced himself dont worry i remember you beth said you caused quite a stir and i dont think you should be here oh jack questioned innocently dr cheveau is really mad at you beth said is he now jack said ive noticed hes been rather grumpy he can be cranky beth admitted but richard said something about your accusing him of spreading the bacteria that weve been experiencing here at the general actually i didnt accuse your boss of anything jack said it was only an implication i made after he irritated me id come over here just to have a conversation with him i really wanted his opinion about the plausibility of all these relatively rare illnesses having appeared so close together and at this time of year but for reasons unknown to me he was in as inhospitable a mood as hed been on my previous visit well i must admit i was surprised how he treated you the day we met beth said same with mr kelley and dr zimmerman i just thought you were trying to help jack had to restrain himself from giving this lively young woman a hug it seemed as if she were the only person on the planet who appreciated what he was doing i was so sorry about your coworker nancy wiggens jack said i imagine its been difficult for you all beths cheerful face clouded over to the point just shy of tears maybe i shouldnt have said anything jack said when he noticed her reaction its all right beth managed but it was a terrible shock we all worry about such a thing but hope it will never happen she was such a warm person although she could be a bit reckless how so jack asked she just wasnt as careful as she should have been beth said she took chances like not using one of the hoods when it was indicated or not wearing her goggles when she was supposed to jack could understand that attitude she didnt even take the antibiotic dr zimmerman prescribed for her after the plague case beth said how unfortunate jack said that might have protected her against the rocky mountain spotted fever i know beth said i wish that i had tried harder to convince her i mean i took it and i dont think i was exposed did she happen to say she did anything different when she got samples from lagenthorpe jack asked no she didnt beth said thats why we feel she was exposed down here in the lab when she processed the samples rickettsia are notoriously dangerous in the lab jack was about to respond when he noticed that beth had begun to fidget and look over his shoulder jack glanced in the direction she was looking but there was no one there i really should be getting back to work beth said and i shouldnt be talking with you dr cheveau told us specifically dont you find that strange jack said after all i am a medical examiner in this city legally i have a right to investigate the deaths of the patients assigned to us i guess i do beth admitted but what can i say i just work here she stepped around jack and went back to her workstation jack followed her i dont mean to be a pest he said but my intuition tells me something weird is going on here thats why i keep coming back a number of people have been acting defensive including your boss now there could be an explanation americare and this hospital are a business and these outbreaks have been tremendously disruptive economically thats reason enough for people to be acting strangely but from my point of view its more than that so what do you want from me beth asked shed taken her seat and gone back to transferring the throat cultures to the agar plates id like to ask you to look around jack said if pathological bacteria are being deliberately spread they have to come from somewhere and the microbiology lab would be a good place to start looking i mean the equipment is here to store and handle the stuff its not as if plague bacteria is something youd find anywhere it wouldnt be so strange to find it on occasion in any standard lab beth said really jack questioned hed assumed that outside of the cdc and maybe a few academic centers plague bacteria would be a rarity intermittently labs have to get cultures of all different bacteria to test the efficacy of their reagents beth said as she continued to work antibodies which are often the main ingredient in many modern reagents can deteriorate and if they do the tests would give false negatives oh of course jack said he felt stupid he should have remembered all this all laboratory tests had to be constantly checked where do you get something like plague bacteria from national biologicals in virginia beth said whats the process for getting it jack asked just call up and order it beth said who can do that jack asked anybody beth said youre joking jack said somehow hed thought the security at a minimum would be comparable to that involved in getting a controlled drug like morphine im not joking beth said ive done it many times you dont need some special permit jack asked i have to get the signature of the director of the lab on the purchase order beth said but thats just to guarantee that the hospital will pay for it so let me get this straight jack said anyone can call these people up and have plague sent to them as long as their credit is okay beth said how do the cultures come jack said usually by mail beth said but if you pay extra and need it faster you can get overnight service jack was appalled but he tried to hide his reaction he was embarrassed at his own naïveté do you have this organizations phone number he asked beth pulled open a file drawer to her immediate right leafed through some files and pulled out a folder opening it up she took out a sheet and indicated the letterhead jack wrote the number down then he pointed to the phone do you mind he asked beth pushed the phone in his direction but glanced up at the clock as she did so ill just be a second jack said he still couldnt believe what hed just been told jack dialed the number the phone was answered and a recording gave him the name of the company and asked him to make a selection jack pressed two for sales presently a charmingly friendly voice came on the line and asked if she could be of assistance yes jack said this is dr billy rubin and id like to place an order do you have an account with national biologicals the woman asked not yet jack said in fact for this order id just like to use my american express card im sorry but we only accept visa or mastercard the woman said no problem jack said visa will be fine okay the woman said cheerfully could i have your first order how about some meningococcus jack said the woman laughed youll have to be more specific she said i need the serologic group the serotype and the subtype we have hundreds of meningococcus subspecies uhoh jack said pretending to have been suddenly paged an emergency has just come up im afraid ill have to call back no problem the woman said call anytime as you know were here twentyfour hours a day to serve your culture needs jack hung up the phone he was stunned i have the feeling you didnt believe me beth said i didnt jack admitted i didnt realize the availability of these pathogens but id still like you to look around here and see if these offending bugs might somehow be stashed here now could you do that i suppose beth said without her usual enthusiasm but i want you to be discreet jack said and careful i want this just between you and me jack took out one of his cards and wrote his home number on the back he handed it to her you can call me anytime day or night if you find anything or if you get into any trouble because of me okay beth took the card examined it briefly and then stuck it into her lab coat pocket okay she said would you mind if i asked for your number jack said i might have some more questions myself obviously microbiology isnt my forte beth thought for a moment then relented she got out a piece of paper and wrote her phone number down she handed it to jack who put it into his wallet i think youd better go now she said im on my way jack said thanks for your help youre welcome beth said she was her old self again preoccupied jack walked out of the microbiology section and headed across the main portion of the lab he still couldnt believe how easy it was to order pathological cultures about twenty feet from the double swinging doors that connected the lab to the reception area jack stopped dead in his tracks backing through the doors was a figure that looked alarmingly like martin the individual was carrying a tray loaded with prepared throat swabs ready for plating jack felt like a criminal caught in the act for a fraction of a second he contemplated fleeing or trying to hide but there was no time besides irritation at the absurdity of his fear of being recognized inspired him to stand his ground martin held the door open for a second figure jack recognized as richard he too was carrying a tray of throat swabs it was richard who saw jack first martin was a quick second he recognized jack immediately despite the mask hi folks jack said you martin cried it is i jack said cheerfully he grabbed the end of his face mask with his thumb and forefinger and pulled it away from his face to give martin an unobstructed look youve been warned about sneaking around in here martin snapped youre trespassing not so jack said he produced his medical examiners badge and pointed it toward martins face just making an official site visit thereve been a few more regrettable infectious deaths over here at the general at least this time you were able to make the diagnosis on your own well see whether this is a legitimate site visit martin said he heaved the tray of throat swabs onto the countertop and snatched up the nearest phone he told the operator to put him through to charles kelley couldnt we just discuss this like grownups jack asked martin ignored the question as he waited for kelley out of curiosity maybe you could just tell me why you were so accommodating on my first visit and so nasty on my next jack said in the interim mr kelley informed me what your attitude had been on that first day martin said and he told me he had learned that you were here without authorization jack was about to respond when it became clear that kelley had come on the line martin informed the administrator that hed again found dr stapleton lurking in the lab while martin listened to an apparent monologue from kelley jack moved over and leaned casually against the nearest countertop richard on the other hand stood rooted in place still supporting his tray of throat swabs martin punctuated kelleys apparent tirade with a few strategically placed yeses and a final yes sir at the end of the conversation as he hung up the phone he treated jack to a supercilious smile mr kelley told me to inform you martin said haughtily that he will be personally calling the mayors office the commissioner of health and your chief hell be lodging a formal complaint concerning your harassment of this hospital while weve been making every effort to deal with a state of emergency he also told me to inform you that our security will be up here in a few moments to escort you off the premises thats terribly considerate of him jack said but i really dont need to be shown the way out in fact i was on my way when we happened to bump into each other good day gentlemen monday pm march so there you have it terese said as she looked out on the expanded team of creatives for the national health account in the present emergency she and colleen had pulled key people away from other projects right now they needed all the man and womanpower they could muster to concentrate on the new campaign any questions terese asked the entire group was squeezed into colleens office with no room to sit they were wedged in like sardines cheek by jowl terese had outlined the no wait idea in an expanded form that she and colleen had devised based on jacks initial suggestion we only have two days for this alice questioned im afraid so terese said i might be able to squeeze out another day but we cant count on it weve got to go for broke there was a murmur of incredulity i know im asking a lot terese said but the fact of the matter is as ive told you we were sabotaged by the accounts department weve even got confirmation that they are expecting to present a talking heads spot with one of the er stars they are counting on us to selfdestruct with the old idea actually i think the no wait concept is better than the cleanliness concept alice said the cleanliness idea was getting too technical with that asepsis malarkey people are going to understand no waiting much better theres also a lot more opportunity for humor another voice commented i like it too someone else said i hate waiting for the gynecologist by the time i get in there im as tense as a banjo wire a wave of tensionrelieving laughter rippled through the group thats the spirit terese said lets get to work lets show them what we can do when our backs are against the wall people started to leave eager to get to their drawing boards hold up terese shouted over the buzz of voices that had erupted one other thing this has to stay quiet dont even tell other creatives unless absolutely necessary i dont want accounts to have any inkling of whats going on okay a murmur of agreement arose all right terese yelled get to it the room emptied as if there had been a fire terese flopped back into colleens chair exhausted from the emotional effort of the day typical of her life in advertising shed started out that morning on a high then sank to a new low and was now somewhere in between theyre enthusiastic colleen said you made a great presentation i kind of wish someone from national health were here at least its a good idea for a campaign terese said the question is whether they can put it together enough for a real presentation theyll certainly give it their best shot colleen said you really motivated them god i hope so terese said i cant let barker have a free field with his stupid talking heads junk thats like taking advertising back to prebernbach days it would be an embarrassment for the agency if the client liked it and we had to actually do it god forbid colleen said well be out of a job if that happens terese said lets not get too pessimistic colleen warned ah what a day terese complained on top of everything else ive got to worry about jack how so colleen asked when i met with him and he gave me the no wait idea he told me he was going back to the general uhoh colleen said isnt that where those gang members warned him against going exactly terese said talk about a taurus hes the epitome hes so damn bullheaded and reckless he doesnt have to go over there they have people at the medical examiners office whose job it is to go out to hospitals it must be some male thing like he has to be a hero i dont understand it are you starting to get attached to him colleen asked gingerly aware it was a touchy subject with terese colleen knew enough about her boss to know that she eschewed romantic entanglements though she had no idea why terese only sighed im attracted to him and put off by him at the same time she said he got me to open up a little and apparently i coaxed him out a little too i think both of us felt good talking to someone who seemed to care that sounds encouraging colleen said terese shrugged then smiled were both carrying around a lot of emotional baggage she said but enough about me how about you and chet its going great colleen said i could really fall for that guy jack felt as if he were sitting through the same movie for the third time once again he was literally on binghams carpet enduring a protracted tirade about how his chief had been called by every major civil servant in the city to complain bitterly about jack stapleton so what do you have to say for yourself bingham demanded finally running out of steam with his ranting he was literally out of breath i dont know what to say jack admitted but in my defense i havent gone over there with the intention of irritating people i was just looking for information theres a lot about this series of outbreaks that i dont understand youre a goddamn paradox bingham remarked as he visibly calmed down at the same time youve been such a pain in the butt youve made some commendable diagnoses i was impressed when calvin told me about the tularemia and the rocky mountain spotted fever its like youre two different people what am i to do fire the irritating one and keep the other jack suggested bingham grunted a reluctant chuckle but any sign of amusement quickly faded the main problem from my perspective he grumbled is that you are so goddamned contumacious youve specifically disobeyed my orders to stay away from the general not once but twice im guilty jack said raising his hands as if to surrender is all this motivated by that personal vendetta you have against americare bingham demanded no jack said that was a minor factor to begin with but my interest in the matter has gone way beyond that i told you last time that i thought something strange was going on i feel even more strongly now and the people over there are continuing to act defensive defensive bingham questioned querulously i was told that you accused the generals lab director of spreading these illnesses that story has been blown way out of proportion jack said he then explained to bingham that hed merely implied as much by reminding the lab director that he the director was disgruntled about the budget americare was giving him the man was acting like an ass jack added i was trying to ask his opinion about the possible intentional spread of these illnesses but he never gave me a chance and i got mad at him i suppose i shouldnt have said what i did but sometimes i cant help myself so youre convinced about this idea yourself bingham asked i dont know if im convinced jack admitted but it is hard to ascribe them all to coincidence on top of that is the way people at the general have been acting from the administrator on down jack thought about telling bingham about his being beaten up and threatened but he decided against it he feared it might get him grounded altogether after commissioner markham called me bingham said i asked her to have the chief epidemiologist dr abelard get in touch with me when he did i asked him what he thought of this intentional spread idea you want to know what he said i cant wait jack said he said except for the plague case which he still cannot explain but is working on with the cdc he feels the others all have very reasonable explanations the hard woman had been in contact with wild rabbits and mr lagenthorpe had been out in the desert in texas and as far as meningococcus is concerned its the season for that i dont think the time sequences are correct jack said nor are the clinical courses consistent with hold on bingham interrupted let me remind you that dr abelard is an epidemiologist hes got a phd as well as an md his whole job is to figure out the where and the why of disease i dont doubt his credentials jack said just his conclusions he didnt impress me from the start you certainly are opinionated bingham said i might have ruffled feathers on past visits to the general jack admitted but this time all i did was talk to the supervisor of central supply and one of the microbiology techs from the calls i got you were deliberately hampering their efforts to deal with the meningococcal outbreak bingham said god is my witness jack said holding up his hand all i did was talk to ms zarelli and ms holderness who happen to be two pleasant cooperative people you do have a way of rubbing people the wrong way bingham said i suppose you know that usually i only have that effect on those i intend to provoke jack said i get the feeling im one of those people bingham snapped quite the contrary jack said irritating you is entirely unintentional i wouldnt have known bingham said in speaking with ms holderness the lab tech i did uncover an interesting fact jack said i learned that just about anyone with reasonable credit can call up and order pathological bacteria the company doesnt do any background check you dont need a license or a permit bingham asked apparently not jack said i suppose id never thought about it bingham said nor had i jack said needless to say thought provoking indeed bingham said he appeared to ponder this for a moment as his rheumy eyes glazed over but then they quickly cleared seems to me youve managed to get this conversation off track he said regaining his gruff posture the issue here is what to do with you you could always send me on vacation to the caribbean jack suggested its nice down there this time of year enough of your impertinent humor bingham snapped im trying to be serious with you ill try to control myself jack said my problem is that during the last five years of my life cynicism has led to reflex sarcasm im not going to fire you bingham announced but ive got to warn you again youve come very close in fact when i hung up the phone from the mayors office i was going to let you go ive changed my mind for now but there is one thing that we have to be clear on you are to stay away from the general do we have an understanding i think its finally getting through jack said if you need more information send the pas bingham said for chrissake thats what theyre here for ill try to remember that jack said all right get out of here bingham said with a sweep of his hand with relief jack stood up and left binghams office he went straight up to his own when he arrived he found chet talking with george fontworth jack squeezed by the two of them and draped his coat over the back of his chair well chet asked well what jack asked back the daily question chet said are you still employed here very funny jack said he was perplexed by the stack of four large manila envelopes at the center of his desk he picked one up it was about two inches thick there were no markings on the exterior opening the latch he slid out the contents it was a copy of susanne hards hospital chart youve seen bingham chet asked i just came from there jack said he was sweet he wanted to commend me on my diagnoses of tularemia and rocky mountain spotted fever bull chet exclaimed honest jack said with a chuckle of course he also bawled me out for going over to the general while jack was talking he took the contents out of all the manila envelopes he now had copies of the hospital charts of the index cases of each outbreak was your visit worth it chet asked what do you mean worth it jack asked did you learn enough to justify stirring up the pot once more chet said we heard you got everyone over there angry again not a lot of secrets around here jack commented but i did learn something that i didnt know jack explained to chet and george about the ease of ordering pathological bacteria i knew that george said i worked in a micro lab during summers while i was in college i remember the supervisor ordering a cholera culture when it came in i picked it up and held it it gave me a thrill jack glanced at george a thrill he questioned youre weirder than i thought seriously george said i know other people who had the same reaction comprehending how much pain suffering and death the little buggers had caused and could cause was both scary and stimulating at the same time and holding it in my hand just blew me away i guess my idea of a thrill and yours are a bit different jack said he went back to the charts and organized them chronologically so that nodelman was on top i hope the mere availability of pathological bacteria doesnt encourage your paranoid thinking chet said i mean thats hardly proof of your theory umm hmm jack murmured he was already beginning to go over the charts he planned to read through them rapidly to see if anything jumped out at him then he would go back over them in detail what he was looking for was any way the cases could have been related that would suggest they were not random occurrences chet and george went back to their conversation when it was apparent jack was preoccupied fifteen minutes later george got up and left as soon as he did chet went to the door and closed it colleen called me a little while ago he said im happy for you jack said still trying to concentrate on the charts she told me what had happened over there at the agency chet said i think it stinks i cant imagine one part of the same company undermining another it doesnt make sense jack looked up from his reading its the business mentality he said lust for power is the major motivator chet sat down colleen also told me that you gave terese a terrific idea for a new campaign dont remind me jack said he redirected his attention to the charts i really dont want to be a part of it i dont know why she asked me she knows how i feel about medical advertising colleen also said that you and terese are hitting it off chet said really now jack said she said that you two had gotten each other to open up i think that is terrific for both of you did she give any specifics jack asked i didnt get the sense she had any specifics chet said thank god jack said without looking up when jack answered chets next few questions with mere grunts it dawned on chet that jack was again engrossed in his reading chet gave up trying to have a conversation and turned his attention to his own work by fivethirty chet was ready to call it a day he got up and stretched noisily hoping that jack would respond jack didnt in fact jack had not moved for the last hour or so except to turn pages and jot down more notes chet got his coat from the top drawer of his file cabinet and cleared his throat several times still jack did not respond finally chet resorted to speech hey old sport chet called out how long are you going to work on that stuff until im done jack said without looking up im meeting colleen for a quick bite chet said were meeting at six are you interested maybe terese could join us apparently they are planning to work most of the night im sticking here jack said enjoy yourselves say hello for me chet shrugged pulled on his coat and left jack had been through the charts twice so far the only genuine similarity among the four cases was the fact that their infectious disease symptoms had started after they had been admitted for other complaints but as laurie had pointed out by definition only nodelman was a nosocomial case in the other three situations the symptoms had come on within fortyeight hours of admission the only other possible similarity was the one that jack had already considered namely that all four patients were people whod been hospitalized frequently and hence were economically undesirable in a capitated system but other than that jack found nothing the ages ranged from twentyeight to sixtythree two had been on the medical ward one in obgyn and one in orthopedics there were no medications common to them all two were on keep open ivs socially they ranged from lower to uppermiddle class and there was no indication that any of the four knew any of the others there was one female and three males even their blood types differed jack tossed his pen onto his desk and leaned back in his chair to stare at the ceiling he didnt know what he expected from the charts but so far he hadnt learned anything knock knock a voice called jack turned to see laurie standing in the doorway i see you made it back from your foray to the general she said i dont think i was in any danger until i got back here jack said i know what you mean laurie said rumor had it that bingham was fit to be tied he wasnt happy but we managed to work it out jack said are you worried about the threat from the people who beat you up laurie asked i suppose jack said i havent thought too much about it im sure ill feel differently when i get to my apartment youre welcome to come over to mine laurie said i have a sad couch in my living room that pulls out into a decent bed youre kind to offer jack said but i have to go home sometime ill be careful did you learn anything to explain the central supply connection laurie asked i wish jack said not only didnt i learn anything but i found out that a number of people including the city epidemiologist and the hospital infectioncontrol officer have been in there beating the bushes for clues i had the mistaken notion it was a novel idea are you still thinking of the conspiracy slant laurie asked in some form or fashion jack admitted unfortunately it seems to be a lonely stance laurie wished him good luck he thanked her and she left a minute later she was back im planning on getting a bite on the way home laurie said are you interested thanks but ive started on these charts and i want to keep at it while the material is fresh in my mind i understand good night good night laurie jack said no sooner had jack opened nodelmans chart for the third time than the phone rang it was terese colleen is about to leave to meet up with chet terese said can i talk you into coming out for a quick dinner we could all eat together jack was amazed for five years hed been avoiding social attachments of any kind now suddenly two intelligent attractive women were both asking him to dine with them on the same night i appreciate the offer jack said he then told terese the same thing hed told laurie about the charts he was working on i keep hoping youll give up on that crusade terese said it hardly seems worth the risks since youve already been beaten up and threatened with the loss of your job if i can prove someone is behind this affair it will certainly be worth the risks jack said my fear is that there might be a real epidemic chet seems to think youre acting foolishly terese persisted hes entitled to his opinion jack said please be careful when you go home terese intoned i will jack said he was getting weary of everyones solicitude the danger of going home that evening was something hed considered as early as that morning well be working most of the night she added if you need to call call me at work okay jack said good luck good luck to you terese said and thanks for this no waiting idea everyone loves it so far im very grateful bye jack went back to nodelmans chart as soon as he put the phone down he was attempting to get through the reams of nurses notes but after five minutes of reading the same paragraph over and over he acknowledged he wasnt concentrating his mind kept mulling over the irony of both laurie and terese asking him to dine with them thinking about the two women led to pondering again the similarities and differences in their personalities and once he started thinking about personality beth holderness popped into his mind as soon as he thought about beth he began musing about the ease of ordering bacteria jack closed nodelmans chart and drummed his fingers on his desk he began to wonder if someone had obtained a culture of a pathological bacteria from national biologicals and then intentionally spread it to people could national biologicals tell it had been their bacteria the idea intrigued him with the advances in dna technology he thought it was scientifically possible for national biologicals to tag their cultures and for reasons of both liability and economic protection he thought it was a reasonable thing to do the question then became whether they did it or not jack searched for the phone number once he found it he put through a second call to the organization early that afternoon on jacks first call hed pressed two for sales this time he pressed three for support after being forced to listen to a rock music station for a few minutes jack heard a youthfulsounding male voice give his name igor krasnyansky and ask how he could be of assistance jack introduced himself properly on this occasion and inquired if he could pose a theoretical question of course igor said with a slight slavic accent i will try to answer if i had a culture of bacteria jack began is there any way that i could determine that it had originally come from your company even if it had gone through several passages in vivo thats an easy one igor said we phagetype all our cultures so sure you could tell it came from national biologicals whats the identification process jack asked we have a fluoresceinlabeled dna probe igor said its very simple if i wanted to make such an identification would i have to send the sample to you jack asked either that or i could send you some of the probe igor said jack was pleased he gave his address and asked for the probe to be shipped via overnight express he said he wanted it as soon as possible hanging up the phone jack felt pleased with himself he thought hed come up with something that might lend considerable weight to his theory of intentional spread if any of the patients bacteria tested positive jack looked down at the charts and considered giving up on them for the time being after all if the opposite turned out to be the case and none of the bacteria was from national biologicals perhaps he would have to rethink the whole affair jack scraped back his chair and stood up hed had enough for one day pulling on his jacket he prepared to head home suddenly the idea of some vigorous exercise had a strong appeal monday pm march beth holderness had stayed late to get all the throat cultures of the hospital employees planted the evening crew had come in at the usual time but at that moment they were down in the cafeteria having their dinner even richard had disappeared although beth wasnt sure if hed left for the day or not since the micro section of the lab was deserted except for her beth thought that if she were to do any clandestine searching this was as good a time as any sliding off her stool she walked over to the door to the main part of the lab she didnt see a soul which encouraged her further turning back to microbiology beth headed over to the insulated doors she wasnt sure she should be doing what she was doing but having said she would she felt some obligation she was confused about dr jack stapleton but she was even more confused about her own boss dr martin cheveau hed always been temperamental but lately that moodiness had reached ridiculous proportions that afternoon hed stormed in after dr stapleton had left demanding to know what she had told the medical examiner beth had tried to say that shed told him nothing of consequence and had tried to get him to leave but dr cheveau wouldnt listen he even threatened to fire beth for willfully disobeying him his ranting had brought her close to tears after hed left beth had thought about dr stapletons comment that people at the hospital including her boss had been acting defensively considering dr cheveaus behavior shed thought dr stapleton might be right it made her even more willing to follow up on dr stapletons request beth stood in front of the two insulated doors the one on the left was the walkin freezer the other the walkin incubator she debated which one to search first since shed been in and out of the incubator all day with the throat cultures she decided to tackle that first after all there was only a small area in the incubator where the contents were unfamiliar to her beth pulled open the door and entered immediately she was enveloped by the moist warm air the temperature was kept close to body temperature at fahrenheit many bacteria and viruses especially those that affected humans had understandably evolved to grow best at human body temperature the door behind beth closed automatically to seal in the heat the compartment was about eight by ten the lighting came from two bulbs covered with wire mesh mounted on the ceiling the shelving was perforated stainless steel it extended floor to ceiling on both walls along the back and down the center creating two narrow aisles beth made her way to the rear of the compartment there were stainlesssteel boxes back there that shed seen on numerous occasions but had never examined grasping one of the boxes with both hands beth slid it out from its shelf and put it on the floor it was about the size of a shoe box when she tried to open it she realized it had a latch that was secured with a miniature padlock beth was amazed and instantly suspicious few things in the lab were kept under lock and key picking the box up beth slid it back into place moving along the shelf she reached around each box in turn every one of them had the same type of lock bending down beth did the same on the lower shelf the condition of the fifth box was different as beth stuck her hand around its back she could feel that the padlocks clasp had not been closed insinuating her fingers between the unlocked box and its neighbors beth was able to slide it out as she lifted it she could tell it wasnt quite as heavy as the first locked box she feared it would be empty but it wasnt as she lifted its cover she saw that it contained a few petri dishes she also noted that the petri dishes did not bear the customary label that was used in the lab instead they only had greasepencil alphanumeric designators beth gingerly reached into the box and lifted out a petri dish labeled a she lifted the top and looked in at expanding bacterial colonies they were transparent and mucoid and they were growing on a medium she recognized as chocolate agar a sharp mechanical click of the insulated door opening startled beth her pulse raced like a child caught in a forbidden act she frantically tried to get the petri dish back in the box and the box back on the shelf before whoever was entering saw what she was doing unfortunately there wasnt enough time shed only had a chance to close the box and pick it up before she found herself facetoface with dr martin cheveau ironically he was at that moment carrying a box identical to the one she was holding what are you doing he snarled im beth voiced but that was all she could say under the pressure of the circumstance no potential explanation came to mind dr cheveau noisily stashed his box on one of the shelves then grabbed beths away from her he looked at the open latch wheres the lock he growled beth extended her hand and then opened it in her palm was the open padlock martin snatched it and examined it how did you get it open he demanded it was open beth asserted youre lying martin snapped im not beth said honest it was open and it made me curious likely story martin yelled his voice reverberated around the confined space i didnt disturb anything beth said how do you know you didnt disturb anything martin said he opened the box and glanced inside seemingly satisfied he closed it and locked it he tested the lock it held i only lifted the cover and looked at one culture dish beth said she was beginning to regain some composure although her pulse was still racing martin slipped the box into its position then he counted them all when he was finished he ordered her out of the incubator im sorry beth said after martin had closed the insulated door behind them i didnt know that i wasnt supposed to touch those boxes at that moment richard appeared in the doorway martin ordered him over then angrily related how hed caught beth handling his research cultures richard acted as upset as martin when he heard turning to beth he demanded to know why she would do such a thing he wondered whether they werent giving her enough work to do no one told me not to touch them beth protested she was again close to tears she hated confrontations and had already weathered a previous one only hours earlier no one told you to handle them either richard snapped did that dr stapleton put you up to this martin demanded beth hesitated not knowing how to respond as far as martin was concerned her hesitation was incriminating i thought as much he snapped he probably even told you about his preposterous idea that the plague cases and the others were started on purpose i told him i wasnt supposed to talk with him beth cried but talk he did martin said and obviously you listened well im not going to stand for it you are fired miss holderness take your things and get out i dont want to see your face again beth sputtered a protest and with it came tears crying is not going to get you anywhere martin spat out nor are excuses you made your choice now live with the consequences get out twin reached across the scarred desk and hung up the phone his real name was marvin thomas hed gotten the nickname twin because hed had an identical twin no one had been able to tell the two of them apart until one of them got killed in a protracted disagreement between the black kings and a gang from the east village over crack territories twin looked across the desk at phil phil was tall and skinny and hardly imposing but he had brains it had been his brains not his bravado or muscles that had caused twin to elevate him to numbertwo man in the gang he had been the only person to know what to do with all the drug money theyd been raking in up until phil took over theyd been burying the greenbacks in pvc pipe in the basement of twins tenement i dont understand these people twin said apparently that honky doctor didnt get our message and hes been out doing just what he damned well pleases can you believe it i hit that sucker with just about everything i got and three days later hes giving us the finger i dont call that respect no way the people want us to talk to him again phil asked hed been on the visit to jacks apartment and witnessed how hard twin had hit the man better than that twin said they want us to ice the bastard why they didnt have us do it the first time is anybodys guess theyre offering us five big ones twin laughed funny thing is i would have done it for nothing we cant have people ignoring us wed be out of business should we send reginald phil asked who else twin questioned this is the kind of activity he loves phil got to his feet and ground out his cigarette he left the office and walked down the litterstrewn hallway to the front room where a half dozen members were playing cards cigarette smoke hung heavily in the air hey reginald phil called out you up for some action reginald glanced up from his cards he adjusted the toothpick protruding from his mouth it depends he said i think youd like this one phil said five big ones to do away with the doctor whose bike you got hey man ill do it bj said bj was the nickname for bruce jefferson he was a stocky fellow with thighs as thick as phils waist hed also been on the visit to jacks twin wants reginald phil said reginald stood up and tossed his cards on the table i had a crap hand anyway he said he followed phil back to the office did phil tell you the story twin asked when they entered just that the doctor goes phil said and five big ones for us anything else yeah twin said you gotta do a white chick too might as well do her first heres the address twin handed over a scrap of paper with beth holdernesss name and address written on it you care how i do these honkies reginald asked i couldnt care less twin said just be sure you get rid of them id like to use the new machine pistol reginald said he smiled with the toothpick still stuck in the corner of his mouth itll be good to see if its worth the money we paid for it twin said twin opened up one of the desk drawers and withdrew a new tec pistol it still had some packing grease on the handle he gave the gun a shove across the desk reginald snapped it up before it got to the edge enjoy yourself twin added i intend to reginald said reginald made it a point never to show any emotion but that didnt mean he didnt feel it as he walked out of the building his mood was soaring he loved this kind of work he unlocked the driversside door of his jetblack camaro and slipped in behind the wheel he put the tec pistol on the passenger seat and covered it with a newspaper as soon as the motor was humming he turned on his tape deck and pushed in his current favorite rap cassette the car had a sound system that was the envy of the gang it had enough subwoofer power to loosen ceramic tile in whatever neighborhood reginald cruised with one last glance at beth holdernesss address and with his head bobbing with the music reginald pulled away from the curb and headed uptown beth hadnt gone directly home in her distressed state she needed to talk with someone shed stopped at a friends house and even had had a glass of wine after talking the situation over she felt somewhat better but was still depressed she couldnt believe shed been fired there was also the gnawing possibility that shed stumbled onto something significant in the incubator beth lived in a fivestory tenement on east eightythird street between first and second avenues it wasnt the greatest neighborhood but it wasnt bad either the only problem was that her building was not one of the best the landlord did the least possible in terms of repair and there was always trouble with something as beth arrived she saw there was a new problem the outer front door had been sprung open with a crowbar beth sighed it had happened before and it had taken three months for the landlord to fix it for several months beth had been intending to move out of the building and had been saving her money for a deposit on a new apartment now that she was out of work shed have to dip into her savings she probably couldnt move at least not for the foreseeable future as she climbed the last flight of stairs she told herself that as bad as things seemed they could be worse she reminded herself that at least she was healthy outside of her door beth fumbled with the clutter in the depths of her purse to find her apartment key which she kept separate from the building key her idea was that if she lost one she wouldnt necessarily lose the other finally coming up with the key she let herself into her apartment she closed and locked the door as was her habit after taking off her coat and hanging it up beth again searched through her purse for jack stapletons card when she found it she sat on the couch and gave him a call although it was after seven beth called the medical examiners office an operator told her that dr stapleton had left for the day turning the card over she tried jacks home number she got his answering machine dr stapleton beth said after jacks beep sounded this is beth holderness i have something to tell you beth choked back tears from a sudden surge of emotion she considered hanging up to collect herself but instead she cleared her throat and continued haltingly i have to talk with you i did find something unfortunately i was also fired so please call beth depressed the disconnect and then hung up the phone for a second she debated calling back to describe what she found but she decided against it shed wait for jack to call her beth was about to stand up when a tremendous crash shocked her into complete immobility the door to her apartment had burst open and it slammed back against the wall hard enough to drive the doorknob into the plaster the deadbolt that shed felt so secure about had splintered the doorjamb as if the jamb had been made of balsa wood a figure stood on the threshold like a magician appearing out of a cloud of smoke he was dressed from head to foot in black leather he glanced at beth then turned and yanked the door closed quiet returned to the apartment with the same suddenness as the explosive crash at the moment only the muffled sound of a tv in a neighboring apartment could be heard if beth could have envisioned this situation she would have thought shed scream or flee or both but she didnt do either shed been paralyzed shed even been holding her breath which she now let out with an audible sigh the man advanced toward her his face was expressionless a toothpick jauntily stuck out of his mouth in his left hand he brandished the largest pistol beth had ever seen its ammunition clip protruded down almost a foot the man stopped directly in front of beth he didnt say a word instead he slowly raised the pistol and pointed it at her forehead beth closed her eyes jack exited the subway at rd street and jogged north the weather was fine and the temperature reasonable he expected a big turnout at the playground and he wasnt disappointed warren saw him through the chainlink fence and told him to get his ass in gear and get over there jack jogged the rest of the way home as he approached his building thoughts of friday night and his uninvited visitors unwelcomely entered his mind having been at the general that day and having been discovered jack thought it was very possible that the black kings would be back if they were jack wanted to know about it instead of going in the front door jack descended a few steps and walked down a dank tunnel that connected the front and the back of his building it reeked of urine he emerged in the backyard which looked like a junkyard in the halflight he could make out the twisted remains of discarded bedsprings broken baby carriages bald car tires and other unwanted trash against the back of the building was a fire escape it didnt descend all the way to the ground the last segment was a metal ladder with a cement counterweight by turning over a garbage can and standing on its base jack was able to reach up and grab the lowest rung as soon as he put his weight on it it came down with a clatter jack climbed up the ladder when he stepped off onto the grate of the first landing the ladder retracted to its original position with equal clamor jack stood still for a few minutes to be sure that the din didnt disturb anyone when no one stuck their head out of a window to complain jack continued climbing on each floor jack had ample opportunity to glance in at the various domestic scenes but he assiduously avoided doing so it wasnt pretty when he saw it closeup jack found true poverty enervating jack also kept his eyes elevated to avoid looking down hed always been afraid of heights and climbing the fire escape was a test of his fortitude as jack approached his own floor he slowed down the fire escape serviced both his kitchen window and his bedroom window both of which were ablaze with light when hed left that morning hed left all the lights on jack sidled up to the kitchen window first and peered in the room was empty a grouping of fruit hed left on the table was undisturbed from where he was standing he could also see through to his door to the common hall his repair was still in place the door had not been forced open moving to the second window jack made sure that the bedroom was as hed left it satisfied he opened the window and climbed in he knew hed been taking a chance leaving the bedroom window unlocked but he thought it worth the risk once inside his apartment he made a rapid final check it was empty with no sign of any unexpected visitors having been there jack quickly changed into his basketball gear and exited the same way hed entered given his acrophobia descent was more difficult than ascent but jack forced himself to do it under the circumstances he wasnt wild about stepping out of his front door unprotected when jack got to the street end of the tunnel he paused in the shadows to view the area immediately in front of his building he was particularly concerned about seeing any groups of men sitting in cars when he was reasonably confident there were no hostile gang members waiting for him he jogged down to the playground unfortunately during the time hed taken to climb up and down the fire escape and change clothes the crowd at the playground had swelled it took jack even longer than usual to get into the game and when he did he ended up on a comparatively poor team although jacks shot was on particularly his long jumper his teammates werent the game was a rout to warrens delight his team had been winning all night disgusted with his luck jack went to the sidelines and picked up his sweatshirt pulling it over his head he started for the gate hey man you leaving already warren called out come on stick around well let you win one of these days warren guffawed he wasnt being a bad sport ridiculing the defeated was part of the accepted playground behavior everybody did it and everybody expected it i dont mind getting whipped if its by a decent team jack shot back but losing to a bunch of pansies is embarrassing ohhhh warrens teammates crooned jacks retort had been a good one warren strutted over to jack and stuck his index finger into jacks chest pansies huh he said i tell you what my five would devastate any five you could put together right now you pick we play jacks eyes swept around the court everybody was looking in their direction jack considered the challenge and weighed the pluses and the minuses first of all he wanted more exercise so he did want to play and he knew that warren could make it happen at the same time jack understood that picking four people out of the crowd would irritate the ones he didnt pick these were people jack had been painstakingly cultivating over the past months to accept him beyond that the people who were supposed to have winners would be especially vexed not at warren who was insulated from such emotion but at jack considering all the angles jack decided it wasnt worth it im going running in the park jack said having bested jacks retort and willing to accept jacks refusal to meet his challenge as another victory warren bowed in recognition of his teams cheering he highfived with one of them and then swaggered back onto the court lets run he yelled jack smiled to himself thinking how much the dynamics of the playground basketball court revealed about current intracity society vaguely he wondered if any psychologist had ever thought about studying it from an academic point of view he thought it would be fruitful indeed jack stepped through the chainlink gate onto the sidewalk and started jogging he ran due east ahead at the end of the block he could see the dark silhouettes of jagged rocks and leafless trees he knew that in a few minutes hed leave behind the bustle of the city and enter the placid interior of central park it was his favorite place to run reginald had been stymied there was no way he could have walked out into a playground in a hostile neighborhood having found the doc playing bball hed resigned himself to waiting in his camaro his hope was that jack would separate himself from the crowd perhaps by heading for one of the nearby delis for a drink when hed seen jack quit the game and pull on his sweater hed been encouraged enough to reach under the newspaper and snap the safety off the tec but then he heard warrens challenge and was sure hed be sitting through at least another game he was wrong to his delight a few minutes later jack came out of the playground but he didnt head west in the direction of the shops as reginald had anticipated instead he headed east cursing under his breath reginald had to make a uturn right in the middle of all the traffic a cabdriver complained bitterly by leaning on his horn it was all reginald could do to keep from reaching for the tec the cabdriver was one of those guys from the far east whom reginald would have loved to surprise with a couple of bursts reginalds disappointment turned back to delight when he became aware of jacks destination as jack sprinted across central park west reginald quickly parked leaping from the car he grabbed the tec along with the newspaper cradling the package in his hands he too dashed across central park west dodging the traffic at that point an entrance to the parks west drive continued eastward into the park nearby was a sweeping stone stairway that rose up around a rocky outcropping lampposts partially lit the walkway before it disappeared into the blackness reginald started up the stairs where hed seen jack go seconds earlier reginald was pleased he couldnt believe his luck in fact chasing his prey into the dark deserted park was making the job almost too easy from jacks point of view at that moment the parks desolate darkness was more a source of comfort than uneasiness unlike when hed crossed the park on his bike friday night he felt consolation in the fact that although his vision was hampered so was everyone elses he firmly believed if the black kings were to harass him it would be in and around his apartment the terrain where jacks run began was surprisingly hilly and rocky the area was called the great hill for good reason he was following an asphalt walkway that twisted turned and tunneled beneath the leafless branches of the surrounding trees the lights from the lampposts illuminated the branches in an eerie fashion giving the impression the park was covered by a giant spiders web although he felt winded at first jack settled into a comfortable pace and began to relax with the city out of view he had a chance to think more clearly he began to wonder if his crusade was based on his hatred for americare as chet and bingham had implied from his present perspective jack had to agree it was possible after all the idea of the intentional spread of the four diseases was implausible if not preposterous and if he found the people at the general defensive maybe hed made them respond that way as bingham had reminded him jack could be abrasive in the middle of his musings jack became aware of a new sound that coincided with his own footfalls it was a metallic click as if his basketball shoes had heelsavers perplexed jack altered his pace the sound went out of sync for a moment but then gradually merged back jack hazarded a glance behind him when he did he saw a figure running in his direction and closing at the moment jack spotted the figure the man was passing under a lamppost jack could see he was not dressed as a jogger in fact he was wearing black leather and in his hand he brandished a gun jacks heart leaped in his chest aided by an adrenaline rush he put on a burst of speed behind him he could hear his pursuer do likewise jack frantically tried to figure the fastest way out of the park if he was able to get among traffic and other people he might have a chance all he knew for sure was that the closest way to the city was through the foliage to his right he had no idea how far it could have been a hundred feet or a hundred yards sensing his pursuer was staying with him and perhaps even gaining jack veered right and plunged into the forest within the woods it was considerably darker than on the walkway jack could barely see where he was going as he stumbled up a steep grade he was in a full panic crashing over underbrush and scrambling through dense evergreens the hill leveled off at the summit and jack burst through to an area with considerably less undergrowth it was just as dark but there were only dead leaves to contend with as he ran between the closely spaced tree trunks happening upon a massive oak tree jack slipped behind and leaned against its rough surface he was breathing hard he tried to control his panting to listen all he could hear was the sound of distant traffic that reverberated like the muffled roar of a waterfall only occasional car horns and undulating sirens punctuated the night jack stayed behind the broad trunk of the oak for several minutes hearing no more footfalls he pushed off the tree and continued heading west now he moved slowly and as silently as possible nudging his feet forward in the leaves to keep the noise down his heart was racing jacks foot hit up against something soft and to his horror it seemed to explode in front of him for a second jack had no idea what was happening with great commotion a phantom figure swathed in rags lurched out of the ground as if resurrecting itself from the dead the creature whirled about like a dervish flailing at the air and shouting bastards over and over again instantly another figure loomed up as well equally frantic youre not gonna get our shopping cart the second man yelled well kill you first jack had only managed to take a single step backward when the first figure threw himself at him smothering him with a wretched stench and ineffectual blows jack tried to push him away but the man reached up and drew his fingernails down jacks face jack marshaled his strength to rid himself of this fetid vagrant who clung to his chest before jack could shake him loose a burst of gunfire shattered the night jack felt himself sprayed with fluid as the tramp stiffened then collapsed forward jack had to push him aside to keep from being knocked over backward the other vagrants keening brought forth a second burst of gunfire his wails of grief were cut off suddenly with a gurgle having seen the direction from which the second burst of gunfire had come jack turned and fled in the opposite direction once again he was in headlong flight despite the darkness and the obstacles suddenly the ground dropped off and jack stumbled down a steep hillside barely keeping his feet under him until he plunged into a dense undergrowth of vines and thornbushes jack clawed his way through the thick bushes until he burst out onto a walkway with such suddenness he fell to his hands and knees ahead he could see a flight of dimly lit granite stairs scrambling to his feet he dashed toward the stairs and took them two at a time as he neared the top a single shot rang out a bullet ricocheted off the stone to jacks right and whined off into the night trying to duck and weave jack reached the top of the stairs and emerged onto a terrace a fountain that had been turned off for the winter stood empty in its center three sides of the terrace were enclosed by an arcade in the center of the rear arcade was another stone stairway leading to another level jack heard the rapid metallic clicks of his pursuers shoes start up the stone stairway behind him he would be there in an instant jack knew he had no time to make it to the second stairway so he ran into the interior of the arcade within the arched space the darkness was complete jack advanced blindly by holding his hands out in front of him the pounding footfalls on the first stairway abruptly stopped jack knew his pursuer had reached the terrace jack continued forward moving faster heading for the second run of stairs to his horror he collided in the blackness with a metal trash can the noise was loud and unmistakable as the can tipped over and rolled to a stop almost immediately a burst of gunfire sounded the bullets entered the arcade and ricocheted wildly off the granite walls jack lay flat clasping his arms over his head until the final shell whined off into the night standing up again jack continued forward more slowly this time when he reached the corner he encountered more obstacles bottles and beer cans were strewn on the floor with no way for jack to avoid them jack winced every time one of his feet struck an object and the resulting noise echoed in the arcade but there was no stopping ahead a faint glow indicated where the second stairway rose up to the next level as soon as jack reached it he started climbing moving more quickly now that there was light enough to see where to put his feet jack was almost to the top when a sharp authoritative command rang out in the stillness hey man hold up or youre gone jack could tell from the sound of the mans voice that he was at the foot of the stairs at that range jack had no choice he stopped turn around jack did as he was told he could see that his pursuer had a huge pistol leveled at him remember me im reginald i remember you jack said come down here reginald ordered in between breaths im not climbing another stair for you no way jack descended slowly when he got to the third stair he stopped the only light was a suffused glow from the surrounding city reflected off the cloud cover jack could barely make out the mans features his eyes appeared to be bottomless holes man you got balls reginald said slowly he let his hand holding the tec pistol fall until it was dangling at his side and youre in shape i gotta hand you that what do you want from me jack asked whatever it is you can have it hey im not expecting anything reginald said cause i can tell you aint got much certainly not in those threads and ive already been to that shithole apartment of yours to be honest im just supposed to ice you word has it you didnt take twins recommendation ill pay you jack said whatever youre being paid to do this ill pay you more sounds interesting reginald said but i cant deal otherwise id have to answer to twin and you couldnt pay me enough to take on that kind of shit no way then tell me whos paying you jack said just so i know hey to tell you the truth i dont even know reginald said all i know is that the moneys good were getting five big ones just for me to chase you around the park for fifteen minutes id say thats not bad ill pay a thousand jack said he was desperate to keep reginald talking sorry reginald said our little rap is over and your numbers up as slowly as reginald had lowered the gun now he raised it jack couldnt believe he was going to be shot at pointblank range by someone he didnt know and who didnt know him it was preposterous jack knew he had to get reginald talking but as glib as jack was he couldnt think of anything more to say his gift for repartee had deserted him as he watched the gun rise up to the point where he was staring directly down the barrel my bad reginald said it was a comment that jack understood from his street basketball it meant that reginald was taking responsibility for what he was about to do the gun fired and jack winced reflexively even his eyes closed but he didnt feel anything then he realized that reginald was toying with him like a cat with a captured mouse jack opened his eyes as terrorized as he felt he was determined not to give reginald any satisfaction but what he saw shocked him reginald had disappeared jack blinked several times as if he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him when he looked more closely he could just make out reginalds body sprawled on the paving stones a dark stain like an octopuss ink was spreading out from his head jack swallowed but didnt move he was transfixed out of the shadows of the arcade stepped a man he was wearing a baseball hat backward in his hand he held a pistol similar to the one reginald had been carrying he went first to reginalds gun which had skidded ten feet away and picked it up he examined it briefly then thrust it into the top of his trousers he stepped over to the dead man and with the tip of his foot turned reginalds head over to look at the wound satisfied he bent down and frisked the body until he found a wallet he pulled it out pocketed it then stood up lets go doc the man said jack descended the last three steps when he got to the bottom he recognized his rescuer it was spit what are you doing here jack asked in a forced whisper his throat had gone bone dry this aint no time for rapping man spit said he then indulged in the act that had been the source of his sobriquet we gotta get the hell out of here one of those bums back on the hill was only winged and hes going to have this place crawling with cops from the moment spits gun had gone off in the arcade jacks mind had been spinning jack had no idea how spit happened to be there at such a crucial time or why he was now hustling him out of the park jack tried to protest he knew leaving a murder scene was a felony and there had been two murders not one but spit was not to be dissuaded in fact when jack finally stopped running and started to explain why they shouldnt flee spit slapped him it wasnt a gentle slap it was a blow with vengeance jack put his hand to his face his skin was hot where hed been struck what the hell are you doing jack asked trying to knock some sense into you man spit said we got to get our asses over to amsterdam here you carry this mother spit thrust reginalds machine pistol into jacks hands what am i supposed to do with it jack asked as far as he was concerned it was a murder weapon that should be handled with latex gloves and treated as evidence stick it under your sweater spit said lets get spit i dont think i can run away like this jack said you go if you must and take this thing jack extended the gun toward spit spit exploded he grabbed reginalds gun out of jacks hand and immediately pressed the barrel against jacks forehead youre pissing me off man he said whats the matter with you there still could be some of these black king assholes hanging around here i tell you what if you dont get your ass in gear im going to waste you you understand i mean i wouldnt be out here risking my black ass if it hadnt been for warren telling me to do it warren jack questioned everything was getting too complicated but he believed spits threat so he didnt try to question him further jack knew spit to be an impulsive man on the basketball court with a quick temper jack had never been willing to argue with him are you coming or what spit demanded im coming jack said im bowing to your better judgment damn straight spit said he handed the machine pistol back to jack and gave jack a shove to move out on amsterdam spit used a pay phone while jack waited nervously all at once the ubiquitous sirens heard in the distance in new york city had a new meaning for jack so did the concept of being a felon for years jack had been thinking of himself as a victim now he was the criminal spit hung up the phone and gave jack a thumbsup sign jack had no idea what the gesture meant but he smiled anyway since spit seemed to be content less than fifteen minutes later a lowered maroon buick pulled to the curb the intermittent thud of rap music could be heard through the tinted windows spit opened the back door and motioned for jack to slide in jack complied events were clearly not in his control spit gave a final look around before climbing into the front seat the car shot away from the curb whats happening the driver asked his name was david he was also a regular on the bball court a lot of shit spit said he rolled his window down and noisily expectorated jack winced each time the bass sounded in one of the many stereo speakers he slipped the machine pistol out from under his sweater having the thing close to his body gave him a distinctly unpleasant feeling what do you want me to do with this jack asked spit he had to talk loudly to be heard over the sound of the music spit swung around and took the gun he showed it to david who whistled in admiration thats the new model he commented with little talk the threesome drove north to th street and turned right david braked across from the playground the basketball game was still in progress wait here spit said he got out of the car and headed into the playground jack watched spit as he walked to the basketball court and stood on the sidelines as the game swept back and forth in front of him jack was tempted to ask david what was happening but his intuition told him to keep still eventually spit got warrens attention and warren stopped the game after a brief conversation during which spit passed reginalds wallet to warren the two men came back to davids car david lowered the window warren stuck his head in and looked at jack what the hell have you been doing he demanded angrily nothing jack said im the victim here why be angry with me warren didnt answer instead he ran his tongue around the inside of his dry mouth while he thought perspiration lined his forehead all at once he stood up and opened the door for jack get out he said we have to talk lets go up to your place jack slid out of the car he tried to look warren in the eye but warren avoided his stare warren started out across the street and jack followed spit came behind jack they climbed jacks stairs in silence you got anything to drink warren asked once they were inside gatorade or beer jack said he had restocked his refrigerator gatorade warren said he walked over to jacks couch and sat heavily jack offered spit the same choices he took beer after jack had provided the drinks he sat in the chair opposite the couch spit preferred to lean against the desk i want to know whats going on warren said you and i both jack said i dont want to hear any shit warren said cause you havent been straight with me what do you mean jack asked saturday you asked me about the black kings warren reminded him you said you were just curious now tonight one of those mothers tries to knock you off now i know something about those losers theyre into drugs big time you catch my drift what i want you to know is if youre mixed up with dealing i dont want you in this neighborhood its as simple as that jack let out a short laugh of incredulity is that what this is about he asked you think im dealing drugs doc listen to me warren said youre a strange dude i never understood why youre living here but its okay as long as you dont screw up the neighborhood but if youre here because of drugs you gotta rethink your situation jack cleared his throat he then admitted to warren that hed not been truthful with him when hed asked about the black kings he told him that the black kings had beaten him up but that it involved something concerning his work that even he didnt totally understand you sure youre not dealing warren asked again he looked at jack out of the corner of his eye cause if youre not straight with me now youre going to be one sorry shit im being entirely truthful jack assured him well then youre a lucky man warren said had david and spit not recognized that dude who came cruising around the neighborhood in his camaro youd be history right now spit says he was fixing to blow you away jack looked up at spit im very grateful he said it was nothing man spit said that mother was so fixed on getting you that he never once looked behind him wed been on his tail almost the moment he turned on a hundred and sixth jack rubbed his head and sighed only now was he truly beginning to calm down what a night he said but its not over weve got to go to the police hell we do warren said his anger returning nobodys going to the police but theres someone dead jack said maybe two or three counting those homeless guys therell be four if you go warren warned listen doc dont get yourself involved in gang business and this has become gang business this reginald dude knew he wasnt supposed to be up here no way i mean we cant have them thinking they can just breeze into our neighborhood and knock somebody off even if it is only you next theyd be icing one of the brothers leave it be doc the police dont give a shit anyway theyre happy when us brothers are knocking each other off all you can do is cause you and us trouble and if you go to the police youre no friend of ours no way but leaving the scene of a crime is a jack began yeah i know warren interrupted its a felony big deal who the hell cares and let me tell you something else you still got a problem if the black kings want you dead youd better be our friend because were the only ones who can keep you alive the cops cant believe me jack started to say something but he changed his mind with his knowledge of gang life in new york city he knew that warren was right if the kings wanted him dead which they apparently didand would all the more now with reginalds deaththere was no way for the police to prevent it short of secretservicetype twentyfourhour guard warren looked up at spit somebodys going to have to stick tight to doc for the next few days he said spit nodded no problem he said warren stood up and stretched what pisses me off is that i had the best team ive had in weeks tonight and this shit has cut it short im sorry jack said ill let you win next time i play against you warren laughed one thing i can say about you doc he said you can sure rap with the best of them warren motioned to spit to leave well be seeing you doc warren said at the door now dont do anything foolish you going to run tomorrow night maybe jack said he didnt know what he was going to do in the next five minutes much less the following night with a final wave warren and spit departed the door closed behind them jack sat for a few minutes he felt shellshocked then he got up went into the bathroom when he looked into the mirror he cringed at the time he and spit had been waiting for david to arrive with the car a few people had glanced at jack but no one had stared now jack wondered why they hadnt jacks face and sweater were spattered with blood presumably from the vagrant there was also a nasty series of parallel scratches from the vagrants fingernails down his forehead and over his nose a crosshatching of scratches marred his cheeks from the underbrush no doubt he looked like hed been in a war jack climbed into his tub and took a shower by then his mind was going a mile a minute he couldnt remember ever being in such a state of confusion except after his family had perished but that was different hed been depressed then now he was just confused jack got out of the shower and dried himself off he was still half debating whether or not to contact the police in a state of indecision he went to the phone thats when he noticed that his answering machine was blinking he pushed the play button and listened to beth holdernesss disturbing message instantly he called her back he let her phone ring ten times before giving up what could she have found he wondered he also felt responsible for her having been fired somehow he was sure he was to blame jack got a beer and took it into the living room sitting on the windowsill he could see a sliver of th street there was the usual traffic and parade of people he watched with unseeing eyes as he wrestled with his dilemma regarding calling the police hours passed jack realized that by not making a decision he was in essence making one by not calling the police he was agreeing with warren hed become a felon jack went back to the phone and tried beth for the tenth time it was now after midnight the phone rang interminably jack started to worry he hoped shed simply fled to a friends house for solace after losing her job yet not being able to get in touch with her nagged at him along with everything else tuesday am march new york city the first thing jack did when he woke up was to try calling beth holderness when shed still not answered hed tried to be optimistic about her visiting a friend but in the face of everything that had happened the inability to get ahold of her was progressively more distressing still without a bike jack was forced back into the subway for his commute but he wasnt alone from the moment jack had emerged from his tenement hed been trailed by one of the younger members of the local gang his name was slam in deference to his dunking ability with the basketball even though he was jacks height he could outjump jack by at least twelve inches jack and slam did not talk during the train ride they sat opposite each other and although slam didnt try to avoid eye contact his expression never changed from one of total indifference he was dressed like most of the younger africanamericans in the city with oversized clothes his sweatshirt was tentlike and jack preferred not to imagine what it concealed jack didnt believe that warren would have sent the young man out to protect jack without some significant weaponry as jack crossed first avenue and mounted the steps in front of the medical examiners office he glanced behind him slam had paused on the sidewalk obviously confused as to what he should do jack hesitated as well the unreasonable thought went through jacks mind of inviting the man in so that he could pass the time in the secondfloor canteen but that was clearly out of the question jack shrugged although he appreciated slams efforts on his behalf it was slams problem what he was going to do for the day jack turned back to the building steeling himself for the possibility of having to face one or more bodies in whose death he somehow felt complicit gathering his courage jack pulled open the door and entered even though he was scheduled for a paper day and no autopsies jack wanted to see what had come in during the night not only was he concerned about reginald and the vagrants he was also concerned about the possibility of more meningococcus cases jack had the receptionist buzz him into the id area walking into the scheduling room jack knew instantly that it was not going to be a normal day vinnie was not sitting in his usual location with his morning newspaper wheres vinnie jack asked george without looking up george told jack that vinnie was already in the pit with bingham jacks pulse quickened given his guilt about the previous evenings events he had the irrational thought that bingham could have been called in to do reginald at this stage of his career bingham rarely did autopsies unless they were of particular interest or importance whats bingham doing in this early jack asked trying to sound disinterested its been a busy night george said there was another infectious death over at the general apparently its got the city all worked up during the night the city epidemiologist called the commissioner of health who called bingham another meningococcus jack asked nope george said they think this one is a viral pneumonia jack nodded and felt a chill descend his spine his immediate concern was hantavirus he knew there had been a case on long island the previous year in the early spring hantavirus was a scary proposition although it was still not an illness with much patienttopatient spread jack could see there were more than the usual number of folders on the desk in front of george anything else interesting last night jack asked he shuffled through the folders looking for reginalds name hey george complained i got these things in order he looked up then did a double take what the hell happened to you jack had forgotten how bad his face looked i tripped when i was out jogging last night jack said jack didnt like to lie what he said was true but hardly the whole story what did you fall into george asked a roll of barbed wire any gunshot wounds last night jack asked to change the subject youd better believe it george said we got four too bad its a paper day for you id give you one which ones are they jack asked he glanced around the desk george tapped the top of one of his stacks of folders jack reached over and picked up the first one when he opened the cover his heart sank he had to reach out and steady himself against the desk the name was beth holderness oh god no jack murmured georges head shot up again whats the matter he asked hey youre as white as a sheet you okay jack sat in a nearby chair and put his head down between his legs he felt dizzy is it someone you know george asked with concern jack straightened up the dizziness had passed he took a deep breath and nodded she was an acquaintance he said but id spoken with her just yesterday jack shook his head i cant believe it george reached over and took the folder from jacks hands he opened it up oh yeah he said this is the lab tech from over at the general sad she was only twentyeight supposedly shot through the forehead for a tv and some cheap jewelry what a waste what are the other gunshot wounds jack asked for the moment he remained seated george consulted his master sheet ive got a hector lopez west hundred and sixtieth street a mustafa aboud east nineteenth street and reginald winthrope central park let me see winthrope jack said george handed jack the folder jack opened it up he wasnt looking for anything in particular but his sense of involvement made him want to check the case the strangest thing was that had it not been for spit jack himself would have been represented there on georges desk with his own folder jack shuddered he handed reginalds folder back to george is laurie here yet jack asked she came in just before you did george said she wanted some folders but i told her that id not made out the schedule yet where is she jack asked up in her office i guess george said i really dont know assign her the holderness and the winthrope cases jack said jack stood up he anticipated feeling dizzy again but he didnt how come george asked george just do it jack said all right dont get mad george said im sorry jack said im not mad just preoccupied jack walked back through communications he passed janices office where she was putting in her usual overtime jack didnt bother her he was too absorbed by his own thoughts beth holdernesss death made him feel unhinged feeling guilty about his complicity in her losing her job was bad enough the idea that she might have lost her life because of his actions was unthinkable jack pressed the button for the elevator and waited the attempt on his own life the night before had given more weight to his suspicions someone had tried to kill him after he refused to heed the warning the very same night beth holderness had been murdered could it have been in the course of an unrelated robbery or could it have been because of jack and if so what did that mean about martin cheveau jack didnt know but what he did know was that he could not involve anyone else in this affair for fear of putting them in jeopardy from that moment on jack knew he had to keep everything to himself as george had surmised laurie was in her office while waiting for george to assign the days cases she was using the time profitably working on some of her uncompleted cases she took one look at jack and recoiled jack offered the same explanation hed given george but he could tell that laurie wasnt quite convinced did you hear that bingham is down in the pit jack asked to move the conversation away from his previous nights experiences i did laurie said i was shocked i didnt think there was anything that could get him here before eight much less in the autopsy room do you know anything about the case jack asked just that it was atypical pneumonia laurie said i spoke with janice for a moment she said theyd had preliminary confirmation it was influenza uhoh jack said i know what youre thinking laurie said wagging her finger influenza was one of the diseases you said youd use if you were a terrorist type trying to start an epidemic but before you go jumping off using this as confirmation of your theory just remember that it is still influenza season primary influenza pneumonia is not very common jack said trying to stay calm the mention of the word influenza had his pulse racing again we see it every year laurie said maybe so jack said but i tell you what how about calling that internist friend of yours and asking if there are any more cases right now laurie asked she glanced at her watch its as good a time as any jack said shell probably be making her rounds she can use the computer terminal at one of the nurses stations laurie shrugged and picked up her phone a few minutes later she had her friend on the line she asked the question then waited while she waited she looked up at jack she was worried about him his face was not only scratched up it was now flushed no cases laurie repeated into the phone when her friend came back on the line thanks sue i appreciate it talk to you soon bye laurie hung up the phone satisfied she said for the moment jack said listen i asked george to assign you two particular cases this morning the names are holderness and winthrope is there some specific reason laurie asked she could see that jack was trembling do it as a favor jack said of course laurie said one thing id like you to do is look for any hairs or fibers on the holderness womans body jack said and find out if homicide had a criminologist at the scene to do the same if there are any hairs see if there is a dna match with winthrope laurie didnt say anything when she found her voice she asked you think that winthrope killed holderness her voice reflected her disbelief jack looked off and sighed theres a chance he said how would you know laurie asked lets call it a disturbing hunch jack said he would have liked to tell laurie more but with the new pact he had with himself he didnt he wasnt about to put anyone else at risk in any form or fashion now you really have my curiosity going laurie said id like to ask one more favor jack said you told me that you had a relationship with a police detective whos now a friend thats true laurie said do you think you could give him a call jack said id like to talk with him sorta off the record you are scaring me laurie said are you in some kind of trouble laurie jack said please dont ask any questions the less you know right now the better off you are but i think i should talk to someone high up in law enforcement you want me to call him now whenever is convenient jack said laurie blew out through pursed lips as she dialed lou soldanos number shed not talked to him in a few weeks and she felt it was a little awkward calling about a situation she knew so little about but she was definitely worried about jack and wanted to help when police headquarters answered and laurie asked for lou she was told the detective wasnt available she left a message on his voice mail for him to call her thats the best i could do laurie said as she hung up knowing lou hell be back to me as soon as he can i appreciate it jack said he gave her shoulder a squeeze he had the comforting sense she was a true friend jack went back to his own office just in time to run into chet chet took one look at jacks face and whistled and what did the other guy look like chet asked jokingly im not in the mood jack said he took off his jacket and hung it over his chair i hope this doesnt have anything to do with those gang members who visited you friday chet said jack gave the same explanation hed given to the others chet flashed a wry smile as he stowed his coat in his file cabinet sure you fell while jogging he said and im dating julia roberts but hey you dont have to tell me what happened im just your friend that was exactly the point jack mused after checking to see if he had any phone messages he started back out of the office you missed a nice little dinner last night chet said terese came along we talked about you shes a fan of yours but shes as concerned as i am about your monomania concerning these infectious cases jack didnt even bother to answer if chet or terese knew what had really happened last night theyd be more than concerned returning to the first floor jack looked into janices office now he wanted to ask her about the influenza case that was being posted by bingham but shed left jack descended to the morgue level and changed into his isolation gear he went into the autopsy room and walked up to the only table in operation bingham was on the patients right calvin on the left and vinnie at the head they were almost done well well bingham said when jack joined them isnt this convenient heres our inhouse infectious expert perhaps the expert would like to tell us what this case is calvin challenged ive already heard jack said influenza too bad bingham said it would have been fun to see if you truly have the nose for this stuff when it came in early this morning there was no diagnosis yet the suspicion was some sort of viral hemorrhagic fever it had everybody up in arms when did you learn it was influenza jack asked a couple of hours ago bingham answered just before we started its a good case though you want to see the lungs i would jack said bingham reached into the pan and lifted out the lungs he showed the cut surface to jack my god the whole lung is involved jack commented he was impressed in some areas there was frank hemorrhage even some myocarditis bingham said he put the lung back and lifted up the heart and displayed it for jack when you can see the inflammation grossly like this you know its extensive looks like a virulent strain jack said youd better believe it bingham said this patients only twentynine years old and his first symptoms occurred around six last night he was dead at four am it reminds me of a case i did back in my residency during the pandemic of fiftyseven and fiftyeight vinnie rolled his eyes bingham had a mindnumbing habit of comparing every case to one that hed had in his long career that case was also a primary influenza pneumonia bingham continued same appearance of the lung when we looked at it histologically we were amazed at the degree of damage it gave us a lot of respect for certain strains of influenza seeing this case concerns me jack said especially in light of the other diseases that have been popping up now dont head off into left field bingham warned remembering some of jacks comments the day before this isnt out of the ordinary like the plague case or even the tularemia its flu season primary influenza pneumonia is a rare complication but we see it in fact we had a case just last month jack listened but bingham wasnt making him feel any more comfortable the patient in front of them had had a lethal infection with an agent that had the capability of spreading from patient to patient like wildfire jacks only consolation was the call laurie had made to her internist friend whod said there were no other cases in the hospital mind if i take some washings jack asked hell no bingham said be my guest but be careful what you do with them obviously jack said jack took the lungs over to one of the sinks and with vinnies help prepared some samples by washing out some of the small bronchioles with sterile saline he then sterilized the outside of the containers with ether jack was on his way out when bingham asked him what he was going to do with the samples take them up to agnes jack said id like to know the subtype bingham shrugged and looked across at calvin not a bad idea calvin said jack did exactly what he said he would but he was disappointed when he presented the bottles to agnes up on the third floor we dont have the capability of subtyping it she said who does jack asked the city or state reference lab agnes said or even over at the university lab but the best place would be the cdc they have a whole section devoted to influenza if it were up to me id send it there jack got some viral transport medium from agnes and transferred the washings into it then he went up to his office sitting down he placed a call to the cdc and was put through to the influenza unit a pleasantsounding woman answered introducing herself as nicole marquette jack explained what he wanted and nicole was accommodating she said shed be happy to see that the influenza was typed and subtyped if i manage to get the sample to you today jack said how long would it take for you to do the typing we cant do this overnight nicole said if thats what you have in mind why not jack asked impatiently well maybe we could nicole corrected herself if there is a sufficient viral titer in your sample meaning enough viral particles i suppose it is possible do you know what the titer is i havent the faintest idea jack said but the sample was taken directly from the lung of a patient who passed away from primary influenza pneumonia the strain is obviously virulent and im worried about a possible epidemic if it is a virulent strain then the titer might be high nicole said ill find a way to get it to you today jack promised he then gave nicole his telephone number both at the office and at home he told her to call anytime she had any information well do the best we can nicole said but i have to warn you if the titer is too low it might be several weeks before i get back to you weeks jack complained why because well have to grow the virus out nicole explained we usually use ferrets and it takes a good two weeks for an adequate antibody response which guarantees well have a good harvest of virus but once we have the virus in quantity we can tell you a lot more than just its subtype in fact we can sequence its genome ill keep my fingers crossed that my samples have a high titer jack said and one other question what subtype would you think was the most virulent whoa nicole said thats a hard question there are a lot of factors involved particularly host immunity id have to say the most virulent would be an entirely new pathological strain or one that hasnt been around for a long time i suppose the subtype that caused the pandemic of to that killed twentyfive million people worldwide might get the dubious honor of having been the most virulent what subtype was that jack asked no one knows for sure nicole said the subtype doesnt exist it disappeared years ago maybe right after the epidemic wore itself out some people think it was similar to the subtype that caused that swineflu scare back in seventysix jack thanked nicole and again assured her hed get the samples to her that day after he hung up he called agnes back and asked her opinion on shipping she told him the name of the courier service they used but she said she didnt know if they shipped interstate besides agnes added it will cost a small fortune i mean overnight is one thing but youre talking about the same day bingham will never authorize it i dont care jack said ill pay for it myself jack called the courier company they were delighted with the request and put jack through to one of the supervisors tony liggio when jack explained what he wanted tony said no problem can you come to pick it up now jack asked he was encouraged ill send someone right away tony said it will be ready jack said jack was about to hang up when he heard tony add arent you interested in the cost i mean this is not like taking something over to queens also theres the question of how you plan to pay credit card jack said if thats okay sure no problem doc tony said its going to take me a little while to figure out the exact charge just give me a ballpark figure jack said somewhere between one and two thousand dollars tony said jack winced but didnt complain instead he merely gave tony his credit card number hed envisioned the cost would be two or three hundred dollars but then he hadnt thought about the fact that someone might have to fly roundtrip to atlanta while jack had been engaged in giving his credit card information one of the secretaries from the front office had appeared at his door shed handed him an overnight federal express package and departed without saying a word as jack hung up from the courier service he saw that the parcel was from national biologicals it was the dna probes hed requested the day before taking the probes and his viral samples jack went back down to agnes he told her about the arrangements hed made with the courier service im impressed agnes said but im not going to ask how much its costing dont jack advised how should i package the samples well take over she said she called in the department secretary and commissioned her to do it with appropriate biohazard containers and labels looks like you have something else for me she said eyeing the vials containing the probes jack explained what they were and what he wanted namely to have the dna lab use the probes to see if they reacted with the nucleoproteins of the cultures taken from any of the four recent infectious disease cases hed been working on what he didnt tell her was why he wanted it done all i need to know is whether it is positive or not jack said it doesnt have to be quantitative ill have to handle the rickettsia and the tularemia agent myself agnes said im afraid to have any of the techs working with them i really appreciate all this jack said well its what were here for agnes said agreeably after leaving the lab jack went downstairs to the scheduling room and helped himself to some coffee hed been so frantic since hed arrived that hed not had much time to think now as he stirred his coffee he realized that neither of the homeless men that hed inadvertently run into in his flight from reginald had been brought in that meant that they were either in some hospital or they were still out there in the park carrying his coffee back upstairs jack sat down at his desk with both laurie and chet in the autopsy room he knew he could count on some peace and quiet before he could enjoy his solitude the phone interrupted it was terese im mad at you she said without preamble thats wonderful jack said with his usual sarcasm now my day is complete i am angry terese maintained but her voice had softened considerably colleen just hung up from talking with chet he told her you were beaten up again that was chets personal interpretation jack said the fact is i wasnt beaten up again you werent i explained to chet that id fallen while jogging jack said but he told colleen terese jack said sharply i wasnt beaten up can we talk about something else well if you werent assaulted why are you sounding so irritable its been a stressful morning jack admitted care to talk about it she asked thats what friends are for ive certainly bent your ear about my problems theres been another infectious death at the general jack said he would have liked to tell her what was really on his mindhis sense of guilt about beth holdernessbut he dared not thats terrible terese said what is wrong with that place what is it this time influenza jack said a very virulent case its the kind of illness ive been truly worried wed see but the flu is around terese said its flu season thats what everybody says jack admitted but not you put it this way jack said im worried especially if it is a unique strain the deceased was a young patient only twentynine in the face of what else has been popping up over there at the general im worried are some of your colleagues worried as well terese asked at the moment im on my own jack admitted i guess were lucky to have you terese said i have to admire your dedication thats kind of you to say jack said actually i hope im wrong but youre not going to give up are you not until i have some proof one way or the other jack said but lets talk about you i hope you are doing better than i i appreciate your asking terese said thanks in no small part to you i think we have the makings of a good ad campaign plus ive managed to have the inhouse presentation put off until thursday so we have another whole day of breathing room at the moment things are looking reasonable but in the advertising world that could change at any moment well good luck jack said he wanted to get off the phone maybe we could have a quick dinner tonight terese suggested id really enjoy it theres a great little italian restaurant just up the street on madison its possible jack said ill just have to see how the day progresses come on jack terese complained you have to eat we both could use the relaxation not to mention the companionship i can hear the tension in your voice im afraid im going to have to insist all right jack said relenting but it might have to be a short dinner he realized there was some truth to what terese was saying although at the moment it was hard for him to think as far ahead as dinnertime fantastic terese said happily call me later and well decide on the time if im not here ill be home okay ill call you jack promised after they exchanged goodbyes jack hung up the phone for a few minutes he stared at it he knew that conventional wisdom held that talking about a problem was supposed to relieve anxiety but at the moment having talked about the case of influenza with terese he only felt more anxious at least the viral sample was on its way to the cdc and the dna lab was working with the probe from national biologicals maybe soon hed start to get some answers tuesday am march phil came through the outer door of the abandoned building the black kings had taken over the door was a piece of threequarterinch plywood bolted to an aluminum frame phil passed the front room with the invariable pall of cigarette smoke and interminable card game and rushed directly back to the office he was relieved to see twin at the desk phil waited impatiently for twin to wrap up a payoff from one of their elevenyearold pushers and send the kid away theres a problem phil said theres always a problem twin said philosophically he was recounting the ragged stack of greenbacks the kid had brought in not like this one phil said reginalds been tagged twin looked up from the money with an expression as if hed just been slapped get out he said whered you hear that shit its true phil insisted he took one of the several beatup straightbacked chairs standing against the wall and turned it around so he could sit on it backward the pose provided visual harmony with the backward baseball cap he always wore who says twin asked its all over the street phil said emmett heard it from a pusher up in times square seems that the doc is being protected by the gangsta hoods from manhattan valley on the upper west side you mean one of the hoods iced reginald twin asked in total disbelief thats the story phil said shot him through the head twin slammed his open palm on the desk hard enough to send the tattered stack of greenbacks wafting off into the air he leaped to his feet and paced he gave the metal wastebasket a hard kick i cant believe this he said what the hell is this world coming to i dont understand it theyd do a brother for some white honky doctor it doesnt make sense no way maybe the doc is doing something for them phil suggested i dont care what the hell hes doing twin raged he towered over phil and phil cringed phil was well aware that twin could be ruthless and unpredictable when he was pissed and he was royally pissed at the moment returning to the desk twin pounded it again i dont understand this but there is one thing that i do know it cant stand no way the hoods cant go around knocking off a black king without a response i mean at a minimum we gotta do the doc like we agreed word is that the hoods have a tail on the doc phil said they are still protecting him its unbelievable twin said as he retook his seat at the desk but it makes things easier we do the doc and the tail at the same time but we dont do it in the hoods neighborhood we do it where the doc works twin pulled open the center drawer of his desk and rummaged around where the hell is that sheet about the doc he said side drawer phil said twin glared at phil phil shrugged he didnt want to aggravate twin but he remembered twin putting the sheet in the side drawer twin got the sheet out and read it over quickly all right he said go get bj hes been itching for action phil disappeared for two minutes when he reappeared he had bj with him bj lumbered into the office his pace belying his notorious quickness twin explained the circumstances think you can handle this twin asked hey no problem bj said you want a backup twin asked hell no bj said ill just wait until the two mothers are together then nail them both youll have to pick the doc up where he works twin said we cant risk going up into the hoods neighborhood unless we go in force you understand no problem bj said you got a machine pistol twin asked no bj said twin opened the lower drawer of the desk and took out a tec like the one hed given to reginald dont lose this he said we only have so many no problem bj said he took the gun and handled it with reverence turning it over slowly in his hands well what are you waiting for twin asked you finished bj asked of course im finished twin said what do you want me to come along and hold your hand get out of here so you can come back and tell me its done jack could not concentrate on his other cases no matter how hard he tried it was almost noon and hed accomplished a pitifully small amount of paperwork he couldnt stop worrying about the influenza case and wondering what had happened to beth holderness what could she have found jack threw down his pen in disgust he wanted desperately to go to the general and visit cheveau and his lab but he knew he couldnt cheveau would undoubtedly call in the marines at a minimum and jack would get himself fired jack knew he had to wait for the results with the probe from national biologicals to give him some ammunition before he approached anyone in authority giving up on his paperwork jack impulsively went up to the dna lab on the sixth floor in contrast to most of the rest of the building this lab was a stateoftheart facility it had been renovated recently and outfitted with the latest equipment even the white lab coats worn by the personnel seemed crisper and whiter than in any of the other labs jack sought out the director ted lynch who was on his way to lunch did you get those probes from agnes jack asked yup ted said theyre in my office i guess that means therere no results yet jack said ted laughed what are you talking about he questioned we havent even gotten the cultures yet besides i think you might be underestimating what the process is going to be we dont just throw the probes into a soup of bacteria we have to isolate the nuclear protein then run it through the pcr in order to have enough substrate otherwise we wouldnt see the fluorescence even if the probe reacted its going to take some time sufficiently chastised jack returned to his office to stare at the wall behind his desk although it was lunchtime he wasnt hungry in the slightest jack decided to call the city epidemiologist jack was interested in the mans reaction to this case of influenza he thought he could give the epidemiologist a chance to redeem himself jack got the number from the city directory and placed the call a secretary answered jack asked to speak with dr abelard who should i say is calling the secretary asked dr stapleton jack said resisting the temptation to be humorously sarcastic knowing abelards sensitive ego jack would have liked to have said he was the mayor or the secretary of health jack twisted a paper clip mindlessly as he waited when the phone was picked up again he was surprised it was again the secretary excuse me she said but dr abelard told me to tell you that he does not wish to speak with you tell the good doctor that i am in awe of his maturity jack said jack slammed the phone down his first impression had been correct the man was an ass anger now mixed with his anxiety which made his current inaction that much more difficult to bear he was like a caged lion he had to do something what he wanted to do was go to the general despite binghams admonitions yet if he went over there whom could he talk with jack made a mental checklist of the people he knew at the hospital suddenly he thought of kathy mcbane shed been both friendly and open and she was on the infection control committee jack snatched up the phone again and called the manhattan general kathy was not in her office so he had her paged she picked up the page from the cafeteria jack could hear the usual babble of voices and clink of tableware in the background he introduced himself and apologized for interrupting her lunch it doesnt matter kathy said agreeably what can i do for you do you remember me jack asked absolutely kathy said how could i forget after the reaction you got out of mr kelley and dr zimmerman they are not the only people i seem to have offended in your hospital jack admitted everybody has been on edge since these infectious cases kathy said i wouldnt take it personally listen jack said im concerned about the same cases and id love to come over and talk to you directly would you mind but it will have to be just between the two of us is that too much to ask no not at all kathy said when did you have in mind im afraid i have meetings scheduled for most of the afternoon how about right now jack said ill pass up lunch now thats dedication kathy said how can i refuse my office is in administration on the first floor uhoh jack voiced is there a chance id run into mr kelley the chances are slim kathy said theres a group of bigwigs in from americare and mr kelley is scheduled to be locked up with them all day im on my way jack said jack exited from the front entrance on first avenue he was vaguely aware of slam straightening up from where he was leaning against a neighboring building but jack was too preoccupied to take much notice he flagged a cab and climbed in behind him he saw slam following suit bj had not been entirely confident hed recognize jack from the visit to the docs apartment but the moment jack appeared at the door of the medical examiners office bj knew it was him while hed been waiting bj had tried to figure out who was supposedly protecting jack for a while a tall muscular dude had loitered on the corner of first avenue and thirtieth street smoking and intermittently looking up at the medical examiner buildings door bj had thought he was the one but eventually hed left so bj had been surprised when hed seen slam stiffen in response to jacks appearance hes no more than a goddamn kid bj had whispered to himself he was disgusted he expected a more formidable opponent no sooner had bj gotten his hand around the butt of his machine pistol which he had in a shoulder holster under his hooded sweatshirt than he saw first jack and then slam jump into separate cabs letting go of his gun bj stepped out into the street and flagged his own taxi just head north bj told the cabdriver but push it man the pakistani cabdriver gave bj a questioning look but then did as he was told bj kept slams cab in sight aided by the fact that it had a broken taillight jack jumped out of the cab and dashed into the general and across the lobby the masks had been dispensed with now that the meningococcal scare had passed so jack couldnt use one to hide behind concerned about being recognized he wanted to spend the least time possible in the hospitals public places he pushed through the doors into the administrative area hoping that kathy had been right about kelleys being occupied the sounds of the hospital died away as the doors closed behind him he was in a carpeted hall happily he saw no one he recognized jack approached the first secretary he came upon and asked for kathy mcbanes office he was directed to the third door on the right losing no time jack hustled down there and stepped in hello jack called out as he closed the door behind him i hope you dont mind my shutting us in like this i know its presumptuous but as i explained there are a few people i dont want to see if it makes you feel better by all means kathy said come and sit down jack took one of the seats facing the desk it was a small office with barely enough room for a desk two facing chairs and a file cabinet the walls had a series of diplomas and licenses attesting to kathys impressive credentials the decoration was spartan but comfortable there were family photos on the desk kathy herself appeared as jack remembered her friendly and open she had a round face with small delicate features her smile came easily im very concerned about this recent case of primary influenza pneumonia jack said losing no time whats been the reaction of the infection control committee weve not met yet kathy said after all the patient just passed away last night have you spoken about it with any of the other members jack asked no kathy admitted why are you so concerned weve seen a lot of influenza this season frankly this case hasnt bothered me anywhere near the way the others did particularly the meningococcus it bothers me because of a pattern jack said it presented as a fulminant form of a pneumonia just like the other rarer diseases the difference is that with influenza the infectivity is higher it doesnt need a vector it spreads person to person i understand that kathy said but as ive pointed out weve been seeing influenza all winter long primary influenza pneumonia jack questioned well no kathy admitted this morning i had someone check to see if there were any other similar cases currently in the hospital jack said there werent do you know if there are now not that i am aware of kathy said could you check jack asked kathy turned to her terminal and punched in a query the answer flashed back in an instant there were no cases of influenza pneumonia all right jack said lets try something else the patients name was kevin carpenter where was his room in the hospital he was on the orthopedic floor kathy said his symptoms started at six pm jack said lets see if any of the orthopedic nurses on the evening shift are sick kathy hesitated for a moment then turned back to her computer terminal it took her several minutes to get the list and the phone numbers you want me to call them now kathy asked theyre due in for their shift in just a couple of hours if you dont mind jack said kathy started making the calls on her second call to a ms kim spensor she discovered that the woman was ill in fact shed just been preparing to call in sick she admitted to severe flu symptoms with a temperature of almost would you mind if i talked with her jack asked kathy asked kim if shed be willing to speak to a doctor who was in her office kim apparently agreed because kathy handed the phone to jack jack introduced himself but not as a medical examiner he commiserated with her about her illness and then inquired about her symptoms it started abruptly kim said one minute i was fine the next minute i had a terrible headache and a shaking chill also my muscles are aching particularly my lower back ive had the flu before but this is the worst ive ever felt any cough jack asked a little kim said and its been getting worse how about substernal pain jack asked behind your breastbone when you breathe in yes kim said does that mean anything in particular did you have much contact with a patient by the name of carpenter jack asked i did kim said and so did the lpn george haselton mr carpenter was a demanding patient once he started complaining of headache and chills you dont think my contact with him could be the cause of my symptoms do you i mean the incubation period for the flu is more than twentyfour hours im not an infectious disease specialist jack said i truly dont know but id recommend you take some rimantadine how is mr carpenter kim asked if you give me the name of your local pharmacy ill call you in a prescription jack said purposefully ignoring kims question obviously his fulminant course started after kims shift had departed as soon as he could jack terminated the conversation he handed the phone back to kathy i dont like this jack said its just what i was afraid of arent you being an alarmist kathy questioned id guess two to three percent of the hospital personnel are out with the flu currently lets call george haselton jack said george haselton turned out to be even sicker than kim hed already called in sick to the floor supervisor jack didnt talk to him he simply listened to kathys side of the conversation kathy hung up slowly now youre starting to get me worried she admitted they called the rest of the evening shift for the orthopedic floor including the ward secretary no one else was ill lets try another department jack said someone from the lab must have been in to see carpenter how can we check ill call ginny whalen in personnel kathy said picking up the phone again a half hour later they had the full picture four people had symptoms of a bad case of the flu besides the two nurses one of the evening microbiology techs had abruptly experienced sore throat headache shaking chill muscle pain cough and substernal discomfort his contact with kevin carpenter had occurred about ten oclock in the evening when hed visited the patient to obtain a sputum culture the final person from the evening shift who was similarly ill was gloria hernandez to kathys surprise but not jacks she worked in central supply and had had no contact with kevin carpenter she cant be related to the others kathy said i wouldnt be too sure jack said he then reminded her that someone from central supply had perished with each of the other recent infectious cases im surprised this hasnt been a topic of debate with the infection control committee i know for a fact that both dr zimmerman and dr abelard are aware of the connection because they have been to central supply to talk to the supervisor mrs zarelli we havent had a formal committee meeting since all this started kathy said we meet on the first monday of each month then dr zimmerman is not keeping you informed jack said it wouldnt be the first time kathy said weve never been on the best of terms speaking of mrs zarelli jack said shed promised me printouts of everything central supply had sent to each of the index cases could we see if she has them and if so have her bring them down having absorbed some of jacks anxiety about the influenza kathy was eager to help after talking briefly to mrs zarelli and ascertaining that the printouts were available kathy had one of the administrative secretaries run up to get them let me have gloria hernandezs phone number jack said in fact give me her address as well this central supply connection is a mystery that for the life of me i cant understand it cant be coincidence and could be key to understanding what is going on kathy got the information from the computer wrote it down and handed it to jack what do you think we should do here at the hospital she asked jack sighed i dont know he admitted i guess youll have to discuss that with friendly dr zimmerman shes the local expert in general quarantine is not very effective for influenza since it spreads so quickly but if this is some special strain perhaps it would be worth a try i think id get those hospital personnel who are sick in here and isolate them worst case its an inconvenience best case it could help avert a disaster what about rimantadine kathy asked im all for it jack said ill probably get some myself it has been used to control some nosocomial influenza in the past but again that should be up to dr zimmerman i think ill give her a call kathy said jack waited while kathy spoke to dr zimmerman kathy was deferential but firm in explaining the apparent connection between the sick personnel and the deceased kevin carpenter once she had spoken she was reduced to silence punctuated only by repetitions of yes at certain intervals eventually kathy hung up she rolled her eyes that woman is impossible she said at any rate shes reluctant to do anything extraordinary as she puts it with just one confirmed case shes afraid mr kelley and the americare executives would be against it for pr reasons until it was undeniably indicated what about the rimantadine jack asked on that she was a little more receptive kathy said she said shed authorize the pharmacy to order in enough for the staff but she wasnt going to prescribe it just yet at any rate i got her attention at least thats something jack agreed the secretary knocked and came in with the printouts jack had wanted from central supply he thanked the woman and immediately began scanning them he was impressed it was rather extraordinary what each patient utilized the lists were long and included everything short of medications food and linen anything interesting kathy asked nothing that jumps out at me jack admitted except how similar they are but i realize i should have asked for a control i should have asked for a similar list from a random patient that shouldnt be hard to get kathy said she called mrs zarelli back and asked her to print one out want to wait kathy said jack got to his feet i think ive overstretched my luck as it is he said if you could get it and have it sent over to the medical examiners office id be appreciative as i mentioned this central supply connection could be important id be happy to do it kathy said jack went to the door and furtively glanced out into the hall turning back to kathy he said its hard to get used to acting like a criminal i think were in your debt for your perseverance kathy said i apologize for those who have misinterpreted your intentions thank you jack said sincerely can i ask you a personal question kathy asked how personal jack asked just about your face kathy asked what happened whatever it was it looks like it must have been painful it looks worse than it is jack said its merely a reflection of the rigors of jogging in the park at night jack walked quickly through administration and across the lobby as he stepped out into the earlyspring sunshine he felt relief it had been the first time hed been able to visit the general without stirring up a hornets nest of protest jack turned right and headed east on one of his prior visits hed noticed a chain drugstore two blocks from the hospital he went directly there kathys suggestion of rimantadine was a good one and he wanted to get some for himself especially given his intention of visiting gloria hernandez thinking of the hernandez woman made jack reach into his pocket to be sure hed not misplaced her address he hadnt unfolding the paper he looked at it she lived on west th street almost forty blocks north of jack arriving at the drugstore jack pulled open the door and entered it was a large store with a bewildering display of merchandise everything including cosmetics school supplies cleaning agents stationery greeting cards and even automotive products was crammed onto metal shelving the store had as many aisles as a supermarket it took jack a few minutes to find the pharmacy section which occupied a few square feet in the back corner of the store with as little respect as pharmacy was given jack felt there was a certain irony they even called the establishment a drugstore jack waited in line to speak to the pharmacist when he finally did he asked for a prescription blank which he quickly filled out for rimantadine the pharmacist was dressed in an oldfashioned white collarless pharmacist jacket with the top button undone he squinted at the prescription and then told jack it would take about twenty minutes twenty minutes jack questioned why so long i mean all you have to do is count out the tablets do you want this or dont you the pharmacist asked acidly i want it jack muttered the medical establishment had a way of bullying people doctors were no longer immune jack turned back to the main part of the store he had to entertain himself for twenty minutes with no goal in mind he wandered down aisle seven and found himself before a staggering variety of condoms bj liked the idea of the drugstore from the moment he saw jack enter he knew it would be close quarters and as an added attraction there was a subway entrance right out the door the subway was a great place to disappear after a quick glance up and down the street bj pulled open the door and stepped inside he eyed the glassenclosed managers office near the entrance but experience told him it wouldnt be a problem it might take a short burst from his machine pistol just to keep everybodys head down when he was on his way out but that would be about it bj advanced beyond the checkout registers and started glancing down the aisles looking for either jack or slam he knew if he found one hed quickly find the other he hit pay dirt in aisle seven jack was at the very end with slam loitering less than ten feet away as bj moved quickly down aisle six he reached under his sweatshirt and let his hand wrap around the butt of his tec pistol he snapped off the safety with his thumb when he arrived at the crossaisle in the middle of the store he slowed stepped laterally and stopped carefully he leaned around a display of bounty paper towels and glanced down the remainder of aisle seven bj felt his pulse quicken in anticipation jack was standing in the same spot and slam had moved over next to him it was perfect bjs heart skipped a beat when he felt a finger tap his shoulder he swung around his hand was still under his sweatshirt holding on to the holstered tec may i help you a baldheaded man asked anger seared through bj at having been interrupted at precisely the wrong moment he glared at the jowled clerk and felt like busting him in the chops but instead he decided to ignore him for the moment he couldnt pass up the opportunity with jack and slam standing nose to nose bj spun back around and as he did so he drew out the machine pistol he started forward he knew a single step would bring the aisle into full view the clerk was shocked by bjs sudden movement and he didnt see the gun if he had he never would have shouted hey the way he did jack felt on edge and jittery he disliked the store especially after his runin with the pharmacist the background elevator music and the smell of cheap cosmetics added to his discomfort he didnt want to be there as wired as he was when he heard the clerk yell his head shot up and he looked in the direction of the commotion he was just in time to see a stocky africanamerican leaping into the center of the aisle brandishing a machine pistol jacks reaction was pure reflex he threw himself into the condom display as his body made contact with the shelving an entire unit tipped over with a clatter jack found himself in the center of aisle eight on top of a mountain of disarranged merchandise and collapsed shelves while jack leaped forward slam hit the floor extracting his own machine pistol in the process it was a skillful maneuver suggesting the poise and expertise of a green beret bj was the first to fire since he held his pistol in only one hand the burst of shots went all over the store ripping divots in the vinyl flooring and poking holes in the tin ceiling but most of the shots screamed past the area where jack and slam had been standing seconds before and pounded into the vitamin section below the pharmacy counter slam let out a burst as well most of his bullets traveled the length of aisle seven shattering one of the huge plateglass windows facing the street bj had pulled himself back the moment hed seen the element of surprise had been lost now he stood crouched over behind the bounty paper towels trying to decide what to do next everyone else in the store was screaming including the clerk whod tapped bj on the shoulder they began rushing to the exits fleeing for their lives jack scrambled to his feet hed heard slams burst of gunfire and now he was hearing another burst from bj jack wanted out of the store keeping his head down he dashed back into the pharmacy area there was a door that said employees only and jack rushed through he found himself in a lunchroom a handful of open soft drinks and halfeaten packaged pastries on the table told him that people had just been there convinced that there was a way out through the back jack began opening doors the first was a bathroom the second a storeroom he heard more sustained gunfire and more screams out in the main part of the store panicked jack tried a third door to his relief it led out into an alley lined with trash cans in the distance he could see people running among those fleeing he recognized the pharmacists white coat jack took off after them tuesday pm march detective lieutenant lou soldano pulled his unmarked chevy caprice into the parking area at the loading bay of the medical examiners office he parked behind dr harold binghams official car and took the keys out of the ignition he gave them to the security man in case the car had to be moved lou was a frequent visitor to the morgue although he hadnt been there for over a month he got on the elevator and pushed five he was on his way to lauries office hed gotten her message earlier but hadnt been able to call until a few minutes ago as he was on his way across the queensboro bridge hed been over in queens supervising the investigation on a homicide of a prominent banker laurie had been telling him about one of the medical examiners when lou had interrupted to tell her he was in the neighborhood and could stop by shed immediately agreed telling him shed be waiting in her office lou got off the elevator and walked down the hall it brought back memories there had been a time when hed thought that he and laurie could have had a future together but it hadnt worked out too many differences in their backgrounds lou thought hey laur lou called out when he caught sight of her working at her desk every time he saw her she looked better to him her auburn hair fell over her shoulders in a way that reminded him of shampoo commercials laur was the nickname his son had given her the first time hed met her the name had stuck laurie got up and gave lou a big hug youre looking great she said lou shrugged selfconsciously im feeling okay he said and the children laurie asked children lou commented my daughter is sixteen now going on thirty shes boy crazy and its driving me crazy laurie lifted some journals off the spare chair she and her officemate shared she gestured for lou to sit down its good to see you laurie lou said its good to see you too she agreed we shouldnt let so much time go by without getting together so whats this big problem you wanted to talk to me about lou asked he wanted to steer the conversation away from potentially painful arenas i dont know how big it is laurie said she got up and closed her office door one of the new doctors on staff would like to talk to you off the record id mentioned that you and i were friends unfortunately hes not around at the moment i checked when you said you were coming over in fact no one knows where he is any idea what its about lou asked not specifically laurie said but im worried about him oh lou settled back he asked me to do two autopsies this morning one on a twentyeightyearold caucasian woman whod been a microbiology tech over at the general shed been shot in her apartment last night the second was on a twentyfiveyearold africanamerican whod been shot in central park before i did the cases he suggested that i try to see if the two were in any way related through hair fiber blood and lou asked i found some blood on his jacket which preliminarily matches the womans laurie said now thats just by serology the dna is pending but its not a common type b negative lou raised his eyebrows did this medical examiner give any explanation for his suspicion he asked he said it was a hunch laurie said but theres more i know for a fact that hed been beaten up recently by some new york gang membersat least once maybe twice when he showed up this morning he looked to me like it might have happened again although he denied it why was he beaten up lou asked supposedly as a warning for him not to go to the manhattan general hospital laurie said whoa lou said what are you talking about i dont know the details laurie said but i do know hes been irritating a lot of people over there and for that matter over here as well dr bingham has been ready to fire him on several occasions hows he been irritating everyone lou asked he has it in his mind that a series of infectious diseases that have appeared over at the general have been spread intentionally you mean like by a terrorist or something lou asked i suppose laurie said you know this is sounding familiar lou said laurie nodded i remember how i felt about that series of overdoses five years ago and the fact that no one believed me what do you think of your friends theory lou said by the way whats his name jack stapleton laurie said as to his theory i dont really have all the facts come on laurie lou said i know you better than that tell me your opinion i think hes seeing conspiracy because he wants to see conspiracy laurie said his officemate told me he has a longstanding grudge against the healthcare giant americare which owns the general but even so that doesnt explain the gang connection or the fact that he might have knowledge of the womans murder whatre the names of the homicide victims elizabeth holderness and reginald winthrope laurie said lou wrote down the names in the small black notebook he carried there wasnt much criminologist work done on either case laurie said you of all people know how limited our personnel is lou said did they have a preliminary motive for the woman robbery laurie said rape no how about the man lou asked he was a member of a gang laurie said he was shot in the head at relatively close range unfortunately thats all too common lou said we dont spend a lot of time investigating those did the autopsies show anything nothing unusual laurie said do you think your friend dr stapleton comprehends how dangerous these gangs can be lou asked i have a feeling that hes walking on the edge i dont know much about him laurie said but hes not a new yorker hes from the midwest uhoh lou said i think id better have a talk with him about the realities of city life and id better do it sooner rather than later he might not be around long dont say that laurie said is your interest in him more than professional lou asked now lets not get into that kind of discussion laurie said but the answer is no dont get steamed up lou said i just like to know the lay of the land he stood up anyway ill help the guy and it sounds like he needs help thank you lou laurie said she got up herself and gave the detective another hug ill have him call you do that lou said leaving lauries office lou took the elevator down to the first floor walking through the communications area he stopped in to see sergeant murphy who was permanently assigned to the medical examiners office after they talked for a while about the prospects of the yankees and the mets in the upcoming baseball season lou sat down and put his feet up on the corner of the sergeants desk tell me something murph lou said whats your honest take on this new doctor by the name of jack stapleton after having fled from the drugstore jack had run the length of the alley and then another four blocks before stopping when he had he was winded from the exertion in between breaths he heard the undulating wails of converging police sirens he assumed the police were on their way to the store he hoped that slam had fared as well as he jack walked until both his breathing and his pulse were back to a semblance of normal he was still shaking the experience in the store had unnerved him as much as the ordeal in the park even though the store episode had taken only seconds the knowledge that once again hed been stalked in an attempt to kill him was mind numbing additional sirens now competed with the normal clatter of the city and jack wondered if he should go back to the scene to talk to the police and perhaps help if anyone had been struck with a bullet but warrens admonitions about talking to the police about gang affairs came to mind after all warren had been right about jack needing his protection if it had not been for slam jack sensed he would have been killed jack shuddered there had been a time in the nottoodistant past when hed not cared particularly if he lived or died but now having come close to death twice he felt differently he wanted to live and that desire made him question why the black kings wanted him dead who was paying them did they think jack knew something that he didnt or was it just because of his suspicions concerning the outbreaks at the manhattan general jack had no answer to these questions but this second attempt on his life made him more confident that his suspicions were correct now he had only to prove them in the middle of these musings jack found himself in front of a second drugstore but in contrast to the first it was a small neighborhood concern entering jack approached the pharmacist who was manning the store by himself his name tag said simply herman do you carry rimantadine jack asked we did last time i looked herman said with a smile but its a prescription item im a doctor jack said ill need a script can i see some identification herman asked jack showed him his new york state medical license how much do you want enough for at least a couple of weeks jack said why dont you give me fifty tablets i might as well err on the plus side you got it herman said he started working behind a counter how long will it take jack asked how long does it take to count to fifty herman replied the last store i was in told me it would take twenty minutes jack said it was a chain store right herman said jack nodded those chain stores dont care a whit about service herman said its a crime and for all their poor service theyre still forcing us independents out of business its got me angrier than hell jack nodded he knew the feeling well these days no part of the medical landscape was sacrosanct herman came out from behind his counter carrying a small plastic vial of orange tablets he plunked it next to the cash register is this for you he asked jack nodded again herman rattled off a list of possible side effects as well as contraindications jack was impressed after jack paid for the drug he asked herman for a glass of water herman gave him some in a small paper cup jack took one of the tablets come again herman said as jack left the store with the rimantadine coursing through his system jack decided it was time to visit gloria hernandez from central supply stepping out into the street jack caught a cab at first the driver demurred about going up into harlem but he agreed after jack reminded him of the rules posted on the back of the front seat jack sat back as the taxi first headed north and then across town on st nicholas avenue after passing central park he looked out the window as harlem changed from predominantly africanamerican neighborhoods to hispanic ones eventually all the signs were in spanish when the cab pulled up to his destination jack paid the fare and stepped out into a street alive with people he looked up at the building he was about to enter at one time it had been a fine proud singlefamily home in the middle of an upscale neighborhood now it had seen better days much like jacks own tenement a few people eyed jack curiously as he mounted the brownstone steps and entered the foyer the blackandwhite mosaic on the floor was missing tiles the names on a broken line of mailboxes indicated that the hernandez family lived on the third floor jack pushed the doorbell for that apartment even though his sense was that it didnt work next he tried the inner door just as in his own building the lock on the door had been broken long ago and never repaired having climbed the stairs to the third floor jack knocked on the hernandezes door when no one answered he knocked again only louder finally he heard a childs voice ask who was there jack called out he was a doctor and wanted to speak with gloria hernandez after a short muffled discussion that jack could hear through the door the door was pulled open to the limit of a chain lock jack saw two faces above was a middleaged woman with disheveled bleachedblond hair her eyes were red and sunken with dark shadows she was wearing a quilted bathrobe and was coughing intermittently her lips had a slight purplish cast below was a cherubic child of nine or ten jack wasnt sure if it was a boy or a girl the childs hair was shoulder length coal black and combed straight back from the forehead mrs hernandez jack questioned the blondhaired woman after jack showed his medical examiners badge and explained hed just come from kathy mcbanes office at the manhattan general mrs hernandez opened the door and invited him inside the apartment was stuffy and small although an attempt had been made to decorate it with bright colors and movie posters in spanish gloria immediately retreated to the couch where shed apparently been resting when jack knocked she drew a blanket up around her neck and shivered im sorry you are so sick jack said its terrible gloria said jack was relieved that she spoke english his spanish was rusty at best i dont mean to disturb you jack said but as you know lately people from your department have become ill with serious diseases glorias eyes opened wide i just have the flu dont i she asked with alarm im sure thats correct jack said katherine mueller maria lopez carmen chavez and imogene philbertson had completely different illnesses than you have that is certain thank the lord gloria said she made the sign of the cross with the index finger of her right hand may their souls rest in peace what concerns me jack continued is that there was a patient by the name of kevin carpenter on the orthopedic floor last night who possibly had an illness similar to your own does that name mean anything to you did you have any contact with him no gloria said i work in central supply im aware of that jack said and so did those other unfortunate women i just mentioned but in each case there had been a patient with the same illness the women caught there has to be a connection and im hoping you can help me figure out what it is gloria looked confused she turned to her child whom she addressed as juan juan began speaking in rapid spanish jack gathered he was translating for him gloria had not quite understood what hed said gloria nodded and said si many times while juan spoke but as soon as juan finished gloria looked up at jack shook her head and said no no jack asked after so many yeses he didnt expect such a definitive no no connection gloria said we dont see patients you never go to patient floors jack asked no gloria said jacks mind raced he tried to think what else to ask finally he said did you do anything out of the ordinary last night gloria shrugged and again said no can you remember what you did do jack asked try to give me an idea of your shift gloria started to speak but the effort brought on a serious bout of coughing at one point jack was about to pound her on her back but she raised her hand to indicate she was all right juan got her a glass of water which she drank thirstily once she could speak she tried to recall everything shed done the evening before as she described her duties jack struggled to think if any of her activities put her in contact with carpenters virus but he couldnt gloria insisted she had not left central supply for the entire shift when jack could not think of any more questions he asked if he could call if something else came to mind she agreed jack then insisted she call dr zimmerman at the general to let her know how sick she was what could she do gloria asked she might want to put you on a particular medication jack said as well as the rest of your family he knew that rimantadine not only could prevent flu but if it was started early enough in an established case it might reduce the duration and possibly the severity of symptoms by as much as fifty percent the problem was it wasnt cheap and jack knew that americare was loath to spend money on patient care it didnt feel it had to jack left the hernandez apartment and headed toward broadway where he thought he could catch a cab now on top of being agitated from the attempt on his life he was also discouraged the visit to gloria had accomplished nothing other than to expose him to glorias influenza which he feared might be the strain that so readily killed kevin carpenter jacks only consolation was that hed started his own course of rimantadine the problem was he knew rimantadine wasnt one hundred percent effective in preventing infection particularly with a virulent strain it was late afternoon by the time jack was dropped off at the medical examiners office feeling stressed and despondent he entered and allowed himself to be buzzed in as he passed the id area he did a double take in one of the small rooms set aside for families identifying their dead jack saw david he didnt know davids last name but it was the same david who had driven jack and spit back to the neighborhood after the episode in the park david also caught sight of jack and for the second their eyes made contact jack sensed anger and contempt resisting the impulse to approach jack immediately descended to the morgue level with his heels echoing loudly on the cement floor he walked around the refrigerated compartments fearful of what he was going to find there in the hall was a single gurney bearing a newly dead body it was directly beneath the harsh glare of a hooded overhead light the sheets had been arranged so that only the face could be seen it had been so posed for a polaroid picture to be taken such a picture was the current method for families to identify their dead photographs were considered more humane than having the bereaved families view the often mutilated remains a lump formed in jacks throat as he looked down on slams placid face his eyes were closed he truly appeared to be asleep in death he looked even younger than he had in life jack would have guessed around fourteen depressed beyond words jack took the elevator up to his office he was thankful that chet was not in he slammed his door sat down at his desk and held his head in his hands he felt like crying but no tears came he knew indirectly he was responsible for yet another individuals death before hed had a chance to wallow in guilt there was a knock on his door at first jack ignored it hoping whoever it was would go away but then the wouldbe visitor knocked again finally he called out irritably for whoever it was to come in laurie opened the door hesitantly i dont mean to be a bother she said she could sense jacks agitation immediately his eyes were fierce like the needle ends of darts what do you want jack asked just to let you know that i spoke with detective lou soldano laurie said as you asked me to do she took several steps into the room and placed lous phone number on the edge of jacks desk hes expecting your call thanks laurie jack said but i dont think at the moment i am in the mood to talk to anyone i think he could help laurie said in fact laurie jack called out sharply to interrupt her then in a softer tone he said please just leave me alone sure laurie said soothingly she backed out and closed the door behind her for a second she stared at the door her concerns skyrocketed shed never seen jack this way it was a far cry from his normally flippant demeanor and reckless seemingly carefree ways hurrying back to her own office laurie closed her door and called lou immediately dr stapleton just came in a few minutes ago she said fine lou said have him give me a call ill be here for at least another hour im afraid hes not going to call laurie said hes acting worse now than he was this morning something has happened im sure of it why wont he call lou said i dont know laurie said he wont even talk to me and as we speak there is another apparent gang murder down in the morgue the shooting took place in the vicinity of the manhattan general you think it involved him in some way lou asked i dont know what to think laurie admitted im just worried im afraid something terrible is about to happen all right calm down lou advised leave it up to me ill think of something promise laurie asked have i ever let you down lou questioned jack rubbed his eyes forcibly then blinked them open he glanced around at the profusion of unfinished autopsy cases that littered his desk he knew there was no chance hed be able to concentrate enough to work on them then his eyes focused on two unfamiliar envelopes one was a large manila envelope the other was business size jack opened the manila one first it contained the copy of a hospital chart there was also a note from bart arnold saying that hed taken it upon himself to get a copy of kevin carpenters chart to add to the others jack had requested jack was pleased and impressed such initiative was commendable and spoke well for the entire pa investigative team jack opened the chart and glanced through it kevin had been admitted for an acl repair of the right knee which had gone smoothly monday morning jack stopped reading and thought about the fact that kevin had been immediately postoperative when hed come down with his symptoms putting kevins chart aside he picked up susanne hards and confirmed that she too had been immediately postop having had a cesarean section looking at pacinis he confirmed the same jack wondered if having had surgery had anything to do with their having contracted their respective illnesses it didnt seem probable since neither nodelman nor lagenthorpe had undergone surgery even so jack thought hed keep the operative connection in mind going back to kevins chart jack learned that the flu symptoms started abruptly at six pm and progressed steadily and relentlessly until a little after nine at that time they were considered worrisome enough to warrant transferring the patient to the intensivecare unit in the unit he developed the respiratory distress syndrome that ultimately led to his death jack closed the chart and put it on the stack with the others opening the smaller envelopeaddressed simply to dr stapletonjack found a computer printout and a postit note from kathy mcbane the note simply thanked him again for his attention to the affairs of the general in a short postscript kathy added that she hoped the enclosed printout would help him jack opened the printout it was a copy of everything that had been sent from central supply to a patient by the name of broderick humphrey the mans diagnosis wasnt mentioned but his age was fortyeight the list was just as long as the lists he had for the infectious disease index cases like the other lists it appeared to be random it was not in alphabetical order nor were similar products or equipment lumped together jack guessed the list was generated in the sequence the items were ordered that idea was bolstered by the fact that all five lists started out identically presumably because as each patient was admitted he required standard routine equipment the random nature of the lists made them hard to compare jacks interest was finding any ways that the control list differed from the others after spending fifteen wasted minutes going back and forth among the lists jack decided to use the computer the first thing he did was create separate files for each patient into each file he copied each list since he was hardly the worlds best typist this activity took him a considerable amount of time several hours drifted by in the middle of the transcription process laurie again knocked on his door to say good night and to see if she could do anything for him jack was preoccupied but he assured her that he was fine when all the data were entered jack asked the computer to list the ways the infectious cases differed from the control case what he got was disheartening another long list looking at it he realized the problem in contrast to the control case all five infectious cases had had sojourns in the intensivecare unit in addition all five infectious cases had died and the control hadnt for a few minutes jack thought that his painstaking efforts had been for naught but then he got another idea since hed typed the lists into the computer in the same order theyd been originally he asked the computer to make the comparison prior to the first product used in the icu as soon as jack pushed his execute button the computer flashed its answer the word humidifier appeared on the screen jack stared apparently the infectious cases had all used humidifiers from central supply the control hadnt but was it a significant difference from jacks childhood he remembered his mother had put a humidifier in his room when hed had the croup he remembered the device as a small boiling cauldron that sputtered and steamed at his bedside so jack could not imagine a humidifier having anything to do with spreading bacteria at fahrenheit it would boil bacteria but then jack remembered the newer type of humidifier the ultrasonic cold humidifier that he realized could be a totally different story jack snatched up his phone and called the general he asked to be put through to central supply mrs zarelli was off so he asked to speak to the evening supervisor her name was darlene springborn jack explained who he was and then asked if central supply at the general handled the humidifiers certainly do darlene said especially during the winter months what kind does the hospital use jack asked the steam type or the cold type the cold type almost exclusively darlene said when a humidifier comes back from a patient room what happens to it jack asked we take care of it darlene said do you clean it jack asked certainly darlene said plus we run them for a while to be sure they still function normally then we empty them and scrub them out why are they always cleaned in the same location jack asked they are darlene said we keep them in a small storeroom that has its own sink has there been a problem with the humidifiers im not sure jack said but if so ill let you or mrs zarelli know id appreciate it darlene said jack disconnected but kept the phone in the crook of his shoulder while he got out gloria hernandezs phone number he punched in the digits and waited a man answered who could speak only spanish after jack struggled with a few broken phrases the man told jack to wait a younger voice came on the line jack assumed it was juan he asked the boy if he could speak to his mother shes very sick juan said shes coughing a lot and having trouble breathing did she call the hospital like i urged jack asked no she didnt juan said she said she didnt want to bother anybody im going to call an ambulance to come and get her jack said without hesitation you tell her to hold on okay okay juan said meanwhile could you ask her one question jack said could you ask her if she cleaned any humidifiers last night you know what humidifiers are dont you yeah i know juan said just a minute jack waited nervously tapping his fingers on top of kevin carpenters chart to add to his guilt he thought he should have followed up on his suggestion for gloria to call zimmerman juan came back on the line she says thank you about the ambulance juan said she was afraid to call herself because americare doesnt pay unless a doctor says okay what about the humidifiers jack asked yeah she said she cleaned two or three she couldnt remember exactly after jack hung up from talking to the hernandez boy he called and dispatched an ambulance to the hernandez residence he told the dispatcher to inform the emts that it was an infectious case and that they should at least wear masks he also told her that the patient should go to the manhattan general and no place else with growing excitement jack placed a call to kathy mcbane as late as it was he didnt expect to get her but he was pleasantly surprised she was still in her office when jack commented on the fact that she was still there after six she said shed probably be there for some time whats going on jack asked plenty kathy said kim spensor has been admitted into the intensive care unit with respiratory distress syndrome george haselton is also in the hospital and is worsening im afraid your fears were well grounded jack quickly added that gloria hernandez would be coming to the emergency room soon he also recommended that the contacts of all these patients be immediately started on rimantadine i dont know if dr zimmerman will go for the rimantadine for contacts kathy said but at least ive talked her into isolating these patients weve set up a special ward that might help jack said its certainly worth a try what about the microbiology tech hes on his way in at the moment kathy said i hope by ambulance rather than public transportation jack said that was my recommendation kathy said but dr zimmerman followed up on it i honestly dont know what the final decision was that printout you sent over was helpful jack said finally getting around to why hed called remember when you told me about the generals nebulizers getting contaminated in the intensivecare unit three months ago i think there might have been a similar problem with the hospitals humidifiers jack told kathy how hed come to this conclusion particularly about gloria hernandez having admitted to handling humidifiers the previous evening what should i do kathy said with alarm at the moment i dont want you to do anything jack said but i should at least take the humidifiers out of service until their safety is assured kathy said the problem is i dont want you to become involved jack said im afraid doing something like that might be dangerous what are you talking about kathy demanded angrily i am already involved dont get upset jack said soothingly i apologize im afraid im handling this badly jack had not wanted to draw anyone else into the web of his suspicions for fear of their safety yet at the moment he didnt seem to have any choice kathy was right the humidifiers had to be taken out of service listen kathy jack said then as succinctly as possible he explained his theory about the recent illnesses being intentionally spread he also told her there was a possibility beth holderness had been killed because hed asked her to search the microbiology lab for the offending agents thats a rather extraordinary story kathy said haltingly then she added its a little hard to swallow all at once im not asking you necessarily to subscribe to it jack said my only interest in telling you now is for your safety whatever you do or say to anyone please keep what i have told you in mind and for gods sake dont mention my theory to anyone even if im right i have no idea whos behind it well kathy said with a sigh i dont know what to say you dont have to say anything jack said but if you want to help there is something you could do like what kathy asked warily get some bacterial culture medium and viral transport medium from the microbiology lab jack said but dont tell anyone why you want them then get someone from engineering to open the elbow drain below the sink in the storeroom where the humidifiers are kept put aliquots from the trap into the two mediums and take them to the city reference lab ask them to see if they can isolate any one of the five agents you think some of the microorganisms would still be there kathy asked its a possibility jack said its a long shot but im trying to find proof whatever way i can at any rate what im suggesting you do is not going to hurt anyone except possibly yourself if you are not careful ill think about it kathy said id do it myself except for the reception i invariably get over there jack said i was able to get away with visiting your office but trying to get bacterial samples out of a trap in central supply is another thing entirely id have to agree with you there kathy said after he hung up jack wondered about kathys reaction to his revelations from the moment hed voiced his suspicions shed sounded subdued almost wary jack shrugged at the moment there wasnt anything else he could say to convince her all he could do was hope shed heed his warnings jack had one more call to make and as he dialed the longdistance number he superstitiously crossed the middle and index fingers of his left hand he was calling nicole marquette at the cdc and jack was hoping for two things first he wanted to hear that the sample had arrived second he wanted nicole to say that the titer was high meaning there were enough viral particles to test without having to wait to grow it out as the call went through jack glanced at his watch it was nearing seven pm he scolded himself for not having called earlier thinking hed have to wait until morning to reach nicole but after dialing the extension for the influenza unit he got nicole immediately it arrived here fine nicole said in response to his query and i have to give you credit for packing it so well the refrigerant pack and the styrofoam kept the sample well preserved what about the titer jack asked i was impressed with that too nicole said where was this sample from bronchiole washings jack said nicole gave a short whistle with this concentration of virus its got to be one hell of a virulent strain either that or a compromised host its a virulent strain all right jack said the victim was a young healthy male besides that one of the nurses taking care of him is already in the icu herself in acute respiratory distress thats in less than twentyfour hours after exposure wow id better do this typing immediately in fact ill stay here tonight are there any more cases besides the nurse three others that i know about jack said ill call in the morning nicole said then she hung up jack was mildly taken aback by the precipitous end to the conversation but he was pleased that nicole was as motivated as shed apparently become jack replaced the phone receiver and as he did so he noticed the tremble of his hand he took a few deep breaths and tried to decide what to do he was concerned about going home he had no way of gauging warrens reaction to slams death he also wondered if yet another assassin would be sent after him the unexpected ring of the telephone interrupted his thoughts he reached for the phone but didnt pick it up while he tried to think who it could be as late as it was he had to shake off some irrational thoughts like the worry it might be the man whod tried to kill him that afternoon finally jack picked up the phone to his relief it was terese you promised you would call she said accusingly i hope youre not going to tell me you forgot ive been on the phone jack said in fact i just this second got off well all right terese said but ive been ready to eat for an hour why dont you come to the restaurant directly from work oh jeez terese jack voiced with everything that had happened hed totally forgotten about their dinner plans dont tell me you are going to try to cop out terese said ive had a wicked day jack said so have i terese countered you promised and as i said this morning you have to eat tell me did you have lunch no jack said well there you go terese said you cant skip dinner as well as lunch come on ill understand if you have to go back to work i might myself terese was making a lot of sense he needed to eat something even if he wasnt hungry and he needed to relax besides knowing tereses persistence he didnt expect shed take no for an answer and jack did not have the energy for an argument are you thinking or what terese asked impatiently jack please ive been looking forward to seeing you all day we can compare war stories and have a vote whose day was the worst jack was weakening suddenly having dinner with terese sounded wonderfully appealing he was concerned about putting her at risk simply through proximity but he doubted anyone was trailing him now if they were he could certainly shake them on the way to the restaurant whats the name of the restaurant jack asked finally thank you terese said i knew youd come through its called positano its just up the street from me on madison youll love it its small and very relaxing very unnewyorkish ill meet you there in a half hour jack said perfect terese said im really looking forward to this its been a stressful few days i can attest to that jack said jack locked up his office and went down to the first floor he did not know how to ensure that no one followed him but he thought that he should at least glance out the front to see if anyone suspicious was lurking there as he passed through communications he noticed that sergeant murphy was still in his cubbyhole talking with someone jack didnt recognize jack and the sergeant exchanged waves jack wondered if there had been an unusual number of unidentified dead over the last several days murphy usually left at five like clockwork reaching the front door jack scanned the area outside he immediately recognized the futility of what he was doing particularly with the homeless facility next door in the old bellevue hospital building there were any number of people loitering who could have qualified as suspicious for a few moments jack watched the activity on first avenue rush hour was still in full swing with bumpertobumper traffic heading north the buses were all filled to overflowing all the cabs were occupied jack debated what to do the idea of standing in the street trying to catch a taxi had no appeal whatsoever hed be too exposed someone might even attack him right there especially if they had been willing to try to shoot him in a drugstore a passing delivery van gave jack an idea turning back into the building he descended to the morgue floor and walked into the mortuary office marvin fletcher one of the evening mortuary techs was having coffee and doughnuts marvin i have a favor to ask jack said whats that marvin asked washing down a mouthful with a gulp of his coffee i dont want you to tell anyone about this jack said its personal yeah marvin questioned his eyes opened wider than usual he was interested i need a ride up to new york hospital jack said could you take me in one of the mortuary vans im not supposed to drive marvin began theres a good reason jack said interrupting marvin im trying to duck a girlfriend and im afraid shes outside im sure a goodlooking guy like you has had similar problems marvin laughed i suppose he said it will only take a second jack said we shoot up first and cut over to york youll be back here in a flash and heres a tenspot for your trouble jack laid a tendollar bill on the desk marvin eyed the bill and looked up at jack when do you want to go right now jack said jack climbed into the passengerside door of the van and then stepped back into the vans cargo area he held on to whatever handhold he could find while marvin backed out onto thirtieth street as they waited for the light at the corner of first avenue jack made sure he stayed well out of sight despite the traffic they made good time to new york hospital marvin dropped jack off at the busy front entrance and jack immediately went inside within the lobby he stood off to the side for five minutes when no one even vaguely suspicious entered jack headed for the emergency room having been in the hospital on multiple occasions jack had no trouble finding his way once in the emergency room he stepped out on the receiving dock and waited for a cab to bring in a patient he didnt have to wait long as soon as the patient got out of the cab jack got in he told the cabdriver to take him to the third avenue entrance of bloomingdales bloomingdales was as crowded as jack assumed it would be jack rapidly traversed the stores main floor emerging on lexington where he caught a second cab he had this taxi drop him off a block away from positano to be a hundred percent certain he was safe jack stood within the entrance of a shoe store for another five minutes the vehicular traffic on madison avenue was moderate as was the number of pedestrians in contrast to the area around the morgue everyone was dressed nattily jack saw no one he would have thought was a gang member feeling confident and patting himself on the back for his ingenuity jack set out for the restaurant what he didnt know was that two men sat waiting inside a shiny black cadillac that had recently parked between the shoe store and positano as jack walked past he couldnt see inside because the windows were tinted dark enough to make them appear like mirrors jack opened the door to the restaurant and entered a canvas tent of sorts designed to keep the winter chill away from the people seated near the entrance pulling a canvas flap aside jack found himself in a warm comfortable environment to his left was a small mahogany bar the dining tables were grouped to the right and they extended back into the depths of the restaurant the walls and ceiling were covered with white lattice into which was woven silk ivy that looked astonishingly real it was as if jack had suddenly walked into a garden restaurant in italy from the savory aroma that informed the place jack could tell that the chef had the same respect for garlic that he had earlier jack had felt he wasnt hungry now he was famished the restaurant was crowded but without the frenzied atmosphere of many new york restaurants with the lattice on the ceiling the sounds of the patrons conversations and the clink of the china were muted jack assumed that the peacefulness of the place was what terese had meant when she said it was unnewyorkish the maître d greeted jack and asked if he could be of assistance jack said he was to meet a ms hagen the waiter bowed and gestured for jack to follow him he showed jack to a table against the wall just beyond the bar terese rose to give jack a hug when she saw his face she paused oh my she said your face looks painful people have been saying that my whole life jack quipped jack please terese said dont joke im being serious are you really okay to tell you the honest truth jack said id totally forgotten about my face it looks like it would be so tender terese said id like to give you a kiss but im afraid nothing wrong with my lips jack said terese shook her head smiled and waved her hand at him you are too much she said i considered myself adept at repartee until i met you they sat down what do you think of the restaurant terese asked as she repositioned her napkin and moved her work aside i liked it immediately jack said its cozy and you cant say that about too many restaurants in this city i never would have known it was here the sign outside is so subtle its one of my favorite places terese said thanks for insisting i come out jack said i hate to admit you were right but you were im starved over the next fifteen minutes they studied their respective menus listened to a remarkably long list of special entrées from their waiter and placed their orders how about some wine terese asked why not jack said do you want to pick terese asked extending the wine list in his direction i have a suspicion that youll know better than i what to order jack said red or white terese asked i can go either way jack said with the wine opened and two glasses poured both terese and jack leaned back and tried to relax both were tense in fact jack wondered if terese wasnt more tense than he he caught her furtively glancing at her watch i saw that jack said saw what terese asked innocently i saw you looking at your watch jack said i thought we were supposed to be relaxing thats why ive been purposefully avoiding asking about your day or telling you about mine im sorry terese said youre right i shouldnt be doing it its just reflex i know colleen and the crew are still in the studio working and i suppose i feel guilty being out here enjoying myself should i ask how the campaign is going jack asked its going fine terese said in fact i got nervous today and called my contact over at national health and had lunch with her when i told her about the new campaign she was so excited she begged me to allow her to leak it to her ceo she called back this afternoon to say that he liked it so much that hes thinking of upping the advertising budget by another twenty percent jack made a mental calculation of what a twenty percent increase meant it was millions and it made him ill since he knew the money would essentially be coming from patientcare funds but not wishing to spoil their evening he did not let terese know his thoughts instead he congratulated her thank you she said it hardly sounds like you had a bad day jack commented well hearing that the client likes the concept is just the beginning terese said now there is the reality of actually putting the presentation together and then actually doing the campaign itself you have no idea of the problems that arise making a thirtysecond tv spot terese took a sip of her wine as she set her glass back on the table she again glanced at her watch terese jack said with mock anger you did it again youre right terese said slapping a hand to her forehead what am i going to do with myself im an impossible workaholic i admit it but wait i do know what i can do i can take the damn thing off she unbuckled her wristwatch and slipped it into her purse hows that she asked much better jack said the trouble is this dude is probably thinking hes some kind of superman or something twin said hes probably saying those brothers dont know what the hell they are doing i mean its all pissing me off you know what im saying so why dont you do this yourself phil asked why me dots of perspiration stood out like cabochon diamonds along his hairline twin was draped over the steering wheel of his cadillac slowly he turned his head to regard his heir apparent in the halflight of the cars interior headlights of the passing vehicles alternately illuminated phils face be cool twin warned you know i cant walk in there the doc would recognize me right off and the game would be over the element of surprise is important but i was there in the docs apartment too phil complained but the mother wasnt looking you in the eye twin said nor did you tag him with a sucker punch he wont remember you trust me but why me phil whined bj wanted to do it especially after things got screwed up in the drugstore he wants another chance after the drugstore the doc might recognize bj twin said besides its an opportunity for you some of the brothers have been complaining that youve never done anything like this and that you shouldnt be next in line in the gang trust me i know what im doing but im not good at this stuff phil complained ive never shot anyone hey its easy twin said first time maybe you wonder but its easy pop its over in a way its kinda a letdown because you get yourself all keyed up im keyed up all right phil admitted relax kid twin said all you have to do is walk in there and not say a word to anyone keep the gun in your pocket and dont take it out until you are standing right in front of the doc then draw it out and pop then get your black ass outta there and away we go its that easy what if the doc runs phil asked he wont run twin said hell be so surprised he wont lift a finger if a dude thinks he might be knocked off he has a chance but if it comes out of the blue like a sucker punch theres no way nobody moves ive seen it done ten times im nervous though phil admitted okay so youre a little nervous twin said let me look at you twin reached over and pushed phils shoulder back hows your tie phil reached up and felt the knot in his tie i think its okay he said you look great twin said looks like youre on your way to church man you look like a damn banker or lawyer twin laughed and slapped phil repeatedly on the back phil winced as he absorbed the blows he hated this it was the worst thing hed ever done and he wondered if it was worth it yet at this point he knew he didnt have much choice it was like going on the roller coaster and clanking up that first hill okay man its time to blow the mother away twin said he gave phil a final pat then reached in front of him to open the passengerside door phil got out onto rubbery legs phil twin called phil bent down and looked into the car remember twin said thirty seconds from the time you go in the door ill be pulling up to the restaurant you get out of there fast and into the car got it i guess so phil said phil straightened up and began walking toward the restaurant he could feel the pistol bumping up against his thigh he had it in his right hip pocket when jack had first met terese hed had the impression that she was so goal oriented shed be incapable of small talk but he had to admit hed been wrong when hed started to tease her unmercifully about her inability to leave her work behind shed not only borne the brunt of the gibes with equanimity but had been able to dish out as good as he gave by their second glasses of wine they had each other laughing heartily i certainly didnt think id be laughing like this earlier today jack said ill take that as a compliment terese said and indeed you should jack said excuse me terese said as she folded her napkin i imagine our entrées will be out momentarily if you dont mind id like to use the ladies room before they get here by all means jack said he grasped the edge of the table and pulled it toward him to give terese more room to get out there was not much space between tables ill be right back terese said she gave jacks shoulder a squeeze dont go away she teased jack watched her approach the maître d who listened to her and then pointed toward the rear of the restaurant jack continued to watch her as she gracefully weaved her way down the length of the room as usual she was wearing a simple tailored suit that limned her slim athletic body it wasnt hard for jack to imagine that she approached physical exercise with the same dogged determination she devoted to her career when terese disappeared from view jack turned his attention back to the table he picked up his wine and took a sip someplace hed read that red wine was capable of killing viruses that thought made him think of something he hadnt considered but perhaps should have hed been exposed to influenza and while he felt confident given the measures he was taking regarding his health he certainly didnt want to expose anyone else to it particularly not terese thinking about the possibility jack reasoned that since he didnt have any symptoms he could not be manufacturing virus therefore he could not be infective at least he hoped that to be the case thinking of influenza reminded him of his rimantadine reaching into his pocket he took out the plastic vial extracted one of the orange tablets and took it with a swallow of water after putting the drug away jack let his eyes roam around the restaurant he was impressed that every table was occupied yet the waiters seemed to maintain a leisurely pace jack attributed it to good planning and training looking to the right jack saw that there were a few couples and single men having drinks at the bar possibly waiting for tables just then he noticed that the canvas curtain at the entrance was thrown aside as a smartly dressed young africanamerican man stepped into the restaurant jack wasnt sure why the individual caught his attention at first he thought it might have been because the man was tall and thin he reminded jack of several of the men he played ball with but whatever the reason was jack continued to watch the man as he hesitated at the door then began to walk down the central aisle apparently searching for friends the gait wasnt the highstepping springy jaunty playground walk it was more of a shuffle as if the man were carrying a load on his back his right hand was thrust into his trouser pocket while his left hung down stiffly at his side jack couldnt help but notice the left arm didnt swing it was as if it were a prosthesis instead of a real arm captivated by the individual jack watched as the mans head swung from side to side the man had advanced twenty feet when the maître d intercepted him and they had a conversation the conversation was short the maître d bowed and gestured into the restaurant the man started forward once again continuing his search jack lifted his wineglass to his lips and took a sip as he did so the mans eyes locked onto his to jacks surprise the man headed directly for him jack slowly put his wineglass down the man came up to the table as if in a dream jack saw the man start to raise his right hand in it was a gun before jack could even take a breath the barrel was aimed straight at him within the confines of the narrow restaurant the sound of a pistol seemed deafening by reflex jacks hands had grasped the tablecloth and pulled it toward him as if he could hide behind it in the process he knocked the wineglasses and the wine bottle to the floor where they shattered the concussion of the gunshot and the shattering of glass was followed by stunned silence a moment later the body fell forward onto the table the gun clattered to the floor police a voice called out a man rushed to the center of the room holding a police badge aloft in his other hand he held a detective special no one move do not panic with a sense of disgust jack pushed the table away it was pinning him against the wall when he did so the man rolled off the side and fell heavily to the floor the policeman holstered his gun and pocketed his badge before quickly kneeling at the side of the body he felt for a pulse then barked an order for someone to call for an ambulance only then did the restaurant erupt with screams and sobs terrified diners began to stand up a few in the front of the restaurant fled out the door stay in your seats the policeman commanded to those remaining everything is under control some people followed his orders and sat others stood immobilized their eyes wide having regained a semblance of composure jack squatted beside the policeman im a doctor jack said yeah i know the policeman said give a check im afraid hes a goner jack felt for a pulse while wondering how the policeman knew he was a doctor there was no pulse i didnt have a lot of choice the policeman said defensively it happened so fast and with so many people around i shot him in the left side of his chest i must have hit the heart jack and the policeman stood up the policeman looked jack up and down are you all right he asked in shocked disbelief jack examined himself he could have been shot without having felt it i guess so he said the policeman shook his head that was a close one he said i never expected anything to happen to you in here what do you mean jack asked if there was to be trouble i expected it to be after you left the restaurant the policeman said i dont know what you are talking about jack said but im awfully glad you happened to be here dont thank me the policeman said thank lou soldano terese came out of the rest room confused as to what was going on she hurried back to the table when she saw the body her hands flew to her face to cover her mouth aghast she looked at jack what happened she asked youre as white as a ghost at least im alive jack said thanks to this policeman in confusion terese turned to the policeman for an explanation but the sound of multiple sirens could be heard converging on the restaurant and the policeman began moving people out of the way and urging them to sit down tuesday pm march jack looked out the window of the speeding car and watched the nighttime scenery flash by with unseeing eyes jack was in the front passenger seat of shawn magoginals unmarked car as it cruised south on the fdr drive shawn was the plainclothes policeman who had mysteriously materialized at the crucial moment to save jack from sure death over an hour had passed since the event but jack was no more relaxed in fact now that hed had time to think about this third attempt on his life he was more agitated than right after the event he was literally shaking in an attempt to hide this belated reaction from shawn he clutched both hands to his knees earlier when the police cars and the ambulance had arrived at the restaurant chaos had reigned the police wanted everyones names and addresses some people balked others complied willingly at first jack had assumed hed be treated similarly but then shawn had informed him that detective lieutenant lou soldano wanted to talk with him at police headquarters jack had not wanted to go but hed been given no choice terese had insisted on coming along but jack had talked her out of it shed only relented once hed promised to call her later shed told him that shed be at the agency after such an experience she didnt want to be alone jack ran his tongue around the inside of his mouth a combination of the wine and tension had made it as dry as the inside of a sock he didnt want to go to police headquarters for fear they might detain him hed failed to report reginalds murder and hed been at the scene of the drugstore homicide to top it off hed said enough to laurie to indicate a potential link between reginald and beths murder jack sighed and ran a worried hand through his hair he wondered how hed respond to the inevitable questions hed be asked you okay shawn questioned he glanced at jack sensing his anxiety yeah fine jack said its been a wonderful evening in new york its a city where you can never get bored thats a positive way to look at it shawn agreed jack shot a look at the policeman who seemed to have taken his comment literally i have a couple of questions jack said how the hell did you happen to be there at the restaurant and how did you know i was a doctor and how is it that i have lou soldano to thank lieutenant soldano got a tip you might be in danger shawn said howd you know i was at the restaurant jack asked simple shawn said sergeant murphy and i tailed you from the morgue jack again looked out at the dark city as it sped by and shook his head imperceptibly he was embarrassed for having thought hed been so clever to ensure hed not been followed it was painfully obvious that he was out of his league you almost gave us the slip at bloomies shawn said but i guessed what you were up to by then jack turned back to the detective who gave lieutenant soldano the tip he asked he assumed it had to have been laurie that i dont know shawn said but youll soon be able to ask him yourself the fdr drive imperceptibly became the south street viaduct ahead jack could see the familiar silhouette of the brooklyn bridge come into view against the pale night sky it looked like a gigantic lyre they turned off the freeway just north of the bridge and were soon pulling into police headquarters jack had never seen the building and was surprised by its modernity inside he had to pass through a metal detector shawn accompanied him to lou soldanos office then took his leave lou stood up and offered his hand then pulled over a straightbacked chair sit down doc lou said this is sergeant wilson lou gestured toward a uniformed africanamerican police officer who got to his feet as he was introduced he was a striking man and his uniform was impeccably pressed his wellgroomed appearance stood in sharp contrast to lous rumpled attire jack shook hands with the sergeant and was impressed with the mans grip in contrast jack was ashamed of his own trembling damp palm i asked sergeant wilson down because hes heading up our antigang violence unit in special ops lou said as he returned to his desk and sat down oh wonderful jack thought concerned that this meeting might get back to warren jack tried to smile but it was hesitant and fake he was afraid his nervousness was all too transparent jack worried that both these experienced lawenforcement people could tell he was a felon the moment he walked through the door i understand you had a bad experience tonight lou said thats an understatement jack said he regarded lou the man was not what hed expected after laurie had said that shed been involved with him jack had assumed hed be more physically imposing taller and more stylish instead jack thought he was a shorter version of himself considering his stocky muscular frame and closecropped hair can i ask you a question jack asked by all means lou said spreading his hands this isnt an inquisition its a discussion what made you have officer magoginal follow me jack asked mind you im not complaining he saved my life you have dr laurie montgomery to thank for that lou said she was worried about you and made me promise that i would do something putting a tail on you was the only thing i could think of im certainly appreciative jack said he wondered what he could say to laurie to thank her now doc theres a lot going on here that wed like to know about lou said he steepled his hands with his elbows on his desk maybe you should just tell us whats happening i truly dont know yet jack said okay fair enough lou said but doc remember you can relax again this is a discussion as shaken up as i am im not sure im capable of much of a conversation maybe i should let you know what i know already lou said lou quickly outlined what laurie had told him he emphasized that he knew that jack had been beaten up at least once and now had had an attempt on his life made by a member of a lower east side gang lou mentioned jacks dislike of americare and his tendency to see conspiracy in the recent series of outbreaks of infectious disease at the manhattan general he also mentioned that jack had apparently irritated a number of people at that hospital he concluded with jacks suggestion to laurie that two apparently unrelated homicides might be linked and that preliminary tests had substantiated this surprising theory jack visibly swallowed wow he said im beginning to think you know more than i do im sure thats not the case lou said with a wry smile but maybe all this information gives you a sense of what else we need to know to prevent any more violence to you and others there was another gangrelated killing in the vicinity of the general this afternoon is that anything you know about jack swallowed again he didnt know what to say warrens admonition reverberated in his mind as did his fleeing from two crime scenes and abetting a murderer he was after all a felon id rather not talk about this right now jack said oh lou questioned and why is that doc jacks mind raced for answers and he was loath to lie i guess because im concerned about certain peoples safety he said thats what we are here for lou said peoples safety i understand that jack said but this is a rather unique situation there are a lot of things going on im worried we might be on the brink of a real epidemic of what lou asked influenza jack said a type of influenza with a high morbidity have there been a lot of cases lou asked not a lot so far jack said but im worried nonetheless epidemics scare me but they are out of my area of expertise lou said but homicide isnt when do you think you might be willing to talk about these murders weve been discussing if youre not inclined at the moment give me a day jack said this epidemic scare is real trust me hmmmm lou voiced he looked at sergeant wilson a lot can happen in a day the sergeant said thats my concern too lou said he redirected his attention to jack what worries us is that the two gang members whove been killed were from different gangs we dont want to see a gang war erupt around here whenever they do a lot of innocent people get killed i need twentyfour hours jack repeated by then i hope to be able to prove what im trying to prove if i cant ill admit i was wrong and ill tell you everything i know which by the way is not much listen doc lou said i could arrest you right now and charge you with accessory after the fact you are willfully obstructing the investigation of several homicides i mean you do understand the reality of what you are doing dont you i think i do jack said i could charge you but im not going to do that lou said he sat back in his chair instead im going to bow to your judgment concerning this epidemic stuff in deference to dr montgomery who seems to think you are a good guy ill be patient about my area of expertise but i want to hear from you tomorrow night understand i understand jack said jack looked from the lieutenant to the sergeant and then back is that it for now lou said jack got up and headed for the door before he reached it sergeant wilson spoke up i hope you understand how dangerous dealing with these gangs is they feel they have little to lose and consequently have little respect for life either their own or others ill keep that in mind jack said jack hurried from the building as he emerged into the night he felt enormous relief as if hed been granted a reprieve while he waited for a taxi to appear in park row in front of the police headquarters he thought about what he should do he was afraid to go home at the moment he didnt want to see the black kings or warren he thought about going back to see terese but he feared endangering her more than he already had with few alternatives jack decided to find a cheap hotel at least hed be safe and so would his friends wednesday am march the first symptom jack noticed was a sudden rash that appeared on his forearms as he was examining it the rash spread quickly to his chest and abdomen with his index fingers he spread the skin at the site of one of the blotches to see if it would blanch with pressure not only did it not blanch the pressure deepened the color then as quickly as the skin eruption appeared it began to itch at first jack tried to ignore the sensation but it increased in intensity to the point where he had to scratch when he did the rash began to bleed each blotch was transformed into an open sore with the bleeding and the sores came a fever it started to rise slowly but once it got past a hundred degrees it shot up soon jacks forehead was awash with perspiration when he looked at himself in the mirror and saw his face flushed and spotted with open sores he was horrified a few minutes later he began to experience difficulty breathing even with deep breaths he was gasping for air then jacks head began to pound like a drum with each beat of his heart he had no idea what hed contracted but its seriousness was all too obvious intuitively jack knew he had only moments to make the diagnosis and determine treatment but there was a problem to make the diagnosis he needed a blood sample but he had no needle perhaps he could get a sample with a knife it would be messy but it might work where could he find a knife jacks eyes blinked open for a second he frantically searched the nightstand for a knife but then he stopped he was disoriented a deep clang sounded again and again jack could not place it he lifted his arm to look at his rash but it had disappeared only then did jack realize where he was and that hed been dreaming jack estimated the temperature in the hotel room to be ninety degrees with disgust he kicked off the blankets he was drenched in sweat sitting up he put his legs over the side of the bed the clanging noise was coming from the radiator which was also steaming and sputtering it sounded like someone was striking the riser with a sledgehammer jack went to the window and tried to open it it wouldnt budge it was as if it had been nailed shut giving up he went to the radiator it was so hot he couldnt touch the valve he got a towel from the bathroom but then found the valve was stuck in the open position in the bathroom jack was able to open a frosted window a refreshing breeze blew in for a few minutes he didnt move the cool tiles felt good on his feet he leaned on the sink and recoiled at the remembrance of his nightmare it had been so frighteningly real he even looked at his arms and abdomen again to make sure he didnt have a rash thankfully he didnt but he still had a headache which he assumed was from being overheated he wondered why he hadnt awakened sooner looking into the mirror he noticed that his eyes were red he was also in dire need of a shave he hoped that there was a sundry shop in the lobby because he had no toilet articles with him jack returned to the bedroom the radiator was now silent and the room temperature had dropped to a tolerable level with cool air flowing in from the bathroom jack began to dress so he could go downstairs as he did so he recalled the events of the previous evening the image of the gun barrel came back to his minds eye with terrifying clarity he shuddered another fraction of a second and he would have been gone three times in twentyfour hours jack had come close to death each episode made him realize how much he wanted to live for the first time he began to wonder if his response to his grief for his wife and daughtershis reckless behaviormight be a disservice to their memory down in the seedy lobby jack was able to purchase a disposable razor and a miniature tube of toothpaste with a toothbrush attached as he waited for the elevator to return to his room he caught sight of a bound stack of the daily news outside of an unopened newsstand above the lurid headlines was morgue doc nearly winds up on the slab in trendy restaurant shootout see page three jack set down his purchases and tried to tease out a copy of the paper but he couldnt the securing band was too tough to snap returning to the front desk he managed to convince the morose night receptionist to come out from behind his desk and cut the band with a razor blade jack paid for the paper and saw the receptionist pocket the money on the way up in the elevator jack was shocked to see a picture of himself on page three coming out of the positano restaurant with shawn magoginal holding his upper arm jack couldnt remember a picture being taken the caption read dr jack stapleton a nyc medical examiner being led by plainclothes detective shawn magoginal from the scene of the doctors attempted assassination a nyc gang member was killed in the incident jack read the article it wasnt long he was finished before he got back to his room somehow the writer had learned that jack had had runins with the same gang in the past there was an unmistakably scandalous implication he tossed the paper aside he was disgusted at the unexpected exposure and was concerned it could hinder his cause he expected to have a busy day and he didnt want interference resulting from this unwanted notoriety jack showered shaved and brushed his teeth he felt a world of difference from when hed awakened but he did not feel up to par he still had a headache and the muscles of his legs were sore so was his lower back he couldnt help but worry that he was having early symptoms of the flu he didnt have to remind himself to take his rimantadine when jack arrived at the medical examiners office he had the taxi drop him off at the morgue receiving bay to avoid any members of the press who might be lying in wait jack headed directly upstairs to scheduling he was worried about what had come in during the night as he stepped into the room vinnie lowered his newspaper hey doc vinnie said guess what youre in the morning paper jack ignored him and went over to where george was working arent you interested vinnie called out theres even a picture ive seen it jack said its not my best side tell me what happened vinnie demanded heck this is like a movie or something whyd this guy want to shoot you it was a case of mistaken identity jack said aw no vinnie said he was disappointed you mean he thought you were someone else something like that jack said then addressing george he asked if there had been any more influenza deaths did someone actually fire a gun at you george asked ignoring jacks question he was as interested as vinnie other peoples disasters hold universal appeal forty or fifty times jack said but luckily it was one of those guns that shoots pingpong balls those i wasnt able to duck bounced off harmlessly i guess you dont want to talk about it george said thats perceptive of you george jack said now have any influenza deaths come in four george said jacks pulse quickened where are they jack asked george tapped one of his stacks id assign a couple of them to you but calvin already called to tell me he wants you to have another paper day i think he saw the newspaper too in fact he didnt even know if youd be coming in to work today jack didnt respond with as much as he had to do that day having another paper day was probably a godsend jack opened the charts quickly to read the names although he could have guessed their identities it was still a shock kim spensor george haselton gloria hernandez and a william pearson the evening lab tech had all passed away during the night with acute respiratory distress syndrome the worry that the influenza strain was virulent was no longer a question it was now a fact these victims had all been healthy young adults whod died within twentyfourplus hours of exposure all of jacks anxiety came back in a rush his fear of a major epidemic soared his only hope was that if he was right about the humidifier being the source all of these cases represented index cases in that all had been exposed to the infected humidifier hence none of these deaths represented persontoperson transfer the key element for the kind of epidemic he feared jack rushed from the room ignoring more questions from vinnie jack didnt know what he should do first from what had happened with the plague episode he thought he should wait to talk to bingham and have bingham call the city and state authorities yet now that jacks worry about a potential epidemic had increased he hated to let any time pass dr stapleton youve had a lot of calls marjorie zankowski said marjorie was the night communications operator some left messages on your voice mail but heres a list i was going to take them up to your office but since you are here she pushed a stack of pink phone messages toward jack jack snatched them up and continued on he scanned the list as he went up in the elevator terese had called several times the last time being four oclock in the morning the fact that shed called so many times gave jack a stab of guilt he should have called her from the hotel but in truth he hadnt felt like talking with anyone to his surprise there were also messages from clint abelard and mary zimmerman his first thought was that kathy mcbane might have told them everything hed said if she had then clints and marys messages might be of the unpleasant sort they had called one after the other just after six am most intriguing and worrisome of all the calls were two from nicole marquette from the cdc one was around midnight the other at five fortyfive rushing into his office jack stripped off his coat plopped himself at his desk and returned nicoles call when he got her on the line she sounded exhausted its been a long night she admitted i tried to call you many times both at work and at home i apologize jack said i should have called to give you an alternate number one of the times i called your apartment the phone was answered by an individual called warren nicole said i hope hes an acquaintance he didnt sound all that friendly hes a friend jack said but the news disturbed him facing warren was not going to be easy well i dont know quite where to begin nicole said one thing i can assure you is that youve caused a lot of people to lose a nights sleep the sample of influenza you sent has ignited a fire down here we ran it against our battery of antisera to all known reference strains it didnt react with any one of them to any significant degree in other words it had to be a strain that was either entirely new or had not been seen for as many years as weve been keeping antisera thats not good news is it jack said hardly nicole said it was very scary news particularly in light of the strains pathogenicity we understand there now have been five deaths how did you know jack asked i just found out myself thered been four more victims last night weve already been in contact with the state and local authorities during the night nicole said that was one of the reasons i tried so hard to get ahold of you we consider this to be an epidemiological emergency i didnt want you to feel you were out of the loop you see we did finally find something that reacted with the virus it was a sample of frozen sera we have that we suspect contains antisera to the influenza strain that caused the great epidemic in and good god jack exclaimed as soon as i discovered this i called my immediate boss dr hirose nakano nicole said he in turn called the director of the cdc hes been on the phone with everyone from the surgeon general on down were mobilizing to fight a war here we need a vaccine and we need it fast this is the swineflu scare of seventysix all over again is there anything i can do jack asked even though he already knew the answer not at this time nicole said we owe you a debt of gratitude for alerting us to the problem as soon as you did i told as much to the director i wouldnt be surprised if he gave you a call himself so the hospital has been notified jack asked most definitely nicole said a cdc team will be coming up there today to assist in any way it can including helping the local epidemiologist needless to say wed love to find out where this virus came from one of the mysteries of influenza is where the dormant reservoirs are birds particularly ducks and pigs are suspected but no one knows for sure its astonishing to say the least that a strain that hasnt been seen for some seventyfive years comes back to haunt us a few minutes later jack hung up the phone he was stunned yet also relieved to a degree at least his warnings of a possible epidemic had been heeded and the proper authorities mobilized if an epidemic was to be averted the only people who could make that happen were now involved but there was still the question of where these infectious agents had come from jack certainly did not think it was a natural source like another animal or a bird for the influenza he thought it was either a person or an organization and now he could concentrate on that issue before jack did anything else he called terese he found her at home she was extremely relieved to hear his voice what happened to you she asked ive been worried sick i stayed the night in a hotel jack said why didnt you call like you said you would terese asked ive called your apartment a dozen times im sorry jack said i should have called but by the time i left the police headquarters and found a hotel i wasnt feeling much like talking to anyone i cant tell you how stressful the last twentyfour hours have been im afraid im not myself i suppose i understand terese said after that horrid incident last night im amazed you are functioning at all today didnt you consider just staying home i think thats what i would have done im too caught up in everything that is happening jack said thats just what i was afraid of terese said jack listen to me youve been beat up and now almost killed isnt it time to let other people take over and you get back to your normal job its already happening to an extent jack said officials from the centers for disease control are on their way up here in force to contain this influenza outbreak all i have to do is make it through today what is that supposed to mean terese asked if i dont solve this mystery of mine by tonight im giving up on it jack said i had to promise as much to the police thats music to my ears terese said when can i see you i have some exciting news to tell after last night i would have thought youd consider me dangerous to be around jack said im assuming that once you stop this crusade of yours people will leave you alone ill have to call you jack said im not sure how the day is going to play out youd promised to call last night and didnt terese said how can i trust you youll just have to give me another chance jack said and now i have to get to work arent you going to ask me about my exciting news terese asked i thought youd tell me if you wanted to jack said national health canceled the internal review terese said is that good jack asked absolutely terese said the reason they canceled it is because they are so sure theyll like our no waiting campaign that i leaked yesterday so instead of having to throw the presentation together haphazardly we have a month to do it properly thats wonderful jack said im pleased for you and thats not all terese said taylor heath called me in to congratulate me he also told me hed learned what robert barker had tried to do so barker is out and im in taylor all but assured me ill be the next president of willow and heath that calls for a celebration jack said exactly terese said a good way to do it would be to have lunch today at the four seasons you certainly are persistent jack said as a career woman i have to be terese said i cant have lunch but maybe dinner jack said that is unless im in jail now what does that mean terese asked it would take too long to explain jack said ill call you later bye terese jack hung up before terese could get in another word as tenacious as she was jack had the feeling shed keep him on the phone until she got her way jack was about to head up to the dna lab when laurie appeared in his doorway i cant tell you how glad i am to see you laurie said and i have you to thank for my being here jack said a few days ago i might have thought of you as having interfered but not now i appreciate whatever you said to lieutenant soldano because it saved my life he called me last night and told me what happened laurie said i tried to call you at your apartment a number of times you and everyone else jack said to tell you the truth i was scared to go home lou also told me he thought you were taking a lot of risks with these gangs involved laurie said personally i think you should call off whatever you are doing well you are siding with the majority if it is any consolation jack said and im sure my mother would agree if you were to call her in south bend indiana and ask her opinion i dont understand how you can be flippant in light of everything that has happened laurie said besides lou wanted me to make sure you understand that he cant protect you with twentyfourhour security he doesnt have the manpower youre on your own at least ill be working with someone ive spent a lot of time with jack said you are impossible laurie said when you dont want to talk about something you hide behind your clever repartee i think you should tell everything to lou tell him about your terrorist idea and turn it over to him let him investigate it hes good at it its his job that might be jack said but this is a unique circumstance in a lot of ways i think it requires knowledge that lou doesnt have besides i sense it might do a world of good for my selfconfidence to follow this thing through whether its obvious or not my ego has taken a beating over the last five years you are a mystery man laurie said also stubborn and i dont know enough about you to know when you are joking and when you are serious just promise to be more careful than youve been the last few days ill make you a deal jack said ill promise if you agree to take rimantadine i did notice there were more influenza deaths downstairs laurie said you think it warrants rimantadine absolutely jack said the cdc is taking this outbreak very seriously and you should as well in fact they think it might be the same strain that caused the disastrous influenza outbreak in ive started rimantadine myself how could it be the same strain laurie asked that strain doesnt exist influenza has a way of hiding out jack said its one of the things that has the cdc so interested well if that were the case it sure shoots holes in your terrorist theory laurie said theres no way for someone to deliberately spread something that doesnt exist outside of some unknown natural reservoir jack stared at laurie for a minute she was right and he wondered why he hadnt thought of it i dont mean to rain on your parade laurie said thats okay jack said preoccupied he was busy wondering if the influenza episode could be a natural phenomenon while the other outbreaks were intentional the problem with that line of thinking was that it violated a cardinal rule in medical diagnostics single explanations are sought even for seemingly disparate events nevertheless the influenza threat is obviously real laurie said so ill take the drug but to make sure you hold up your side of the bargain i want you to keep in touch with me i noticed that calvin took you off autopsy so if you leave the office you have to call me at regular intervals maybe youve been talking to my mother after all jack said sounds remarkably like the orders she gave me during my first week at college take it or leave it laurie said ill take it jack said after laurie left jack headed to the dna lab to seek out ted lynch jack was glad to get out of his office despite the good intentions involved he was tiring of people giving him advice and he was afraid chet would soon be arriving undoubtedly hed voice the same concerns just expressed by laurie as jack mounted the stairs he thought more about lauries point concerning the influenzas source he couldnt believe hed not thought of it himself and it undermined his confidence it also underlined how much he was depending on a positive result with the probe national biologicals had sent if they were all negative hed have scant hope of proving his theory all hed have left would be the improbable cultures hed hoped kathy mcbane had obtained from the sink trap in central supply the moment ted lynch caught sight of jack approaching he pretended to hide behind his lab bench shucks you found me ted joked when jack came around the end of the counter i was hoping not to see you until the afternoon its your unlucky day jack said im not even on autopsy so ive decided to camp out here in your lab i dont suppose youve had a chance to run my probes actually i stayed late last night and even came in early to prepare the nucleoproteins im ready to run the probes now if you give me an hour or so i should have some results did you get all four cultures jack asked sure did ted said agnes was on the ball as usual ill be back jack said with some time to kill jack went down to the morgue and changed into his moon suit before entering the autopsy room the morning routine was well under way six of the eight tables were in various stages of the autopsy procedure jack walked down the row until he recognized one of the cases it was gloria hernandez for a moment he looked at her pale face and tried to comprehend the reality of death having just spoken with her in her apartment the day before it seemed an inconceivable transition the autopsy was being done by riva mehta lauries officemate she was a petite woman of indian extraction who had to stand on a stool to do the procedure at that moment she was just entering the chest jack stayed and watched when the lungs were removed he asked to see the cut surface it was identical to kevin carpenters from the day before complete with pinpoint hemorrhages there was no doubt it was a primary influenza pneumonia moving on jack found chet who was busy with the nurse george haselton jack was surprised it was chets usual modus operandi to stop into the office before doing his days autopsies when chet saw it was jack he seemed annoyed how come you didnt answer your phone last night chet demanded it was too long a reach jack said i wasnt there colleen called to tell me what happened chet said i think this whole thing has gone far enough chet instead of talking how about showing me the lung jack said chet showed jack the lung it was identical to gloria hernandezs and kevin carpenters when chet started to talk again jack merely moved on jack stayed in the autopsy room until hed seen the gross on all the influenza cases there were no surprises everyone was impressed by the pathogenicity of the virus changing back into his street clothes jack went directly up to the dna lab this time ted acted glad to see him im not sure what you wanted me to find ted said but you are batting five hundred two of the four were positive just two jack asked hed prepared himself for either all positive or all negative like everything else associated with these outbreaks he was surprised if you want i can go back and fudge the results ted joked how many do you want to be positive i thought i was the jokester around here jack said do these results screw up some theory of yours ted asked im not sure yet jack said which two were positive the plague and the tularemia ted said jack walked back to his office while he pondered this new information by the time he was sitting down hed decided that it didnt make any difference how many of the cultures were positive that fact that any of them were positive supported his theory unless an individual was a laboratory worker it would be hard to come in contact with an artificially propagated culture of a bacteria pulling his phone over closer to himself jack put in a call to national biologicals he asked to speak with igor krasnyansky since the man had already been accommodating enough to send the probes jack reintroduced himself i remember you igor said did you have any luck with the probes i did jack said thank you again for sending them but now i have a few more questions ill try to answer them igor said does national biologicals also sell influenza cultures jack asked indeed igor said viruses are a big part of our business including influenza we have many strains particularly type a do you have the strain that caused the epidemic in jack asked he just wanted to be one hundred percent certain we wish igor said with a laugh im sure that strain would be popular with researchers no we dont have it but we have some that are probably similar like the strain of the swineflu scare its generally believed that the strain was a permutation of hn but exactly what no one knows my next question concerns plague and tularemia jack said we carry both igor said im aware of that jack said what i would like to know is who has ordered either of those two cultures in the last few months im afraid we dont usually give that information out igor said i can understand that jack said for a moment jack feared he would have to get lou soldano involved just to get the information he wanted but then he thought he could possibly talk igor into giving it to him after all igor had been careful to say that such information wasnt usually given out perhaps youd like to talk to our president igor suggested let me tell you why i want to know jack said as a medical examiner ive seen a couple of deaths recently with these pathogens wed just like to know which labs we should warn our interest is preventing any more accidents and the deaths were due to our cultures igor asked that was why i wanted the probes jack said we suspected as much but needed proof hmm igor said i dont know if that should make me feel more or less inclined to give out information its just an issue of safety jack said well that sounds reasonable igor said its not as if its a secret we share our customer lists with several equipment manufacturers let me see what i can find here at my workstation to make it easier for you narrow the field to labs in the new york metropolitan area jack said fair enough igor said jack could hear the man typing on his keyboard well try tularemia first here we go there was a pause okay igor said we have sent tularemia to the national health hospital and to the manhattan general hospital thats it at least for the last couple of months jack sat more upright especially knowing that national health was the major competitor of americare can you tell me when these cultures went out i think so igor said jack could hear more typing okay here we are the national health shipment went out on the twentysecond of this month and the manhattan general shipment went out on the fifteenth jacks enthusiasm waned slightly by the twentysecond hed already made the diagnosis of tularemia in susanne hard that eliminated national health for the time being does it show who the receiver was on the manhattan general shipment jack asked or was it just the lab itself hold on igor said as he switched screens again it says that the consignee was a dr martin cheveau jacks pulse quickened he was uncovering information that very few people would know could be discoverable he doubted that even martin cheveau was aware that national biologicals phagetyped their cultures what about plague jack asked just a moment igor said while he made the proper entries there was another pause jack could hear igors breathing okay here it is igor said plagues not a common item ordered on the east coast outside of academic or reference labs but there was one shipment that went out on the eighth it went to frazer labs ive never heard of them jack said do you have an address fivefifty broome street igor said how about a consignee jack asked as he wrote down the address just the lab itself igor said do you do much business with them jack asked i dont know igor said he made another entry they send us orders now and then it must be a small diagnostic lab but theres one thing strange whats that jack asked they always pay with a cashiers check igor said ive never seen that before its okay of course but customers usually have established credit is there a telephone number jack asked just the address igor said which he repeated jack thanked igor for his help and hung up the phone taking out the phone directory he looked up frazer labs there was no listing he tried information but had the same luck jack sat back once again hed gotten information he didnt expect he now had two sources of the offending bacteria since he already knew something about the lab at the manhattan general he thought hed better visit frazer labs if there was some way he could establish an association with the two labs or with martin cheveau personally hed turn everything over to lou soldano the first problem was the concern about being followed the previous evening hed thought hed been so clever but had been humbled by shawn magoginal yet to give himself credit he had to remember that shawn was an expert the black kings certainly werent but to make up for their lack of expertise the black kings were ruthless jack knew hed have to lose a potential tail rapidly since they had clearly demonstrated a total lack of compunction about attacking him in public there was also the collateral worry about warren and his gang jack didnt know what to think about them he had no idea of warrens state of mind it was something jack would have to face in the near future to lose any tail jack wanted a crowded location with multiple entrances and exits immediately grand central terminal and the port authority bus terminal came to mind he decided on the former since it was closer jack wished there were some underground way of getting over to the nyu medical center to help him get away from the office but there wasnt instead he settled on a radiodispatched taxi service he directed the dispatcher to have the car pick him up at the receiving bay of the morgue everything seemed to work perfectly the car came quickly jack slipped in from the bay they managed to hit the light at first avenue at no time was jack a sitting duck in a motionless car still he hunched low in his seat out of view sparking the drivers curiosity the cabbie kept stealing looks at jack in his rearview mirror as they drove up first avenue jack raised himself up and watched out the back he saw nothing suspicious no cars suddenly pulled into the traffic no one ran out to flag a cab they turned left on fortysecond street jack had the driver pull up directly in front of grand central the moment the car came to a stop jack was out and running he dashed through the entrance and merged quickly with the crowd to be absolutely sure he was not being followed he descended into the subway and boarded the fortysecond street shuttle when the train was about to leave and the doors had started to close jack impeded their closing and jumped off the train he ran up into the station proper and exited back onto fortysecond street through a different entrance than he used when he arrived feeling confident jack hailed a taxi at first he told the driver to take him to the world trade center during the trip down fifth avenue he watched to see if any cars taxis or trucks could have been following when none seemed to be doing so jack told the driver to take him to broome street jack finally began to relax he sat back in the seat and put his hands to his temples the headache hed awakened with in the overheated hotel room had never completely gone away hed been ascribing the lingering throb to anxiety but now there were new symptoms he had a vague sore throat accompanied by mild coryza there was still a chance it was all psychosomatic but he was still worried after rounding washington square the taxi driver went south on broadway before turning east on houston street at eldridge he made a right jack looked out at the scenery hed not had any idea where broome street was although hed assumed it was someplace downtown south of houston that entire section of the city was one of the many parts of new york he had yet to explore and there were many street names with which he was unfamiliar the cab made a lefthand turn off eldridge and jack caught a glimpse of the street sign it was broome street jack looked out at the buildings they were five and six stories tall many were abandoned and boarded up it seemed an improbable place to have a medical lab at the next corner the neighborhood improved slightly there was a plumbingsupply store with thick metal grates covering its windows sprinkled down the rest of the block were other buildingsupply concerns on the floors above the streetlevel stores were a few loft apartments otherwise it seemed to be vacant commercial space in the middle of the following block the cabdriver pulled to the side of the street fivefifty broome street was not frazer labs it was a combination checkcashing place mailbox rental and pawnshop stuck between a package store and a shoe repair shop jack hesitated at first he thought hed gotten the wrong address but that seemed unlikely not only had he written it down but igor had mentioned it twice jack paid his fare and climbed from the cab like all the other stores in the area this one had an iron grille that could be pulled across its front at night and locked in the window was a miscellaneous mixture of objects that included an electric guitar a handful of cameras and a display of cheap jewelry a large sign over the door said personal mailboxes painted on the door glass were the words checks cashed jack stepped up to the window by standing directly in front of the electric guitar he could see beyond the display into the store itself there was a glasstopped counter that ran down the right side behind the counter was a mustached man with a punkrock hairstyle he was dressed in military camouflage fatigues in the rear of the shop was a plexiglasenclosed cubicle that looked like a bank tellers window on the left side of the store was a bank of mailboxes jack was intrigued the fact that frazer labs might be using this tacky shop as a mail drop was certainly suspicious if it was true at first he was tempted to walk in and ask but he didnt he was afraid by doing so he might hinder other methods of finding out he knew that such personal mailbox establishments were loath to give out any information privacy was the main reason people rented the boxes in the first place what jack truly wanted was not only to find out if frazer labs had a box there but to entice a frazer labs representative to come to the shop slowly an elaborate plan began to form in jacks mind being careful not to be seen by the clerk within the store jack quickly walked away the first thing he needed was a telephone directory since the area around the pawnshop was comparatively deserted jack walked south to canal street there he found a drugstore from the phone directory jack copied down four addresses a nearby uniform shop a van rental agency an office supply store and a federal express office since the clothing shop was the closest jack went there first once in the store jack realized that he couldnt remember what federal express courier uniforms looked like but he wasnt terribly concerned if he couldnt remember he didnt think the clerk in the pawnshop would know either jack bought a pair of blue cotton twill pants and a white shirt with flap pockets and epaulets he also bought a plain black belt and blue tie would you mind if i put these on jack asked the clerk of course not the clerk said he showed jack to a makeshift dressing room the pants were slightly too long but jack was satisfied when he looked at himself in the mirror he thought he needed something else he ended up adding a blue peaked cap to his outfit after jack paid for his purchases the clerk was happy to wrap up jacks street clothes just before the package was sealed jack thought to rescue his rimantadine with the symptoms he was feeling he didnt want to miss a dose the next stop was the officesupply store where jack selected wrapping paper tape a mediumsized box string and a packet of rush labels to jacks surprise he even found biohazard labels so he tossed a box of them into his shopping cart in another part of the store he found a clipboard and a pad of printed receipt forms once he had everything he wanted he took them to the checkout register and paid the next stop was the federal express office from their supply stand jack took several address labels with the clear plastic envelopes used to attach them to a parcel the final destination was a car rental agency where jack rented a cargo van that took the most time since jack had to wait while someone went to another location to bring the van to the agency jack used the opportunity to prepare the parcel first he put together the box wanting to give it the feeling of having contents jack eyed a triangular piece of wood on the floor near the entrance he assumed it was a doorstop when no one at the rental counter was looking jack picked up the object and slipped it into the box he then crumpled up multiple sheets of a new york post that he found in the waiting area he hefted the box and gave it a shake satisfied he taped it shut after the wrapping paper and the string were applied jack plastered the outside with rush and biohazard labels the final touch was the federal express label which jack carefully filled out addressing it to frazer labs for the return address jack used national biologicalss after throwing away the top copy jack inserted one of the carbons into the plastic envelope and secured it to the front of the box he was pleased the package appeared official indeed and with all the rush labels he hoped it would have the desired effect when the van arrived jack went out and put the package the remains of the wrapping material and the parcel containing his clothes in the back climbing behind the wheel he drove off before going back to the pawnshop jack made two stops he returned to the drugstore where hed used the phone book and bought some throat lozenges for his irritated throat which seemed to be getting worse he also stopped at a deli for some takeout he wasnt hungry but it was already afternoon and hed eaten nothing that day besides after he delivered the package he had no idea how long hed have to wait while driving back to broome street jack opened one of the orangejuice containers hed bought and used the juice to take a second dose of rimantadine in view of his progressive symptoms he wanted to keep the drugs concentration high in his blood jack pulled up directly in front of the pawnshop leaving the engine running and the emergency blinkers blinking clutching his clipboard he got out and went around to the rear to get the package then he entered the store the door had bells secured to the top edge and jacks entrance was heralded by a raucous ringing as had been the case earlier there were no customers in the shop the mustached man in the camouflage fatigues looked up from a magazine with his hair standing on end he had the look of perpetual surprise ive got a rush delivery for frazer labs jack said he plopped the parcel down on the glass counter and shoved the clipboard under the mans nose sign there at the bottom he added while proffering his pen to the man the man took the pen but hesitated and eyed the box this is the right address isnt it jack asked i reckon the man said he stroked his mustache and looked up at jack whats the rush i was told there was dry ice in there jack said then he leaned forward as if to tell a secret my supervisor thinks its a shipment of live bacteria you know for research and all the man nodded i was surprised i wasnt delivering this directly to the lab jack said it cant sit around i mean i dont think it will leak out or anything at least i dont think so but it might die and then it will be useless i assume you have a way of getting in touch with your customers i reckon the man repeated id advise you to do that jack said now sign and ill be on my way the man signed his name reading upside down jack made out tex hartmann tex pushed the clipboard back toward jack and jack slipped it under his arm im sure glad to get that thing off my truck jack said ive never been much of a fan of bacteria and viruses did you hear about those cases of plague that were here in new york last week they scared me to death the man nodded again take care jack said with a wave he walked out of the store and climbed into his truck he wished that tex had been a bit more talkative jack wasnt sure if he would be calling frazer labs or not but just as jack was releasing the emergency brake he could see tex through the window dialing his phone pleased with himself jack drove several blocks down broome street then circled the block he parked about a half block from the pawn shop and turned off the motor after locking the doors he broke out the deli food whether he was hungry or not he was going to make himself eat something are you sure we should be doing this bj questioned yeah man im sure twin said he was maneuvering his cadillac around washington square park looking for someplace to park it wasnt looking good the park was crammed full of people entertaining themselves in a bewildering variety of ways there was skateboarding inline skating frisbee throwing break dancing chess playing and drug dealing baby carriages dotted the park it was a carnivallike atmosphere which was exactly why twin had suggested the park for the upcoming meeting shit man i feel naked without some kind of ordnance its not right shut your mouth bj and look for a spot for this ride of mine twin said this is going to be a meeting of the brothers theres no need for any firepower what if they bring some bj asked hey man dont you trust nobody twin asked at that moment he saw a delivery van pulling away from the curb what do you know were in luck twin expertly guided his car into the spot and pushed on the emergency brake it says for commercial vehicles only bj said he had his face pressed up against the window to see the parking sign with all the crack weve moved this year i think we qualify twin said with a laugh come on get your black ass in gear they got out of the car and crossed the street to enter the park twin checked his watch they were a little early despite the trouble parking that was how twin liked it for this kind of meeting he wanted a chance to scope the place out it wasnt that he didnt trust the other brothers it was just that he liked to be careful but twin was in for a surprise when his eyes swept the area for the agreedupon meeting he found himself transfixed by the stare of one of the more physically imposing men hed seen in some time uhoh twin said under his breath whats the matter bj demanded instantly alert the brothers have gotten here before us twin said what do you want me to do bj asked his own eyes raced around the park until they too settled on the same man twin had spotted nothing twin said just keep walking he looks so goddamn relaxed bj said it makes me worried shut up twin commanded twin walked right up to the man whose piercing eyes had never left his twin formed his right hand into the form of a gun pointed at the man and said warren you got it warren said hows it going not bad twin said he then ritualistically raised his right hand to head height warren did the same and they highfived it was a perfunctory gesture akin to a couple of rival investment bankers shaking hands this heres david warren said motioning toward his companion and this heres bj twin said mimicking warren david and bj eyed each other but didnt move or speak listen man twin said let me say one thing right off we didnt know the doc was living in your hood i mean maybe we should have known but we didnt think about it with him being white what kind of a relationship did you have with the doc warren asked relationship twin questioned we didnt have no relationship how come youve been trying to ice him warren asked just for some small change twin said a white dude who lives down our way came to us and offered us some cash to warn the doc about something he was doing then when the doc didnt take our advice the dude offered us more to take him out so youre telling me the doc hasnt been dealing with you people warren asked shit no twin said with a derisive laugh we dont need no honky doctor for our operation no way you should have come to us first warren said we would have set you right about the doc hes been running with us on the bball court for four or five months hes not half bad neither so im sorry about reginald i mean it wouldnt have happened if wed talked im sorry about the kid twin said that shouldnt have happened neither trouble was we were so pissed about reginald we couldnt believe a brother would get shot over a honky doctor that makes us even warren said thats not counting what happened last night but that didnt involve us i know twin said can you imagine that doc hes like a cat with nine lives how the hell did that cop react so fast and why was he in there he must think hes wyatt earp or something the point is that we have a truce warren said damn straight twin said no more brother shooting brother weve got enough trouble without that but a truce means you lay off the doc too warren said you care what happens to that dude twin asked yeah i do warren said hey then its your call man twin said it wasnt like the money was that good anyway warren stuck out his hand palm up twin slapped it then warren slapped twins be good warren said you too man twin said warren motioned to david that they were leaving they walked back toward the washington arch at the base of fifth avenue that wasnt half bad david said warren shrugged you believe him david asked yeah i do warren said he might deal in drugs but hes not stupid if this thing goes on we all lose wednesday pm march jack felt uncomfortable among other problems he was stiff and now all his muscles ached hed been sitting in the van for more hours than he cared to count watching customers going in and out of the pawnshop thered never been a crowd but it was steady most of the people looked seedy it occurred to jack that the shop was trafficking in illicit activities like gambling or drugs it was not a good neighborhood jack had sensed that the moment hed arrived that morning the point had been driven home as darkness fell and someone tried to break into the van with jack sitting there the man had approached the passengerside door with a flat bar which he proceeded to insert between the glass and the door frame jack had to knock on the glass and wave to get the mans attention the moment he saw jack he ran off jack was now popping throat lozenges at a regular rate with little relief his throat was worse and to add to his increasing misery hed developed a cough it wasnt a bad cough merely a dry hack but it further irritated his throat and increased his anxiety that he had indeed caught the flu from gloria hernandez although two rimantadine tablets were recommended as the daily dose jack took a third when the coughing started just about the time jack was contemplating admitting to himself that his clever ploy with the package had been a failure his patience paid off the man involved did not attract jacks attention initially hed arrived on foot which was not what jack expected he was dressed in an old nylon ski parka with a hood just like a few of the individuals whod preceded him but when he came out he was carrying the parcel despite the failing light and the distance jack could see the rush and biohazard labels plastered haphazardly over the exterior jack had to make a rapid decision as the man walked briskly toward the bowery he hadnt expected to be following a pedestrian and he debated if he should get out of the van and follow on foot or stay in the van circle around and try to follow the man while driving thinking that a slowly moving van would attract more attention than a pedestrian jack got out of the truck he followed at a distance until the man turned right on eldridge street jack then ran until he reached the corner he peeked around just in time to see the man entering a building across the street midway down the block jack quickly walked to the building it was five stories like its immediate neighbors each floor had two large storefrontsized windows with smaller sashed windows on either side a fire escape zigzagged down the left side of the facade to end in a counterweighted ladder pivoted some twelve feet from the sidewalk the groundfloor commercial space was vacant with a for rent sign stuck to the inside of the glass the only lights were in the secondfloor windows from where jack was standing it appeared to be a loft apartment but he couldnt be certain there were no drapes or other obvious signs of domesticity while jack was eyeing the building vaguely wondering what to do next the lights went on up on the fifth floor while he watched he saw someone raise the sash of the smaller window to the left jack was unable to see if it had been the man he followed but he suspected it was after making certain he wasnt being observed jack quickly moved over to the door where the man had entered he tried it and it opened stepping over the threshold he found himself in a small foyer a group of four mailboxes was set into the wall to the left only two had names the second floor was occupied by g heilbrunn the fifthfloor tenant was r overstreet there was no frazer labs four buzzers bordered a small grille which jack assumed covered a speaker he vaguely contemplated ringing the fifth floor but had trouble imagining what he could say he stood there for a few minutes thinking but nothing came to mind then he noticed that the mailbox for the fifth floor appeared to be unlocked jack was about to reach up to the mailbox when the inner door to the building proper abruptly opened it startled jack and he jumped but he had the presence of mind to keep himself turned away from whoever was exiting the building the person hastily brushed by jack with obvious distress jack caught a fleeting glimpse of the same nylon ski parka a second later the man was gone jack reacted quickly getting his foot into the inner door before it closed as soon as he was certain the man was not immediately returning jack entered the building he let the door close behind him a stairway wound up surrounding a wide elevator built of a steel frame covered by heavy wire mesh jack assumed the elevator had been for freight not only because of its size but also because its doors closed horizontally instead of vertically and its floor was roughhewn planks jack got into the elevator and pushed five the elevator was noisy bumpy and slow but it got jack to the fifth floor getting off he faced a plain heavy door there was no name and no bell hoping the apartment was empty jack knocked when there was no answer even after a second louder rapping jack tried the door it was locked since the stairway rose up another floor jack climbed to see if he could get to the roof the door opened but would lock behind him once he was outside before he ventured onto the roof he had to find something to wedge between the door and doorjamb so he could return to the stairwell just over the threshold he found a short length of twobyfour which he guessed was there for that very purpose with the door propped open jack stepped out onto the dark roof and gingerly walked toward the front of the building ahead of him he could see the arched handrails of the fireescape ladder silhouetted against the night sky arriving at the front parapet jack grasped the handrails and looked down the view down to the street awakened his fear of heights and the idea of lowering himself over the edge made him feel momentarily weak yet just twelve feet down was the fireescape landing for the fifth floor it was generously illuminated by the light coming from within the apartment despite his phobia jack knew this was a chance he couldnt pass up he had to at least take a look into the window first he sat on the parapet facing the rear of the building then holding on to the handrail he stood up keeping his eyes fixed on each rung jack lowered himself down the short run of ladder he moved slowly and deliberately until his foot hit up against the grate of the landing never once did he look down maintaining one hand on the ladder he leaned over and peered through the window the space was indeed a loft as jack had surmised but he could see it was partially divided with sixfoothigh partitions immediately in front of him was a living area with a bed to the right and a small kitchen built against the left wall on a round table was the opened remains of jacks parcel the doorstop and the crumpled newspaper were strewn about the floor what interested jack more was what he could just see over the partition it was the top of a stainlesssteel appliance that did not look as if it belonged in an apartment with the window in front of him invitingly open jack could not control his urge to climb into the apartment for a better look besides he rationalized he could exit into the stairwell rather than subject himself to climbing the fireescape ladder again although he continued to avoid looking down it took jack a moment to convince himself to let go of the ladder by the time he had slithered into the apartment headfirst he was perspiring heavily jack quickly collected himself once inside with his feet planted on the floor he had no compunction about peering back out the window and down at the street he wanted to make sure the man in the ski parka wasnt coming back at least not for the moment satisfied jack turned back to the apartment he went from the combination kitchenbedroom into a living room dominated by a storefrontsized window there were two couches facing each other and a coffee table on a small hooked rug the walls of the partitions were decorated with posters announcing international microbiological symposia the magazines on the coffee table were all microbiological journals jack was encouraged perhaps he had found frazer labs after all but there was also something that disturbed him a large glassfronted gun cabinet stood against the far partition the man in the ski parka was not only interested in bacteria he was also a gun enthusiast moving quickly jack passed through the living room intent on locating the door to the stairwell but as soon as he passed beyond the living rooms partition he came to a stop the entire rest of the large multicolumned loft was occupied by a lab the stainlesssteel appliance hed seen from the fire escape was similar to the walkin incubator hed seen in the generals lab in the far righthand corner was a type iii biosafety hood whose exhaust vented out the top of the sashed window although jack had suspected hed find a private lab when he climbed through the window the comprehensiveness of the one hed discovered stunned him he knew that such equipment was not cheap and the combination living quarterslab was unusual to say the least a generous commercial freezer caught jacks attention standing to the side were several large cylinders of compressed nitrogen the freezer had been converted to using liquid nitrogen as its coolant making it possible to take the interior temperature down into the minusfiftydegree range jack tried to open the freezer but it was locked a muffled noise that resembled a bark caught jacks attention and he looked up from the freezer he heard it again it came from the very back of the lab where there was a shed about twenty feet square jack walked closer to examine the odd structure a vent duct exited from its rear and exhausted through the top of one of the rear windows jack cracked the door a feral odor drifted out as well as a few sharp barks opening the door farther jack saw the edges of metal cages he flipped on a light he saw a few dogs and cats but for the most part the room was filled with rats and mice the animals stared back at him blankly a few dogs wagged their tails in hopeful anticipation jack shut the door in jacks mind the man in the parka was becoming some kind of fiendish microbiological devotee jack didnt even want to think about what kind of experiments were in progress with the animals hed discovered a sudden distant highpitched whine of electrical machinery made jacks heart skip a beat he knew instantly what it was the elevator with rapidly mounting panic jack frantically searched for the door to the hall the spectacle of the lab had diverted his attention from locating it it didnt take long to find but by the time jack reached it he feared the elevator would be nearing the fifth floor jacks initial thought had been to dash up the stairs to the roof and then exit the building after the man in the parka had entered his apartment but now with the elevator fast approaching jack thought hed be seen that left exiting the apartment the way hed entered but when the elevator motor stopped and the metal doors clanged open he knew there wasnt time jack had to hide quickly preferably close to the door to the hall about ten feet away was a blank door jack rushed to it and opened it it was a bathroom jack jumped in and pulled the door closed behind him he had to hope the man in the parka had other things on his mind than using the toilet or washing his hands hardly had jack shut the bathroom door than he heard keys turning the locks of the outer door the man came in locked the door after him then walked briskly away the sound of his footsteps receded then disappeared for a second jack hesitated he gauged how much time he needed to get to the door to the hall and unlock it once he got to the stairs he felt confident he could outrun the man in the parka with all his basketball playing jack was in better shape than most as quietly as possible jack opened the door at first he only cracked it to be able to listen jack heard nothing slowly he opened the door further so that he could peer out from jacks vantage point he could see a large part of the lab the man was not to be seen jack pushed the door open just enough to squeeze through he eyed the door to the hall there was a deadbolt a few inches above the knob glancing around the lab once more jack slipped out of the bathroom and rushed silently over to the outer door he grasped the knob with his left hand while his right hand went to the deadbolt but there was an agonizing problem the deadbolt had no knob a key was required from both inside and out jack was locked in panicked jack retreated to the bathroom he felt desperate like one of the poor animals penned in the makeshift shelter his only hope was that the man in the parka would leave before using the bathroom but it was not to be after only a few agonizing minutes the bathroom door was suddenly whisked open the man sans parka started in but collided with jack both men gasped jack was about to say something clever when the man stepped back and slammed the door hard enough to bring down the shower curtain and rod jack immediately went for the door handle for fear of being locked in putting his shoulder into it jack rammed the door unexpectedly the door opened without hindrance jack stumbled out of the bathroom struggling to stay on his feet once he had his balance his eyes darted around the loft the man had disappeared jack headed for the kitchen and the open window he had no other choice but he only made it as far as the living room the man had also run there to snatch a large revolver out of a drawer in the coffee table as jack appeared the man leveled the gun at him and told him to freeze jack immediately complied he even raised his hands with such a large gun pointing at him jack wanted to be as cooperative as possible what the hell are you doing here the man snarled his hair fell across his forehead making him snap his head back to keep it out of his eyes it was that gesture more than anything else that made jack recognize the man it was richard the head tech from the manhattan generals lab answer me richard demanded jack raised his hands higher hoping the gesture might satisfy richard while his mind desperately sought some reasonable explanation of why he was there but none came to mind under the circumstances jack couldnt even think of anything clever to say jack kept his eyes riveted to the gun barrel which had moved to within three feet of his nose he noticed the tip trembled suggesting that richard was not only angry but also acutely agitated in jacks mind such a combination was particularly dangerous if you dont answer me im going to shoot you right now richard hissed im a medical examiner jack blurted out im investigating bull richard snapped medical examiners dont go busting into peoples apartments i didnt break in jack explained the window was open shut up richard said its all the same youre trespassing and meddling im sorry jack said couldnt we just talk about this were you the one who sent me that fake package richard demanded what package jack asked innocently richards eyes left jacks and they swept down to jacks feet and then back up to his face youve even got on a fake deliveryman outfit that took thought and effort what are you talking about jack asked i dress like this all the time when im not at the morgue bull richard repeated he pointed toward one of the couches with the gun sit down he yelled all right already jack said you only have to ask nicely the initial shock was passing and his wits were returning he sat where richard indicated richard backed up to the gun cabinet without taking his eyes off jack he groped for keys in his pocket and then tried to get the gun cabinet open without looking at what he was doing can i give you a hand jack asked shut up richard yelled even his hand with the key was shaking when he got the glazed door open he reached in and pulled out a pair of handcuffs now thats a handy item to have around jack said handcuffs in hand richard started back toward jack keeping the gun pointed at his face i tell you what jack said why dont we call the police ill confess and they can take me away then ill be out of your hair shut up richard ordered he then motioned for jack to get to his feet jack complied and lifted his hands again move richard said motioning toward the main part of the lab jack backed up he was afraid to take his eyes off the gun richard kept coming toward him the handcuffs dangling from his left hand over by the column richard snapped jack did as he was instructed he stood against the column it was about fifteen inches in diameter face it richard commanded jack turned around reach around it with your hands and grasp them together richard said when he did what richard had insisted jack felt the handcuffs snap over each wrist he was now locked to the column mind if i sit down jack asked richard didnt bother to answer he hurried back into the living area jack lowered himself to the floor the most comfortable position was embracing the column with his legs wrapped around it as well as his arms jack could hear richard dialing a telephone jack considered yelling for help when richard started his conversation but quickly scrapped the idea as suicidal considering how nervous richard was acting besides whomever richard was calling probably wouldnt care about jacks plight jack stapleton is here richard blurted without preamble i caught him in my goddamn bathroom he knows about frazer labs and hes been snooping around in here im sure of it just like beth holderness at the lab the hairs on the back of jacks neck rose up when he heard richard mention beths name dont tell me to calm down richard shouted this is an emergency i shouldnt have gotten myself involved in this youd better get over here fast this is your problem as well as it is mine jack heard richard slam down the telephone the man sounded even more agitated a few minutes later richard reappeared without his gun he came over to jack and looked down at him richards lips were quivering how did you find out about frazer labs he demanded i know you sent the phony package so theres no use lying jack looked up into the mans face richards pupils were widely dilated he looked half crazy without warning richard slapped jack with an open palm the blow split jacks lower lip a trickle of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth youd better start talking richard snarled jack gingerly felt the damaged part of his lip with his tongue it was numb he tasted the saltiness of his blood maybe we should wait for your colleague jack said to say something his intuition told him he soon would be seeing martin cheveau or kelley or possibly even zimmerman the slap must have hurt richard as well as jack because he opened and closed his hand a few times and then disappeared back into the living area jack heard what he thought was the refrigerator being opened then an ice tray being dumped a few minutes later richard reappeared to glare at jack he had a dish towel wrapped around his hand he commenced pacing pausing every now and again to glance at his watch time dragged by jack would have liked to have been able to take one of his throat lozenges but it was impossible he also noticed that his cough was increasing and that he now felt just plain sick he guessed he had a fever the distant highpitched sound of the elevator brought jacks head up from where it had slumped against the column jack considered the fact that the buzzer hadnt sounded that meant that whoever was on their way up had a key richard heard the elevator motor as well he went to the door and opened it to wait in the hall jack heard the elevator arrive with a thump the motor switched off and the elevator door clanged open where is he an angry voice demanded jack was facing away from the door when he heard richard and his visitor come into the loft he heard the door close and be locked hes over there richard said with equal venom handcuffed to the column jack took a breath and turned his head as he heard footsteps close in on him when he caught sight of who it was he gasped wednesday pm march you bastard terese snapped why couldnt you let sleeping dogs lie you and your stubbornness youre screwing everything up just when things are finally starting to go right jack was dumbstruck he looked up into her blue eyes which he had only recently seen as soft now they looked as hard as pale sapphires her mouth was no longer sensuous her bloodless lips formed a grim line terese richard yelled dont waste time trying to talk with him we got to figure out what were going to do what if someone knows he is here terese broke off from glaring at jack to look at richard are those stupid cultures of yours in this lab she demanded of course theyre here richard said then get rid of them terese said flush them down the toilet but terese richard cried dont but terese me get rid of them now even the influenza richard questioned especially the influenza terese snapped morosely richard went over to the freezer unlocked it and began rummaging through its contents what am i going to do with you terese asked redirecting her attention to jack she was thinking out loud for starters you could take off these handcuffs jack said then we could all go for a quiet dinner at positano and you can let your friends know we are there shut up terese exclaimed ive had it with your repartee abruptly terese left jack and moved over next to richard she watched him gathering a handful of frozen vials all of it now she warned there cannot be any evidence here you understand it was the worst decision of my life to help you richard complained when he had all the vials he disappeared into the bathroom how are you involved in all this jack asked terese terese didnt answer instead she walked around the partition into the living room behind him jack heard the toilet flush and he hated to think what had just been sent into the citys sewers to infect the sewer rats richard reappeared and followed terese into the living area jack couldnt see them but given the high unadorned ceiling he could hear them as if they were right next to him weve got to get him out of here immediately terese said and do what richard asked moodily dump him in the east river no i think he should just disappear terese said what about mom and dads farmhouse up in the catskills i never thought of that richard said his voice brightened but yeah thats a good idea how will we get him up there terese asked ill bring around my explorer richard said the problem is getting him into it and then keeping him quiet terese said ive got ketamine richard said whats that terese asked its an anesthetic agent richard said its used a lot in veterinary medicine there are some uses for humans but it can cause hallucinations i dont care if it causes hallucinations terese said all i care about is whether it will knock him out or not actually it would be best just to have him tranquilized ketamine is all ive got richard said i can get it because its not a scheduled drug i use it with the animals i dont want to hear about any of that terese said is it possible just to give him enough to make him dopey i dont know for sure richard said but ill try how do you give it terese asked injection richard said but its shortacting so we might have to do it several times lets give it a try terese said jack found himself perspiring heavily when terese and richard reappeared from the living room jack didnt know if it was from a fever or from the worry engendered by the conversation hed just overheard he did not like the idea of being an unwilling experimental subject with a potent anesthetic agent richard went to a cabinet and got out a handful of syringes from another cabinet he got the drug which came in a glass vial with a rubber top he then stopped to figure out a dose what do you think he weighs richard asked terese as if jack were an uncomprehending animal id guess about oneeighty give or take five pounds terese said richard did some simple calculations then filled one of the syringes as he came at jack jack had to fight off a panic attack he wanted to scream but he didnt richard injected the ketamine into his right upper arm jack winced it burned like crazy lets see what that does richard said stepping away he discarded the used syringe while we wait ill go get my car terese nodded richard got his ski parka and pulled it on at the door he told terese hed be back in ten minutes so this is a sibling operation jack commented when he and terese were alone dont remind me terese said shaking her head she began to pace as richard had earlier the first effect jack experienced from the ketamine was a ringing in his ears then his image of terese began to do strange things jack blinked and shook his head it was as if a cloud of heavy air were settling over him and he was outside of himself watching it happen then he saw terese at the end of a long tunnel suddenly her face expanded to an enormous size she was speaking but the sound echoed interminably her words were incomprehensible the next thing jack was aware of was that he was walking but it was a strange uncoordinated walk since he had no idea where the various parts of his body were he had to look down to see his feet sweep out of the periphery of his vision and then plant themselves when he tried to look where he was going he saw a fragmented image of brightly colored shapes and straight lines that were constantly moving he felt mild nausea but when he shook himself it passed he blinked and the colored shapes came together and merged into a large shiny object a hand came into his field of vision and it touched the object that was when jack realized it was his hand and the object was a car other elements of his immediate environment became recognizable there were lights and a building then he realized that there were people on either side of him holding him up they were speaking but their voices had a deep mechanical sound as if they were synthesized jack felt himself falling but he couldnt stop himself it seemed as if he fell for several minutes before landing on a hard surface then he could only see dark shapes he was lying on a carpeted surface with something firm jutting into his stomach when he tried to move he found that his wrists were restrained time passed jack had no idea how long it could have been minutes or it could have been hours but at last hed regained orientation and he was no longer hallucinating he realized that he was on the floor of the backseat of a moving car and his hands were handcuffed to the undercarriage of the front passenger seat presumably they were on their way to the catskills to relieve the discomfort of the driveshaft pressing against his stomach jack drew his knees underneath him to assume a crouchedover position it was far from ideal but better than it had been but his discomfort was from more than his cramped posture the flu symptoms were much worse and combined with a hangover from the ketamine he felt about as bad as hed ever felt several violent sneezes caused terese to look over the back of the seat good god she exclaimed where are we jack asked his voice was hoarse and the effort of speaking caused him to cough repeatedly he was having a problem with his nose running but with his hands secured he couldnt do anything about it i think you better just shut up or youll choke to death richard said terese turned to richard is this coughing and sneezing from the shot you gave him how the hell do i know its not as if ive ever given ketamine to a person before well its not so farfetched to imagine you might have an idea terese snapped you use it on those poor animals i resent that richard said indignantly you know i treat those animals like my pets thats why i have the ketamine in the first place jack sensed that the anxiety that terese and richard had evidenced earlier about his presence had metamorphosed into irritation from the way they were speaking it seemed to be mostly directed at each other after a brief silence richard spoke up you know this whole thing was your idea not mine he said oh no terese voiced im not about to let you get away with that misconception you were the one who suggested causing americare trouble with nosocomial infection it never would have even crossed my mind i only suggested it after you complained so bitterly about americare gobbling up national healths market share despite your stupid ad campaign richard said you begged me to help i wanted some ideas terese said something to use with the ads hell you did richard said you dont go to a grocery store and ask for hardware i dont know squat about advertising you knew my field was microbiology you knew what id suggest it was what you were hoping i never thought about it until you mentioned it terese countered besides all you suggested was that you could arrange some bad press by nuisance infections i thought you meant colds or diarrhea or the flu i did use the flu richard said yes you used the flu terese said but was it regular flu no it was some weird stuff that has everybody all up in arms including doctor detective in the backseat i thought you were going to use common illnesses not the plague for chrissake or those other ones i cant even remember their names you didnt complain when the press jumped all over the outbreaks and the market share trend rapidly reversed richard said you were happy i was appalled terese said and scared i just didnt say it youre full of crap richard said heatedly i talked with you the day after the plague broke out you didnt mention it once it even hurt my feelings since it took some effort on my part i was afraid to say anything about it terese said i didnt want to associate myself with it in any way but as bad as it was i thought that was it i didnt know you were planning on more i cant believe im hearing this richard said jack became aware they were slowing down he lifted his head as high as his handcuffed hands would allow the glare of artificial light penetrated the car theyd been driving in darkness for some time suddenly there were bright lights and theyd come to a complete stop under an overhang when jack heard the driversside window going down he realized they were at a tollbooth he started to yell for help but his voice was weak and raspy richard reacted swiftly by reaching around and smacking jack with a hard object the blow impacted on jacks head he collapsed onto the floor dont hit him so hard terese said you dont want blood on the inside of the car i thought shutting him up was more important richard said he threw a handful of coins into the bin of the automatic gate jacks headache was now worse from the blow he closed his eyes he tried to find the most comfortable position but there werent many choices mercifully he finally fell into a troubled sleep despite being thrown from side to side after the toll they were driving on a winding and twisting road the next thing jack knew they were stopped again carefully he raised his head again there were lights outside of the car dont even think about it richard said he had the revolver in his hand where are we jack asked groggily at an allnight convenience store richard said terese wanted to get some basics terese came back to the car with a bag of groceries did he stir she asked as she climbed in yeah hes awake richard said did he try to yell again nope richard said he didnt dare they drove for another hour terese and richard intermittently continued to bicker about whose fault the whole mess was neither was willing to give in finally they turned off the paved road and bounced along a rutted gravel drive jack winced as his tender body thumped against the floor and the driveshaft hump eventually they made a sharp turn to the left and came to a stop richard switched off the motor both he and terese then got out jack was left in the car by himself lifting his head as high as he could he was only able to see a swatch of night sky it was very dark getting his legs under him jack tried to see if he could possibly rip the handcuffs from beneath the seat but it wasnt possible the handcuffs had been looped around a stout piece of steel collapsing back down he resigned himself to waiting it was half an hour before they came back for him when they did they opened both doors on the passenger side terese unlocked one side of the handcuffs out of the car richard commanded he held his gun aimed at jacks head jack did as he was told terese then quickly stepped forward and recuffed jacks free hand in the house richard said jack started walking on wobbly legs through the wet grass it was much colder than in the city and he could see his breath ahead a white farmhouse loomed in the darkness there were lights in the windows facing a balustraded porch jack could make out smoke and a few sparks issuing from the chimney as they reached the porch jack glanced around to the left he could see the dark outline of a barn beyond that was a field then there were mountains there were no distant lights it was an isolated private hideaway come on richard said poking jack in the ribs with the barrel of the gun inside the interior was decorated as a comfortable weekendsummer house with an english country flair there were matching calico couches facing each other in front of a massive fieldstone chimney in the fireplace was a roaring freshly kindled fire an oriental rug covered most of the wideboard floor through a large arch was a country kitchen with a center table and ladderback chairs beyond the table was a franklin stove against the far wall was a large sstyle porcelain kitchen sink richard marched jack into the kitchen and motioned for him to get down on the rag rug in front of the sink sensing he was about to be shackled to the plumbing jack asked to use the rest room the request brought on a new argument between brother and sister terese wanted richard to go into the bathroom with jack but richard flatly refused he told terese she could do it but she thought it was richards role finally they agreed to let jack go in by himself since the guest bathroom had only one tiny window one that was too small for jack to climb through left to himself jack got out the rimantadine and took one of the tablets hed been discouraged that the drug had not prevented his infection but he did think it was slowing the flus course no doubt his symptoms would be far worse if he werent taking it when jack came out of the bathroom richard took him back to the kitchen and as jack had anticipated locked the handcuffs around the kitchen drainpipe while terese and richard retired to the couches in front of the fire jack eyed the plumbing with the intent of escaping the problem was that the pipes were oldfashioned they werent pvc or even copper they were brass and cast iron jack tried putting pressure on them but they didnt budge resigned for the moment jack assumed the most comfortable position it was lying on his back on the rag rug he listened to terese and richard who for the moment had gotten past their attempts to blame each other for the present catastrophe they were now being more rational they knew they had to make some decisions jacks position on his back made his nasal discharge run down the back of his throat his coughing jags returned as did a round of violent sneezes when he finally got himself under control he found himself looking up into tereses and richards faces we have to know how you found out about frazer labs richard said gun once again in hand jack feared that if they found out he was the only person who knew about frazer labs theyd probably kill him then and there it was easy jack said give us an idea how easy terese said i just called up national biologicals and asked if anyone had recently ordered plague bacteria they told me frazer labs had terese reacted as if shed been slapped angrily she turned to richard dont tell me you ordered the stuff she said with disbelief i thought you had all these bugs in your socalled collection i didnt have plague richard said and i thought plague would make the biggest media impact but what difference does it make they cant trace where the bacteria came from thats where you are wrong jack said national biologicals tags their cultures we all found out about it at the medical examiners office when we did the autopsy you idiot terese shouted youve left a goddamn trail right to your door i didnt know they tagged their cultures richard said meekly oh god terese said rolling her eyes to the ceiling that means everybody at the mes office knows the plague episode was artificial what should we do richard asked nervously wait a second terese said she looked down at jack im not sure hes telling the truth i dont think that fits with what colleen said hang on let me call her tereses conversation with colleen was short terese told her underling that she was worried about jack and asked if colleen could call chet to inquire about jacks conspiracy theory terese wanted to know if anyone else at the medical examiners office subscribed to it terese concluded by telling colleen that she was unreachable but would call back in fifteen minutes during the interim there was little conversation except for terese asking richard if he was sure hed disposed of all the cultures richard assured her that hed flushed everything down the toilet when the fifteen minutes was up terese redialed colleen as promised at the end of their brief conversation terese thanked colleen and hung up thats the first good news tonight terese said to richard no one else at the mes office gives any credence to jacks theory chet told colleen that everyone chalks it up to jacks grudge against americare so no one else must know about frazer labs and the tagged bacteria richard said exactly terese said and that simplifies things dramatically now all we have to do is get rid of jack and how are we going to do that richard asked first you are going to go out and dig a hole terese said i think the best spot would be on the other side of the barn by the blueberry patch now richard questioned this isnt something we can blithely put off you idiot terese said the grounds probably frozen richard complained it will be like digging in granite you should have thought of that when you dreamed up this catastrophe terese said get out there and get it done there should be a shovel and a pick in the barn richard grumbled as he pulled on his parka he took the flashlight and went out the front door terese jack called out dont you think youve taken this a bit too far terese got off the couch and came into the kitchen she leaned against the cabinet and eyed jack dont try to make me feel sorry for you she said if i warned you once i warned you a dozen times to leave well enough alone youve only yourself to blame i cant believe your career can be this important to you jack said people have died and more people can die still not just me i never intended that anybody die terese said that only happened thanks to my harebrained brother whos had this love affair with microbes ever since he was in high school hes collected bacteria the way a survivalist collects guns just having them around was a weird turnon for him maybe i should have known hed do something crazy sometime i dont know right now im just trying to get us out of this mess youre rationalizing jack said youre an accomplice just as guilty as he is you know something jack terese said at this moment i couldnt care less what you think terese walked back to the fire jack could hear more logs being added he rested his head on his forearm and closed his eyes he was miserable both sick and frightened he felt like a condemned man vainly waiting for a reprieve when the door burst open an hour later jack jumped hed fallen asleep again he also noticed a new symptom now his eyes hurt when he looked from side to side digging the hole was easier than i thought richard reported he peeled off his coat wasnt any frost at all it must have been a bog in that area at one time because there werent even any rocks i hope you made it deep enough terese said tossing aside a book i dont want any more screwups like having him wash up in the spring rain its plenty deep enough richard said he disappeared into the bathroom to wash his hands when he came out terese was putting on her coat where are you going out terese said she headed for the door ill go for a walk while you kill jack wait a second richard said why me youre the man terese said with a scornful smile thats a mans work the hell it is richard said im not going to kill him i couldnt i couldnt shoot someone while hes handcuffed i dont believe you terese yelled youre not making sense you had no compunction about putting lethal bacteria into defenseless peoples humidifiers which sure as hell killed them it was the bacteria that killed them richard said it was a fight between the bacteria and the persons immune system i didnt do the killing directly they had a chance give me patience terese cried rolling her eyes heavenward she collected herself and took a breath okay fine with the patients it wasnt you it was the bacteria in this case it will be the bullet not you hows that does that satisfy this weird sense of responsibility of yours this is different richard said its not the same at all richard we dont have any choice otherwise youll go to jail for the rest of your life richard hesitantly looked over at the gun on the coffee table get it terese commanded when she saw him eyeing the pistol richard wavered come on richard terese urged richard went over and irresolutely picked up the gun holding it by the barrel as well as the handle he cocked it good terese said encouragingly now go over there and do it maybe if we take off the handcuffs and he tries to run i can richard began but he stopped in midsentence when terese strode over to him with her eyes blazing without warning she slapped him richard recoiled from the blow and his own anger flared dont even talk like that you fool terese spat we are not taking any more chances understand richard put a hand to his face and then looked at it as if he expected to see blood his initial fury quickly abated he realized that terese was right slowly he nodded okay now get to it terese said ill be outside terese strode to the door do it quickly but dont make a mess she said then she was gone silence settled over the room richard didnt move he only turned the gun over slowly in his hands as if he were inspecting it finally jack spoke up i dont know whether id listen to her you might face prison for the outbreaks if they can prove it was you behind them but killing me like this in cold blood means the death penalty here in new york shut up richard screamed he rushed into the kitchen and assumed a shooting stance directly behind jack a full minute went by which seemed like an hour to jack hed been holding his breath unable to hold it any longer he exhaledand immediately began coughing uncontrollably the next thing he knew richard tossed the gun onto the kitchen table then he ran to the door he opened it and shouted out into the night i cant do it almost immediately terese reappeared you goddamned coward she told him why dont you do it yourself richard spat back terese started to respond but instead she strode to the kitchen table snapped up the gun and walked around to face jack holding the pistol in both hands she pointed it at his face jack stared back at her directly into her eyes the tip of the gun barrel began to waver all at once terese let out a barrage of profanity and threw the gun back onto the table ah iron woman isnt as hard as she thought richard taunted shut up terese said she stalked back to the couch and sat down richard sat across from her they eyed each other irritably this is becoming a bad joke she said i think we are all strung out richard said thats probably the first thing youve said thats true terese said im exhausted what time is it its after midnight richard said no wonder terese said ive got a headache im not feeling so great myself richard admitted lets sleep terese said well deal with this problem in the morning right now i cant even see straight jack woke up at fourthirty in the morning shivering the fire had gone out and the temperature in the room had fallen the rag rug had provided some warmth jack had managed to pull it over him the room was almost completely dark terese and richard had not left on any lights when theyd retired to separate bedrooms what little light there was drifted in from outside through the window over the sink it was just enough for jack to discern the vague shapes of the furniture jack didnt know what made him feel worse fear or the flu at least his cough had not worsened the rimantadine had seemingly protected him from developing primary influenza pneumonia for a few minutes jack allowed himself the luxury of contemplating being rescued the problem was that the chances were minuscule the only person who knew that the national biologicals probe test was positive with the plague culture was ted lynch not that he could know what it meant agnes might but there was no reason for ted to tell agnes what hed found if rescue was not a viable possibility then hed have to rely on escape with numb fingers jack felt up and down the length of drainpipe to which he was shackled he tried to feel for any imperfections but there were none he positioned the handcuffs at various heights and with his feet against the pipes pushed until the handcuffs cut into his skin the pipes were there to stay if he were to escape it would have to occur when he was allowed to go to the bathroom how he would actually do it he had no idea all he could hope was that theyd become careless jack shuddered when he thought of what morning might bring a good nights sleep would only toughen tereses resolve the fact that neither terese nor richard could shoot him in cold blood the night before was scant reassurance as selfcentered as they both were he couldnt bank on that continuing indefinitely using his legs jack succeeded in getting the rag rug to fold over him again settling down as best he could he tried to rest if an opportunity of escape presented itself he hoped hed be physically able to take full advantage of it thursday am march catskill mountains new york the hours had passed slowly and miserably for jack hed not been able to fall back asleep nor could he even find a comfortable position with his shivering when richard finally staggered into the room with his hair standing on end jack was almost glad to see him ive got to use the bathroom jack called out youll have to wait for terese to get up richard said he was busy rebuilding the fire the door to tereses room opened a few minutes later terese was dressed in an old bathrobe she didnt look any better than richard her normal helmet of highlighted curls looked more like a mop she was without makeup and the contrast with her normal appearance made her seem exceptionally pale ive still got my headache terese complained and i slept lousy me too richard said its the stress and we never really had any dinner but im not hungry terese said i cant understand it ive got to go to the bathroom jack repeated ive been waiting for hours get the gun terese said to richard ill unlock the handcuffs terese came into the kitchen and bent down to reach under the sink with the handcuff key sorry you didnt sleep well jack said you should have joined me out here in the kitchen its been delightful i dont want to hear any mouth from you terese warned im not in the mood the handcuff snapped open jack rubbed his chafed wrist as he stiffly got to his feet a wave of dizziness spread over him forcing him to lean against the kitchen table terese quickly relocked the handcuff around jacks free wrist jack wouldnt have been able to resist even if hed had the intention okay march richard said he was training the gun on jack in a second jack said the room was still spinning no tricks terese said she stepped away from him as soon as he could jack walked to the bathroom on rubbery legs the first order of business was to relieve himself the second was to take a dose of the rimantadine with a long drink of water only then did he hazard a look in the mirror what he saw surprised him he wasnt sure he would have recognized himself he looked like a vagrant his eyes were bright red and slightly swollen dried blood was on the left side of his face and spattered on the shoulder of his uniform shirt apparently from the blow hed received in the car at the tollbooth his lip was swollen where richard had split it dried mucus stuck to his formidable stubble hurry up in there terese commanded through the door jack ran water in the sink and washed his face using his index finger he brushed his teeth then with a little water he smoothed his hair its about time terese said when jack emerged jack suppressed the urge to give a clever retort he felt he was walking a tightrope with these people and he didnt want to push his luck he hoped they wouldnt lock him back to the kitchen drain but the wish was in vain he was marched right back to the sink and secured we should eat something richard said i got cold cereal last night terese said fine richard said they sat at the table a mere four feet away from jack terese ate very little she again mentioned that she just wasnt hungry they didnt offer any cereal to jack have you thought about what were going to do richard asked what about those people who were supposed to kill jack in the city who were they its a gang from down where i live richard said how do you contact them terese asked i usually call them up or just go over to the building they occupy richard said ive been dealing with a man called twin well lets get him the hell up here terese said he might come richard said if the money is right call him terese said how much were you going to pay them five hundred richard said offer him a thousand if you have to terese said but say its a rush job and that hes got to come today richard scraped back his chair and went into the living room to get the phone he brought it back to the kitchen table he wanted her to listen in case they had to up the ante he didnt know how twin would respond to the idea of coming all the way to the catskills richard dialed and twin answered richard told him he wanted to talk once again about knocking off the doctor hey man were not interested twin said i know there was trouble in the past richard said but this time it will be a snap we have him handcuffed and hidden away outside the city if thats the case you dont need us twin said wait richard said hastily hed sensed twin was about to hang up we still need you in fact to make it worth your while driving out here well pay double a thousand bucks twin asked you got it richard said dont come twin jack shouted its a setup shit richard barked he told twin to hold the line for a second in a fit of fury richard cracked jack over the head with the butt of his gun jack closed his eyes hard enough to bring tears the pain in his head was intense again he felt blood drip down the side of his scalp was that the doc twin asked yeah that was the doc richard said angrily what did he mean setup twin asked nothing richard said hes just running off at the mouth weve got him handcuffed to the kitchen drainpipe let me get this straight twin said youre paying a thousand bucks for us to come out and ice the doc while hes chained to a pipe itll be a like a turkey shoot richard assured him where are you twin asked about a hundred miles north of the city richard said in the catskills there was a pause what do you say richard asked its easy money why dont you do it yourself twin asked thats my business richard said all right twin said give me directions but if there is any funny stuff youll be one unhappy dude richard gave directions to get to the farmhouse and told twin theyd be waiting for him richard slowly replaced the receiver while he looked triumphantly at terese well thank god terese said id better call in sick richard said picking up the phone again i should have been at work already after he finished his call terese made a similar one to colleen then she went to take a shower richard went to fill the wood box wincing against the pain jack pushed himself back to a sitting position at least the bleeding had stopped the prospect of the black kings arrival spelled doom from bitter experience jack knew these gang members would have no qualms about shooting him no matter what state he was in for a few seconds jack lost total control of himself like a child in a temper tantrum he yanked inconsequentially at his shackles all he managed to do was cut into his wrists and knock over some detergent containers there was no way he was about to break either the drainpipe or the handcuffs after the fit had passed jack slumped over and cried but even that didnt last long wiping his face on his left sleeve he sighed and sat up he knew he had to escape on his next trip to the bathroom hed have to try something it was his only chance and he didnt have much time threequarters of an hour later terese reappeared in her clothes she dragged herself to the couch and plopped down richard was on the other couch flipping through an old s life magazine i really dont feel too good terese admitted my headache is still killing me i feel like im coming down with a cold me too richard said without looking up i have to use the bathroom again jack called out terese rolled her eyes give me a break she said no one moved or spoke for five minutes i suppose i can just let loose right here jack said breaking the silence terese sighed and threw her legs over the side of the couch come on stalwart warrior she said disparagingly to richard they used the same method as before terese unlocked the handcuffs while richard stood poised with the gun do i really need these handcuffs while im in the bathroom jack asked when terese started to relock them absolutely terese said once inside the bathroom jack took another rimantadine and a long drink of water then leaving the water running he stepped on the closed toilet seat grasped the window trim with both hands and began to pull he increased the pressure to see if the window casing would come loose just then the door opened get down from there terese snarled jack stepped down from the toilet and cringed he was afraid that richard was about to hit him on the head again instead richard just crowded into the bathroom holding the gun out in front of him trained on jacks face the gun was cocked just give me a reason to shoot he hissed for a second no one moved then terese ordered jack back to the kitchen sink cant you think of another place jack said im getting tired of the view dont push me terese warned with the cocked gun just a few feet away there was nothing jack could do in a matter of seconds he was handcuffed to the drainpipe yet again a half hour later terese decided to go out to the store to get some aspirin and some soup she asked richard if he wanted anything he told her to get some ice cream he thought it might feel good on his sore throat after terese had left jack told richard that he had to go to the bathroom again yeah sure richard said without budging from the couch i do jack averred i didnt get to go last time richard gave a short laugh tough shit he said it was your own fault come on jack said it will only take a minute listen richard yelled if i come in there it will be to crack you over the head again understand jack understood all too well twenty minutes later jack heard the unmistakable sound of a car approaching along the gravel drive he felt a rush of adrenaline in his system was it the black kings his panic returned and he stared forlornly at the unbudgable drainpipe the door opened to jacks relief it was terese she dropped a bag of groceries on the kitchen table then retreated to the couch and lay down and closed her eyes she told richard to put the groceries away richard got up without enthusiasm he put what had to be kept cold in the refrigerator and the ice cream in the freezer then he placed the cans of soup in the cupboard in the bottom of the bag he found aspirin and a bunch of small cellophanewrapped packages of peanutbutter crackers you might give some of the crackers to jack terese said richard looked down at jack you want some he asked jack nodded although he still felt ill his appetite had returned hed not eaten anything since the deli food in the van richard fed jack peanut butter crackers whole like a mother bird dropping food into a waiting chicks gaping mouth jack hungrily devoured five of them and then asked for water for chrissake richard voiced he was annoyed this job had fallen to him give it to him terese said reluctantly richard did as he was told after a long drink jack thanked him richard told jack to thank terese not him bring me a couple of aspirin and some water terese said richard rolled his eyes what am i the servant just do it terese said petulantly threequarters of an hour later another car could be heard coming up the driveway finally richard said as he tossed a magazine aside and heaved himself off the couch they must have driven by way of philadelphia for chrissake he headed for the door while terese pushed herself up to a sitting position jack swallowed nervously he could feel his pulse pounding in his temples he realized he didnt have long to live richard pulled open the door shit he voiced terese sat bolt upright whats the matter its henry the goddamn caretaker richard croaked what are we going to do you cover jack terese barked in panic ill talk to henry she stood up and swayed for a moment as a wave of dizziness overcame her then she went out the door richard dashed over to jack en route hed picked up the gun which he now held by the barrel as if it were a hatchet one word and so help me ill bash your head in he growled jack looked up at richard he could see the mans determination outside he could hear a car come to a stop followed by the muffled sound of tereses voice jack was faced with an unreasonable quandary he could yell but how much sound he could make before being incapacitated by richard was questionable yet if he didnt try hed soon be facing the black kings and certain death he decided to go for it jack put his head back and started to scream for help as expected richard brought the handle of his gun crashing down on jacks forehead jacks scream was cut off before he could form any words a merciful darkness intervened with the suddenness of a light being switched off jack regained consciousness in stages the first thing he was aware of was that his eyes wouldnt open but after a struggle the right one did and a minute later so did the left when he wiped his face on his sleeve he realized that his lids had been sealed together with coagulated blood with his forearm jack could feel that he had a sizable lump centered at his hairline he knew it was a good place to be hit if you had to take a wallop that part of the skull was by far the thickest he blinked to clear his vision and looked at his watch it was just after four a fact confirmed by the anemic quality of the lateafternoon sunlight coming through the window over the sink jack glanced around the living room which he could see from under the kitchen table the fire had burned down significantly terese and richard were sprawled on their respective couches jack changed his position and in the process tipped over a container of window cleaner whats he doing now richard asked who the hell cares terese said what time is it its after four richard said where are these gang friends of yours terese demanded are they coming by bicycle should i call and check richard asked no lets just wait here for a week terese said irritably richard put the phone on his chest and dialed when the phone was answered he had to ask for twin after a long wait twin came on the line why the hell arent you here richard complained weve been waiting all day im not coming man twin said but you said you were richard rejoined i cant do it man twin said i cant come not even for a thousand dollars nope twin said but why richard demanded cause i gave my word twin said you gave your word what does that mean richard asked just what i said twin said dont you understand english but this is ridiculous richard said hey its your party twin said you have to do your own shit richard found himself holding a dead telephone he slammed the receiver down that worthless bum he spat he wont do it i cant believe it terese pushed herself up into a sitting position so much for that idea that puts us back to square one dont look at me im not doing it richard snapped ive made that crystal clear its up to you sister hell all this was for your benefit not mine supposedly terese retorted but you got some perverted enjoyment out of it you finally got to use those bugs youve been playing with all your life yet now you cant do this simple thing youre some sort of she struggled for the word degenerate she said finally well youre no snow white yourself richard yelled no wonder that husband of yours left you tereses face flushed she opened her mouth but no words came out suddenly she lunged for the gun richard took a step backward he feared hed overdone it by mentioning the unmentionable for a second he thought terese was about to use the gun on him but instead she flew into the kitchen cocking the gun as she went she stepped up to jack and pointed the gun at his bloodied face turn away she commanded jack felt as if his heart had stopped he looked up the quivering barrel and into tereses arctic blue eyes he was paralyzed incapable of following her command damn you terese said through a sudden flood of tears uncocking the gun she tossed it aside then rushed back to the couch to bury her head in her hands she was sobbing richard felt guilty he knew he shouldnt have said what he had losing her baby and then her husband was his sisters achilles heel meekly he went over to her and sat on the edge of the couch i didnt mean it richard said stroking her back gently it slipped out im not myself terese sat up and wiped her eyes im not myself either she admitted i cant believe these tears im a wreck i feel awful too now my throats sore you want another aspirin richard asked terese shook her head what do you think twin meant about giving his word she asked i dont know richard said thats why i asked him why didnt you offer him more money terese said he didnt give me a chance richard said he hung up well call him back terese said we have to get out of here how much should i offer richard said i dont have the kind of money you have whatever it takes terese said at this point money shouldnt be a limiting factor richard picked up the phone and dialed this time when he asked for twin he was told twin was out he wouldnt be back for an hour richard hung up we have to wait he said what else is new terese commented terese lay back on the couch and pulled a crocheted afghan over her she shivered is it getting cold in here or is it just me she asked i had a couple of chills myself richard said he went to the fire and piled on more logs then he got a blanket from his bedroom before reclining on his couch he tried to read but he couldnt concentrate he was intermittently shivering despite the blanket i just thought of a new worry he said what now terese asked her eyes were closed jacks been sneezing and coughing you dont think he was exposed to my flu strain the one i put in the humidifier with the blanket wrapped around him richard got up and went into the kitchen and asked jack about it jack didnt answer come on doc richard urged dont make me have to hit you again what difference does it make terese called from the couch it makes a lot of difference richard said theres a good chance my strain was the strain that caused the great flu epidemic of i got it in alaska from a couple of frozen eskimos who died of pneumonia the time frame was right terese joined him in the kitchen now youre getting me worried she said do you think he has it and has exposed us its possible richard said thats terrifying she looked down at jack well she demanded were you exposed jack wasnt sure if he should admit to his exposure or not he didnt know which would anger them more the truth or his silence i dont like it that hes not answering richard said hes a medical examiner terese said he had to have been exposed they brought the dead people to him he told me on the phone im not afraid of that richard said the exposure to worry about is to a living breathing sneezing coughing person not a dead body medical examiners dont take care of live people terese said all their patients are dead thats true richard admitted besides terese said jack is hardly sick hes got a cold big deal wouldnt he be really ill by now if hed contracted your flu bug youre right richard said im not thinking straight if he had the flu bug hed be flat out by now brother and sister returned to their couches and collapsed i cant take much more of this terese said especially the way i feel at fivefifteen exactly one hour after the previous call richard phoned twin this time twin himself picked up what the hell are you pestering me for twin asked i want to offer more money richard said obviously a thousand wasnt enough i understand its a long drive up here how much are you looking for you didnt understand me did you twin said irritably i told you i couldnt do it thats it games over two thousand richard said he looked over at terese she nodded hey man are you deaf or what twin said how many times three thousand richard said and terese again nodded three thousand bucks twin repeated thats correct richard said you are sounding desperate twin said were willing to pay three thousand dollars richard said that should speak for itself hmmm twin said and you say you have the doc handcuffed exactly richard said it will be a piece of cake i tell you what twin said ill send someone up there tomorrow morning youre not going to do what you did this morning are you richard asked no twin said i guarantee ill have someone up there to take care of things for three thousand richard said he wanted to be sure they understood each other three thousand will be just fine twin said richard replaced the receiver and looked over at terese do you believe him she asked this time he guaranteed it richard said and when twin guarantees something it happens hell be here in the morning im confident terese sighed thank god for small favors she said jack wasnt so relieved his panic rekindled he determined he had to find a way to escape that night morning would bring the apocalypse afternoon dragged into evening terese and richard fell asleep unattended the fire died down a chill came with the darkness jack wracked his brains for ideas of escape but unless he was freed from the drainpipe he didnt see how he could get away around seven both richard and terese began to cough in their sleep at first they seemed more to be clearing their throats than coughing but soon the hacking became more forceful and productive jack considered the development significant it gave support to a concern hed been harboring since they both began complaining of chills namely that they had caught the dreaded flu from him just as richard suspected thinking back to the long car ride from the city jack realized it would have been hard for them not to have contracted his illness during the ride jacks symptoms were peaking and symptoms of the flu often peaked with maximum viral production each of jacks sneezes and coughs had undoubtedly sent millions of the infective virions into the cars confined space still jack couldnt be sure besides his real worry was facing the black kings in the morning he had more pressing concerns than the health of his captors jack yanked futilely at the drain with the short chain between the handcuffs all he succeeded in doing was to make a racket and abrade his wrists more than they already were shut up richard yelled after having been awakened by the clamor he switched on a table lamp then was immediately overwhelmed by a fit of coughing whats happening terese asked groggily the animal is restless richard rasped god i need some water he sat up waited for a moment then got to his feet im dizzy he said i might even have a fever he walked hesitantly into the kitchen and got a glass as he was filling it jack thought about knocking his legs out from under him but he decided that would only win him another blow to the head i have to go to the bathroom jack said shut up richard said its been a long time jack said its not as if im asking to go for a run in the yard and if i dont go its going to be unpleasant around here richard shook his head in resignation after he took a drink of water he called out to terese that her services were needed then he got the gun from the kitchen table jack heard richard cock the gun the move narrowed jacks options terese appeared with the key jack noticed her eyes had a glazed feverish look she bent down under the sink and unlocked one side of the handcuffs without a word she backed away as jack got to his feet as before the room swam before his eyes some escape artist he thought cynically he was weak from lack of food sleep and liquids terese relocked the handcuffs richard marched directly behind jack with the gun at the ready there was nothing that jack could do when he got to the bathroom he tried to close the door sorry terese said using her foot to block it you lost that privilege jack looked from one to the other he could tell there was no use arguing he shrugged and turned around to relieve himself when he was finished he motioned toward the sink how about my washing my face he asked if you must terese said she coughed but then held herself in check it was obvious her throat was sore jack stepped to the sink which was out of the line of tereses sight after turning on the water jack surreptitiously got out his rimantadine and took one of the tablets in his haste he almost dropped the vial before getting it back into his pocket he glanced at himself in the mirror and recoiled he looked significantly worse than he had that morning thanks to the new laceration high on his forehead it was gaping and needed stitches if it was to heal without a scar jack laughed at himself what a time to worry about cosmetics the trip back to the spot of jacks internment was without incident there were a few moments when jack was tempted to try something but each time his courage failed him by the time jack was again locked up under the sink he felt disappointed in himself and correspondingly despondent he had the disheartening sense that hed just let his last chance of escape slip by do you want any soup terese asked richard im really not hungry richard admitted all i want is a couple of aspirin i feel like ive been run over by a truck im not hungry either terese said this is more than a cold im sure i have a fever too do you think we should be worried obviously weve got what jack has richard said i guess hes just more stoic anyway well see a doctor tomorrow after twins visit if we think we should who knows maybe a nights sleep is all we need let me have a couple of those aspirins terese said after taking their analgesic terese and richard returned to the living room richard spent a few moments building up the dying fire terese made herself as comfortable as possible on her couch soon richard went back to his they both seemed exhausted jack was surer than ever that both his captors had the deadly strain of the flu he didnt know what his ethics dictated he do the problem was his rimantadine and the fact that it possibly could thwart the flus progress jack agonized silently over whether he should tell them of his exposure and talk them into taking the drug to potentially save their lives even though they were totally committed to ending his and were responsible for the deaths of other innocent victims with that in mind did he owe terese and richard compassion in the face of their callous indifference should his oath as a physician prevail jack took no comfort at the notion of poetic justice being done yet if he shared the rimantadine with them they might deny it to him after all they werent choosy about the way he died as long as it wasnt directly by their hand jack sighed it was an impossible decision he couldnt choose but not making a decision was in effect a decision jack understood its ramifications by nine oclock tereses and richards breathing had become stertorous punctuated by frequent coughing episodes tereses condition seemed worse than richards around ten a markedly violent fit of coughing woke terese up and she moaned for richard whats the matter richard questioned lethargically im feeling worse terese said i need some water and another aspirin richard got up and woozily made his way into the kitchen he gave jack a halfhearted kick to move him out of the way needing little encouragement jack scrambled to the side as much as his shackled hands would allow richard filled a glass with water and stumbled back to terese terese sat up to take the aspirin and the water while richard helped support the glass when she was finished with the water she pushed the glass away and wiped her mouth with her hand her movements were jerky with the way im feeling do you think we should head back to the city tonight she questioned we have to wait for morning richard said as soon as twin comes well be off besides im too sleepy to drive now anyway youre right terese said as she flopped back at the moment i dont think i could stand the drive either not with this cough its hard to catch my breath sleep it off richard said ill leave the rest of the water right here next to you he put the glass on the coffee table thanks terese murmured richard made his way back to his couch and collapsed he drew the blanket up around his neck and sighed loudly time dragged and with it terese and richards congested breathing slowly got worse by tenthirty jack noticed that tereses respiration was labored even from as far away as the kitchen he could see that her lips had become dusky he was amazed shed not awakened he guessed the aspirin had brought her fever down in spite of his ambivalence jack was finally moved to say something he called out to richard and told him terese didnt sound or look good shut up richard yelled back between coughs jack stayed silent for another half hour by then he was convinced he could hear faint popping noises at the end of each of tereses inspirations that sounded like moist rales if they were it was an ominous sign suggesting to jack that terese was slipping into acute respiratory distress richard jack called out despite richards warning to stay quiet terese is getting worse there was no response richard jack called louder what richard answered sluggishly i think your sister needs to be in an intensive care unit jack said richard didnt respond im warning you jack called im a doctor after all and i should know if you dont do something its going to be your fault jack had hit a nerve and to his surprise richard leaped off the couch in a fit of rage my fault he snarled its your fault for giving us whatever we have frantically he looked for the gun but he couldnt remember what hed done with it after jacks last visit to the bathroom the search for the pistol only lasted for a few seconds richard suddenly grabbed his head with both hands and moaned about his headache then he swayed before collapsing back onto the couch jack sighed with relief touching off a fit of rage in richard had not been expected he tried not to imagine what might have happened had the gun been handy jack resigned himself to the horror of witnessing the spectacle of a virulently pathogenic influenza wreaking its havoc with tereses and richards rapidly worsening clinical state he recalled stories that had been told about the terrible influenza pandemic of people were said to have boarded a subway in brooklyn with mild symptoms only to be dead by the time theyd reached their destination in manhattan when jack had heard such stories hed assumed they had been exaggerations but now that he was being forced to observe terese and richard he no longer thought so their swift deterioration was a frightening display of the power of contagion by one am richards breathing was as labored as tereses had been terese was now frankly cyanotic and barely breathing by four richard was cyanotic and terese was dead at six am richard made a few feeble gurgling sounds and then stopped breathing friday am march morning came slowly at first pale fingers of sunlight tentatively limned the edge of the porcelain sink from where jack was sitting he could see a spiderweb of leafless tree branches against the gradually brightening sky he hadnt slept a wink when the room was completely filled with morning light jack hazarded a look over his shoulder it was not a pretty scene terese and richard were both dead with bloody froth exuding from their dusky blue lips both had started to bloat slightly particularly terese jack assumed it was from the heat of the fire which was now reduced to mere embers jack looked back despairingly at the drainpipe that so effectively nailed him to his spot it was an inconceivable predicament twin and his black kings were probably now on their way even without the three thousand dollars the gang had ample reason to kill him given his role in two of their members deaths throwing back his head jack screamed at the top of his voice for help he knew it was futile and soon stopped when he was out of breath he rattled the handcuffs against the brass pipe and even put his head in under the sink to examine the lead seal where the brass pipe joined the castiron pipe below the trap with a fingernail he tried to dig into the lead but without result eventually jack sat back his anxiety was enervating coupled with his lack of sleep food and water it was hard to think clearly but he had to try he didnt have much time jack considered the faint possibility that the black kings wouldnt show up as theyd failed to show the day before yet that prospect wasnt any rosier jack would be sentenced to an agonizing death from exposure and lack of water of course if he couldnt take his rimantadine the flu might get him first jack fought back tears how could he have been so stupid to have allowed himself to get caught in such an impossible situation he chided himself for his inane heroic crusade idea and the juvenile thought of wanting to prove something to himself hed been as reckless in this episode as hed been each day hed ridden his bike down second avenue thumbing his nose at death two hours passed before jack heard the faint beginnings of the dread sound the crackling of car tires on gravel the black kings had arrived in a fit of panic jack repeatedly kicked the drainpipe as hed done numerous times over the previous day and a half with the same result he stopped and listened again the car was closer jack looked at the sink suddenly an idea occurred to him the sink was a huge old castiron monstrosity with a large bowl and expansive drainage area for dishes jack imagined it weighed several hundred pounds it was hung on the wall in addition to being supported by the heavy drain getting his feet under him jack rested the underlip of the sink on his biceps and tried to pry the sink upward it moved slightly and bits of mortar at the sinks junction with the wall fell into the bowl jack twisted like a contortionist to put his right foot against the sinks lip he could hear the car come to a halt the moment he pushed with his leg there was a cracking sound jack positioned himself so that both his feet were under the edge of the sink straining with all his might he exerted the maximum force he could muster with a snap and a grinding sound the sink detached from the wall a bit of plaster rained down on jacks face unattached the sink teetered on the drain with another thrust of his legs jack got the sink to fall forward the copper watersupply pipes snapped off at their soldered ends and water began spraying the drain remained intact until the lead seal gave way at that moment the brass pipe slipped out of the cast iron the sink made an enormous crashing noise as it crushed a ladderback chair before thumping heavily on the wooden floor jack was soaked from the spraying water but he was free he scrambled to his feet as heavy footfalls sounded on the front porch he knew the door was unlocked and that the black kings would be inside in a moment theyd undoubtedly heard the crash of the sink with no time to look for the pistol jack lunged for the back door frantically he fumbled with the deadbolt and threw the door open in an instant he was outside hurling himself down the few steps to the dewcovered grass hunching down to stay out of view jack ran from the house as fast as he could manage with his hands still handcuffed ahead was a pond it occupied the area hed imagined was a field on his arrival the previous night to the left of the pond and about a hundred feet from the house stood the barn jack ran to it it was his only hope of a hiding place the surrounding forest was barren and leafless with heart pounding jack reached the barn door to his relief it was unlocked he yanked it open dashed inside and pulled it closed behind him the interior of the barn was dark dank and uninviting the only light came through a single westfacing window the rusted remains of an old tractor loomed in the halflight with utter panic jack stumbled around in the darkness searching for a hiding place his eyes began to adjust he looked into several deserted animal stalls but there was no way to conceal himself there was a loft above but it was devoid of hay looking down at the plank flooring jack vainly looked for a trapdoor but there wasnt any in the very back of the barn there was a small room filled with garden tools but still no place to hide jack was about to give up when he spotted a low wooden chest the size of a coffin he ran to it and raised its hinged lid inside were malodorous bags of fertilizer jacks blood ran cold outside he heard a male voice yell hey man around here theres tracks in the grass with little other choice jack emptied the chest of the bags of fertilizer then he climbed in and lowered the lid shivering from fear and the damp cold jack was still perspiring his breaths were coming in short gasps he tried to calm down if the hiding place was to work hed have to be silent it wasnt long before he heard the door to the barn creak open followed by the sound of muffled voices footsteps sounded on the plank flooring then there was a crash as something was overturned jack heard curses then another crash you got your machine pistol cocked one husky voice said whatd you think i am stupid another replied jack heard footsteps approach he held his breath tried to contain his shivering and fought the urge to cough there was a pause then the footsteps receded jack allowed himself to breathe out somebodys in here im sure of it a voice said shut up and keep looking the other answered without warning the cover to jacks hiding place was whisked open it happened with such unexpected suddenness jack was totally unprepared he let out a muffled screech the black man looking down at him did the same letting the lid slam back into place the lid was quickly yanked open again jack could see that the man was holding a machine pistol in his free hand on his head was a black knit cap jack and the black man locked eyes for a moment then the man looked toward his partner its the doc all right he called out hes here in a box jack was afraid to move he heard footsteps approaching he tried to prepare himself for twins mocking smile but jacks expectations werent met when he looked up it wasnt twins face he saw it was warrens shit doc warren said you look like you fought the vietnam war all by yourself jack swallowed he looked at the other man and now recognized him as one of the basketball regulars jacks eyes darted back to warren jack was confused afraid this was all a hallucination come on doc warren said reaching a hand toward jack get the hell out of the box so we can see if the rest of you looks as bad as your face jack allowed himself to be helped to stand up he stepped out onto the floor he was soaking wet from the broken water pipes well everything else looks like its in working order warren said but you dont smell great and weve got to get these cuffs off how did you get here jack asked finally finding his voice we drove warren said howd you think we got here the subway but i expected the black kings jack said a guy by the name of twin sorry to disappoint you man warren said youve got to settle for me i dont understand jack said twin and i made a deal warren said we called a truce so thered be no more brothers shooting brothers part of the terms were that they wouldnt ice you then twin called me and told me you were being held up here and that if i wanted to save your ass id better get mine up to the mountains so here we are the cavalry good lord jack said shaking his head it was unsettling to learn how much ones fate was in the hands of others hey those people back in the house dont look so good warren said and they smell worse than you howd they happen to die influenza jack said no shit warren said so its up here too i heard about it on the news last night theres a lot of people down in the city all revved up about it and for good reason jack said i think youd better tell me what youve heard epilogue thursday pm april new york city the game to eleven was tied at ten apiece the rules dictated a win by two so a onepoint layup wouldnt clinch it but a long twopointer would this was in the back of jacks mind as he dribbled upcourt he was being mercilessly hounded by an aggressive player by the name of flash whom jack knew was faster than he the competition was fierce players on the sidelines waiting to play were loudly supporting the other team a sharp contrast to their typical studied indifference the reason for the change was the fact that jacks team had been winning all night mainly because jack was teamed up with a particularly good mix of players that included warren and spit jack normally didnt bring the ball downcourt that was warrens job but on the previous play to jacks chagrin flash had made a driving layup to tie the game and after the ball had passed through the basket it had ended up in jacks hands in order to get the ball downcourt as fast as possible spit had stepped out when jack gave him the ball spit gave it right back as jack pulled up at the top of the key warren faked one direction and then made a rush for the basket jack saw this maneuver out of the corner of his eye and cocked his arm with the intent of passing the ball to warren flash anticipated the pass and dropped back in hopes of intercepting it all at once jack was in the clear and he changed his mind about passing instead he let fly one of his normally reliable jumpers unfortunately the ball hit the back of the rim and bounced directly into flashs waiting hands the tide then swept back in the other direction to the glee of the onlookers flash brought the ball rapidly downcourt jack was intent on denying him the opportunity of repeating his driving layup but inadvertently gave him too much room to jacks surprise since flash was not an outside shooter flash pulled up and from downtown let fly his own jumper to jacks horror it was nothingbutnet as the shot passed through the basket a cheer rose up from the sidelines the game had been won by the underdogs flash highstepped around the court holding his arms straight and stiffly to his sides with his palms out all his teammates slapped his palms in a congratulatory ritual as did some of the onlookers warren drifted over to jack with a disgusted look on his face you should have passed the friggin ball warren said my bad jack said he was embarrassed hed made three mistakes in a row shit warren said with these new kicks of mine i didnt think i could lose jack looked down at the spankingnew pair of nikes warren was referring to and then at his own scuffed and scarred filas maybe i need some new kicks myself jack hey jack a female voice called out hello jack looked through the chainlink fence separating the playground from the sidewalk it was laurie hey kid warren said to jack looks like your shortie has decided to pay the courts a visit the gamewinning celebration stopped all eyes turned to laurie girlfriends and wives didnt come to the courts whether they werent inclined or whether they were actively excluded jack didnt know but the infraction of lauries unexpected arrival made him feel uncomfortable hed always tried to play by the playgrounds mostly unspoken rules i think she wants to rap warren said laurie was waving jack over i didnt invite her jack said we were supposed to meet later no problem warren said shes a looker you must be a better lover than you are a bball player jack laughed in spite of himself then walked over to laurie behind him he heard the celebration recommence and he relaxed a degree now i know the stories are all true laurie said you really do play basketball i hope you didnt see the last three plays jack said you wouldnt have guessed i played much if you had i know we werent supposed to meet until nine but i couldnt wait to talk to you laurie said whats happened jack asked you got a call from a nicole marquette from the cdc laurie said apparently she was so disappointed not to get you that marjorie the operator put her through to me nicole asked me to relay a message to you well jack questioned the cdc is officially putting the crash vaccine program on hold laurie said there hasnt been a new case of the alaskastrain influenza for two weeks the quarantine efforts have worked apparently the outbreak has been contained just the way the seventysix swine flu was thats great news jack said over the past week hed been praying that this would happen and laurie knew it after fiftytwo cases with thirtyfour deaths there had been a lull everyone involved was holding his breath did she offer any explanations as to why they think this has occurred jack asked she did laurie said their studies have shown that the virus is unusually unstable outside of a host they believe that the temperature must have varied in the buried eskimo hut and might have even approached thawing on occasion thats a far cry from the usual minus fifty degrees at which viruses are typically stored too bad it didnt affect its pathogenicity as well jack said but at least it made the cdcengineered quarantine effective laurie said which everyone knows isnt the usual case with influenza apparently with the alaska strain contacts had to have relatively sustained close contact with an infected individual for transmission to occur i think we were all very lucky jack said the pharmaceutical industry deserves a lot of credit too they came through with all the rimantadine needed in record time are you finished playing basketball laurie asked she looked over jacks shoulder and could see that another game had commenced im afraid so jack said my team lost thanks to me is that man you were talking with when i arrived warren laurie asked thats right jack said hes just as you described laurie said he looks impressive but theres one thing i dont understand how do those shorts of his stay on they are so oversized and he has such narrow hips jack let out a laugh he looked back at warren casually shooting foul shots like a machine the funny thing was that laurie was right warrens shorts defied newtons law of gravity jack was just so accustomed to the hiphop gear hed never questioned it i guess its a mystery to me too jack said youll have to ask him yourself okay laurie said agreeably id like to meet him anyway jack turned back to her with a quizzical look im serious she said id like to meet this man you are in awe of and who saved your life dont ask him about his drawers jack cautioned he had no idea how that would go over please laurie said i do have some social sense jack called out to warren and waved him over warren sauntered to the fence dribbling his basketball jack was unsure of the situation and didnt know what to expect he introduced the two people and to his surprise they got along well its probably not my place to say this laurie began after they had spoken for a while and jack might wish i didnt but jack cringed he had no idea what laurie was about to say id like to thank you personally for what you did for jack warren shrugged i might not have taken my ride all the way up there if i knew he wasnt going to pass me the ball tonight jack formed his hand into a semifist and cuffed the top of warrens head warren flinched and ducked out of the way nice meeting you laurie he said im glad you stopped by me and some of the other brothers have been a bit worried about the old man here were glad to see that he has a shortie after all whats a shortie laurie asked girlfriend jack translated come anytime laurie warren said you sure are betterlooking than this kid he took a swipe at jack and then dribbled back to where hed been shooting foul shots shortie for girlfriend laurie questioned its just raptalk jack said shortie is a lot more flattering than some of the terms but youre not supposed to take any of it literally dont get me wrong i wasnt offended laurie said in fact why dont you ask him and his shortie to come to dinner with us id like to get to know him better jack shrugged and looked back at warren thats an idea he said i wonder if hed come youll never know unless you ask laurie said i cant argue with you there jack said i assume he has a girlfriend laurie said to tell you the truth i dont know jack said you mean to tell me you were quarantined with the man for a week and you dont even know if he has a girlfriend laurie said what did you men talk about all that time i cant remember jack said hold on ill be right back jack walked over to warren and asked him if hed come to dinner with them and bring his shortie that is if you have one jack added of course i have one warren said he stared at jack for a beat then looked over at laurie was it her idea yeah jack admitted but i think its a good one the reason i never asked in the past is because i never thought youd come where a restaurant called elios on the east side jack said at nine its my treat cool warren said how you getting over there i suppose well take a taxi from my place jack said no need warren said my rides handy ill pick you up at quarter of nine see you then jack said he turned and started back toward laurie this doesnt mean im not still pissed that you didnt pass me the ball on that last run warren called out jack smiled and waved over his shoulder when he got back to laurie he told her that warren was coming wonderful laurie said i agree jack said ill be dining with two of the four people who saved my life where are the other two laurie asked unfortunately slam is no longer with us jack said regretfully thats a story i have yet to tell you spit is the fellow over on the sidelines in the bright red sweatshirt why not ask him to dinner too laurie suggested another night jack said id rather this not be a party im looking forward to the conversation you learned more about warren in two minutes than ive learned in months ill never understand what you men talk about laurie said listen ive got to shower and dress jack said do you mind coming up to my place not at all laurie said im kind of curious the way youve described it its not pretty jack warned lead on laurie commanded jack was pleased there were no homeless people asleep in the hall of his tenement but to make up for that blessing the endless argument on the second floor was as loud as ever nevertheless laurie didnt seem to mind and had no comment until they were safely inside jacks apartment there she glanced around and said it looked warm and comfortable like an oasis itll only take me a few minutes to get ready jack said can i offer you something actually i dont have much how about a beer laurie declined and told jack to go ahead and shower he tried to give her something to read but she declined that as well i dont have a tv jack said apologetically i noticed laurie said in this building a tv is too much of a temptation jack said it would walk out of here too fast talking about tv laurie said have you seen those national health commercials everyone is talking about the no wait ones no i havent jack said you should laurie said theyre amazingly effective one of them has become an overnight classic its the one with the tag line we wait for you you dont wait for us its very clever if you can believe it its even caused national healths stock to go up could we talk about something else jack said of course laurie said she cocked her head to the side whats the matter did i say something wrong no its not you its me jack said sometimes im overly sensitive medical advertising has always been a pet peeve of mine and lately i feel even more strongly about it but dont worry ill explain it later
