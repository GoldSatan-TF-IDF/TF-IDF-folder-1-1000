jeff abbott do unto others it was really rude of beta harcher to argue with me right before she got killed downright inconsiderate if you want my opinion the woman acted like she had a tollfree line to jesus so youd think she would have had forewarning of her fate plus she went on her tirade in front of folks which caused me all sorts of grief later fortunately im not a man to complain about the lack of trump cards that life deals you the day she died was a typically humid sunny spring day in central texas id been running an errand and i was in a cussing mood when i got back to the library you see coming back from the pharmacy where id bought mamas medicine id tripped over a damn baseball bat some kid had left in the small ballpark next to the libraryand id nearly planted my face in the grass i picked up the bat looking around for a batless kid but didnt see the owner i figured whatever little billy joe or bobby jack had lost his equipment would come wailing about it soon enough so i took the bat inside the mirabeau public library was its usual hub of activity shelves of dusty unread books made a place scintillate i walked in nodded to some of the regulars winked at a couple of the pretty ladies and dumped the bat into my little office behind the checkout counter i surveyed the library in mirabeau threes literally a crowd so we had ourselves a horde that morning old men sat in the periodical section slowly scanning the papers and frowning over progress a couple of bookminded youths from the high school fed their spring break reading habits in the sciencefiction section in the most distant corner of the library the gossipy ladies of the eula mae quiff literary society led by the one and only eula mae herself quietly pretended to discuss the latest offerings in romance literature while chatting about their neighbors all in all a quiet group idling away several hours in the coolness of the books and avoiding the smothering spring humidity im not usually found at the checkout counter but since i didnt have a staff i didnt have much choice the last chief librarian the muchloved miss eugenia pollard had died three months earlier and her staff had departed for greener pastures one had taken a job as chief librarian in nearby bavary the other had gone off to be a country singer in houston i of course was the one left warbling the bluesalthough their departures had left the job available for me my assistant candace tully was only halftime and was at a dentists appointment this afternoon the only advantage was i didnt have a staff continually pointing out how everything had been done under the golden touch of miss eugenia my own library experience had been ten years earlier working parttime in college at the fondren library at rice university so id brought a certain flexibility to the work flexible meaning that i often didnt know what the hell i was doing and just rolled with the punches fending off my desire for a cigarette with a wad of juicy fruit gum i sat behind the counter and unfolded my many folders one was of resumes and applications for my unfilled staff one was a grant request i was working on to the us department of education to get money for a literacy program another folder held the layout for our monthly newsletter much of it devoted to childrens activities and the last contained a request from the mayor my boss to take a look at the library rules and policy since miss eugenia hadnt updated that particular document since reconstruction i attacked the resumes first the sooner i got help the much less stressful my days would be it was the juicy fruit that caused the commotion beta harcher resented folks sinning right in front of her and since i was chewing gum and not reading religious literature i raised betas ire i knew she was standing there for a full minute waiting for me to look at her so i kept my eyes lowered it didnt work mr poteet she snapped not bothering to modulate her voice that irritates me after all it is a library i try to keep the noise down even if most of my patrons are hard of hearing im a librarian now although not by training and my respect for the profession has grown by leaps and bounds i looked up at her she was in her early fortiesbut carrying all the sins and worries of her neighbors had aged her once she might have had a delicate dolllike face now lines of worry and pinched anger marred her forehead and cheeks shots of gray streaked her thick dark hair id wondered what kind of body might be lurking below her frumpy clothes it was hard to tell beneath the dark shapeless jackets and the bible she constantly clutched to her bosom her blue eyes gleamed with shiny repressed indignation i suspected her righteousness was going to be all over me like white on rice i popped my gum and picked up the book stamp as though i expected beta to actually check out a book instead of lighting a bonfire underneath one i saw the hardback novel beta held in her quavering hand goodness miz harcher i smiled my public relations smile i didnt know you liked english literature this isnt literature mister this book is obscene women in love by d h lawrence oh miz harcher thats a classic i gently tried to take the book from her hands but she wouldnt let go she didnt want to miss a chance to wrestle with satan classic smut you mean she slapped a familiar piece of paper on the counter the last sixteen times shed done this id sighed now i fumed whats this i asked all innocence another request for reconsideration of material beta smiled i glanced at the form she had filled one out for lawrences women in love just as she had for books by mark twain jay mcinerney raymond chandler nathaniel hawthorne alice walker and others were openminded folks in the new south no matter what the media might have you believe if you object to something in the mirabeau library you can fill out one of these requests for reconsideration we didnt get them often at least we hadnt until beta went on her emptytheshelves campaign i scanned her latest report written in her creepy thin handwriting no she admitted she hadnt read the whole book it liked to make me gag so i couldnt finish the godless trash her estimation of the main idea of the material was innovative promote sex outside of marriage and in her judgment the book would have a deleterious effect on the youth of mirabeau its liable to make them want to fornicate before they get halfway through i leaned back in my chair id had enough of this harassment look miz harcher i know my rights jordan poteet talking to you isnt going to satisfy my complaint you got to call a meeting of the materials review committee i groaned if someone files a request and i cant resolve the problem i have to call a meeting of the mrc which consists of me naturally the chairman of the library board and another member of the board beta had demanded sixteen meetings thus far and hadnt gotten one book off the shelves i decided to try polite reason with her miz harcher no one considers lawrence obscene these days why you can go to the big universities in austin and college station and they teach him there this academic recommendation didnt sway beta harcher she flipped open the book to a passage of dire sin shed marked with her bony blamepointing finger she lectured me like she was calling fire down to the pulpit not to mention that the title itself suggests unnatural acts but listen to this the thought of love marriage and children and a life lived together in the horrible privacy of domestic andhere she puckered her sour faceconnubial satisfaction was repulsive she glared at me this book is antifamily i sighed miz harcher hadnt consulted noah webster on what connubial meant but it sounded decadent enough to warrant her attention her harangue riveted everybody i could see old man renfro and my other elderly regulars look up from their reading eula mae quiff and her groupies watched more interested in local passions than those described in the bodice rippers they discussed gaston leach stuck his head out from behind the sciencefiction stack ogling the scene through his bottlethick lenses ruth wills a local nurse glanced up from the card catalog biggest crowd in the mirabeau library in three days beta loved an audience id seen her poking around the shelves the past couple of days sniffing out depravity and now shed made her move and you know chewing gums not allowed in the library jordy poteet beta harcher added taking on all transgressions in her immediate vicinity im trying to quit smoking i explained hoping for a little mercy and as the librarian i allow what i like in this library i tried to puff out a bubble to piss her off but juicy fruits not built for blowing the city council might argue with that beta shook the offending volume of lawrence in my face if the city councilors want to fire me they can women in love is not obscene miz harcher she pulled out her big censorship gun oh really mr poteet i think the godfearing folks of mirabeaud like to know what else goes on in this book she leaned her face close to mine and i could smell her unpleasant breath probably chewing brimstone as a mint men wrestling in the nude together she enunciated the words carefully making sure i understood their import yes the two men in the book wrestle it shows their friendship i explained patiently they dont have sex my twentiethcentury brit lit professor surely wouldve found beta a challenging pupil why dont you really read the book miz harcher you might find it interesting i dont have time for such smut no i said knowing that folks were watching but you do have time to come in here make a scene disturb the other patrons and in general make a nuisance of yourself i dont appreciate your tone jordy poteet she set her lips tightly glaring at me and i dont appreciate yours miz harcher i had grown tired of her stunts since my victory over her two months ago at a library board meeting i stood hoping to look tough at my height of six feet two i didnt think itd work ive been told repeatedly that my blond hair and green eyes make me look too boyish to scare anyone but infants ill remind you that you were thrown off the library board because of your censorship stance if you dont want to read the book dont read it no one is hogtying you down and forcing you to read mr lawrence but dont expect you can come into this library and dictate to others whats available to them this tactic of continually filing complaints this trash undermines peoples souls good god miz dont you take our lords name in vain she shrieked you could have heard a page turn in the silence but no one in the library was reading anymore not with betas soulsaving floor show playing hardly anyone checks out that book i lowered my voice rather than lowering myself to her level very few souls are at risk i hated all the eyes that were suddenly on me id felt that way ever since id come home to mirabeau and i still wasnt comfortable with it i cant stand pity maybe we can step into my office and discuss this request for reconsideration i considered that a perfectly reasonable suggestion so i was awfully surprised when she slapped me with women in love she belted that book right across my face not a love tap but an honesttogod blow and jesus made that woman strong my head whipped around and the ceiling lights flared in my eyes i felt my lip split and there was a wetness on my nose that i was sure was blood the carpet felt rough against my hands and i realized i was kneeling on the floor knocked clear out of my chair i saw my wad of gum stuck on my office door i glanced up at beta harcher she smiled as pleased with herself as a child with a new toy her eyes were two shiny pebbles cold and stony screams erupted from the eula mae quiffers gaston leach ducked back into the space operas and fantasy novels old man renfro creaked out of his chair arthritically trying to hurry to my defense ruth wills beat him to it she ran over and grabbed betas arm let me go beta squawked as though ruth were a demon wresting her from the lords work ruth pulled the book from betas clutches and tossed it on the counter i think youd better go baiteye youve caused enough trouble the look beta gave ruth wills held pure venom you watch your mouth missy youre a sinner too you have no right youve just assaulted mr poteet ruth interrupted coolly in front of witnesses i like ruth shes one of mirabeaus nicest residents shes also a lovely brunette with a figure a boy could doze against and die happy he could press charges against you and no one here would blame him you better leave beta eula mae quiff herself had come up behind them keeping the younger ruth as a buffer between her and our local zealot eula mae is fond of bead necklaces and she nervously fingered one of the several around her throat as she watched beta that smut hes offering our youngs no better than that trash you write eula mae beta snarled all that sexand women living independently from gods plan my fans judge it otherwise eula mae sniffed she swirled her colorful robelike dress to emphasize her point i thought she might take a bow gods the final judge beta stared down at me like a dog eyeing a pork chop ill close this pit of lies god will help me beta stop it an unexpected ally had appeared tamma hufnagel the baptist ministers wife she had come up behind eula mae beta was one of their flock but tammas young face looked pained this is not the way to conduct our lords work hush beta ordered poor tamma clammed up abruptly back on my feet i grabbed a tissue and wiped the blood from my nose and mouth i poked at my nose experimentally it didnt shift into a new shape so i decided it wasnt broken i was still in shock that this woman had whacked me she looked so harmless until she opened her ornery mouth why couldnt she have assaulted me with a nice thin booksay of mice and men no the final judge is over in the courthouse i reached for the phone you get out and lay off the library or ill call junebug moncrief and have your godfearing self hauled into jail i couldnt resist and i shouldve you think st peterll be impressed with your having a record when you approach those pearly gates he might just put you on the down elevator youre burning in tell not me beta announced pulling away from ruths grasp she straightened with righteous dignity ill leave although im not afraid to go to jail i have the lords work to do today she cast a baleful eye over the stunned silent faces in the library yall remember that i have the lords work to do i wondered if i was the only one on betas holy hit list i leaned across the counter and jabbed my finger in her face tempting her to take a bite fine you poor misguided woman go make trouble for someone else this may be a public facility but you are damned unwelcome here if you bother me or anyone at the library again i will press charges you cant punish me you judge me not though god is judging you her voice hardened and it amazes me still that there could be so much spite in that frumpy form hes judging you mr knowitall jordy poteet thats why your mother is the way she is you shut up i yelled get out dead silence in the stacks those dark deadened eyes stared into mine i fought back a sudden primitive urge to spit in her face yes i do have a bad temper and beta saw shed gone too far she didnt flinch away but ruth hustled her out into the spring beat i could hear beta protesting the whole way threatening ruth with various fundamentalist punishments i could only imagine what special levels of gehenna she reserved for me i slumped into my chair my hands shook i was ten years younger and a foot taller than beta harcher but her words rattled me more than her punch i admit it i couldve throttled herjust for a momentwhen she made that crack about my mother whack me with books all you like but leave my family alone the bleeding stopped but i kept dabbing my nostrils with the tissue the bluehaired crowd headed straight for me gabbing with their henhouse tongues the eula mae quiffers examined me carefully and assured that i was okay offered their opinions on beta shes addled said one lady poor dear just takes the bible too literally opined a more pious woman who had not been battered with a book recently i cant believe she struck you added another disappointed that my nose was intact what a bitch eula mae commented shes the closest thing to a celebrity mirabeau hasa romance novelist known to her fans by the nom de plume jocelyn lushe i have nothing against romancesi could probably use one in my lifebut eula mae gets inordinate amounts of local adoration for her prose i can only take so many heaving bosoms and smoldering loins per page and eula mae isnt big on setting limits mousy tamma hufnagel watched me carefully miz harchers upset about being kicked off the library board jordy shes just awful tetchy about civic morals she means well no she doesnt mrs hufnagel i answered shes a lunatic and theyre usually not concerned with the public good i watched ruth come back into the library without beta i could just kill that old biddy dont you listen to beta harcher jordy dorcas witherspoon one of my mothers friends took my hand shes a bitter fool shes unhappy so she wants everyone to be that way we dont care if you keep smutty books you know all i read here is the houston paper for hints from heloise please ladies im fine i assured them i sighed i guess mrs hufnagels right betas just mad she got kicked off the library board shell just find someone else in mirabeau to terrorize that unfortunately didnt happen the good lord decided i suppose that he needed beta harcher at his right hand a far sight earlier than any of us reckoned the rest of the afternoon passed without divine retribution for keeping d h lawrence on the library shelves at six i closed up and drove past the wellkept homes and fake antique light posts on bluebonnet street mirabeau is texas old founded in during the republic days but i figure the powers that be dont think it looks quaint enough for antique buyers and city folks looking to move to the country so theyve started adding dickensian touches such as victorian light posts and wroughtiron benches on the major streets in town we natives try not to mind it doesnt take more than ten minutes to get anywhere in mirabeau and getting home takes me all of two minutes i veered left onto lee street drove down a block to blossom street and stared up at the neat twostory frame house id grown up in and recently returned to did it look smaller or was it that i was just bigger and wiser i couldnt tell i went inside and found my mother walking in circles around the cozy living room she does that more and more now shuffling along in her slippers and robe i suppose its a nice room to orbit mama just has to navigate a wicker sofa and an oval polished wood coffee table with a fan of southern living back issues spread across it normally i would have steered mama to a chair and told her to sit down but i had a throbbing headache this was not the life id ever planned on coming home to so i sat down and watched mama for a few minutes she was intent on some journey of her own and she made for good quiet company our quality time together didnt last long youre not being much help jordy letting her do that my sister arlene muttered as she walked in from the kitchen i could smell the wonderful aroma of blackeyed peas and chickenfried steaks sister i never call her arlene unless im really mad at her flared me a look as hot as her skillets she took mamas arm and aimed her toward a chair mama a lock of her blondishgray hair straying into her face sat unprotestingly and looked at me as though unsure of who i was jordy she announced finally in the same tone shed used to reproach me for mouthing off as a youngster that was a relief in her mind for the past two days id been her longdead brother walter and it was nice to be back among the living eula mae called and told me what happened at the library sister said with that tone she gawked at my busted lip so much for my three minutes of peace which was my daily allowance at home i guess youd like to get fired from that library sister observed archly going back into the kitchen with a toss of her blonde hair i can always count on sister for loving support that way you could just go back to boston and your precious little publishing job and never mind mama my throat tightened im still not used to mama its hard to go away from home leaving your mother full and vital and smart and return to find her mind eroding like a clay bank on a flooded creek i got up and followed sister into the kitchen why are you pissed today you have a fight with bubba bubba jasper owned a truck stop called the near end on highway where sister cooked gods food like chickenfried steaks enchiladas and pecan pies she worked from eight at night till four in the morning came home and slept till ten when i went to the library she hated that schedule and i wasnt that crazy about it either but it kept one of us at home most of the time i took care of mama at night sister handled her during the day i suspected bubba gladly gave sister that shift to discourage competing suitors bubba needed any advantage he could muster never mind bubba sisters rosebud mouth pouted she poked at the simmering blackeyed peas with a stained wooden spoon she was so pretty when we were kids id been jealous of sisters popularity in school id spent most of my academic career in the mirabeau public schools as arlene poteets little brother it wasnt a bad label having a popular sister helped no end in the date department whats wrong i asked ii think you resent me jordy you havent been much help with mama this past week i had a reply ready as usual with sister but i stopped she really looked sad staring down into the warming vegetables shed pulled her thick blonde hair back from her face and it made her look older and tired her features were still striking with high cheekbones and clear green eyes i think you resent me cause i brought you back here you didnt bring me back sister i chose to come back no you didnt weve been playing this guilt game long enough i made you feel guilty about being up north and now you wont let me put mama in a nursing home sister looked up from her bare feet no i wont put mama in a home i hoped we wouldnt have this argument again im not going through what we went through with papaw again i set my teeth i remember walking out of my grandfathers nursinghome room while he sobbed as we left him just the memory makes my heart clench you hador havethe money to put mama in a good place and she wont know the difference her mind is going jordy yesterday she thought i was aunt sally visiting from houston she kept asking if i was going to vote for harry truman i always try to find the bright side of bad times at least she knows its an election year i bit down on my swollen lip as soon as i said it surprised at myself sister wasnt amused sometimes she doesnt even remember mark and thats hard for him her own grandchild the money isnt the issue sister yes it is you have it and i dont thats how it is jordy and has been for years and you accuse me of resenting you listen to yourself she shrugged maybe i do resent you mr big book editor living up north and making money to burn she shook her head and laughed her drawly little giggle that annoyed me when we were growing up youre really using that fancy college degree arent you stacking books back at the mirabeau library look running a librarys not easy you know that was the only job i could find here connected with books you care more about books than you do me she snapped god i have my own life to live and i have mark to raise you could give me the money and keep mama from being such a godawful burden to me yes i could i suppose but i wont i wont have mama in a home she needs us not strangers in uniforms its not your choice to ruin my life and marks too its my money i answered not adding that there wasnt a lot of my money left im sorry you feel this way you dont have to help with mama ill move her into a place of my own and get daytime help while im at the library you dont have to have a damn thing to do with her and let you have all that moral superiority let people here think i dont care about mama as much as you do forget it public opinion in mirabeau still mattered to sister left over from her cheerleader days im sure then quit complaining i spoke more sharply than i intended but the strain of quarreling with her showed dinnerll be ready in about ten minutes sister went into her monotone please set the table all right i didnt want to argue any more i set the table quickly and haphazardly flinging the silverware and plates down like i was dealing cards sister twitched at the noise but didnt look up from the cream gravy she stirred would you please go find mark i turned and went i stumbled out the front door into the fading spring sunshine the evening was still warm and hazy with moisture spring had been rainy mirabeau is the lush dark deep green that always surprises folks whove based their visions of texas on john wayne movies that were shot in dusty brown arizona the oak trees pregnant with leaves shook in the twilight breeze above my head the crepe myrtles were short explosions of pink scattering their blossoms on the air i leaned against my blue and gray chevy blazer and looked out down lee street across front yards that were maintained like badges of honor yardswhether front or backusually arent divided by fences in mirabeau and the residential streets dont have curbs the grass just goes straight into the neighbors yards and into the street when i was little this whole neighborhood was my playground but now i felt like i was trespassing what was i doing here id bolted at age eighteen swearing to never come back twelve years later and here i was i scanned the street my nephew mark was down a few houses talking with a neighbors kid mark supper time he waved back almost begrudgingly maybe sister was right was i controlling her and marks life by insisting that we take care of mama at home i didnt feel in control mamas disease was it dictated and governed every aspect of our lives id given up a life id loved being a social sciences editor for a prestigious textbook publisher in boston id acquired authors negotiated contracts planned marketing campaigns to storm college campuses nationwide it had been decent money and a lot of fun now i was back at my lifes square one because i didnt want my mother in a nursing home logical arent i i couldnt blame sister for being mad if she blamed mamas condition for running her life she thought i was making it worse shed wanted money to put mama in a nursing home over in la grange she didnt have the money hadnt had anything except mark since her rodeosmitten husband had abandoned her five years ago and headed to parts unknown i had headed for parts unimaginable new england but sisterd had my phone number i stood in the carport staring at the modest house id grown up in it was built at the turn of the century and had belonged to my fathers uncle who died widowed and childless two stories white with plenty of blueshuttered windows across the front to let in light and maybe neighbors peering eyes the porch was wood and held two white wicker chairs that shouldve held mama and daddy sister and i sat there and moped these days we hadnt kept up the house as daddy had it had been his pride and joy but we took the house for granted mark trimmed the yard and tended the flower beds but the house needed a paint job especially across the front porch i knew i should get it taken care of but i was wary of spending money in front of sister every cent i wasted on other expenses was a cent that could help lift the burden of our mother from our shoulders if only daddy had been as thoughtful about insurance as he was about lawn care the average yearly cost of nursing home care in this country is thirty thousand bucks it tends to be one of those facts you dont bother with till your mothers walking in circles drooling on her chin and thinking youre her long dead brother walter my investments and savings couldnt bear that assault part of me didnt want mama in a home and the other part of me didnt want my savings flying away so quickly i couldnt tell sister my financial woes she thought my college education resulted in an instantly swollen bank account she wouldnt believe me if i told her i didnt have the money to keep mama in a home for years of alzheimers contrary to popular belief publishing is not a gold mine mark swaggered up to me like only a thirteenyearold can he doesnt even have the grace to look like a poteetnot that its his fault hes tall and rangy like us but thats about it where sister and i are fairhaired and greeneyed like both our parents mark is dark and just looks like trouble hes the spitting image of his daddy the aforementioned rider from responsibility even wearing silvery round glasses he looks like a rebel i never managed that in my youth i hate to interrupt your cramped social schedule but suppers on i said usually i tease mark but arguing with sister had soured my mood mark surveyed me with eyes older than the rest of him you and mom have been fighting over mamaw again what are you psychic i put my arm around his shoulder and steered him toward the house i dont know why you two just dont accept mamaw for how she is she aint getting better isnt i automatically corrected we walked into the living room where mama sat chatting chirpily with shadows mark waved his arms in front of her face no ones here mamaw nobody but us she looked at him hurt turning her face away she pressed the back of her hand to her pinched mouth i took mark by the arm and shuffled him into the kitchen must you argue with her hes a good kid but i wondered if the strain of our difficult domestic situation was wearing on him nothin to argue about with mamaw an argument takes two people armed with opinions or facts mamaws lacking both dont be disrespectful mark mark smacked his chewing gum in a most impertinent teenage fashion i do wonder where he gets it you know uncle jordy i dont see disrespect in facing up to mamaw going out of her head i opened the fridge got out a pitcher of iced tea and slammed the door youre too young to understand mamas not exactly going out of her head who was i kidding i was mad at mark for saying exactly what i thought i think theres going to be a vacancy sign hung up real soon mark muttered as sister came back in needless to say the rest of the meal did not go well little family squabbles over the sanity of the clan matriarch do not make for carefree dinner conversation mark huffed off to his room to read as i said the boy is not entirely without redeeming features sister pouted again and left for the near end and the company of bubba and i sat watching tv with mama i think the vapid sitcom made as much sense to her as it did to me i started reading an old copy of eudora weltys short stories disturbed only by mamas occasional gigglealong with the laugh track as automatic and sad as a last breath it was ten oclock and i was putting on the news from channel out of austin when the phone rang and my life turned left jordy it was sister hows mama fine i answered sister thinks she takes better care of mama than i do did you give her her haldol sister asked and i slapped my forehead crap id gotten the prescription filled and my confrontation with beta harcher had driven the pills right out of my mind i glanced over at mama she looked wide awake our family doctor prescribed haldol for her restless nights so common in alzheimers patients um yeah just about to give it to her i fibbed id left the pills in my office at the library well sister didnt need to know about my slight dereliction of duty i could run down to the library and be back with sister none the wiser okay ill see you in the morning then there was the barest hint of reconciliation in her voice fine bye i hung up mama was watching the television and had turned the volume to a murmur the way she liked it now i went to the stairs in the entry way and called up to mark im heading off to the library for a second ill be right back come down and sit with mama please as i went out the door i heard the shuffle of his feet as he descended the stairs i got in my blazer and headed down lee street driving past mirabeaus little city park i could have turned onto bluebonnet then but a bit of curiosity as to what was going on in town steered me past the park toward mayne street spelled that way because some founding mother didnt want mirabeau to copy every other small town in america it had been the same growing up herethe hope that something fascinating might be going on if you just went around town to find it the night had cooled some but the air felt wet with unfallen spring rain distant thunder rumbled faintly toward austin and the hill country i scanned the clouded skies for lightning but the night was dark and still theres no long drive around mirabeau if you head north of mayne you get the lovely quiet neighborhoods i grew up in if you head south of mayne you go through the small business district stores stand in sturdy brick buildings that have survived tornado flood and modern architectureand proudly have their dates of dedication carved in the crests on their highest usually third floors past the business district is a small railroad yard and beyond are the mix of trailer parks ramshackle shacks and small but tidy homes that make up the poor part of town the railway also divides mirabeau by color an unofficial segregation marked by the nightly whistle of the train complete your circle and you run smack dab into a gentle curve of the colorado river where mirabeau and its few thousand souls sit the colorado was swollen with spring rain and with my window down i could smell the faint but pungent odors of muddy river and decay mayne was as dead as a street could be a scattering of cars squatted at hubbards grocery and some highschool kids sat on the back of a pickup truck in the dairy queen parking lot watching the world not go by i sighed and made a left onto loeber street away from the business district i wasnt missing anything by not going straight to the library and then straight home this wasnt boston the library was at the intersection of loeber and bluebonnet and sat dark and solid in the night were lucky in mirabeau the library is a handsome building built only ten years ago made of solid brick and native granite from the hill country modern materials shaped into oldstyle architecture the words public library city of mirabeau were carved into granite above the front doors and at night a light shone on the words like a beacon of knowledge beautiful ancient live oaks stood guardian around the building i pulled the blazer up to the entrance the library doesnt rate a parking lot you have to park either on loeber or bluebonnet or in the little lot next to the small softball field or maybe in the little tatty apartment complex thats down loeber as we never have a crowd we never have a parking problem i fumbled for my keys unlocked the door and threw on the lights same old place i thought i walked past the dedication plaque past the new neoncolored posters my assistant candace had hung to encourage kids in the summer reading program past the newarrivals bin to the checkout counter i opened my office door turned on the light and found mamas pills in my desk drawer pocketing them i turned off my office light and closed the door i pausedand to this day i dont know why something was wrong a prickle ran along my neck like a ghosts fingernail i looked across the wide doors and the stacks of books there was only the gentle hum of automatic airconditioning comforting to any modern texan i wandered from the checkout counter to the childrens section glancing around like a determined shopper at the bargain mall everything seemed in place it felt like someone was watching me i took a deep shuddering breath i was being silly a long day with beta harcher and my mother had gotten to me i looked around again shrugged off my exhaustion turned out the lights and locked up i got into my car and drove up bluebonnet back to my mindnumbed mother and my sarcastic nephew and the next morning all holy hell broke loose there are so many ifs in this world if i hadnt forgotten mamas pills if i hadnt fought with beta harcher the day before if beta had never found her own personal jesus and the biggest if of all if mama had never gotten sick and brought me home to all this rotten lying deceit and death but theres really no point in articulating your ifs even once i learned that the hard way i got to the library about am parking per my custom right in front i always want the city council to know that im on the job theyre functional illiterates but they might wander by the library by mistake my assistant candace tully arrived as i did pulling her teal mercedes up behind my blazer candace is a real piece of work shes mirabeaus youngest professional volunteer and everyones just real worried that she hasnt gotten married yet her daddy owns five banks in central texas and her mama owns six so candace is not one for regular gainful employment aside from her parttime library work she serves the mirabeau historical society the various county daughter associations of the republic of texas the confederacy and the american revolution and has actually been sighted escorting elderly ladies across the street everyone admires candace tully and shes been a constant pain in my butt since i got the chief librarian job candace was on a husbandhunting safari and i was big game if she wasnt so cute ignoring her would be easy as pie candace sidled up to me as if we were in a smoky bar and i had the last cigarette today she was sporting a navy silk blouse creamcolored pants and a colorful paisley scarf pinned to her shoulder with a fetching drape she looked real nice i wasnt nearly as appealing in faded jeans cowboy boots an old pair id hardly ever worn living in massachusetts and a blue chambray shirt i got out of the car and candace nearly strained her neck looking up at me maybe shes fivefootthree on a hot day she brushed her brown hair out of her blue eyes and examined me critically i heard about your little encounter with beta harcher she said severely and i cant believe shed wallop you she patted my bruised cheek i shrugged not a big deal really i wish id been there to punch her lights out candace grimaced digging in her purse for her library keys i peered down into the chaos you got mace in there i can borrow in case she comes back candace grinned i imagine you took care of yourself didnt need to all the ladies came to my defense her eyes flashed up at me shes a looker but she tries too hard and dating a coworker is a recipe for disaster ill bet they did candace retorted i couldnt resist teasing her especially ruth wills she mustve worked in an asylum once she manhandled ol beta hmmph i hope her bedside manners better than that candace muttered then shot me a look to imply i best not know anything about ruth wills and beds candace plied me with questions as we opened up the library and went about our usual chores she checked the afterhours drop for any returned books and i went to the back room to brew some coffee we cant drink beverages out on the library floor so we keep a little fridge with cokes and a mr coffee in a back storage room i usually manage to sneak a cup to my office and ive seen candace sip a diet dr pepper then hide the can in her file cabinet at the checkout counter were fairly hardened criminals at the library i walked in front of the checkout counter past the childrens section and past the stairs that went up to the public room that civic groups sometimes used for their meetings i thought of my feeling of unease last night when i was alone in the stacks and decided i was being silly my complacency lasted all of the four seconds it took to reach the storage room my eyes registered muddy footprints on the carpet near the back door and i frowned wondering what idiot had tracked in mud i opened the storage room door and saw beta harchers body lying across the tile floor i wanted to yell but my throat didnt work and instead i just leaned soundlessly against the open door i could hear candace humming a favorite garth brooks tune of hers and it sounded as small and as distant as a crickets hum in a summer night i never associated baseball bats with evil to me they were just thick sticks of wood lying in the grass of the backyard youd sling a bat over a shoulder and walk down to the weedy field at the elementary school where for a while you and your friends could forget about schoolwork parents and bossy big sisters bats were tokens of boyhood and of a game that i never excelled at but loved to play they appeared from my closet early in the spring usually around march when the rains abated and retired after another season of service when i went back to school to me bats represented happiness an innocence that i had before i left mirabeau to venture beyond river and highway the bat id found yesterday and left in my office was next to beta harchers body i could see one huge bruise about an inch above the imaginary line between left eye and left ear from what i was told later she probably didnt suffer her left eye was swollen shut her heart mustve kept pushing blood into her brain and the pressure of that blood inflated her tissues before she breathed her last susurration of air i saw blood and hair but not much of either on the flared end of the bat specks of blood dotted the floor by her head my voice asserted itself and i screamed candace she came running like a jackrabbit on fire i felt her arm close around mine and her harsh shudder of air she pulled me away from the door my god candace gasped miss harcher how what happened shes dead i think i pulled away from candace stepped back into the room and put my fingertips to betas neck her throat was as cool and still as a winter day i leaned back howand whywas beta harcher dead in my library i stared at her again as if expecting her to raise her battered head and provide an answer the only other item to register in my mind was her clothing she was wearing a black turtleneck a black skirt black pantyhose and black shoes shed always dressed frumpy but now she looked like a new york bohemian poet tarblack mud caked her shoes and i saw tracks of mud on the floor i turned and grabbed candaces arm i pulled her away from the room and headed for the phone at the checkout counter dialing i wondered how the hell beta harcher had gotten into the library and thats when i remembered my creepy sensation of being observed last night mirabeau isnt accustomed to murder our streets are eerily quiet of violent death last year thered only been one murder in all of bonaparte county and thatd been in the county seat of bavary a fight in a pool hall had suddenly turned into a stabbing and a man who didnt speak much english coughed up his life on the smooth green felt of a billiard table i couldnt remember a murder in town at all until sister reminded me of when buell godkin got stinking drunk and blasted his brother to kingdom come thatd been years ago women dont die from blows to the head in mirabeau they die of seditious disease of bodies that have weathered years and are simply ready to rest of the little death that lurks in too many beer bottles of reckless driving or maybe of just loneliness when they are left solitary after decades of marriage and their husband lies cold in the ground or in my mothers case theyll die because their minds will eventually vanish and nothing will remain to motivate the breath and the heartbeat not even lifes most secret sacred memories our chief of police junebug moncrief arrived quickly with the coroner and an attitude of outrage that such an event had taken place in his town candace was outside directing the ambulance and moving her mercedes out of the way and i was guarding the body i dont know why it just seemed the proper thing to do i wished for a blanket to cover beta one stony blue eye was open and i hated the way it stared blankly at the ceiling as though pleading with the powers above for kind judgment and resurrection junebug stormed in with one of his officers nodded sternly at me and glanced in at the body jesus bitchin christ he said which im sure miss harcher would not have appreciated the other officer a youngster with cropped red hair fidgeted sweatily as he loaded film his eyes darted between the camera and betas corpse while his fingers fumbled with the controls i wanted to assure him shed hold her pose but i thought itd be ungentlemanly junebug waved me off go outside jordy and just sit dont let anyone else come in here cept the paramedics i know its a burden but dont open your mouth either librarys closed for today okay you and i and miss tullyll all talk in a minute i nodded wordlessly and went outside grateful for the scents of wildflowers and fresh air the air in the library had taken on a dense quality i didnt like candace fretted as she watched the paramedics tumble a portable gurney from the ambulance she opened the door for the two men and they rushed in they dont have to be in a hurry i said and then thought what a rotten comment that was how jordy how did she get in here who killed her why candace hissed in a whisper shaking her head in disbelief i took candaces hand and sat down with her on the front step i told her junebug said for us to wait outside and hed come talk to us she nodded her normally permanent perkiness blanched away the wait was awful i guess they have to take pictures and examine the body some before they move it and secure the area whatever that means i held candaces hand and thought about all the energy that had been in beta harcher energy enough to make scenes in libraries whack grown men and be so sure of her own lightness all of that life vanished with one solid blow i felt my breakfast shift uncertainly in my belly i stuck my face into the next breeze that blew and felt better it was sad that meteorologically this was shaping up to be a fine day folks wandered over to the ambulance some from homes and some from the small businesses near bluebonnet in a town that is populated mostly by senior citizens you get used to seeing ambulances idling in the road losing an elder is of course mourned but not unexpected however the library isnt usually where people expire so there was curiosity old man renfro our most loyal patron arrived walking with his cane and dressed as always in a threadbare gray suit his wrinkled coffeecolored face frowned as he looked at candace and me on the steps we obviously didnt belong there during library hours he and others inquired and i replied that thered been an accident and the library was closed for the day i didnt know what else to say this revelation didnt get anyone to turn on their heels and seek other entertainment the crowd about fifteen strong stood by the ambulance waiting grimly a little japanese sedan spewed gravel as it screeched to a stop next to candaces mercedes her hand tightened on mine at the thought of all those little meteors denting her finish a dapper short little fellow i knew to be an utter fool jumped from the car and practically skipped to the library he obviously couldnt wait to see the body his dark eyes glanced at candace and me i didnt raise a hand to stop him billy ray bummel the assistant da wouldnt have stopped anyhow he dashed into the library some indeterminate time later junebug the coroner and billy ray bummel emerged the paramedics followed trundling a blanketed form gasps and other expressions of surprise and curiosity arose from the crowd they sounded like a freakshow audience ogling a particularly ugly mutant junebug fixed the group with a stern eye yall get get going about your business and let us do ours a few spectators moved away but most acted like their feet were mired in mud who is it a voice croaked from the crowd junebug leveled his eyes at the offender you can read about it in the paper now get moving along hed put on his reflective sunglasses for the proper authority image and stuck a stetson back on his brown crewcut he was bigger and taller than me with a solidly broad face im sure hed already thought itd look good next year on a sheriffs poster he looked much the same as in high school except for the slightest of beer guts and a few worry lines creasing his brow a second warning sufficed and the crowd ambled apart as the ambulance was loaded and roared off toward the hospital the lights didnt flare and the siren stayed silent i felt sick and sad beta mightve been crazy but she didnt deserve this junebug took me by the arm cmon jordy his deep voice was raspy from tobacco lets talk inside let me explain about me and junebug wed known each other since first grade in a small town when you spend twelve years of school and summers with the same kids you develop what those tv shrinks call lovehate relationships its inevitable you play with these kids day after day and you cant imagine life without their company but youre also guaranteed to get plenty mad at each other junebug and i got along fine until high school when we got all competitive we competed for sports honors he usually won academic honors i usually won but junebug beat me in math and the same pretty girls of which we had a finite supply in mirabeau our friendship didnt pick up when i returned to town id been beyond mirabeau and hed stuck close we didnt hang out together but neither were we sworn enemies he came to my daddys funeral and three weeks ago id gone to his daddys funeral you do that here even if comforting words to someone youve drifted far away from taste odd in your mouth junebug of course isnt his given name hes hewett moncrief junior and everyone knows that a junior is sometimes saddled as a toddler with being a junebug well that saddle stuck his daddy was mean that way we sat in the periodical section the days houston and austin papers still wrapped in their plastic covers dotted with drops of water from the wet grass you want us to get yall some coffee junebug offered i cant let you go back there to make any but ill call over to the diner and get you and miss tully some i shook my head i suddenly realized that candace was not there junebug saw my face shes outside ill talk to her in a minute junebugs voice is always slow and languorous like he just woke up i couldnt imagine him yelling at an arrestee hed probably thank them once he locked the handcuffs i need to ask you some questions okay i said blankly but i stared at the pack in his pocket id really really like a cigarette here im quittin he tossed his pack on the table between us and i retrieved an ashtray from my office it was an ugly misshapen glazedclay expression of thirteenyearold angst that mark had made in an arts class so much for quitting smoking i lit and dragged hard telling myself what a filthy habit it was just one id have just one junebug eyed me i dont think youre supposed to smoke in here im not but i dont care and you probably dont either right now i answered he let it go and began taking my statement his first question was simple what had happened that morning he wrote down my story in a battered notepad hed produced from his pocket i made my answers short and distinct i was still in shock over my grisly discovery just try finding a corpse in your workplace and see how you handle it have the body be someone you know my hands werent shaking and i was glad of that my voice shook a little and if junebug hadnt known me he might not have noticed i suppose that miz harcher had a key to the library junebug asked no she used to have a key because she was on the library board up until february she tried to ban some booksreal bits of trash like the color purple huckleberry finn and the scarlet letter and the board got fed up with her they booted her out she turned in her key and i had the locks changed yall always do that when a member leaves the library board junebug raised an eyebrow at me no of course not but i felt that considering the uh extremity of her views regarding certain books here it would be appropriate to limit her access to business hours god i sounded like an official report thats interesting we found a key in her pocket separate from her key ring he pulled a plastic bag from a large paper bag next to his feet is this a library key jordy yeah looks just like mine i produced my key from my pocket i wonder how she got this junebug said thinking aloud he did that back in school and used to drive our teachers nuts i dont know i answered not from me junebug gnawed at the end of his pen i understand you had a little runin with her yesterday my gut churned as if id just narrowly avoided stepping into an elevator shaft before i knew it i was sliding my palms down my jeans drying them of sweat miz harcher threw herself a hissy fit in the library over what she considered porn and whacked me upside the head with a book she left or rather was shown the door made some comments didnt she about shutting down the library look junebug you already seem to know the answer to that question youve already heard the gossips version yeah she did just that howd you know and whats your point i have my sources he said loftily and my point is i got a dead woman here you argued with her just yesterday jordy i have to ask these questions my temper decided to make an appearance its one of the finer poteet family traits you cant seriously think i killed her can you for gods sake my voice sounded alien to me still deep and drawly but saying words i never thought id say jordy i have to ask would you like an attorney present i swallowed you cant think i killed her junebug thats crazy do you want an attorney now or will you answer further questions i bristled my uncle bid was an attorney but summoning him might be more unpleasant than being hauled off to jail i made myself calm down go ahead i have nothing to conceal and i want to cooperate junebug junebug sat and stared at me for a full minute it was unnerving but i resolved not to let it bother me i pulled my blanket of outraged innocence closer about me he pulled a loose page from his notepad it was light blue stationery this list mean anything to you he handed me the paper and i saw his eyes dart to see if my hands were steady i willed them to stillness the list was written in betas spidery handwriting i recognized it from the notes she used to send the library when she was on the board i tried not to drop the paper as i reached the end of the list tamma hufnagelnum hally schneiderprov jordan poteetisaiah eula mae quiffjob matt blalockmatt ruth wills kings bob don goertzjudges anne poteetgen mama what the hell was she doing on a list written by some religious zealot whod been murdered names with bible quotes next to them what was this list even for invitees to a revival meeting i didnt think so i took a long draw on my nowstubby cigarette and committed the names and quote numbers to memory as best i could i used to do that with sales figures on my books at the textbook publishers before i had to confer with my jerk of a boss so i had a quick memory the list doesnt mean anything to me i said but i know all these folks miz quiff miz wills and mrs hufnagel were here yesterday when beta made her scene hally schneiders family is distant kin to me and they live on my street matt blalock and bob don goertzwell everyone knows them and ive no idea what my mother and i are doing there i dont know what significance the bible quotes have she wasnt quoting the good book when she was here yesterday whered you find this junebug narrowed his eyes at me but kept his voice soft and slow it was stuffed down her shirt shed hidden it there i guess or someone planted it i suggested maybe to confuse the issue junebug appeared unwilling to grant such cleverness to a local murderer he watched me fish another cigarette from his pack and light it i resolved to keep the amount smoked to a prime number to give myself some leeway you ever see that bat before the one that killed her my stomach sank to somewhere near my ankles and im sure my cigarette shook oh god yeah and im sure my prints will be on it unless the killer wiped it clean i found it yesterday in the softball lot when i was coming back to the library i see he jotted on his pad and eyed me like i might make a sudden move and so did everyone else who was in there junebug a roomful of people saw me carrying that stupid bat i put it in my office well jordy this is all very interesting you know what i learned at the police academy i bit back my first reply which involved mastering how not to leave a piss stain on your pants junebug wasnt acting like a childhood friend i couldnt believe he imagined i had any connection to this that most murders are awful simple you just got to worry about motive opportunity and access to a weapon he looked up at me with the eyes of a stranger sounds to me like you got all three buddy please the woman hit me with a book made a spectacle of herself and stormed off thats not a motive for murder plus do you honestly think i could kill anybody junebug didnt answer that question instead like a socratic teacher he posed me another one did you have any other dealings with miz harcher aside from yesterday i looked him dead in the eye like i said she got thrown off the library board she didnt approve of the city council hiring me and shed been trying to get certain books off the shelf for ages i had to deal with her through the library board she lost and i won so my feud was over with her as far as i was concerned a rational thought fought its way through my shock i stubbed out my cigarette and snatched the list back from junebug who didnt look at all pleased the library board i said ruth wills and eula mae quiff are both on it sos hally schneiders mother and tamma hufnagels husband and bob don goertz replaced miz harcher when she was taken off what about matt blalock hes not on the board but i let the county vietnam vets support group meet here so who all has keys to this place well me of course and candace the board members eula mae ruth adam hufnagel janice schneider and bob don goertz matt blalock has a key because the vets group meets after hours on thursday which is our short day i tried unsuccessfully to dredge up more names i think thats it interesting isnt it junebugs quiet drawl dripped with accusation i raised my palms in mock surrender i dont know what that list means she was a crazy bitter old woman who believed she was doing gods work when all she did was piss folks off but nobody on that list is a murderer junebug stared back at me with the look hed used to try to psych me out before basketball tryouts there was a dead woman here this morning and i cant find a single shred of evidence that points to a breakin she had a key on her whered she get that key or a copy narrows the field a tad dont it i should tell you i said that i was here last night around ten for about three minutes and something creepy happened that brought him forward on his haunches and i explained about forgetting mamas medicine did you see or hear anything unusual no nothing i just came in got the pills and left i cant explain itbut i just had a funny feeling that someone was watching me i just thought it was nerves junebug judged me with his eyes and scribbled in his notepad i want you to come to the station with me jordy and sign a statement okay his tone was almost friendly again sure let me tell candace shell be at the station ill need a statement from her too i paused so who do you think did it you have to be pretty damned coldblooded killing someone with a baseball bat junebug smiled a knowitall smile lots of people are cold inside we just never see it i myself felt a little bit frosty and i didnt argue your mamas keeping you in town for a while right jordy junebug sounded more casual than he meant yes she is my voice was like stone good i dont think you should go anywhere till this is all over before we left i sat in my car found a gasoline receipt and scribbled down the list of names and bible verses i thought id gotten them right i hoped so as i followed junebugs car the two blocks to the police station at the corner of loeber and magnolia i thought about that list why did beta hide it on her person she wouldnt have wanted someone to see it perhaps and why did the list exist anyway why those eight names id give my statement then get home as quick as i could mama kept a bible at her bedside although she didnt even look at the pictures anymore and maybe if the foggy veil lifted from her mind for a while she could tell me why beta harcher would have her on such a list that wasnt likely though providing my statement was easy i was finished in twenty minutes then i waited for junebugs secretary to type it up the whole time billy ray bummel looked at me like i was a cross between jack the ripper and joseph goebbels im giving billy ray far too much credit in knowing criminal history he probably thinks jack the ripper is someone with a gas problem and joseph goebbels is a turkey tycoon despite his law degree undoubtedly granted by one of the finer mailorder institutions billy ray has carried on the fine bummel tradition of denseness education doesnt erase highquality stupidity like billy rays it just makes it more dangerous junebugs secretary nelda announced to him that shed reached betas niece in houston junebug got up to take the call i signed my statement billy ray took the document and examined it critically as though hoping to spot a confession somewhere in there his black eyes larger than most widened as he caught what looked like a clue it must have been waving to him he set his bony knobby hands on his beer belly and chewed his bottom lip ive seen cows masticate in the exact same fashion cows arent bright either so you were there last night after ten wouldnt surprise me if thats about the time the coroner says miz harcher met her deemise i gave him the withering look that mama and sister taught me when i was young you narrow your eyes raise your brow and flare a nostril like theres a rank smell its also important to maintain a demeanor of indifference to what the other persons saying excuse me billy ray but you ought to wait until you have a few more facts before you start making accusations you had the murder weapon you run the place where she was killed and you had both opportunity and motive billy ray mustve had a pit bull at home for inspiration youre being ridiculous she had a key she could have let her murderer in i dont think so and dont fool yourself that knowing junebug for so long will help you any im watching you mr jordan poteet youre my number one suspect and im gonna nail your skinny ass to the wall for dramatic effect billy ray ran a hand through his rapidly thinning hair it only took half a second you think all the sun his head gets would help his brain grow but his mind isnt fertile ground i felt scared and mad at the same time i didnt want either emotion to show youve got my statement you havent charged me with anything may i go billy ray smiled officiously and gestured toward the door go on ahead be sure and let us know if you intend to leave town i walked without hurry to the front door i didnt look back at billy ray the sunshine was bright and cheery but my skin was icecold i hadnt killed beta harcher but at least one member of the local authorities considered me guilty as sin think about it think about being at the top of the list of suspects of bashing in a womans head and see if you dont have a bit of trouble swallowing candaces mercedes was still in the parking lot she hadnt yet given her statement to junebug i considered waiting for her then imagined her hanging around me like a stray cat behind a restaurant i didnt want that right now id call her later first things first i wanted to talk to mama and to find me a bible i needed to know why beta harcher thought of me in connection with a verse from isaiah it was about eleventhirty when i reached my house nothing seemed different from when id left except that i could smell skunk on the latemorning air sometimes the critters wander in town looking for food get scared and let fly with their chemical defense then they scurry back to the woods just like beta harcher come in raise a stink get out of the picture but leave an an noying reek behind it was the meanest thought id ever had in my life by the time i got inside i was sullen with guilt over it mama sat in the den watching all my children on a whispering tv since shed gotten sick she couldnt stand loudness although it never bothered her before shed sit for hours simply watching actors move their lips i couldnt hear what trauma the pretty blonde on the soap was enduring i had my own to fret about sister was still in her robe yawning and reading the austin newspaper over coffee she saw my face and bolted to her feet i told her quickly what happened sister of course was horrified i spoke in low tones of having discovered the body so mama wouldnt hear i described the list that junebug had found and produced my copy i confessed to having forgotten mamas medicine and going to the library at what now seemed like a mighty inopportune moment at the end sister sank into her chair and so billy ray told me im the number one suspect me can you believe the nerve sister shook her head they cant be serious i mean junebugs known you forever he knows you wouldnt kill a tick much less miz harcher she stood we have to call uncle bid theres no need i havent been arrested for anything and im sure junebugll find whoever did this plus i didnt want to have any unnecessary contact with uncle bid ive always contended that uncle bid should be belled like a leper so youd know when hes coming i dont believe theres a more unpleasant old fart of a lawyer in texas i went into the den mama watched the tv screen intently as a very quiet argument raged i switched off the set mama kept staring at the screen without changing one muscle in her face i knelt before her mama look at me she turned her face and gave me a shy uncertain smile how are you today i asked gently i sensed sister hovering nearby fine thank you etiquette was no longer a certainty with mama but today at least she hadnt forgotten her manners mama i want you to think do you know a lady named beta harcher i enunciated the name carefully as though that would help mama fight through the choking mass of abnormal nerve cells the disease spawned in her brain who beta harcher mama looked blank i asked again she looked blank again maybe shell remember later sister offered she probably wont remember this conversation later i snapped sister looked wounded and i said sorry im stressed i took a deep breath try association she was real active in the baptist church mama shes short dark hair kind of frumpy sort of bossy this complimentary description of beta didnt penetrate far i dont know mama said she looked down into her lap i dont know she repeated her voice wavering its okay mama dont worry you watch your show now i stood and switched the tv back on try again later sister suggested i leaned down and kissed mamas cheek her hand came up to my head unexpectedly and her fingers tangled in my thick hair so close to the strawberryblonde color of her own i held the embrace for a moment then turned back to sister her bible still up in her room i think so sister answered cmon mama lets have a glass of iced tea i left them in the kitchen and bounded up the stairs in my room i got paper and pen then walked down the hall mamas room was quiet and comfortable with irish lace curtains and an antique oak bed that had been her aunts pictures of sister and me as children joined by the more recent photos of mark dotted the walls i sat on the quilted bedspread and opened her bible it occurred to me that i didnt know which translation of the bible beta had used to select these quotes i could only hope that i got the gist of the meanings from the same verses in mamas bible i smoothed out the folded list and considered it beta had written it then hidden it why it was a diverse roster each person had a connection with the library although some were more tenuous than others i decided to treat it as a list of folks that beta harcher had a gripe with i knew the people on the list werent her friends and she didnt want us to be certain folks and certain verses there had to be a reason mama and me first i looked again at the verse next to my name isaiah i flipped through the bible till i found it woe unto them that call evil good and good evil i said the words aloud did the woman think i had my sensibilities reversed considering i kept books in the library that she considered objectionable i suppose so i looked up the quote indicated by mamas name genesis in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children i didnt retain much from the sunday school classes that my parents made me attend but i did recall that verse referred to eves curse of blood and painful childbirth good god what did that have to do with my mother shed had two children and plenty of pain in the process due to our large poteet heads but why would beta harcher write this down perhaps beta considered bearing a heathen like me to be the utmost in maternal agony i copied my makeshift list into a notebook and then copied the verses i started through the rest of the list writing down each corresponding verse by each name it made for interesting reading i sat back on the bed the police would surely be talking to these people junebug and billy ray were probably conducting their own version of the spanish inquisition right now then i heard billy rays words im going to nail your skinny ass to the wall maybe their questioning of the others was going to center around me i had access to the scene access to the weapon and id fought with the deceased i shut my eyes remembering how a libraryful of folks had overheard me say i couldve killed beta god sometimes the police didnt need to look beyond that if the district attorney thought there was a case my motive seemed slim to me but i played devils advocate beta had threatened to close the library what if the police postulated that i believed her and feared shed cost me the only job id been able to land would someone kill for a job maybe not but junebug might surmise id kill for my mother my position at the library allowed sister and me to keep mama at home it was common knowledge that id returned to mirabeau from a goodpaying job up north to keep mama out of an institution how far would i go to maintain that arrangement i swallowed i wondered that my self i knew i wouldnt resort to murder but i would have fought tooth and nail to keep the library safe from beta harcher i think folks in town such as the chief of police knew that too and mama why was she on the list never mind the librarywhat if beta had threatened my mother in some way if junebug assumed i could kill once to protect my job protecting my mother might induce me to a tristate slaying spree i sounded paranoid even to myself mama wasnt going to be much help i thought i scanned the names again perhaps one of them knew a perfectly logical reason for this list the library was closed and sister was here until eight tonight i could ask some questions of my own and maybe find out why beta harcher had ended up on the wrong side of batting practice in the library the first baptist church of mirabeau is one of the ugliest buildings thats trying to be pretty that ive ever seen its built of beige brick with purplish windows smeared with white to give the windows a marbled effect ive seen birdshit that exact color even god would call this church ugly it sat on the corner of alamo and heydl streets on the south side of mayne like most churches in town and there arent manythe baptists catholics and methodists have just about everyone covered first baptist has an announcement sign with a black felt background with big white letters that stick into the felt each sermon here gets treated like a blockbuster summer movie at least for its one week of fanfare tamma hufnagel knelt in front of the announcement board as i pulled up a box of letters rested in her lap and she was posting the theme for next sundays sermon i opened my notebook on my lap and reread tammas verse which was numbers be sure your sin will find you out whoa sounded juicy i wondered what sin mousy tamma could have committed in betas eyes dancing playing cards i only knew tamma hufnagel to say hello but i did know her husband a sight better brother adam hufnagels preaching wasnt exactly fire and brimstone more like a light grilling im surprised beta tolerated such slackness on his part my dealings with brother adam on the library board had been polite if distant hed been betas biggest supporter in her censorship stances but had tried to get her to soften her hysterics he hadnt fought too hard when beta got punted from the board i think he knew it was a losing cause and he didnt want to put his own position in jeopardy he was a real smooth talker who could make you feel like jesus was just around the corner so you better run the dustrag over the furniture to get it spiffy for him i got out of the car and approached tamma hufnagel she watched me as i walked toward her for some reason i felt uneasy tammas pretty in a plain way reddish brown hair green eyes with a slim almost boyish figure her nose is snubshaped and looks as though it belongs on another face her hair which would have looked better let down was pulled tightly back into a bun she wore a plain white polostyle shirt and a denim skirt long and modest i guessed she was about my age but was trying to look twenty years older maybe to catch up with her husband the only softening of her face was the scattering of girlish freckles across her nose and cheeks those freckles were like a memory of summer i remembered hearing she wasnt a local girl id been told she came from giddings or one of the other predominantly german and wendish communities in eastcentral texas hello mrs hufnagel she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand as a schoolgirl might hello i guess youve heard about miz harcher she nodded and bit her thin lip for a moment chief moncrief phoned us she was a prominent member here you know he wanted to know if we knew her next of kin we gave him her nieces name i wasnt expecting such a detailed explanation im sure you must be very upset her answer was a gesture toward the sermon board it read making pea i was sure more letters were needed you know that i found her in the library i wondered just how much junebug was telling folks and i decided to start with the basics she nodded he said someone hadhere she swallowed deeply her thin throat moving like a snake under waterbashed her head with a baseball bat thats true you know mrs hufnagel i didnt agree with beta as far as books went but im sorry shes dead i didnt wish that on her of course you wouldnt who do you think mightve killed her i asked and tamma hufnagel stood abruptly the box of plastic letters tumbling from her lap and spilling across the grass i glanced down wondering if anything interesting was now spelled out on the lawn i dont know she gasped why are you asking me mrs hufnagel please im asking because you knew her and you knew the people that knew her she was killed in the library or at least her body was left there there must be a reason it was a terrible shock to me and i just want to know what happened if she was killed there it means she was there after hours with someone i put my hands on tamma hufnagels arm and she froze i stared into her face listen to me mrs hufnagel beta had a key either she met someone there or someone lured her there she hated that library and id already warned her to stay away but somehow she got a key i paused tamma hufnagel stared at the grass shaking her head she knelt by the letter box carefully pulling her skirt around her legs so i didnt even see a flash of calf ive made a mess she said and began gathering the letters i knelt next to her and helped her pick the little plastic vowels and consonants out of the lawn i offered a palmful to her she took the letters from my hand touching the plastic extrusions on the letters and not me i thought id made her uncomfortable when i touched her she sorted the letters into the box i dont know who would have wanted to kill her she shrugged yes she was difficult sometimes i think she believed she had been specially touched by the lord she looked skyward but no answer was forthcoming on the accuracy of her statement i really didnt know her well what was your relationship like with her i tried to sound conversational rather than interrogative she glanced at me ran a thin tongue over thin lips then went back to putting letters into the board making peace w we got along okay she was a woman of strong convictions she had very definite opinions about the church about god she searched for a letter in her palm and about morality did you ever disagree with her well of course we did it is adams church after all she shrugged she liked to be in charge of everything the rummage sale the bake sale the tent revival in the summer the book burnings i added in a miffed tone tamma paused you know that adam and i didnt agree with her about her attitude toward the library well not entirely we dont approve of every book you keep but thats neither here nor there we certainly didnt want to see the place shut down remember at the library board meetings adam tried for compromise regarding your views and betas views i appreciate that mrs hufnagel it took every fiber of my being not to disclose what i thought about censorship and her holierthanthou attitude i wondered again what sin shed committed in betas eyes i was tempted to mention the list but i decided not to let junebug do that i wonder did you ever see my mother with miz harcher your mother the question surprised her she gave me a long cautious look no not that i remember your familys not baptist are yall there was disapproval in her voice but i ignored it she decided to be forgiving since my mother was losing her mind you know we have a healing service on tuesday nights you could bring your mother and see if adam could help and well add her to our prayer list i didnt know whether to laugh or say thank you mama had always taught us that saying thank you was as automatic a response as breathing even when faced with the impossible if adam hufnagel could drive the neurological demons from my mothers mind id drag her down here let brother adam lay hands on her and dance with a snake in my mouth i decided on politeness medicine hadnt done much yet for mama and including her on the prayer list was kind of tamma thanks maybe we will come prayer heals jordy we were now on first names acts of god do happen here really i asked and have they happened to you have they made you free of sin tamma hufnagel stared at me there is a look of defiance people who are terrified can muster and she did i thought she wasnt used to being challenged probably most of brother adams flock wouldnt say boo to her being the preachers wife made her untouchable her mouth set into a thin frown of course not were sinners from birth only jesus offers us a chance at redemption miz harcher doesnt seem to have believed much in the redemption side of the equation i observed dryly all i ever heard from her was the judgment the fire the eternal damnation i never heard once about the rewards to follow for good behavior i paused and realized i needed to keep my tongue in check tamma hufnagel looked at me like i was a pagan dancer for dionysus come to town to set up a temple and do a little drunken shimmy i paused and thought if she decided i was getting uppity she might respond the way most fundamentalists do with a torrent of words to tell you why youre wrong and why theyre right when she spoke her voice cut with an unexpected edge you nonbelievers think you know everything well you dont im not a nonbeliever im a good episcopalian and i cant know anything when people dont answer questions i retorted i guess youve got something to hide mrs hufnagel i asked you a minute ago if you knew anything about that key beta harcher had and youve managed to dance around an answer since baptists dont approve of dancing period i thought the very suggestion of her performing any sort of mental terpsichorean activities would annoy her i didnt like being rude but i needed to know what she knew shed made betas list because of some sin shed committed and manners werent going to prevent my finding out more it worked she looked at me like i was a vacation bible school student whod challenged the existence of god for your information mr smarty pants chief moncrief called my husband and asked him about his key to the library when adam checked it was gone he kept it on the same ring that he keeps the church keys on which are here during the day it would have been simple for beta to take adams key so theres that mystery solved she wore her conviction like a starchy illfitting blouse now will you let me be adams key im sure junebug found that interesting and im sure he asked you where you and reverend hufnagel were last night around ten or so she kept the awkward smugness a tad longer of course he did he wanted to know when beta could have taken that key adam saw her at the church yesterday afternoon around four he now thinks she might have taken the library key from his officehe said he was talking to lenny mauder out in the assembly hall about expanding the parking lot and beta couldve gotten into his office then i met adam at the church around six for a meeting we stayed until seven then we went home had dinner and watched john wayne on cable rio bravo we were in bed and asleep by ten she ignored the implicit suggestion that she or her husband could be a suspect that meeting at seven was for the vacation bible school group to start planning this summers sessions it was odd that she didnt show up for the meeting shed been adamant about guiding the churchs children along a path of rightousness whata horrible concept beta shaping young minds the keen edge still adhered to tammas voice and i wondered if she hadnt cared much for beta herself who else was there i asked you sound like chief moncrief why all the questions why not answer i countered im sure you dont have any secrets of course not flustered she fumbled in the box for a letter its not a secret at all im just surprised youre curious the planning committee was me beta and janice schneider this year janice and i are doing most of the teaching beta took on recruitment and pity the parent who didnt sign up junior i know what a pain she was on the library board did she run you ragged on the vacation bible school stuff want the kids to light fires under their curious georges of course not tamma said quickly for the second time in a minute thats mean of you jordy i shrugged so what else can you tell me about her nothing new her voice sounded tired and i could tell she wanted to be rid of me she could be awfully judgmental at times but that was her burden she had a very strong sense of morals she liked to remind people that there was a definite right and a definite wrong shed let them know when theyd failed and what they had to do to make amends but people dont alwaysshe paused looking for wordscotton to advice may i ask when you last saw miz harcher i asked trying to get onto less philosophically slippery rocks yesterday afternoon i guess around two i knew shed be upset after your little altercation in the library she glanced over at me so i stopped by her house to see if she was feeling better she was shed found strength in the bible and was studying it studying it or writing down verses to go alongside names i wondered we talked for a while and then i left she continued you didnt see anyone else there did you did she have any other visitors tamma hufnagel finished her task and stood balancing the box of letters so she wouldnt drop it again she looked me dead in the eye and there was nothing shy afraid or mousy about her now the mask was set like old makeup why yes she did bob don goertz stopped by as i was leaving and seemed rather upset i gather there was some problem between them now if youll excuse me i have to fix adam some lunch goodbye jordy she turned and walked into the ugly church i glanced down at the completed board making peace with death what a lovely invitation the air now felt moist and hot as the noontime sun began its drumbeat on the town i sat in my blazer for a few minutes running the air conditioner at arctic blast and watching the leafy oak branches sway in the wind i didnt regard beta harcher and tamma hufnagel as such bosom buddies they might have been allies members of the same church followers of the same version of god but maybe they just werent friends people who pride themselves on their powers of judging others dont bond well theres always that withholding of true affection waiting for a sign of human weakness from one that the other can deliberate on clearly beta harcher rejoiced in finding people deficient in some way so she could proclaim what awful sinners they were and how bad they needed godand her guidance how do you stay friends with a miserable soandso like that i pulled away from the first baptist church of mirabeau making peace with death tamma hufnagel seemed to have already done that and right quick icouldnt stand bob don goertz fortunately i only knew him from a distance bob don owned the two biggest car dealerships in bonaparte county if you looked up charlatan in the dictionary you might find a bejeweled and polyestered bob don leering back at you ready to shake your hand and arrange financing for your new or quality preowned car im only a bigot toward car dealers ive yet to meet one i like he replaced beta on the towns library board when she got booted the hufnagels liked him which was no recommendation in my book as soon as beta got sacked for her reactionary hysterics bob don stated that what america was all about was freedom of the press and hed sure be delighted to donate his time to the library board the board elected him without a second or possibly first thought since then hed been as sweet and as fake as cotton candy to me i guess he knew i was a force to be reckoned with or he wanted to sell me a car apparently for bob don running a car dealership was a lot like running for public office he could smell the winds of change and spit the other way quicker than you could blink his saliva out of your eye i pulled my blazer into the quiet dealership hoping that bob don hadnt dashed off to a cholesterolfilled lunch with the good ol boys i parked stepped out of the car and made it about three feet before a fat balding salesman arrowed toward me telling him as we hustled along that i wasnt buying but was just there to see bob don i swerved and made it roughly twenty feet before a younger fellow with huge sideburns and bad teeth attempted a verbal tackle offering to let me testdrive a bronco nimbly avoiding him and his sales pitch i made it to the airconditioned showroom with a plea to use the bathroom i pushed past another sweaty salesman and got into bob dons inner sanctum a gumchewing beehived receptionist examined me critically before picking up her phone and announcing me to the king of the road bob don came to his office door quickly which surprised me he surprised me further by looking happy to see me his broad tanned face broke into an eartoear white grin well hey there jordy its good to see you he pumped my hand like i was a water well hello bob don i wonder if you have a minute to talk privately why sure i do apparently talking to me would be the highlight of his day i found that a little difficult to believe what with all the unsold cars on his lot we went into his office decorated in smalltown prosperity pictures of local little league teams that were sponsored by the goertz dealership covered the walls going back at least two decades trophies for the teams that fared well stood on a shelf hed backed several winners and probably sold their parents a car while the glow of victory was fresh there were pictures of him and his wife over several years the fashions changing somewhat but not straying far from rural texas couture his wife was a numbedlooking woman with heavylidded blank eyes and pneumatically big hair id heard gossip that she drank heavily there were awards for excellence from the various automakers he represented but they were cheaplooking certificates that bob don had mounted in expensive frames i thought they looked rather sad bob don sat behind his desk in a thronelike leather chair and gestured for me to take a seat clutter covered the desk including a huge ceramic monstrosity of an ashtray with a few butts mashed in it i saw it and laughed it reminded me of the horror ashtray i used in the library bob don laughed with me in the automatic reflexive way of salesmen i told him why i laughed and his grin grew oh lord yes gretchens just got too much time on her hands he examined the ashtray as though it were an interesting part from a foreign car she said it represents somethin but damned if i know what it is rage i think insisted she had to take some damned course over at the community college in bavary not pottery but ceramics next week itll be photography or genealogy or some such thing he shook his head and started to offer me a cigarette suddenly he withdrew the pack sorry just remembered youre trying to quit how did you know you mentioned it last board meeting he shrugged and put the pack away actually id love to have a cigarette with you bob don i decided to hold off on quitting for the moment he looked pleased muttered something about not living forever and lit for us both i inhaled deeply and looked at him through the smoky veil tall guy over six feet probably up over two hundred pounds now his face held strength when he wasnt trying to be a good ol boy and i thought he mustve been handsome when he was young he looked better when he didnt smile than when he did his official beta verse according to my notebook was judges have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two two women had beta discovered another woman in bob dons life aside from the artistically challenged gretchen or had some other prey been split or neither beta had a vivid imagination at least i had that in common with her i thought i stayed silent for a moment watching him smoke and wondering if he was going to set his blondgray hair on fire with his cigarette his hair spray was probably creating an ozone hole directly over mirabeau he wore it swept into a conway twittystyle helmet with long matching sideburns bob don could have easily been a televangelist or a sixties countrywestern singer as much as a rural car dealer whats up jordy he finally said breaking my reverie i wanted to talk to you about beta harcher his eyes frosted oh her dont pay attention to her shes just a bit overzealous and i didnt let him continue havent you heard shes dead i might as well have leaned over the table and mussed up his hair the shock showed naked on his face he recovered quickly drawing on his cigarette his eyes avoided mine dead i told the story in few words omitting the list i thought the police might have called you by now theyre starting an investigation of course call me why now he looked at me his complexion fair to begin with paled you have a key to the library bob don there was a key on her that tamma hufnagel says beta swiped from adam but who knows for sure good lord he receded into his chair he blinked his puffy blue eyes through the smoke holy christ he muttered would you like a drink sacrilege and booze how unbaptist of you bob don he shrugged instead of arguing im a man like any other jordy i believe in god but all his rules get tiresome im gonna have me a whiskey you want one sure i never drink early but im flexible under stress he produced two plastic glasses from a desk drawer along with a bottle of jack daniels he poured solemnly and handed me a glass he didnt make a toast and i was relieved beta dead he muttered jesus it seems impossible the shock faded from his face and his expression was composed and unreadable everyone dies i observed wondering how hed react to such a cold comment yeah but i always thought shed go on her own terms he shook his head and sipped i understand you saw her yesterday around midafternoon you ask that like you dont care but i think you do he fingered his red necktie covered with little yellow horseshoes you were upset when you saw her i said who told you this he asked tamma hufnagel i guess she was leaving as i got there practically running looked as scared as a fouryearold at a haunted house i filed that away never mind tamma im curious as to why you were there he frowned and i saw his fingers whiten against his drink why should i tell you his friendliness had not entirely evaporated but it was drying i measured him i hadnt liked bob don before but in the past five minutes hed shown glimmers of humanity that elevated him beyond the supercilious gladhander id known look she threatened me yesterday in the library then she ends up dead there from a bat i brought and left in my office it doesnt look promising for me the police and billy ray bummel think i was involved he mashed out his cigarette and downed his glass of jack daniels his stare held mine ill ask you a question jordy i want the truth i will help you all i can if you need it his eyes had a frankness i hadnt expected did you kill her no i did not i answered and if i did why would you help me anyway he poured more whiskey into his glass because i liked your daddy and i like your mama he said simply id do it for them then help me tell me why you were there and what you know about her what do i know about her he looked toward the window he didnt say anything for several moments she grew up here she was pretty when she was younger she was wild too i remember hearing that about her although she was several years younger than me she didnt get religion bad until she was twenty and then something happened to her to make her think she and jesus together were an unbeatable team she never married cause nobody could live with her her daddy was welltodo and she lived off the money he left her he shrugged she was obsessed with god with judging people i nodded do you think she ever used that judging to go a step beyond what do you mean he asked hoarsely you cant judge someone until you know their story she could just judge people by conduct but that might not be enough i watched him our eyes never strayed from each others was she the type to dig up dirt on folks use it against them i thought of the verses shed associated with tamma and bob don they suggested secrets best kept hidden she wasnt blackmailing me bob don said tonelessly he raised the plastic glass to his lips and gulped not the response i expected i sipped my own drink trying to act nonchalant so why did you go see her yesterday he swallowed i wanted to clear the air with her about me replacing her on the board just make amends instead of amens he tried to laugh but it sounded more like a sick cough i knew how upset she was and i thought it best to make her feel she still had a voicethrough meon the board that was all i needed another beta and are you her voice now are you going to give me as much trouble as she did bob don looked hurt he fumbled for his words as though they were scraps hed scattered on the floor no not at all look jordy please stay out of all this let the police do their job their job seems to be trying to find enough evidence to arrest me according to billy ray bummel they wont arrest you i promise i bob don never got to finish i heard the nasal sounds of the beehived receptionist and i recognized two other voices before the door flew open junebug moncrief and billy ray bummel they hadnt bothered with the niceties of knocking billy ray looked at me like hed caught me with my hands around a tender young throat i told em you were busy talking to mr poteet the receptionist yelled from behind mirabeaus law and order its okay bernadette bob don eyed junebug and billy ray critically yall come in since they were already in they stayed put a glaring bernadette shut the door behind her afternoon mr goertz junebug smiled billy ray nodded and continued to scrutinize me as if i were a urine specimen gentlemen bob don wheedled in his closingthedeal voice usually visitors wait to be announced yall trying to make ever body here think yall gonna arrest me he chuckled goodnaturedly at the end we just wanted to ask you some questions bob don junebug said how you doing jordy i stood setting my drink on bob dons desk im fine thank you i didnt feel it you mind telling us what youre doing here billy ray asked not making a toast to miz harchers memory i hope before i could answer bob don leapt into the fray jordy here and i were just talking about him gettin a new truck you must be a mighty cool customer findin a dead body then going car shoppin billy ray observed he didnt bother to hide the vitriol in his voice billy ray junebug cautioned he looked at me then the drinks didnt know you were interested in buying a truck jordy im offering him a good tradein on that car of his but he reckons im trying to rip him off bob don laughed as jovial as a host politely trying to remove unwanted guests his verbal awkwardness was gone the hallmark glibness thatd earned him that big car lot was back since junebug and billy ray obviously want to talk to you bob don ill be leaving i shook his hand ill consider your offer thanks give me a call and well discuss it further his blue eyes bored into mine and there was steel in his handshake i thought for a moment that he was reluctant to release my hand but he did junebug and billy ray said nothing further to me as i walked out and shut the door i went past the still fuming bernadette who was muttering about the poor manners of civil servants i emerged into the heat of the afternoon bob don goertz unaccountably was acting like my ally but even though he had been forthcoming he hadnt seemed comfortable did i make him nervous id halfexpected him to point a finger at me and tell the officers that i was prying into beta harchers death but he hadnt and i thought i knew why id asked if beta was the type to dig up dirt on people his immediate response was shes not blackmailing me it seemed an odd answer for a smooth talker like bob don not a yeah she was the type to do it or no she was a good christian woman whod never commit extortion he just said he wasnt being victimized i wondered if that was a slip of the tongue if bob don had been so jumpy that hed logically leapfrogged ahead a couple of questions was he being blackmailed by beta or did he know of someone else who was i was getting ahead of myself i thought but id definitely take him up on his offer of further discussion he hadnt said where he was last night i felt that honest bob don wasnt being entirely so it didnt make me want to buy a car from him the smell of marijuana hung faint in the air as i sat on matt blalocks screened back porch i wasnt surprised that someone in mirabeau would be toking up but i found it disconcerting that a vietnam vet sneaked a puff while staring out at the lush dense growth of mossy woods that came up to his property like alien jungle it seemed too much like a scene from an oliver stone picture matt blalock wheeled back onto the porch balancing a lap tray with iced tea glasses with little mint sprigs i hoped they were mint topping the tea id have offered to help but i knew from experience matt liked to do everything himself stopping at the low table in front of me he handed me a glass of tea and set one down for himself he deftly whipped the tray around and tossed it onto another table the tray clattered but didnt fall good aim i offered matt shrugged he wasnt a big guy only five feet six or so but his arm muscles bulged massively from years of acting for his legs he kept his black hair cut military short matts uniform these days was jeans and some causerelated tshirt using his big chest to advertise saving the whales disarming the populace or promoting world peace todays shirt invited us to plant a tree his other nod to calculated bohemianism was a perfect little trimmed triangle of beard that sprouted on his chin pointing downward it was like a small medal of hair pinned to his face his eyes were dark quick and intelligentwithout the haunted look one hears vets have all i really knew about him was that he did occasional computer consulting for software companies in austin and that he was involved in the vietnam veterans movement your farms looking good i offered by way of conversation he shrugged again an odd motion that evoked french schoolgirls more than burly veterans credit my dad and my brother they do all the work i just live here i couldnt imagine my family letting me do drugs on the porch but maybe the blalocks figured matt had earned special privileges i hope theyll be reopening the library soon matt observed in his lazy drawling voice i dont want to have to move our vets meeting on account of that bitch i loathed beta harcher but even i wouldnt have said something that insensitive shes dead matt have some respect dingdong jordy matt laughed the witch is dead look im not one to render tears or even one moment of fake sympathy over someone i despised she hated me and i hated her and that was fine he turned his wheelchair to face me you may not think its fine now matt i answered you had a key to the library you obviously didnt get along with her the cops have got your number he shrugged again my shoulders would get tired if i only had one gesture to rely on he kept his hands wearing fingerless gloves near his wheels theyve already been out here chief moncrief and that snotnosed prosecutor of his those two are useless whoever killed baiteye is going to outfox them ive no doubt junebugs used to dealing with offenders who show him their monogrammed belt buckles when he asks for id and billy ray bummel walks his kid to school cause theyre in the same grade jesus he laughed a dry rustling sound deep in his throat so weve got us a clever killer yep someone got her into the library conked her and isnt leaving a trace anywayhe sipped teait had to be planned can you imagine ol baiteye causing a crime of passion he slapped his leg in amusement ive always thought of you as one of the smarter people in town matt i smiled maybe you did it he considered the possibility maybe i did although i heard she got it with one blow id have been slower lots i wondered if hed seen slow killing before the look on matts face made my throat tighten you heard what that woman said to me at the board meetings jordy when i came to talk on behalf of library patrons i had and i looked at the overgrowth on his property embarrassed as blunt and unlikable as matt could be betas cruelty toward him had been unbelievable when he spoke against her censorship stand she brought out her most vicious artillery i saw the scene in my minds eye a redfaced beta screeching and spitting at matt calling his veterans newsletter unpatriotic and saying it was best he was crippled since he couldnt be as seditious from a wheelchair i do hate venom even adam hufnagel and his wife betas strongest allies had begged her to stop id seen matts hands grip the arms of his chair his knuckles bleached of blood fighting for control i think i had realized then exactly what sort of twisted person i was dealing with in beta harcher the next meeting the board removed her she even called here at the house a couple of times matt scratched at his funky patch of beard told my father he should just push me out into the countryside and leave me to die he laughed daddy told her id survived worse than the mirabeau scenery and she could kiss his big white ass im sure that mended fences screw her he said his voice sounding loose and a little drunk im glad shes dead were you this open with the police matt no i wasnt this open he answeredand i knew why hed rolled the joint id smelled after the visit from junebug matt was a little high and a little more talkative i considered matt he appeared completely forthright unlike tamma and bob don i decided on unmitigated honesty did junebug mention a list of betas that they found yeah he did allowed i was on some list of hers didnt say who else was on it i told him it was probably her shit list cause she sure wasnt doing her early christmas shopping for me well im on the list too along with others who have connections to the library so she was pissed at everyone at the library tell me something new each name had a bible quote next to it matt would you like to know what yours is that threw him he actually moved back slightly in his wheelchair not that it matters but yeah i would its appropriately a quote from matthew a famous one verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me i paused what do you think she meant by that matt putting that quote by your name his fingers tented over his mouth containing his laughter how could i betray that bitch i sure wasnt on her side you cant betray an enemy matt gestured with his tea sloshing some of it on the porch floor he ignored it and smiled at me like a general at untrained troops and what was your quote jordy something about keeping objectionable library materials im not up on my bible never had much use for all that claptrap anyway i set my tea down and repeated my quote about good and evil matt laughed again his merriness gave me the creeps i thought he might keep laughing and just not stop je sus i wish i had so much spare time to muck around in other peoples lives making lists with fucking bible quoteswhat total horseshit where were you last night matt around ten or so he quit laughing and glared at me i think i resent you even asking me such a question im sure junebug and billy ray asked you oh they did but they were more interested in you he didnt need to put the extra stress on the last word it hit me like a rock is that the purpose of this little social call jordy to start pointing fingers of blame at everyone else to get the heat off yourself i dont need to point fingers i retorted i didnt kill her but i want to know who did i dont care much for being implicated in a murder you hated her and you had keys to the library but im in a wheelchair he said mockingly dont you hide behind it matt those arms of yours are plenty powerful im sure you could hit a home run with a bat or bash in betas head just as easy as pie but i was here jordy matt whispered with a smile i was here with my family to back me up is your alibi that good it wasnt and it made me feel mad i stood alibis can be broken matt im sure when junebug interrogates everyone else involved in the censorship fight the hatred between you and beta will become an issue i may have to mention it to him myself with that i turned for the door matt didnt permit me the last word dont interrupt him jordy hell be busy reading you your miranda rights then low bitter laughter i slammed the porch door and headed for my car a brilliantly splitting headache hit me after my confrontation with matt as i drove back into town from the blalock farm i massaged my temples and reviewed my predicament id always rather liked matt although i didnt know him very well he had a reputation in the town for being a smart aleck and a loudmouth but id seen him face down betas abuse without ever sinking to her level what surprised me was the depth of his venom he abhorred beta harcher as much as she did him id thought hed be above that with his concern for baby seals and whatnot i wondered what the autopsy on her body would show could the blow have come from someone seated if so matt made a prime candidate i turned from the farm road onto mayne still a bit outside the city limits i wasnt making too spectacular a debut as an investigator i had some possibly meaningless bible verses and a list of suspects a baptist ministers wife who seemed too mousy to say boo but maybe wasnt a usedcar salesman who wanted to protect me but maybe didnt and a bitter antagonistic activist no doubt there i didnt place any of them above suspicion unfortunately no one was understudying my unwanted role of prime suspect i hadnt eaten lunch so i swung toward home i took the long way around instead of going right onto lee street for the straight shot i turned early driving down gregg street beta harchers house sat at the end of the road gregg would have gone farther but a hundred yards beyond betas backyard the land tumbled down to the colorado i drove slowly past the house deciding to look like any gawker a tv van from one of the austin stations was parked by the curb an immaculately groomed blonde with a microphone chatted with a heavy elderly woman whod put on her sunday best for the cameras in olden days vultures attended sudden death today we have the media on impulse i uturned and headed to the library there were a couple of officiallooking cars there but no cameras or lollygaggers i steered homeward hoping that there wouldnt be cars i didnt want to see i wasnt entirely lucky candaces mercedes was perched in the driveway i sighed parked and went in mama was animated telling a politely nodding candace about her marriage nuptial bliss wasnt candaces favorite topic of conversation at least in public candace had changed clothes wearing a stylish banana republic tshirt faded and nicely snug jeans and a fancy belt studded with silver conchos she looked gorgeous and i reminded myself again that she was a coworker as i walked in she jumped to her full if diminutive height and where the hell have you been excuse my language mrs poteet but im mad at your son mama assured herself i was her son with a glance and seemed satisfied uhout i answered what was i supposed to say sleuthing interrogating suspects well i want you to know what ive had to go through to protect your good name candace said archly i raised a hand to fend off the oncoming torrent where are sister and mark theyve run to the grocery store she paused the police called mark to confirm you were here last night i came here cause i got tired of hunting you down andi needed to see you after this mornings shock i swallowed she needed me i deflected a blush by asking a question what happened at the station youll be delighted to know i wasnt bodysearched candace huffed although i wouldnt put it past billy ray honestly i told them what little i knew and that nasty billy ray kept trying to hint that youd killed miss harcher i repeatedlymind you repeatedlytold him that was utterly ridiculous but he didnt get the hint what a moron wouldnt surprise me a bit if his family tree didnt fork hes still trying to implicate me i wanted details candace threw her hands up in the air tried but i set him straight i gave him a piece of my mind and then some thanks candace i said happy that she was on my side she smiled then and i felt a bit awkward i didnt want to encourage her after all shes my assistant and we have to keep our relationship professional not personal i dont understand any of this mama said looking to candace candace heaved air horrified at what shed said in front of my mother now mrs poteet dont you worry about jordy im going to take care of everything the police are just misguided itll all get settled she patted mamas hand would you like some lunch mama shook her head no i want a nap candace volunteered to take mama upstairs and get her settled so i made turkey sandwiches with lots of mayonnaise tomato and lettuce on wheat bread i dumped a small bag of corn chips on each plate and popped two cold cans of dr pepper i put the plates on the table and sat down with my lunch and my ruminations holding true to the rule that i get little peace in my home candace rejoined me before i was half through now jordy she said pulling up a chair i want the truth where have you been she dug into her sandwich and after the first bite smiled i guess im not a bad cook for a bachelor i told her about my interviews with tamma hufnagel bob don goertz and matt blalock candace was quite prepared to be my watson aha that tamma hufnagel probably a crazed killer you always have to look out for the quiet ones she asserted she acts timid but i think theres a toughness underneath maybe shes too quiet my point exactly or theres bob don id never buy a car from that crook youd never buy american candace and he doesnt sell imports well if i get the sudden urge for a chrysler im going to honest eds in bavary candace announced he seemed to have a secret but he also seemed inclined to help me i finished my sandwich of course candace slapped her forehead he wants to find out how much you know cause hes the killer makes perfect sense stay away from him jordy bob don didnt get nearly as upset as matt blalock warped by his wartime experiences candace intoned poor guy beta made him snap and he saw her as a vietcong probably called her charlie right before he whacked her the phone rang and i reached for it grateful for the interruption candace grabbed it away reporters she hissed as though there were lepers on the line she spoke guardedly into the receiver poteet residence a moments silence then a may i ask whos calling was it suddenly cooler in here or was it just me let me see if hes available the cold front swept through as swift and sure as one from canada ruth wills for you i took the receiver hoping the frostbite would be minimal thanks candace she made no move to give me privacy ruth sounded amused i see you have an answering service these days jordy um yes just for today im not surprised youre screening calls i hear you discovered the late beta harcher this morning are you okay the amusement left her voice to be replaced by husky softness a murmur to be heard on the nextdoor pillow not a voice youd expect to hear inquiring about your emotional wellbeing fine thank you did you hear that from junebug yes i did he stopped by the hospital this morning to talk with me she paused again i need to speak to you in person could we have dinner tonight i was a little taken aback finding beta dead and ruth wills asking me out fortunes wheel was spinning every which way today i dont know please say yes jordy look im still on duty i wanted to see you sooner and not under these circumstances but please please meet me tonight the voice had me like a pipe enchanting a snake okay when out of the corner of my eye i saw candace stiffen seven meet me at rositas that was a nice mexican restaurant in bavary fine i said thanks she hung up without a goodbye and i replaced the phone in its cradle what did ruth want candace examined the last of her corn chips with profound absorption she wanted to discuss some library business with me maybe regarding beta i shrugged no big deal candace measured me on some internal scale she tented her cheek with her tongue and looked at me again i felt awkward why did she always do that to me it was damped annoying suddenly i wanted her gone i have some other matters to attend to today i said but candace didnt let me finish you go and do that ill stay here and keep an eye on your mom thats not necessary candace really ill wait for sister to come home i dont mind ill watch tv arlene should be back soon go talk with ruth or whatever it is you have to do i decided not to mention that ruth invited me to dinner best to beat a diplomatic retreat out of my own house leaving i shook my head at my own cowardice a tall bronzed teenager who was my third cousin tended the dense flower beds that made up most of eula mae quiffs lawn he was almost hidden in the wild explosions of rhododendrons roses daisies and every other odd mixture of flower that eula mae favored her garden had as much order and as much color as her novels hally schneider his tan face damp with sweat looked up and favored me with a friendly smile hey there jordy you lookin for miz quiff yeah shes inside getting me a drink she oughta be right back like a stage cue eula mae appeared on her porch with a glass of iced tea she came down the stairs her baggy dress hanging about her bony fortyish body and fluttering in the breeze her hair was its usual explosion of red curls pulled into a semblance of order with a paisley scarf she wore large earrings that looked like they were handmade in africa her hands were elegantly bejeweled and her nails were long and lacquered i wonder how she typed on her keyboard id known eula mae a long time her daddy and my daddy had been friends since she was a little over ten years older than me we hadnt been close when i was a kid but when i moved back to town shed been my staunchest supporter in the library wars with beta she handed hally the drink and favored me with a sly eye here you go hally dear drink up thanks miz quiff hally said gulping down the tea i saw eula mae ogling him her avid eyes locked on where his thick neck met his broad shoulders i coughed im sorry to interrupt your labors eula mae but i need to speak with you of course jordy where are my manners come sit on the porch with me and have some tea i turned to hally you going to be here for a while he nodded still got a fair amount of weeding to do okay id like to talk with you when im done visiting with eula mae if hally seemed surprised he didnt show it he just nodded and knelt back to his gardening eula mae and i walked up the long path to her gracious home it reminded me of a shrunken antebellum mansion one you might find on a hollywood lot shed lived there alone since her terminally shy sister patty died ten years ago id always wondered if patty simply succumbed to eula maes ego she gestured languidly toward a porch chair and went inside loose pages lying on a wicker table caught the breeze at their corners and gently turned up printing and red marks covered the paper eula maes latest i leaned forward to peek and one of eula maes multitude of cats yowled at me from a white whicker chair i stuck my tongue out and the cat raised its head snidely my hostess returned with another glass of tea and handed it to me absently she shoved the cat out of the chair the cat mewled in protest at the declining social standards on the porch while eula mae kept an eye on her gardener jesus eula mae why dont you just go out there and undress the poor kid she looked at me with reproach simply because i find your cousin aesthetically pleasing doesnt mean i want my way with him please im doing research research the displaced cat growled again and eula mae scooped him into her lap she stroked his fur contritely and he allowed her to place her cheek on him while she spoke yes jordy that boy is going to be the hero of my next work well someone very like him in form what about in mind hally was a good kid and a great athlete but not a straighta student my hero will have a bit more on the ball than hally but nothing more in terms of physical endowment eula mae answered we must always look for inspiration and never turn it away hed look divine painted on the cover of my next novel i think you could find all sorts of inspiration round here if you were writing a murder mystery i observed dryly i was working up to that eula mae answered but i didnt know your mental state you over your shock sugar pie she patted my knee in a friendly way the cat glared balefully at me the shock of finding her body yes for the time being the shock of being suspected of killing her not quite yet eula mae played dreamily with one of her errant curls yes the police have already been here asking me about you and our beloved beta she saw me tense and shook her head junebug cant possibly think you killed her you know hes really a sweet boy underneath all that bluster billy rays a different story though and junebug gets pressure from him she paused giving me a speculative stare so what was your quote i told her she shook her head the ringlets dancing around her face makes as much sense as mine job my desire is that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book well ive written several awardwinning books and i was her adversary big whoop whats the damn point of it all i take it junebug shared the list with you just my part he wouldnt divulge who else was on it i did she sat and listened thoughtfully harrumping at tamma hufnagel and bob don goertzs names at my mother and hally schneiders names she frowned dont understand that at all how could she hate or want to hurt someone with alzheimers andshe gestured in the direction of her gardenersomeone as sweet as hally i shrugged mama cant remember any connection with her and i dont know about hally maybe its some sick way of striking at me or janice schneider my lord eula mae said but not to me her eyes were back in the garden hally had removed his shirt and his bunched muscles moved smoothly as he worked eula mae sighed like a dieter in front of a candy store youth is wasted on the young jordy remember that with hally out of reach she appraised me you and hally do favor each other you know you both got those fine schneider looks shame youre still just an infant compared to me but of course candace is a different story i rolled my eyes look eula mae lets concentrate you know damn well that i didnt kill beta and im willing to give you the same benefit of doubt are you so sure she interrupted her voice as sweet and fake as snocone syrup i stopped dead im kidding she exclaimed but her eyes showed merriment at my discomfort i ran a tongue over dry lips so when was the last time you saw her i asked oh that nastiness in the library when she slapped the tar out of you not since no jordy lord what do you want an accounting of my movements all right perry mason ill be delighted to oblige murders one of the few crimes im still innocent of and i want to keep my unstained reputation after that little scene at the library i came back here did some work on the newest bookit features charity keepwell who i am sure youll remember from my very wellreceived lily of the alamo two books back then i had my dinner watched some television did a little editing and went to bed what time was that around ten and alone she seemed to have spotted something interesting on her nail the cat batted her sleeve wanting attention i see and you dont know of anyone who had a motive to kill beta lord sure i did that crazy matt blalock for one and i suppose even you i tried not to look menacing i hope you didnt make any such statement to the police eula mae leaned close to me and i could smell the slightly sour odor of old perfume no sugar pie i didnt motive yes but youre not stupid enough to commit murder but someone like matt blalock is or that ruth wills ruth my dinner date that possibility didnt promote good digestionand it might make conversation just a tad strained surely you could tell theres no love lost between ruth and beta i knew they didnt get along but are you keeping your ears in a jar beta tried to get ruth fired eula mae leaned back delighted in the miniature drama shed caused a beringed hand ran through her curly mane to heighten the effect what for i dont know all the details i just heard about it from my friend joan shes a secretary over at the hospital and a very ardent fan of mine of course sheer numbers preclude my having a real relationship with most of my fans but ive made an exception for joan such a perceptive reader and an extremely reliable source joan said beta claimed ruth tried to poison her when she was in the hospital last january what this was news to me oh the hospital shut it up because it was groundless eula mae sniffed just beta getting a visitation from satan and blaming it on ruth no one filed charges or anything i think the da over in bavary talked beta out of it cause it was so blasted silly so what happened between them eula mae waved her hand dismissing the need for details i dont know apparently beta was in the hospitalshed had some chest pains and they were keeping her for observationand she said ruth entered her room and tried to give her an injection when shed just been given some medication by another nurse according to beta ruth told her she was going to get hers and ruth tried to stick the needle in her beta screamed bloody murderyou know what a set of lungs the old witch hadand some other nurses rushed in of course ruth denied the whole crazy thing and there was no evidence to support betas charge i dont get it even if it were true why would ruth want to kill beta back then who knows community service perhaps its a lot of bullcrap if you ask me but noweula mae slid her glance slyly over her shoulderwho knows i mean beta did try to ruin her career but she failed ruth didnt lose her job they didnt even file charges why kill beta now this made little sense to me i dont know what else might have transpired between them ruth supported you in the censorship fight maybe theres some other dark secret between them eula maes eyes glowed with creativity as though she were plotting her next potboiler was ruth on that list what was her quote ruths was easy to remember especially in light of this revelation it was kings to wit there is death in the pot when i read it earlier i had no story such as this to relate it to now it sounded like beta considered ruth as mirabeaus own lucrezia borgia i repeated the quote to eula mae and enjoyed the momentary silence well my lord sounds like beta still held a grudge great i have a dinner date with ruth tonight my enthusiasm waned mind your cocktail sweetie eula mae laughed then her merry face darkened and grew serious well what if its not bullcrap and beta was right maybe you shouldnt go for gods sake even if it was true shed have no reason to poison me i stood and watched hally fill a trash bag with pulled weeds hey maybe hallys pulled up a toxic plant i can take with me for defense dont joke jordy i turned and looked at her the pretend drama was out of her face someone killed beta maybe someone on that list maybe not but its for the police to handle let them ruth called me she cant think that im snooping into her life i brightened maybe because of betas earlier accusation the policell think of ruth as a bigger suspect now you sound guilty eula mae reproved no one looks more culpable than the fellow who goes around trying to prove his innocence i stood and rested my forehead against the porch pillar thanks for the catch look if you saw how billy ray guns for me you were panicked this morning sug eula mae rested her knobby hand on my arm you found the dead body of someone you know in your workplace thats a profound shock i think youve borne it quite well but youve got to quit thinking that youre going to be arrested in the next ten seconds unless you find the killer its not healthy to worry so i hated to admit it but she made sense junebug surely wouldnt arrest meor anyone elsewithout hard evidence he was a professional after all i kept picturing him as the boy id grown up with and not as the responsible police chief he was hed done a good job for mirabeau billy ray was another story thanks eula mae i appreciate that yeah yeah right she wagged crimson fingernails at me just give me first rights to be your biographer from the hoosegow deal i nodded toward her scattered pages and then toward hally who was drying the sweat from his firm body with his shirt ill let our beloved jocelyn lushe get back to work have a good dinner dont let candace know she might poison you even if ruth doesnt you could always count on eula mae for moral support i headed back down the walk watching hally toss open another trash bag for the mound of weeds hed pulled i suppose eula mae was right even distantly related as third cousins still considered kin in this part of the country there was a family resemblance we both stood tall with thick blondish hair and green eyes and we had the distinctive stubborn schneider cheekbones that could freeze into refusal and mulishness at a moments notice but where i was lanky from running and idle reading hally was thicklybuilt from years of football and work id been a much gawkier kid hally was a senior at mirabeau high and was probably years ahead sexually of where id been at that age i just hoped he wasnt ahead of where i was now i shook his hand ignoring the dirt on his palms hey jordy hows cousin anne doing he asked i admit surprise the schneiders live no more than three houses down from us but theyve only shown a passing interest in mamas decline hallys annoyingly peppy mother janice boasted a better attendance record at library board meetings than she did in checking up on her neighboring kinfolk shes about the same hally he shook his head damn shame i know mom keeps meaning to come over and see you and arlene and anne i see mark in the neighborhood but i get the feeling that he doesnt care to discuss his grandmother i suspected that hally didnt do much to curry a friendship with mark hally was a senior a popular athlete from a perfect family mark was a moody freshman loner stuck with a mouthy mother a mouthier uncle and a diminishing grandmother i sighed i halfway felt like telling hally that the schneiders had been crappy kinfolk but i decided it wasnt the time or place its hard listen hally i wanted to see you about something else he looked bemusedly at the porch hope its not about miz quiff i assure you my intentions are honorable i laughed no not about eula mae curiosity couldnt resist though she hasnt acted uh inappropriately toward you has she it was his turn to laugh not at all although im sure she thinks i never see her looking at me i kind of like older women but eula maes not my type no i need to discuss a different topic with you i guess you heard about beta harcher hallys smile faded yeah i heard mom told me about it you found her in the library yeah and why didnt you ask me about that straightaway i wondered not every day someone you encounter has stumbled across a corpse and youd think the topic would debut damn early in the conversation did you know her hally blinked why are you asking i figured a football player like hally appreciated bluntness i told him about the list shock spilled across his face honest to god jordy i dont know why that woman would have my name there hally wiped a sweaty lip with the back of his gardengloved hand there was a bible quote by each name yours was proverbs fools make a mock at sin hallys tongue darted out to his lips and back again nervously why would she write something like that about me i thought youd know you been doing any sinnin lately i said it as nicely as i could but ive never believed in treating errant family members with kid gloves or garden gloves in this case hally looked spooked he took a step backward and fell over the bag of weeds dirt and twigs stuck to his sweaty back and he jumped up quickly brushing them off his jeans and mumbling about being clumsy in the offseason id seen that boy play football with the grace of a dancer so i crossed my arms and frowned at him whats got the chigger in your pants its a little unnerving you know to hear some dead person was writing shiti mean stuffabout you good thing sweet cousin janice wasnt there to hear her little boy cuss janice would smile big as day while she scrubbed your mouth with lye soap so how did beta know you hally she mustve to write what she did the words came quickly she knew mom from the library and the church i knew her from sunday school im president of the youth group there and she babysat for us sometimes when i had a date or something for school and mom and dad went out hally had been an only extraadored child until his little brother josh arrived five years ago much to janices embarrassment she was the kind of woman whod prefer no one know she was still getting sex at forty so you knew her socially i saw her at church she had some definite opinions about how the youth group should be run i remembered what tamma hufnagel said in the same vein betas need for control was an equalopportunity annoyance hally continued and i saw her about a week ago when she babysat josh after going to the movies in bavary i got home before mom and dad did so i relieved her put josh in the car and took her home i sighed hally seemed shook by all this and i couldnt blame him i was shook too but i didnt like that he wasnt able to meet my eyes for more than a second or two what was he hiding how did she act when you saw her i asked hally shrugged and pulled his tshirt back on same mean old bat as always i suppose she was still mad at mom for siding with you about banning books mom told her that didnt mean they couldnt still get along even if they disagreed so i think thats why mom asked her to babysit josh maybe to patch up miz harcher really seemed to like josh shed play games with him read him mother goose and pooh bear stories i kind of thought shed wished for a grandkid of her own beta harcher being nice to a child i imagined betas babysitting activities to include recanting of cartoons a delicious serving of cold gruel with a side order of guilt a spirited game of name that heretic and basics of book incineration kindness and stories that didnt involve retribution for sins hadnt occurred to me maybe thered been a heart under that stony skin and nothing unusual happened when you took her home i pressed hally looked nervous again running his tongue tip over his chapped lips his jaw worked well yeah but im sure it doesnt mean anything it was probably library business or something he glanced nervously toward the house i dont want to get in trouble and i dont want her in trouble i followed his eyes to the empty porch eula mae had vanished into her inner sanctum to be jocelyn lushe and chronicle the escapades of her latest pair of starcrossed lovers eula mae i asked what do you mean she was sitting on betas porch when we pulled up waiting for her miz harcher had left her porch light on and i could see miz quiff sitting up there miz quiff looked maddern hell she was sitting in a porch chair and she got up real slow from it when miz harcher got out of my car hally paused real slow you know like someone whos so mad that theyve got to move like molasses to keep from knocking the tar out of someone i know what you mean so what happened then hally scooped weeds from the ground and stuffed them in a bag nothing miz harcher said something like finally kissed josh goodnight and told me to get on home so i did hally tied off the lawn bag with a green piece of wire but im sure it doesnt mean anything he still didnt look at me if hed been making a mock at sin as beta suggested he wasnt going to look me in the eye and fess up you dont mind me asking do you hally where you were last night he did meet my eyes no i dont mind i was out with a girl chelsea hart didnt get home until after midnight he smiled and added even with a later curfew for spring break i missed it mom was mad i see well listen i got to go tell your mother ill stop by soon relief moved across his face like a shadow okay jordy you take care i walked away from my cousin and away from my friends house feeling as if even the people i knew and trusted werent being up front with me eula mae hadnt mentioned her little late night excursion to see beta last week hally behaved as if hed done worse than miss curfew knowing he was on that list shook him up and i wondered why hally rather than his libraryboard mother had made betas mysterious catalog excuse me but a dinner with ruth wills sister demanded the bathroom door didnt do a lot to mute her you cant go out on some date whos gonna stay here with mama mark can stay hes old enough to take care of her i made a face at the door the shaving cream made me look rabid i already felt it i think an adult should be here god have mercy you just found a body this morning and the police think you mightve killed her decent folksd stay home then i guess im indecent i ignored her reply and finished shaving ill call dorcas witherspoon and see if she can come over i splashed water on my face and turned to the shower maybe i can just call candace sister offered i couldnt immediately tell if she was teasing but i had my suspicions im sure shed be delighted to babysit mama while youve got a hot date bet she wouldnt mind at all give it a rest i turned the taps and drowned out her babble i stepped into the shower and let the water sluice over me i had found when i returned to mirabeau that the bathroom was a simple haven from mama sister and mark no wonder many middleaged men spend so much time there worry nagged at me more than sister did in a small town gossip runs rife betas charges against ruth had certainly been effectively muffled and it seemed doubly interesting that beta who was never stingy with accusations never mentioned her feud with ruth at the library board meetings the hospital ruth or someone else had managed to keep beta from hellfirenbrimstoning against ruth as mirabeaus resident poisoner that bothered me no end sister had returned downstairs when i snuck from the steamy bathroom down the hall to my old bedroom theres nothing quite like growing up in a house leaving it for years then coming back and living in your own room again id expected to hate the arrangement but with the stress of mamas disease it comforted me its like putting on a very old and comfortable pair of jeans and finding theyve stretched a little to match your longer legs the bed id slept in as a teenagerthe one id lost my virginity in one thunderous spring afternoon when mama daddy and sister had gone to visit friends in bastropwas still there my legs still stuck out a tad over the edge during sleep id taken down the dusty academic awards and the track trophies from mirabeau high and replaced them with art thatd hung in my condo in boston the mark rothko prints and the ansel adams photographs looked out of place with the antique furniture but i didnt care i needed some link to my middle life the one id sandwiched between childhood and unexpected adulthood in mirabeau i slipped a cd into my portable stereo id put on my old study desk and got dressed while miles davis made his trumpet sing a sketch of spain i picked khakis brown loafers and a nicely tailored chambray shirt rositas wasnt fancy by boston standards but i wanted to look presentable for ruth i thought about a tie decided id look like a doofus wearing a tie if i wasnt going to church and tossed it back on the bed i didnt get away scotfree the phone rang and i scooped it up get your business wrapped up with ruth wills candace asked archly no candace i didnt feel like fibbing maybe sister really had called her just about to though so where are you meeting her she mustve smelled my cologne through the receiver some women can do that there was no getting past this and i got a little hot candace was my friend and coworker but nothing more no matter how cute and caring she could be she could also be damned aggravating i didnt owe her an explanation look candace she asked me out to dinner she wants to discuss beta and ive found out some other information that makes me want to talk to ruth even more well i want to discuss beta too candace i began but didnt finish didnt have a prayer ill tell you this but if my mother finds out im in deep mud beta banked at mothers bank here in town and she deposited cash into her savings account a week ago good lord where did she get that kind of money candace finished my sentence with a vexatious amount of smugness damn good question god candace howd you find that out thats supposed to be confidential mother better not find out i got one of the tellers to help me she told me the police were already looking into betas accounts well thats interesting candace i assume that miz harcher didnt generally deposit that kind of money in her account candace snorted nope hardly ever had a balance over five thousand and most of that from the trust her daddy left her she wasnt poor but she wasnt wealthy either i recalled the conversations id had today and how that money might fit in i glanced at my watch i was going to be late getting over to bavary i got to go candace ill phone you later tonight that placated her okay dont have any fun with that witch i hung up and my male pride roared at me why on earth did i promise to call candace after seeing ruth i didnt owe candace an uptotheminute activity report as i descended the stairs sister lectured a sullen mark about taking care of mama mark turned hostile eyes on me i had plans tonight you know you aint the only one with a social life sorry mark ill make it up to you maybe if i bought him a playboy hed warm up to me only problem was if sister found out shed warm up even faster as in nuclear meltdown well just make sure you come home tonight mark said dont worry im not out to score i dont mean that uncle jordy just dont get arrested rositas screamed with color the walls were a riotous lime green to accompany the riotous behavior the margaritas could cause adorned with oversized and vibrant paintings of red parrots rainbowbeaked toucans and black sombreros tinny latino music chirped from mounted speakers there was a patio that faced a side street in bavary but it overflowed with customers who were slurping down drinks stuffing nachos in their faces and all talking simultaneously i wanted quiet for my teteatete with ruth i went in and was heartened that most patrons were taking advantage of the nice clear night outdoors the dining room wasnt too crowded a beautiful young woman with ebony eyes and luxurious black hair approached me with a smile im meeting someone i began but she didnt let me finish you mr poteet yes this way please i followed her to a dim corner booth where ruth wills sat as comfortable as a cat curled up on a pillow her brown hair swept up in a flattering way and her eyes were dark in the pale light she looked a little more urbane than the typical customer in a black mock turtleneck and tailored gray slacks a simple diamond pendant hung about her neck i tried not to stare at the diamond since it reposed on her shapely breasts i didnt want her to mistake why i was here her physical attractiveness hadnt lured me here i reminded myselfi wanted answers but suddenly i found myself swallowing when a simple hello would have done nicely jordy she said offering me her hand i took it wondering for a moment if kissing it was out of the question her customary attire was a baggy sweatshirt and jeans she looked lovely that way but now she was positively gorgeous and had she changed her voice she spoke as smoothly as the curve of her hip ruth nice to see you you could tell i was making my small talk extrasuave and elegant i coughed for refuge and sat ive taken the liberty of ordering a pitcher of margaritas she murmured i hope you dont mind thats fine i tried to get seated comfortably without making the vinyl squeak i wanted us to get together socially im sorry that i waited until such sad circumstances she placed a hand near her pendant as though taking a pledge granted that miss harcher was not the most beloved person in town but as a nurse i find it hard to wish anyone ill this girl couldnt have poisoned a rabid rat i thought then pulled on the mental reins keep actions related to mind i told myself im a weak man in some regards and ruth sapped my strength lets not talk about that right now i made my voice purr as best i could how about an appetizer we made it through the meal without mentioning any bodies id recently discovered the conversation stayed safely within limits the hopes for next seasons mirabeau bees highschool football team ruths life in the coastal city of corpus christi before shed come to mirabeau my life in boston amidst all those yankees it was a nice dinner quesadillas stuffed with jalapenos and cheese chicken flautas for her beef enchiladas smothered in cheese and chili con carne for me spanish rice and refried beans for both and margaritas served in bluerimmed glasses that could have doubled as goldfish bowls i finished one feeling tip top and hardly noticed when ruth poured me another beta didnt rear up from the grave until we were filling our powdered sugary sopapillas with honey it must have beenruth finished loading the hollow pastry with honeyhorrendous finding her body terrible shock for you and poor dear candace more for me i guess candace was a rock yes i would think so ruth bit into the bottom of her sopapilla pulled it away from her mouth and let the honey drip onto her tongue and yes i watched it was downright fascinating she swallowed the honey then sipped at her margarita candace seems to be quite strong where youre concerned i felt a need to explain candace is my friend and my assistant we have a professional relationship really i think if you were a library book shed have you checked out constantly i smiled thinly lets not talk about candace she gave a quick cut of her hand over her glass fine its a dull subject anyway i didnt let that pass you brought her up why do you care if shes interested in me i normally wasnt so forward but i didnt like her picking on candace and the margarita felt like liquid bravery what makes you think i care she asked you invited me to dinner ruth not the other way around i shrugged i figured that beta harcher was the proposed topic she laid her fork down as though in surrender her eyes dark with smoke met mine and for the first time i felt a little afraid of her shed poured the margarita for me and now i wondered if it didnt have the slightest lethally chemical taste touche and im sorry i picked on yourher mind searched for an appropriate term for candacelittle friend so what about beta i asked who killed her i dont know who do you think did it ruth leaned forward not you im not saying that out of any sort of fear toward you gee thanks thatll keep me from cutting your throat later unexpectedly she broke into raucous laughter other tables glanced our way saw the empty pitcher and lost interest i couldnt keep from smiling at her despite feeling that the joke just wasnt funny she poked my arm with short painted fingernails i like you jordy youre on the edge thanks i think i mean it jordy youre so different from most people in mirabeau god the entire towns a bore i stiffened the margarita glass halfway to my lips you dont like mirabeau she made a dismissive noise i suppose there are worst places but dont you find it unbearable after the big city i finished the sip of margarita id started did i hate it here perhaps i had when id first come home the shock of mamas illness the tension between sister and me and the stress of taking over at the library hadnt made mirabeau seem congenial but when i thought about it mirabeau was still home you can take the boy out of the country but not the country out of the boy coming home had been a rediscovery of sorts that people waved and spoke to you on the street even if they didnt know you and they werent begging or raving that neighbors all knew each other that you could sleep with a window open on a lovely spring night without fear so what if we didnt have a sushi bar id just as soon use raw fish for bait down on the colorado i smiled thinly no i like it here she flicked her tongue across her smile maybe i am in trouble didnt mean to bash sweet ol mirabeau lets get back to beta i didnt mean to debate mirabeaus merits she lowered her eyes staring at her empty glass beta yknow ive seen plenty of people die in my line of work you avoid sympathy because you just cant spend the energy ive cried more over an unknown child that died in the emergency room than i ever will over beta harcher she shrugged a slow uncoiling movement you didnt have a cordial past with her i said she sipped at her margarita rolling the crushed ice and salt in her mouth and studied me over the glass no i didnt we didnt agree about the library and even less about the hospital ruths nerves didnt move much less jump she smiled so you know about that little stink she made i have a distinct feeling that if shed been poisoned last night youd be spending quality time with junebug moncrief right now that whole incident was utterly ridiculous crazy woman that she was i almost felt sorry for her until she died one item confuses me no end i said why she didnt raise this issue at some point in the censorship fight at the library with you on my side and her against us she would have vented full steam she sure in hell didnt spare me eula mae or matt blalock i wasnt certain that breath was still escaping from her lips her dark eyes traveled my face as though looking for a crack i blinked i waited finally she shrugged as if the question were unimportant it didnt happen i never ever tried to poison her or harm her in any way she made it up because she hated my guts how did the hospital keep her from makinguh unfounded accusations she straightened they know me there and they knew her story was bullshit the hospital told her theyd sue her for slander libel whatever if she claimed that i tried to hurt her they meant it and she saw that so she shut up i should have tried that approach with her at the library got me an attorney considering that the only attorney i knew was my uncle bid that was a wholly unappetizing prospect ruth laughed again we could have kept a whole firm litigating against her so why did she make that charge against you ruth if it was foundless im curious as to her motive what possessed that womanno pun intendedanyhow jordy you know how judgmental and demanding she was shed get into her head that you were a sinner and that she was going to get you goodbefore god had a chance ruths eyes held mine for a long moment crazy people dont need motives so she just made up that story about you trying to kill her for no good reason thats right like i said she was nuts odd i always thought she knew exactly what she was doing if she did it it was because she didnt like me maybe she was planning her censorship campaign then and knowing id side against her she decided to smear me off the board look jordyher voice imparted frustrationshe redefined pathetic okay i wont argue with you on that point you might want to save your arguments for the police ruth frowned you said you didnt know who killed her the police and that bumpkin da asked me about you and miss harcher like how bad did it get between the two of you at the board meetings they wanted to know if you threatened her at the meetings someone told billy ray that you said you couldve killed beta i kept from groaning who had been standing there after ruth hustled beta out eula mae tamma and almost six other library regulars i wished id bitten off my intemperate tongue billy ray asked me to confirm that when i told him i saw the fight between you and beta but i told him i hadnt heard you say any such thing thanks billy rays hot on my trail ruth shook her head i already told you i dont think you did it whoever killed that woman had to hate her from the getgo it couldnt have been a crime of passion no one loved her passion can mean hate too and matt sure seems to have hated her ruth wills drew back from the table resting against the booth she shook her head no i dont believe matt could murder anyone it was an unexpected defense you should have seen him today he hated her guts i didnt like her neither did you or eula mae i think she irritated bob don and the hufnagels more than theyd admit but matt despised her she shook her head again i dont know matt very well but he served his country and i dont think hed kill beta then who she leaned forward it obviously had to be someone she knew she wouldnt have been in the library with a stranger she didnt have a key tamma hufnagel says beta swiped adams key i interjected ruth snorted whatever regardless of who had the key she wouldnt have been there late at night with someone she didnt know so why was she at the library i dont know she was meeting someone there someone she couldnt meet elsewhere because they needed privacy if she had to meet with someone on the library board why not at the deserted library she tapped fingertips on the table she could have met me at my placei live alone same with eula mae but not so with matt bob don janice schneider reverend hufnagel or you you all have keys and you all have families in your homes now i dont think that you or matt did it adam hufnagels the biggest stuffed shirt i can imagine but he is a preacher and i dont think hes a killer janice schneiderpardon me i know shes kin to youis a wimp that just leaves bob don i opened my mouth and shut it again i hadnt given much thought to why beta was at the library id assumed shed wanted to get rid of books shed objected to so why would bob don want to kill her i asked ruth smirked i would pick him when you start narrowing down the options why bob don i thought of bob dons heartiness toward me his seeming willingness to help me and tammas story of his arrival at betas as she left looking angry something that happened last saturday ive been looking at buying a pickup truck and bob dond told me hed give me a good price i stopped by the dealership late saturday after i got off my shift at the hospital hed told me hed deal with me direct so i went back to his office ruth fidgeted for a minute beta was there i heard her voice even before i was at the door she was screaming at him telling him he was nothing but a lousy lying sinner i opened the doori actually thought something violent was going on beta and bob don were in there all right and bob don looked like id just kept him from committing murder his face was all bloated and red he was so mad beta had spit on her chin and she was waving that damned old bible of hers in his face the tension the hatred in that room she shivered all news to me my god what happened i asked she drained the last of her margarita i muttered something about how they were yelling loud enough to raise the dead i thought bob don was going to have a stroke hes got one of those pulsy veins in his forehead that jitter when hes mad beta gave me one of those triumphant little sneers she told bob don to remember what she said or you know wholl pay you dont want em hurt do you i cant forget the words because she said them with such contempt she threatened him with me right there i was speechless she called me a namei believe hussy was her new vocabulary word then she pushed past me and left i saw bob don today junebug and billy ray paid him a visit ruth nodded they saw me at the hospital this morning i told them where id been last night that was their first question and then i told them about bob don and beta so where were you last night she didnt seem to mind the question on duty at the hospital i worked a double shift cause im taking off some time later this month so did bob don say anything to you after beta left like i said i was ready to call the cops i thought his aorta was about to conk out he just sank into his chair and looked up at me like hed never seen me before ruth fell silent as a smiling talkative waiter cleared the table of the empty pitcher and plates after he hustled away she continued i asked him if he was okay and he didnt even answer me the first time he finally said hed be fine so i left it was weird ive seen a look like that in my work when somebody hears a loved one has died or that theyre terminally ill bob don hed been hearty not shaken when i was in his office from ruths account you might have thought hed weep in relief when i told him beta was dead hed acted like he was hardly affected what had she done to him who were the they she threatened to hurt i was still thinking when she propositioned me i almost didnt hear her what i said thinking shed misspoken i said lets go back to my place weve both had rotten days jordy maybe we can help each other relax her voice already felt like hands gently massaging my shoulders a red fingernail idly traced the hair on my wrist now i grew up a hick but that awkwardness was long past me id been a big boy for a while and could handle a sexually aggressive and confident woman god knows i was attracted to her the yes halfformed on my tongue till i thought of betas allegations against her and eula maes warning to be careful i liked ruth but i wasnt sure i trusted her and i was suddenly far too tired not that candace did not influence my decision in any way remotely no thanks ruth i appreciate the offer but its been a long and stressful day i need to get on home she smiled a smile she didnt mean i saw her eyes crinkle in anger for a bare moment she wasnt accustomed to refusal and she didnt like it the crinkle faded i understand why dont you call me when youre feeling more up to par i nodded wondering if she was challenging my potency with that last remark i walked her out to her car it was a red miata cool wheels i said she patted it my vice she said i know its an indulgence but nurses dont get many chances to spoil themselves i got an inheritance from my aunt in corpus and decided to splurge she opened the door and slid inside elegantly i fought back a sudden fantasy of checking myself into the hospital and letting ruth give me a sponge bath hows your mom she asked unexpectedly best as could be expected must be hard on you she said thoughtfully emotionally and financially yes it is on both counts she gave me a speculative smile and cranked her engine i promised to call her later and watched her drive off i walked to my blazer thinking what an idiot i was here was a gorgeous woman who was practically throwing herself at me and here i was too tired antsy and distrusting for even a roll in the hay lord knows my sex life had evaporated since id moved back to mirabeau maybe id entirely lost my drive my pants felt tight and i decided that wasnt my problem i liked ruth but i didnt particularly relish bedding anyone on betas list there were too many unanswered questions and i wasnt entirely sure i believed ruths disclaimers about betas lies i pushed in the blazers cigarette lighter and fished a pack out of my glove compartment id stuck them there last week vowing to quit if ruth could have her miata i could have my vice too as a smoking spot the blazer was a damn poor substitute for ruth willss bed i got home relieved to see that i wasnt going to be policed either by junebug or candace the carport was empty inside mark sat close to the tv as arnold schwarzenegger shot his way through a group of extras in one of the terminator films the gunfire whispered with the sound turned low mama watched the movie a sure sign of her illness shed never have countenanced one of those bloodfests before she got sick hey how are yall i asked mark glared up at me from the couch well despite that i didnt get to go to randys house tonight im trying to have just a little fun mark started snidely but i held up a hand listen mark listen real good since youre about to hit puberty youll soon realize life isnt fair and youll realize that life is too short to listen to whiners youve got about onetwentieth of the problems of everyone else in this house so having to forfeit one evening isnt going to kill you your grandmothers sick your moms busting her ass at that crappy truck stop to clothe and feed you and im trying to figure out who really killed beta harcher so i dont end up in jail so my dear nephew just shut up his jaw fell as if the hinge had vanished mama certainly wouldnt have cottoned to me chastising her adored grandbaby but she wasnt sure who mark was his eyes flashed again and then went back to the tv i went into the kitchen and brewed some decaf leaning over the sink i rinsed out my mouth with tap water trying to clean out the sting of lime and tequila i was buzzed from the drinks yet i was too hyper to go to bed and plop down too many fingers pointing blame tamma pointing at bob don bob don pointing at tamma matt pointing at me eula mae pointing at ruth hally pointing at eula mae ruth pointing at bob don giving him the early lead and worst of all billy ray pointing at me with the finger hed chiseled off the statue of blind justice over at the county courthouse i poured my coffee then stirred in milk and some sweetn low none of that heman black coffee for me id rather chew barbed wire i went past the onscreen carnage in the living room wished mama and a blissfully silent mark goodnight and took my coffee upstairs in my room i slid a marychapin carpenter cd into the player and let her wistful lyrics croon in my ear country music has sure improved in the last couple of years even bringing back fans like me who didnt know there were other kinds of music until we were teenagers when we jumped over to other parts of the jukebox most of my cd collection remains jazz and classical id fallen for both in college but the country stack kept growing with folks like marychapin lyle lovett jimmie dale gilmore tish hinojosa and rosanne cash putting out beautiful intelligent albums i needed to put my thoughts in order i wrote down the names of everyone on betas list it was the key to the mystery i was sure i also wrote down what questions remained as far as i could see i wrote steadily trying not to lapse into the bad habit of chewing on my pen i fought back the craving for a cigarette while i sat and thought over the days events marychapin finished her songs and i replaced her with lyle lovetts dryly witty mix of jazz blues and country i made three trips downstairs for coffee the last time i helped mama up to bed and got her settled for the night her medicine had relaxed her and she didnt argue as i got her into her nightdress she lay back on her pillows her eyes looked dull and listless compared with the highly intelligent eyes that id stared into during dinner you were gone did you have a nice time mama asked it was unusual for her to notice that someone was around or not maybe this was a sharper moment for her yes mama i did have a nice time thank you for asking thats good she patted my hand might as well try mama do you remember beta harcher she was a lady at the baptist church and she did work for the library worked against the library but that was too many details for mama mama didnt like questions they frustrated her i dont know i dont know its okay i just thought you might remember her ask your father she said sleepily that advice wasnt particularly helpful i counted my blessings anyway many alzheimers patients spend their nights keeping their caretakers awake mama embraced sleep tonight i kissed her cheek turned out the lights and went down to retrieve the cup of decaf id left when mama asked me to take her upstairs the television fell silent as i came down the stairs mark crouched on the couch staring at his beloved hightop sneakers instead of me i ignored him and picked up my cooling mug of coffee sorry about before he muttered im sure its the same kind of apology his daddy never bothered to give my sister apology accepted i sat down next to him and lifted his chin so his eyes met mine god he was growing up quick itd only seemed like yesterday hed been a baby that gurgled and cooed happily at his uncle jordy look mark im not mad at you its just that you have to understand the situation were all in as you pointed out to me yesterday your mamaw is not getting better she is never going to get better i shouldnt have kidded you that shes ever going to improve and we all have to do what we can to hold together as a family were all making sacrifices your mothers working ungodly hours i gave up a good job and moved back here where i have practically no career opportunities so you have to help do your share too and sitting with your mamaw when we need you to is not too much to ask and how long till you get tired of it uncle jordy mark asked acidly im sorry i snapped at you before but this noble act isnt flying with me everyones saying how great you are for coming back here and helping with mamaw well big fucking deal he waited to see if the language shocked me i stayed as still as stone he continued his words spilling out youll get tired of it sooner or later and youll haul butt back to boston or wherever you damn well please youre not going to find any job in mirabeau to make you happy living heres going to wear thin and youll take your nobleness say thanks to me and mom and youll be gone his thin face paled and those young dark eyes dampened with angry tears is that what you think mark thats what happens it always happens he got up and started up the stairs im not your daddy you know im not going anywhere i wouldve called louder but i didnt want to wake mama marks steps paused for one brief moment on the stairs then resumed their pounding i heard his door shut maybe that explained the anger and the snotty comments he was thirteen starting that terribly awkward age and hed never known a man who stuck around his father cut out when he realized mark and sister meant responsibility my and sisters dad had inconsiderately died sisters subsequent few boyfriends didnt seem much taken with the idea of an ill motherinlaw and another mans child why should this faraway uncle suddenly appear as the silvered knight of trust i leaned back on the couch i understood his worry god knows id been tempted to leave sister still tended to treat me like a pesky little brother who foiled her plans mama could drive you crazy with her repetitive behavior her restless nights her lack of being the woman who raised me marks mouth outdid mine at his age and mirabeau didnt offer much in the way of employment in my field id gotten calls from friends at brooksjellicoe the publisher id worked for in boston seeing if id changed my mind seeing how mama was doing and inquiring if i was considering coming back they wouldnt keep calling forever and what would i do after mama passed away that could be next week or in twenty years i wouldnt have a career left thats what being a caretaker did to you stripped you of yourself and replaced it with a distorted mirror image of the sick person you sacrificed your life for id look in the mirror someday and see mama instead of myself i groaned i was turning into norman bates from psycho i warmed my coffee and went back upstairs id nearly finished my notes i turned off the stereo then read over what id written questions about beta why did she make that list of names connected to the library and why was she carrying it around with her why was she dressed all in black not her usual attire why was mud caked on her shoes had not rained in the past couple of days why was she at the library at night how did she get a key tamma hufnagel says beta swiped adams key why did the killer use the bat in my office because it was handy or to implicate me handiness indicates that the killer came into my office bat was behind my desk where did that in her account come from who benefits under her will maybe this has nothing to do with the library after all betas list tamma hufnagelministers wife her quote is numbers be sure your sin will find you out what sin had tamma committed that beta knew about something that could ruin her or just something that beta used to irritate her hally schneidermy third cousin son of library board member janice schneider works parttime for eula mae claims he was on a date with a girl named chelsea hart last night at time of murder mirabeau native his quote is proverbs fools make a mock at sin another quote related to sin did beta think that hally had done something sinful then hadnt worried about it or joked about it hard to see how quote pertains to him jordan poteeti can say categorically that i did not kill beta harcher my quote is isaiah woe unto them that call evil good and good evil betas death has brought me woe all right have no interpretation for her quote for me unless its that i considered books she called evil to be good and worth keeping on the shelves eula mae quiffsuccessful romance writer known professionally as jocelyn lushe her quote is job my desire is that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book beta objected to eula maes passionate little paperbacks called them smut did she bruise eula maes considerable ego one time too many why was eula mae meeting beta late at night and why didnt she mention it to me matt blalockvietnam vets activist contract computer programmer for software companies in austin his quote is matthew verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me what betrayal had matt committed in betas eyes of god mother or country beta called matt seditious for his vets activities that challenge the lightness of the war she was so oldfashioned this is the best interpretation i know so far ruth willsnurse at mirabeau hospital claims to have witnessed a violent argument between beta and bob don last saturday her quote is kings there is death in the pot guess is that it refers to ruths alleged attempt to poison beta bob don goertzlocal car and pickup truck czar his quote is judges have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two sounds like bob don had either reaped a windfall of women or that he possibly had a mistress on the side could it have been beta herself if not now then in the past knew her since she was young and claimed she was wild then anne schneider poteetmy mother for whatever reason her quote is genesis in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children i have no idea what this means in connection with my mother probably the sorrow was to be that i someone beta loathed was her child i closed my eyes as i finished reading my notes mama this of all made the least sense my mother hadnt hurt a fly in her whole life she was caring forgiving loving yet shed made it onto this list of beta harchers sinners perhaps ruth was right crazy people didnt need motives putting my mother on that list was proof enough i paused then realized id left something out i scribbled again board members not on list reverend adam hufnagelpreacher at first baptist church of mirabeau for past five years i havent spoken with him regarding betas deathmust do soon why is his wife on betas list why isnt he janice schneiderhomemaker my cousinbymarriage married to my second cousin harold schneider mother of hally and josh perky stepfordwife greeting card type had beta babysit her son josh on occasionapparently tried to make up with beta after library incidents why is her son hally on betas list why isnt she i drummed my pen against the paper those ending questions were both damned good ones perhaps there was no reason to it after all mama was on the list maybe tamma and hally were there as well to strike against imagined betrayers adam and janice janice had voted against beta and adam hadnt argued hard when the board voted to remove her that assumed this list was some sort of weapon beta couldve used against those she hated or maybe hally and tamma had been doing their own wrongs against beta i decided talking to brother adam and cousin janice was a priority there was one more addition to the notebook beta harcher mid s never married as far as i know mirabeau native did not work lived off trust left to her by family no close relatives in town has a niece in houston according to tamma hufnagel do not know of anyone that she considered a close friend or confidante extremely religious a zealot according to bob don got religion in her early s previously had a reputation for being wild whatever that means had served on library board less than six months when she began attempts to ban books she considered unwholesome ejected from library board by other members acted as though she operated by divine guidance even stated as much when she assaulted me in the library deposited large unexplained amount of cash recently in her savings account apparently argued with bob don goertz if ruth is to be believed and was having a late night meeting with longtime enemy eula mae quiff in the week before she died eula mae and bob don a welltodo writer and a prosperous car dealer and in betas savings account i wondered if for all her moralizing beta harcher considered blackmail a sin i switched out the light and considering the length and stress of the day id had collapsed quickly into a deep sleep beta harcher kindly stayed out of my dreams the next morning started off as most mornings did except i kept wondering whether or not i could open the library and whether junebug still considered me a prime suspect i fixed breakfast for mama and mark and checked on sister she snored in her room worn from an evening of cooking up homestyle food for wayfarers im not nearly as good a cook as sister but mama and mark didnt complain course its hard to mess up toaster waffles and rice krispies but i do pride myself on my ability to coordinate every part of the meal so it reaches the table simultaneously junebug didnt disappoint he showed up about eightthirty and i was glad to see that billy ray wasnt in tow hey jordy good morning junebug held his stetson in his hands as if sparking sister rather than grilling me good morning chief moncrief i kept my tone formal he frowned id like to speak with you for a minute jordy dont you need a backup chief after all im a dangerous suspect come on jordy he sounded like the junebug of old asking for his baseball back when wed disagreed about a hit being foul quit being pissy about this i got a job to do im not here to arrest you i relented i just made some coffee come on in he came awkwardly into the kitchen watching mama good morning miz poteet mark how yall doing mama stared at junebug as if she feared he might be here to escort her to a nursing home she smiled cautiously in his direction mark once again put himself first i already told you what i know chief he said sounding like a prepubescent version of a bogartmovie thug junebug regarded mark critically yes son i know thanks again for your cooperation im here to see your uncle though would yall mind giving us some privacy mark please take mama upstairs then go outside and play i said do thirteenyearolds still play marks eyes widened like drops of ink in water are you going to arrest him no son good to see you again miz poteet junebug nodded politely at mama as mark escorted her out of the kitchen i poured junebug black coffee and set it before him i decided to act like what i was just a bystander to all these nasty little events so when can i reopen the library not today he said in his slow voice sipping the brew his blue eyes flicked at me you make good coffee i sipped my own in response is that what you came by to tell me that the library has to stay closed you could have phoned he set the mug down jordy i think beta mightve been in the library to burn it down i felt the heat of the mug in my hands but it paled next to the heat in my face burn the library bum my library junebug read my expression i didnt get into this with you before because we didnt know her fingers smelled of gasoline and the coroner found traces of gasoline on her clothes and there was a pack of matches in her skirt pocket did you find gas cans my voice sounded stunned in her car it was parked down the street from the library found it there yesterday not enough that she tried to ban books not enough that she threatened to shut the library down no if she couldnt have her way shed just torch it even the many books she didnt object to just to get rid of the few i jumped up from my chair and paced the kitchen madly she didnt threaten to burn the place down to you junebug asked in his relaxed drawl never i stopped you know i would have reported any such threat to you id have had you and the volunteer fire department on twentyfourhour alert and id have had billy ray throw a book she couldnt burn at her skinny butt unless you decided to stop her yourself he said it as casually as if he were reading a highschool football score from the paper i felt my lips tighten you know i wouldnt kill her thered be no reason for me to youre the law i would have come to you i think you would have too junebug said but thats not how billy ray sees it he figures billy ray couldnt figure if you gave him both sides of the flash card i interrupted that if you knew she might try something like that but you didnt have solid proof you might just take it into your head to guard the library maybe keep a bat handy a bat that has only your prints on it only my prints i gulped but pressed on does that sound as stupid to you as it does to me tell billy ray to unknot his lariat from around his ankles and try throwing again instead of dreaming up little scenarios between me and beta why doesnt he get busy finding out about that money in her account or why bob don had such a fight with her last week or why she accused ruth wills of trying to poison her or why eula mae was meeting her late at night last week or why she bothered to make that list in the first place i stopped or why only my prints are on that bat if some kid just left it in the lot itd have to have his prints on it too right junebugs jaw wavered how the hell open mouth do not insert foot because of torrent of words that pour out in temper i sat down quickly a model schoolboy i guess youve been checking up on folks he said sternly a model principal thats my job jordy mine and billy rays well do your job hewett hes not real crazy about being called by that name how inconsiderate of me you know in your heart that i didnt murder anybody you know i couldnt get that schnauzer of a lawyer off of me the front door creaked and it wasnt a schnauzer of a lawyer that came in it was a chihuahua of a lawyer little and hairless bidwell j poteet attorneyatlaw my beloved uncle bid he stood in the doorway of the kitchen resplendent in his smalltown lawyers light gray suit smoking an obnoxious cigarillo it fit him he was short like my father had been and hed lost most of his hair what little remained was scraggly and white a soul less charitable than myself wouldve said it looked like cat mange his eyes were a deep lake blue but icy and cool the stub of that cigarillo popped out of his thin lips and his raspy drawl pervaded the room like the nauseating smell of the smoke i hope youre not trying to intimidate my client chief uncle bid wheedled he ought to have my representation if youre trying to coax a confession out of him junebug frowned this isnt an interrogation mr poteet jordy and i are just talking ill be the judge of that sir uncle bid sat in the chair he blinked at me like a troll at a billy goat gruff arent you going to be hospitable and offer your poor old uncle some coffee soon as i find the rat poison for it i thought getting up and slopping coffee into a cup your sisterinlaw is doing fine thank you for asking i announced bid made a hoarse reply that lacked concern hed done nothing to try to help mama the wife of his older brother hed dropped by only once before since id moved home just to explain what an idiot i was to return to mirabeauand grieve that daddy was spinning from his grave all the way to china on account of my giving up my career feel the love mr poteet let me assure you that i wasnt questioning jordy we were simply discussing when he could reopen the library it is a crime scene you know and we cant run the risk of tampering there junebug said bid sucked down boilinghot coffee as if it was ice water those cigarillos must build up the scar tissue fast well then if you two have concluded your business id like to speak privately with my nephew junebug arched an eyebrow but didnt argue yes we are finished i believe jordy ill let you know when you can reopen i nodded mutely and escorted junebug to the door he paused on the porch as he adjusted his hat and blinked into the morning sunshine its a nice day why dont you spend it with your mother take her out to the park or out to lunch i have other plans junebug remember jordy im the law ill handle the investigating around here and one thing i might have to investigate is how you knew about that money in beta harchers account i didnt want to get candace in trouble for sneaking around bankrecord confidentiality but i didnt want to lie to a police officer either best to take the blunderbuss approach have you found where all that money came from no we havent he confessed you know anything about it no i admitted will wonders never cease ill see you later jordy junebug smiled at me set his hat to his liking and headed for his cruiser i went back into the kitchen uncle bid leaned against the open refrigerator his bald head surveying the shelves up close breakfast service is closed i quipped if you want the special thrill of having a relative cook for you wait till sister wakes up im sure shell whip up your favorite and get that smelly cigar out of the fridge and out of the house but theres no need to spit it out just let your lips follow he slammed the door shut and rubbed an apple on his lapel youd shame my brother talking to me that way he could invoke a fathers ghost faster than hamlet no hed be ashamed of how youve ignored mama you never call you never come by unless its to offer lessthanconstructive criticism your absence is a blessing to me though so i guess i shouldnt complain im concerned about you jordy and im here to help you need my representation ive just had me a fascinating conversation with billy ray bummel he bit into the apple and chomped noisily that didnt keep him from talking lets look at the facts boy beta harcher popped you one and threatened you in front of a library full of witnesses you were in the library by yown admission in the range of time the murder took place if she was going to burn down the library that was an immediate threat not only to you but to the only employment that you are remotely suited for in this townaside from village idiot and only your prints are on the murder weapon now do you still think you dont need my help ill get my own legal representation thank you the phone rang i scooped it up willing to chitchat with an obscene caller rather than bid it was candace glad to see youre home i waited last night for your call oops id been so wrapped up in pulling my thoughts together and writing out my notes id forgotten my promise to phone candace sorry i said look this isnt a good time can i call you back as long as youre not fixing breakfast for ruth wills it mightve sounded mean if she hadnt laughed im not talk to you in a minute i hung up and turned back to bid he munched the apple down to the core i kept hoping there was a seed or two he might choke on im offering you free legal representation just as soon as youre arrested he said wiping his mouth with a dainty monogrammed handkerchief im not going to be arrested if they had anything on me theyd have arrested me by now i said it with more conviction than i felt and even if they do ill get me a good attorney someone over in bavary who actually hasnt been investigated by the state bar bid shrugged away the history of his luminous career and how will you afford it jordy with your stellar librarians salary he got up and thumbed his cigarillo stub into the trash you dont have the money to spend on legal defense and trust me you dont want a public defender bonaparte countys recruiting from the very dregs of the dreggiest of law schools ill take my chances thank you im sure any public defender would do a more conscientious job for me than you would youve never given a crap about me or my family you always acted superior because you had all the education and daddy didnt well ive got an education now uncle bid but i didnt need that to see that youre just an uncaring selfish bastard his bony ugly face thank god i didnt favor the poteet side screwed up in anger he turned red you listen to me boy i will represent you you are kin and i will not have the poteet name disgraced i will not entrust your defense to some weteared kid straight out of school theres too much at stake too much what i crossed my arms and smiled youve never offered to do anything that you didnt get a ton of benefit from he fished another cigarillo from his pocket and lit it in a fluid motion he took his time making the end of the nasty thing glow with each suck of whispered breath when he finally spoke his voice was sulky but reasonable jordy i know weve had our differences i know i havent beenhis face screwed up as he breathed in smoke making him look like a little dragonthe best uncle to you and arlene ive been remiss in my duties to your poor mother im asking for a chance to help you he laid his palms up in mock surrender please let me help you if the worst happens and you get charged with betas murder i watched him he acted sincere acted id had enough experience with him to avoid embracing him and sobbing that all was forgiven but maybe the old coot was genuine this time please he said once more i loved hearing him beg but i wanted him gone more tell you what uncle bid if i do get arrested ill retain your free services until then we wont have any sort of formal agreement deal he didnt look entirely pleased but hed honed his ways of hiding disappointment through his many failures in the courtroom he came forward and shook my hand his was sticky with apple juice deal then jordy he relinquished my hand and tried a new buddyingup tactic although i remain staunchly convinced of your innocence it wouldnt surprise me that you couldve killed that woman crazy old bitch waste of what was once fine womanhood you knew beta i asked wishing i could wipe my palm i wasnt on speaking terms with her bid offered congenially but i knew her when she was younger an eyepopper that girl was and knew how to have a good time uncle bid thoughtfully gyrated his pelvis so i wouldnt miss his point beta bob don had said she didnt get religion until she was in her twenties what kind of woman was she before then bob dons description of wild had been vague you and beta i asked incredulous imagining oddities from the kama sutra was easier than conjuring up an image of my uncle and beta harcher coupling oh lord no jordy i never dated her i wouldnt have soiled my reputation by doing so funny how people turn out though such a wild thing in her youth then such a driedup old church hag he shook his head bob don said she was pretty when she was younger bid frowned you stay away from bob don goertz hes nothing but a dirty liar god only knew what brought that on i didnt know bid and bob don knew each other ill be going remember what i said and you call me if you run into trouble give my best to arlene mark and your mother i nodded not wanting to argue again beta harcher party girl turned keeper of morality i wondered if uncle bid was trying to make his own metamorphosis candace had nothing new to report i told her about ruth witnessing the fight between bob don and beta didnt mention ruths offer of sexual solace and concluded by telling her that apparently my prints were the only ones on the baseball bat at the last tidbit she gasped my god maybe they will arrest you i dont know it seems odd that i would have the only prints on it say the killer wore gloves if a kid left it in the field it should also have his or her prints why doesnt it the killer wiped it clean candace prompted and missed my prints i dont think so i was the only person to handle that bat when it came into the library i closed my eyes remembering i brought the bat into the library i put it in my office no one else went near it until the killer used it to bash beta the only explanation candace said slowly is that it was wiped before you handled it a kid wouldnt do that theres no reason to unless she stopped what oh god unless the killer planted it there already wiped clean of prints and waited for you to pick it up thats crazy candace i coughed doesnt that seem like putting a lot up to chance that im the first person to walk by the bat that i notice it that i pick it up that i even take that path at any given time of the day jordy candaces tone was flat youre far more a creature of habit than you realize you always cut through the field on your way to the pharmacy yeah but i dont go to the pharmacy on a regular basis whenever mama needs her medicine maybe the killer knew when that would be when youd be going next my god i exclaimed pictures unraveled in my mind like a grainy oldtime newsreel youre onto something candace imagine youre the killer you want to frame me for this murder you want to get my prints on the murder weapon you want to put me at the scene of the crime near the time of the murder or you want to kill beta harcher at a place where only iand possibly a few others including youhave access you cant use a conventional weapon like a gun or a knife because how could you explain getting me to touch it please leave your prints on that registered weapon jordy and ill be on my way so you decide to use as your weapon something i might handle but theres nothing in the library thats lethal enough i dont have a heavy paperweight on my desk i dont have an antique sword hanging over the card catalog but there is a softball field right by the library so you decide to use a baseball bat you knowor learnthat i cut through the softball field when i head toward the pharmacy or downtown in general so you find out when im planning on going to the pharmacy watch me leave then leave the bat there on the path for me to find when i return if i pick it up youre set if i dont maybe you have an alternate plan candace sighed on the other end of the line a lot of ifs there i clutched the phone in excitement but say its true that could narrow the field down even further who would know that mama needed her prescription refilled and that i would go down the path that day maybe thats not the key candace suggested maybe they just were in the library when you left to go to the pharmacy and then put the bat out for you to find when you got back maybe your mothers medicine had nothing to do with it leave it to candace to make simplifying conclusions simple seemed better okay lets take that tack so who was around that morning candace hummed slightly on the other line lets see you me old man renfro of coursehes always there eula mae and her lot were just starting to arrive when you left she harrumphed ruth wills was there looking up something probably home cures for venereal disease she paused tamma hufnagelno she came in after you got back right when the fight started with you and beta maybe she was outside the library and saw me go maybe so and maybe anyone else couldve been too candace agreed bob don came in to return a book that his wifed checked out there was a whiskey spill on one page and he offered to buy the book that was about ten minutes before you left i took care of it bob don again i said his name pops up more than a jackinthebox there were a few others at the library older folks that nerdy gaston leach i cant imagine any of them as betas killer i rubbed my eyes ive got to go candace ive got some folks to see im afraid that junebug knows that we know about betas deposit it kind of slipped out this morning she sighed disappointed in me oh well mother will just have to forgive me after all its for a worthy cause saving your butt as soon as sister was awake i told her about junebugs visit uncle bids offer and my theory about the murder weapon uncle bid being nice she wiped sleep from her eyes as i sat on the corner of her bed im fast asleep right nope and im not working today the librarys still closed she blinked green eyes at me rimmed with dark those eyes said shed been working too much why do i get the feeling that youre not going to volunteer to stay home with mama theres some people ive got to see look jordy youre trying to clear yourself before theyve even arrested you how would i clear my name from a jail cell i wouldnt count on uncle bid to hire a decent private investigator ive got to do this now prove im innocent i leaned back on the bed i called dorcas witherspoon she said shed stay with mama if you needed to run errands okay sister knotted the sheets around her she was wearing an oversized tshirt that said rice university god id given that to her my senior year in college and she still slept in it i cant believe this is happening i cant believe anyone thinks youre a killer i have you on my side though and candace sister squeezed my hand it was the first legitimate sign of affection shed shown me in weeks i think we were both just too tired to bother most of the time too caught up in feeling sorry for ourselves too worn down from dealing with mama too frustrated at our own powerlessness in the face of her disease wed been close once i wanted to be close to her again i offered to bring her some coffee in bed and she giggled you she asked i drew myself up to my full height i too can be sensitive and caring we just got a book about it at the library i brought her milky coffee the way she liked it she sipped it as daintily as an english lady being gently roused in the morning by a roomful of servants i told her about my dinner with ruth and what id found out yesterday she listened for once and did not interrupt me a rarity for my big sister when i was done sister finished her coffee before she spoke well i can fill in one gap bob don did used to be friends with mama and daddy when oh when i was real little before you were born he came over quite a bit i remember he loved to toss me up in the air and catch me id squeal everybody deaf and he and mama and daddy played cards some evenings i remember that but he and mama and daddy had some big falling out i think it was over him marrying that nasty gretchen i dont think mama and daddy liked being around her shes a real bitch candace says that bob don returned a library book thatd had booze spilled on it sister huffed then shes also a real drunk bitch wouldnt surprise me a bit have you ever seen that woman jordy course she doesnt get out like she used to but i know a drunk when i see one she must just be getting worse and worse poor bob don maybe he really does want to help make up for the rift between him and daddy and mama maybe so i said thoughtfully i offered to make sister some breakfast but she said shed get her own she wasnt willing to take a chance on my cooking so i got on with my work there were people to see and stories to be checked out i decided to strike close to home first the bavarymirabeau phone book listed three families named hart i got lucky the second time around the lady who answered had a daughter named chelsea may i ask why you want to speak with her the woman asked her voice was nasal but polite i fidgeted actually shes dating my cousin hally schneider i thought she might assist me in planning a surprise party for him i couldnt think of anything else and hoped that i wouldnt actually have to plan a social function for a teenager to cover my tracks the woman warmed oh yes hally and chelsea did go out the other night such a handsome young man her voice faltered ii didnt know that he was really interested in chelsea oh talks about her constantly i chirped well hed mentioned her once that counted for something mrs hart directed me to luannes backerei a little german bakery in downtown mirabeau i thanked her and hung up i could stop off and chat with chelsea on my way to see reverend hufnagel bob don goertz and eula mae and when i got back downthestreet neighbor janice schneider and i were going to have a little hearttoheart as well the warm aroma of freshly baked kolaches enveloped me as i stepped into luannes backerei kolaches are a czech pastry a warm square roll with a fruit or sausage middle and topping every small town in eastcentral texas boasts a kolache bakery even some left over from the earliest czech immigrants kolache and coffee together are the ultimate in comfort foods the smell alone brought back memories of my grandmother schneiders kitchen a tray of hot kolaches being set before sister and mewith a gentle warning to let them cool so we wouldnt burn our mouths todays batch smelled of apple peach and heaven i didnt know luanne or any of the staff there was one stout matronly woman in the back on the phone and a trio of young girls brewing coffee pulling fresh kolaches out of glassfronted ovens and ringing the cash register if luannes had a morning rush id missed it two plump ladies in stretch polyester pantsuits sat by the door laughing merrily over steaming cups of coffee a circle of older men slumped by a table watching the women chat one man a dallas cowboys cap perched on his head held court talking and smoking his cigarette the other men munched on their kolaches and it was hard to tell if they paid the slightest attention to him they had probably heard whatever story he was telling a hundred times already i approached the counter bought two apple kolaches and a coffee laced with milk and sugar the girl who rang up my purchase smiled prettily i thought she was just hallys type excuse me are you chelsea hart no she is the girl jerked her head toward the ovens a girl i never would have pictured with hally schneider extracted a tray of steaming peach kolaches from the oven she wasnt pretty and im not being unkind she just wasnt her face was bony to an extreme gaunt and sallow her nose and chin were small but sharply pointed like a cartoon witchs her hair was pulled back into a ponytail of dirtyblonde hair with a front tuft moussed to defy gravity a shortsleeved blouse showed arms like rails i moved down the counter and spoke to her aware of the cashiers eyes on me excuse me chelsea i said chelsea hart gave me an apathetic glance and moved her chewing gum to the other side of her mouth yeah can i help you she asked in a nasally drawl im jordy poteet hally schneiders cousin could i talk to you for a second i motioned toward a table chelsea blinked brown eyes at me she glanced back at the heavy woman who chirped into her phone waving a lit cigarette for emphasis she turned to me sure i went to a corner table with my kolaches and coffee and chelsea followed dragging her feet along the ground she sat across from me propping up her bony face with bony fingers kolache i offered her one of my apple pastries she made a sour face which didnt help her cause any god no i get enough of them believe me what did you want i still hadnt come up with a better excuse than planning some party for hally well i understand youre dating my cousin she laughed and it was too hollow and empty to come from a teenage girl i dont think one miserable evening counts as dating oh i was at a loss sorry im planning a party for hally and i hoped you could help me i thought that i was hallys girlfriend she laughed shaking her head wrong you must not know your cousin very well i wouldnt be the person to help you plan a party for hally i took immediate refuge in the kolache chewing it slowly to gather my thoughts chelsea looked bored i swallowed and said but you were out with him night before last right yeah i was my evening with prince charming right she leaned forward and i could smell mixing with the fragrance of coffee and fruit a cheap sticky perfume you tell your cousin something for me okay i dont get asked out that often and it dont bother me my own company suits me fine but when a guy wants to spend time with me i expect him to be with me not off in his own world he didnt give a rats ass about being with me it was just like he was killing time she leaned back i was surprised when hally asked me out he aint exactly the kind of boy that goes out with me but i figured it out im not stupid he aint been dating anyone in school so i figure heres a chance for me even though he asked me at the last minute when we were together he didnt even know i was around just kept checking his watch all through our hamburgers told me the same football story three times and didnt realize it even parked down by the river and he just wanted to talk if i want to talk i can stay home and listen to my sister chelsea hart smacked her gum emphatically he probably thought he was doing me some damn big favor just breathing the same air as me well i dont need that if he was out with me just to make some other girl jealous he can kiss my ass can i ask you one question i interjected enough pretense she shrugged bony shoulders when did he bring you home midnight i got a curfew i was ready to go home hours earlier though but he insisted on sitting and talking christ what a bore he was and if youre having some stupid party for him cross my name off the invite list i dont need him with that she stormed back to the counter leaving me with a kolache halfway to my mouth hell hath no fury and all that i finished my coffee chelsea hart might be as ugly as the day was long but damned if she wasnt her own person that would help her in life far better than comeliness ever would why was hally spending time with a girl he had no apparent interest in where was his mind when he was on the date from hell i had a sinking feeling that hally was more concerned with providing himself with an alibi for betas murder than with winning chelseas heart why had my cousin gone to the trouble what did he have to hide i hurried out of the warm smell of the bakery the dull throb of suspicion beginning in my heart matt blalock was the last person i expected to see at the first baptist church but there he was adam hufnagel was helping him into his taurus storing the folding wheelchair and putting it in the back seat i pulled up next to matt the good reverend and matt ignored me by the time i was out of the car matts exhaust churned in the air and he tore out of the parking lot i blinked at reverend adam hufnagel he smiled thinly at me i dont think he was pleased to see me adam hufnagel was a tall rangy man thinner from his bout with cancer last year he was a tough old bird and hed beaten the disease his hair was iron gray the color that gives a man the look of resolve strongfeatured he looked more distinguished than handsome the ideal father figure i wondered if his wife tamma thought of him that way brother adam slipped on his smiling parsons face for me jordan he came forward shaking my hand in the warm intimate way that all clergy use good to see you son how are you doing his voice a richtimbred instrument oozed just the amount of concern a southern gentleman would permit himself fine reverend considering what alls happened in the past couple of days do you have a minute to talk he inspected his watch just for a few minutes i have to meet with the ladies who are planning vacation bible school ah werent your wife my cousin janice and beta doing that he steered me toward a church side door why yes they were horrible about betas murder horrible no one should die that way i agreed thats why im trying to find out who killed her i felt his fingers on my arm stiffen for a moment then relax we went down a short tiled hallway the walls covered with a rainbow of felt cutouts done by the sunday school children crosses trees of life doves hands grasping the nursery school interpretation of religion it seemed better than betas version adam hufnagels office was immaculate files were stacked neatly on his desk pencils and pens stood in holders with not a single stray on the desk an assortment of silverframed photos ranged the credenza behind his comfortable leather chair so much for vows of poverty the pictures were nearly always of hufnagels adam and tamma vacationing in a sunny place adam and tamma wearing tshirts of the churchs soccer team adam and tamma getting married he looking more like her father than her husband adam gestured toward a seat when will the library reopen hopefully soon junebug makes that decision i paused adam hufnagel was a little intimidating but i hadnt backed down over the book banning and i wasnt about to back down now i swallowed and said is that what matt was here to see you about the library sort of adam smiled at me like he might at a child whod asked if god really existed he wanted to know if he could use the church hall for his veterans meeting since the library is temporarily closed of course i gave him permission and he was very happy oh if i hadnt kept eye contact with the good reverend i might have believed it eyes betray us adam hufnagels eyes darted down to my lap and back again as he spoke he didnt want to look at me and when i thought of matt blalock and adam hufnagel whod been on opposite sides of the censorship battle i couldnt see matt asking adam for help matt can be difficult but these are veterans adam shrugged keeping his eyes steadily on me i thought perhaps letting matt use the church would mend fences broken during our recenthe fumbled for a worddisagreements matt doesnt strike me as a fence mender he wasnt exactly broken up over beta harchers death adam raised palms in supplication and it was a distinctly annoying gesture it said dont ask mei just work here matt has many burdens to carry jordan i hope i can minister to his needs now what did you want to see me about surely not to ask questions about matt blalock i licked my lips i felt as nervous as the proverbial whore in church grilling regular folks was one thing but trying to worm information out of a man who was supposed to be above reproach made me uneasy i swallowed down my unease and forged ahead i understand that beta took your key to the library to get in apparently so adam nodded tamma noticed it missing when the police called beta was here the afternoon before she died for a brief time i dont keep the office locked during church hours it would have been easy for her to take thou shalt not steal i intoned seems she only observed commandments that were convenient to her jordan let me be frank he leaned forward over his spotless desk beta harcher was a committed member of this congregation shouldve been committed i thought but held my tongue she didnt have much of a life outside of church old maid with no family left here in town she practically ran this church for me he smiled but there was no feeling behind it and that didnt bother you tamma suggested to me that she tried to tell you what to do im an ordained minister of the southern baptist church jordan im the one responsible for my flock not beta harcher she knew and understood that she appointed herself custodian of other peoples morality quick enough adam hell he was on the board wasnt he first names were a leveling field i leaned forward rudely putting my elbows on his desk i meant to be rude she was going to burn down the library thats the latest theory they found traces of gasoline on her hands if she couldnt ban some books shed burn all of them are you still so proud of her now adam he didnt rattle no of course not that would have been wrong of her he narrowed his eyes at me seems to me that points the finger of blame more at you jordan quite possible youd do anything to protect that library i shrugged someone who doesnt know me very well might think so i curled one leg up under myself and he glanced at his watch i didnt hurry did the police tell you about the list she made they hadnt i told him about it and watched the color seep from his face his blood traveled pretty fast for an older man interesting isnt it reverend you didnt make the list she must not have been mad at you you dont know that the list is of people she had a bone with adam answered i didnt have any problems with beta did your wife she made the list shes not on the library board neither were hally or my mother or matt but i didnt mention that youre making a mountain out of a molehill tamma and beta got along fine tamma felt she ought to be in charge of certain church events as my wife beta disagreed there was some conflict between them for a while usually with beta winning tamma does not usually have a confrontational personality no she doesnt beta had the monopoly on that adam hufnagel raised an eyebrow at me they worked on their differences i asked tamma and beta to serve together as chaperons at a youth group retreat over at lake travis at the beginning of march they returned with their disagreements resolved as friends he looked sternly at me im sure their shared love of jesus brought them together mustve i concurred politely and i have no idea why beta would put tammas name on this list youre judging beta too harshly perhaps it was a prayer list we should pray for our enemies i shook my head maybe with me and some of the others who are on the list but not your wife right you just said they were pals i cant help you i dont know the answer to why beta did that he stood trying to end the interview i must meet with my wife and janice we have a lot of planning to do for the vacation bible school just another minute please i said keeping my seat his comment reminded me of something tamma mentioned yesterday she said shed also worked with beta on the church rummage sale adam smiled briefly as he sat back down that was the first sign that their little battles were over beta volunteered for it then just took it over entirely from tamma tamma realized that it was important to beta to feel busy so she let her when was that sale i asked adam glanced at his calendar about two weeks ago beta im afraid didnt do a very good job she left many things undone that tamma and i had to do at the last minute like what he shrugged impatient sorting through contributions pricing them shed made a start on some but then it was as if she forgot to finish the rest that didnt sound like beta if she was anything she was thorough shed shown that in her war against the library i thought hard i hadnt considered one important part of the formula that equalled death for beta harcher why had she died now at that particular time what had happened in her life that led to her death i had only concentrated on her war against the library and me but she might have had other mischief up her pilgrims sleeve the church was her other main means of contact with her fellow human beings perhaps i needed to start looking for an answer there aside from her general involvement in the church there was her involvement in the vacation bible school the rummage sale and the youth groups do you have a list of everyone who contributed to the rummage sale adam hufnagel looked suspiciously at me what was iherod hunting down innocents why would you want that im curious as to who donated to the church surely you keep a list of contributors i do but i dont see that its any of your business look adam you can play this the easy way or the rough way beta harcher had an unusual amount of money in her banking account enough to overflow most coffers she hadnt had that money long it hasnt been traced yet so i dont think she got it from stock options or winning the lottery she was getting it from someone it took a moment for it to register with adam blackmail beta thats absurd the music of his voice was slightly offkey no more ridiculous than her trying to burn the library im just curious about who she dealt with in the past two weeks it wasnt just the folks on the library board it was people in this church adam looked uncertain i stood thats okay i can just take my story to junebug he doesnt think i killed her hes just itching to have someone else to hand over to billy ray bummel he can get a warrant to search every record in this church tamma interrupted us she stepped inside her husbands office not seeing me at first but deciphering the look on her husbands face her eyes so downcast yesterday found me and werent happy jordy what are you doing here her voice showed anger talking to your husband i answered im a stickler for politeness bothering him you mean i wish youd leave him alone the mouse was now roaring i ignored her adam held the power in that relationship so it was him i dealt with that list reverend he weighed it in his mind a tongue used to spouting scripture and metaphor fell silent he walked out of the office tamma glared at me why are you doing this why are you bothering us she demanded her hands balled into fists unsuitable for prayer i didnt realize looking for truth was a bother to you isnt that why we have churches i used to think nicely of you jordy but youre a thoroughly unlikable person leave us alone adam returned with a file he sorted through the papers found one set the file down and walked back out i heard his footsteps stop the hum of a copying machine and the crisp sound of paper sliding into a tray his footsteps resumed and he entered brandishing a paper at me here i hope you dont bother these people too much he glanced at his wife who wouldnt look at me i cant see how this has anything to do with betas death thanks good day reverend mrs hufnagel i nodded to the unfriendly tamma and left walking out into the morning sunshine of the parking lot i scanned the list quickly it was interesting that two of the names matched two of the names on betas list i changed my plans i went home sister sat in the living room watching mama sweep the back porch mama loved to do that repetitive actions hold a fascination for alzheimers patients its almost as if their repertoire of tasks is so limited they get a sensual pleasure out of repeating endlessly the few actions they can still do well mama swept even the microbes off that porch weaving back and forth for hours if uninterrupted we didnt want her to do it at first but her doctor said it was decent exercise it was better than the walking in circles that she also favored i decided to try out a theory no more taking folks at face value i picked up the kitchen phone cleared my throat and dialed matt blalocks number hello blalock residence may i speak to matthew blalock please i sounded just like my friend and coworker gil camden back in boston just watering down the yankee accent a tad making fun of yankees when you live up there tends to make you into a good mimic at least it did me this is matt blalock hello my name is gil camden im a vietnam vet who just recently moved to bavary i understand you hold a weekly meeting over there in mirabeau for vets im interested in attending yes we do but not this week matt coughed we dont have our usual meeting place available we should have it back next week and well meet then if i can get your address and phone number mr camden ill i set the receiver gently back into its cradle the good reverend hufnagel had lied right to my face so why were he and matt together at the church the two of them were a pair that just didnt match i went up to my room and laid out my notes since i didnt have enough answers about the suspects i decided to concentrate on the victim beta brought death on herself this was no random act of violence no crime of passion her presence in the library at night her attempt to torch the building her careful list of names and biblical verses the unexplained money in her account pointed to some system shed imposed on her life beta in other words was up to something and it got her killed i was the person most attached to the library im the only one who would have arguably killed for it and i wouldnt have gone that far that list had kept me focused on betas relationships at the library but mirabeau was a small town and lives overlap in other areas i needed to cast my net further and id decided to start with the church i wrote out another list on paper timetable of events in betas life januarybeta in hospital accuses ruth wills of trying to poison her incident dropped februarybeta forced off library board

bat i read again where beta deposited all that money the day after she met eula mae and eula mae was one of the few folks in town who could cough up that much cash beta mustve been dangling something over eula maes head the palm of my hand slapped up against my mouth and i felt as stupid as a bummel at birth beta did have something over eula mae but it had to be something beta didnt know about when she made her censorship stand at the library if beta had dirt on eula mae shed have used it to get eula mae to switch her vote the same for the others on the board janice and ruth but beta hadnt no embarrassing revelations came to light when beta got tossed whatever shed had on eula mae she hadnt had it in february but at some point beta got smarter shed gotten worth in smarts meeting late with eula mae threatening bob don who else i tore through my notebook back to the list of names maybe this was a list of people beta could blackmail but then why were my name and mamas on it id been as virtuous as a monk since coming home and mama could only get into a limited amount of mischief in her condition it didnt wash sister rapped gently on my door shed never done that as a teenager but shed broken her filthy habits you have a visitor jordy beta harchers niece is downstairs the young miss harcher wasnt what i expected although i hadnt given it much thought when id heard beta had a niece it wasnt hard to imagine some tightlipped proper young clone of beta apparently selfrighteousness and primness arent in the genetic code the girl was around five feet eight with shoulderlength reddish brown hair and a finely featured face her eyes were blue as a jay and they darted around with the same cunning and speed her figure was firm and shapely under the black tshirt and faded acidwashed jeans she wore she also wore large funky turquoise earrings and black cowboy boots i guessed she was young around twentythree mark had come in from the backyard as sister and i came down the stairs the girl laughed at something he said a high musical bell of a giggle he blushed madly and kept gawking at her i obviously needed to have a talk with that boy when all this calmed down had sister explained the facts of life to him lord all my responsibilities i kept those facts of life firmly out of my head as i introduced myself im not sure she did well mr poteet you sure dont look like any librarian i ever met im shannon harcher her hand was cool and firm in my grasp please sit down i indicated the sofa she did neatly and i sat next to her i glanced at sister asking with my eyes for some privacy sister made herself comfortable in the easy chair mark leaned against the wall trying to look older and nonchalant it didnt work my sympathies on your aunts death i said not knowing what else to say to my surprise a hint of a smile tugged at her mouth youre very kind mr poteet but i know you and aunt beta werent exactly friends she gave me updates over the phone about her bookbanning efforts i opened my hands then closed them back together no use in denying that little fact no we werent friends i she raised a wellmanicured hand to interrupt me look mr poteet theres no need to explain i know what kind of person my aunt was shannon harcher shrugged you dont have to pretend with me that you liked her i wont hold you to all those smalltown niceties okay miss harcher shannon then call me jordy okay shannon your aunt and i werent friends i paused youve probably already heard that from the das office and the chief of police her lovely eyes narrowed i havent talked with the das office the chief told me youd found the body so junebug hadnt told this girl i was a suspect maybe he didnt consider me one anymore i felt relief that she hadnt talked with billy ray bummel she wouldnt have come around me if hed been allowed to paint my picture i did find the body i told her the story quickly i left out the part about billy ray wanting to nail my butt to the wall while i spoke sister got up and fixed us iced tea with sliced limes shannon nodded her appreciation and sipped she didnt interrupt my story and sat thoughtfully for a moment when i finished a baseball bat of all things shannon finally said i still cant believe it i always thought that shed go down frothing at the mouth waving her trusty bible not to be indelicate i said but i take it you didnt share your aunts religious views one of her fine high arched eyebrows which probably already needed a building permit went up a little farther no im afraid i didnt i know you didnt get along with her jordy sometimes i didnt either my folks died when i was seventeen in a car wreck in houston they didnt leave me enough for college and i didnt have the grades for a scholarship aunt beta gave me the money for college she smiled with provisions as long as i went to baylor as long as i went to church regularly as long as i majored in religion sounds like beta sister put in shannon smiled her gorgeous smile i might have majored in religion myself to see that more often it turned out to be negotiable i ended up majoring in music instead i just told aunt beta i specialized in church music and that made her happy im glad someone could negotiate with her i never mastered that particular talent i shifted on the couch dont take this the wrong way shannon but why are you here to see me surely not just to meet the man who found your aunts body shannon lowered her eyes staring down into her iced tea she looked soulful and lost it was a pose that she seemed comfortable in carefully made to tug at a mans heart i could hear marks sigh across the room in going through some of aunt betas things i found these library books i was going to drop them off at the library but it was closed and i was curious to meet you anyway after chief moncrief told me youd found my aunt she dug into a book bag at her feet which i hadnt noticed before pulling out four hardbacks she offered them to me i took them from her scanning the titles a writers guide to getting published drug abuse traitor to humanity videotaping for fun living with alzheimers disease it made for a curious reading list shannon watched my face that book on alzheimers made me wonder if she was coming down with it hardly my mother has alzheimers though and she made that list of betas i set the books down i have no idea why beta was interested in these other topics my aunt never had a wide range of hobbies shannon said dryly i liked her even more i ran a thumb along the book bindings alzheimers and my mother and now beta with a book on the painful subject i wondered if some similar connection existed between eula mae and this book on writing and what about the others i couldnt imagine beta doing drugsbut i did know that matt blalock smoked dope maybe beta knew too although i couldnt imagine matt caring if she did know she hadnt turned him in and i couldnt picture beta submitting an entry to americas funniest home videos so why the videotape book shannon cleared her throat and stood well i appreciate your hospitality jordy she nodded to sister thanks for the tea mrs slocum nice to have met you mark now you stay handsome hear before mark could burst a blood vessel i put my hand on shannons arm stay for just a moment please i want to ask you something she shrugged and sat back down your aunt had just deposited in her savings account before she died i understand that was an unusual amount for her to have shannon examined one of her fingernails im not sure i should discuss my aunts financial situation with you that was after all her business and now its mine was the unspoken ending to that sentence i waited patiently for her to look at me she did when i didnt speak those of us who are involuntarily involved in this case have thought that beta might have been getting money by extortion shannon looked at me with wry amusement my aunt a blackmailer get real jordy she sighed i guess i have to tell her secret not that it matters now she was hoarding that money for a long while she was going to open up her own church in houston her own church i was glad my jaw was hinged otherwise my chind be scraping the ground beta wasnt an ordained minister i managed to say shannon laughed oh that didnt matter it was going to be a nondenominational fundamentalist church she didnt need to be ordained for that she just needed money time and some real estate shannon shook her head shed told me all about it shed saved up a bunch of money and she was going to go to houston and find her some office space she could convert no pun intended she laughed any grief over her aunt forgotten she was supposed to come out to houston next month and sign a lease she was going to drag me into this whole mess i work as a music promoter for several bands in houston she kept going on about how i could be the music director for her church god i wanted to avoid that if possible enough to kill her i wondered if shed saved all this money how come she made it in one big deposit why not let it grow in the account and accrue some interest i dont know she was goofy but she wasnt stupid if she was saving up to start a church shed want as much money as possible i shook my head im not calling you a liar shannon but i dont believe she had that money stuffed into a mattress all these years and just decided to put it in her account shannons eyes steeled then it must have been donations from supporters you know like the tv evangelists get it doesnt matter anyhow that money is mine now not if it came from illegal means i said simply you already know she had a list of people on her when we found her ive been talking with all those folks and theyre each as skittish as a waterbug during a drought maybe theres a connection between her list these books and that money maybe she was researching her first sermons sister volunteered and i shot her a black look she shrugged she was religious shannon argued religious people dont break the law she was in a library after hours ready to torch it i retorted i bet you if we look in the texas penal code well find arson mentioned so what do you want from me shannon demanded her eyes flashed and i guess the thought of losing that money was the spark i want you to save yourself a lot of grief later on i answered if the money is genuinely your aunts then its yours and the matters settled but if she got it through blackmail we need to know now that way you wont have to worry about the police coming and asking you for it down the line shannon weighed her choices the lovely skin tightened across her high cheekbones as she thought she was a smart woman fine she finally said ill cooperate what do you want i want usmeaning you me and chief moncriefto search your aunts house for any evidence that she was blackmailing someone she shook her head but not in disagreement the police already went through the house when she was killed they didnt find anything then we go through it again junebugs fellas probably wait for something to announce itself before they notice it if we dont find anything there your aunt is probably innocent of extortion and ill apologize to her at her grave but if she was we might find who killed her i want that shannon said bluntly i want to know who killed her and i want them to pay for it i wont pretend that she was my favorite person in the world but she helped me when i needed it its not right that she died that way i want that too i said but for an entirely different reason it wasnt right that beta was murdered but in my humble opinion it was less right that i be arrested for it she glanced at her watch i have an appointment with reverend hufnagel hes conducting the funeral service how about around three this afternoon ill call the chief i said sure that he would not be pleased about me inviting myself along for the ride she stood eager to be gone she said her goodbyes again to mark and sister i walked shannon to her car noticing that two doors down janice schneider was pulling into her driveway time to pay my kinfolk a visit i went back into the house mark was still mooneyed over our visitor but that wasnt keeping him from toying around with expensive hardware he pulled wires and cords from the tv and the vcr wow shes real pretty huh uncle jordy he said yanking on a cord that looked costly to replace yes shes very attractive and too old for you and too young for me i watched as he broke the bonds that hooked together tv and recorder what exactly are you doing mark he began lugging the vcr up the stairs you said we all had to make our adjustments with mamaws illness well my adjustment for today is watching a schwarzenegger tape on the tv in your room so i can blare the volume and not freak out mamaw he vanished up the stairs and into my private sanctuary great i thought that room always had been a magnet for teenage male mischief ever go into someones house and feel more like youve stepped into a catalog than a place where people actually live i felt that way everytime i went into janice schneiders house note that i said house not home i swear to god there was no way this woman had three males actually living in this house it was as pristine as new crystal and as tasteful as money could make it there had been enough money all right janices living room wasnt much bigger than ours but it was as white as a snowy field the carpet the upholstery the throw pillows were all various shades of ivory the furniture that wasnt white seemed to be all glass and chrome so you could see through it to the white or have the white reflected back at you i thought the tv might only pick up static just to fit in if id been a speck of dirt in that room i would have died of loneliness janice bravely served me coffee in that expanse of snowy home furnishings i say bravely because if i were her i wouldnt allow anything that could make a stain in that room janice seemed to have total confidence in my ability to not spill however she was still as pretty as shed been in school with brown hair and pert features she looked strained though around her eyes and mouth i think it was all that perkiness she was always the happiest smilingest person you ever saw god she was annoying civilization could be falling around your head and janiced just giggle and say we could have a bake sale to help the survivors where beta had been dour about folks relationships to their maker janice was sure that god really did love everybody and that hed give those extra bad sinners a pat on the head and forgive them right away so they wouldnt even get their toes warm before they strapped on their angels wings she sided with me against beta in the censorship fight to my surprise but i felt that janice had stuck by me because her god liked mark twain and maya angelou and jay mcinerney and all those other folks beta objected to her god liked everyone even me i just cant tell you how devastated we all are janice sniffed as she dumped a chunk of sugar in her coffee i didnt think she could get any sweeter but i refrained from comment i saw hally the other day he said that beta babysat for yall sometimes janice nodded looking desolate she caught herself though and perked right up yes miz harcher was real sweet to our josh i know that might be hard for you to believe jordy but she truly was fond of josh i think she sometimes wished she had children of her own i mustve missed her maternal streak oh it was there janice assured me but you know living alone in that old house with no real involvement in her life but church janice faded off shaking her head we all make our choices i answered yes janice agreed but i tried to help her before all that todo over the library i even tried to set her up on a date date my throat caught a date with beta harcher one could only imagine the possibilities since none of them would ever take place yes janice smiled remembering but her reputation preceded her i couldnt find a willing widower in all of bonaparte county that seemed to me the saddest part of all i felt bad for beta all of a sudden despite everything no matter how much trouble shed caused folks each day she had to wake up and live the hell of a life shed created for herself alone and unloved and now cold in the morgue with hardly a person to mourn her i got up from the couch and walked into the warming sunlight streaming through the slidingglass window that led to the schneiders porch i felt janices eyes follow me you were working with her on the vacation bible school plans werent you i could almost hear her relax behind me yes i was i have to admit i think both tamma and i were dreading it after her getting kicked off the library board but she was easy to work with undemanding and even calm did you know that she was planning on moving to houston and opening a fundamentalist church there i asked turning back to her janice obviously didnt her perky face tightened in surprise beta her own church i find that hard to believe believe it she told her niece all about it and stashed away a little money as her startup funds how surprising im sure folks at church didnt know anything about this she paused if its true maybe thats why shed gotten even more involved in the administrative side of the church lately the youth trips the rummage sale the school maybe she wanted to learn how to run such things i nodded my agreement janice cleared her throat and tried to change the subject how is anne doing are you and arlene holding up fine thank you for asking i answered keeping the sarcasm out of my voice i wanted to say come down and see her for yourselfits not catching but i refrained i walked back to janice sitting perfectly on her perfect little couch in her perfect little house i pressed onward you know that when i found beta there was a list of names in her pocket with bible quotes next to them janice set her coffee cup back in its saucer with a rattle yes i know junebug moncrief told us when he came to ask hally some questions then you know that hallys name was on that list she nodded the whole things silly hally had nothing to do with beta except that she went to his church he headed up a youth group that she chaperoned and she babysat for his brother janice took refuge in silence she sipped at her empty coffee cup most of the other names of people on that list are library board members there are a few though that arent hally made it onto betas list and you didnt im curious as to why to know that id have to know why she made that list janice countered i dont do you i have my suspicions i answered airily suspicions and no proof the quote next to hallys name was fools make a mock of sin do you have any idea what that means none whatsoever hally is beyond reproach she snapped i mustve hit a nerve shed stopped smiling please janice i smiled hes a teenager teenagers do dumb things sometimes it doesnt mean hes not a good kid i glanced around at the ideally pristine room and wondered if anything less than perfection was acceptable in janices eyes i dont know of anything that hally has done that beta could find fault with janice asserted beta found fault with things most people would consider faultless like d h lawrence and nathaniel hawthorne i reminded her i had a talk with hally yesterday at the very mention of beta harcher and her death he was as nervous as a longtailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs im just wondering why how dare you she sputtered jumping to her feet how dare you come into my home and suggest that my son had anything remotely to do with a murder i crossed my arms spare me the histrionics janice id never have suggested it if beta hadnt had his name on that list and if he hadnt acted so skittish of course he was skittish he knew her she was murdered thats upsetting to people it certainly seemed to upset her remorseful maybe saddened maybe but not skittish hally acts like he has something to hide janice the very suggestion enraged her her arms hanging at her side cocked into ls and her fingers jerked with anger if id been within reach she would have slapped me get out get out of my house she whispered i obviously hadnt handled this well my approach of forthrightness with hally hadnt worked on his mother i set my coffee cup down on her table and i raised palms in supplication okay janice okay dont bust an artery or anything im going she stood there trembling watching me leave i felt like id smeared something nasty across her spotless white interiors hally was pulling up in his little mustang when i walked out onto the yard he smiled uncertainly when he saw me hey jordy he called as he unfolded himself from the car hi hally i said deciding to take the offensive again look ive upset your mother we were discussing beta harcher hallys blue eyes flashed what is it with you jordy why dont you just let the police do their job and leave everyone else alone he was mad at me but he was more scared i could see the fear in his face lurking behind the braggadocio he wore like a mask im sorry i didnt mean to rattle your mother hally ignored me and stormed toward the house i couldnt resist oh hally i did see chelsea hart this morning charming girl she sends you her best he tottered torn between the idea of coming back across the yard and dealing with me and going in the house to either see janice or possibly hide under his bed mom won the door slammed hard behind him rattling the bay windows janice had added to give her house extra class i exhaled slowly not feeling proud of myself well id stirred up the hornets nest at the schneiders i retraced my conversation with janice in my head i could have been a lot more diplomatic i supposed i turned and headed down the street walking along the line where grass met road and balancing on it like a highwire walker josh schneider nearly ran me down before i saw him he came pedaling down the road carefully perched on his little shiny blue bicycle he stopped about three feet dead from me the tires pealing pleasantly as he halted josh hi how are you even as i asked i glanced back at the schneiders we were in front of my house so i didnt think hally or janice could see im sure if they could have josh wouldve been snapped up quick got a second to talk sure he sniffed where hally was a younger version of his father my cousin harold josh was a petite janice he resembled her with his fine looks and brownish hair but more than that he acted like her id never smiled so much as a child i dont think id seen josh without a grin before cheering up the other kids he wasnt smiling now looking a sad figure in dusty jeans a cartooned tshirt and neonlined tennis shoes hey buddy you doing okay i squatted down next to him he shrugged i guess so you sad about something josh nodded i miss miz harcher i loved her my throat tightened someone did actually care about the old battleax i chastened myself for thinking that betas parents must have loved her surely perhaps some young man once considered her pretty and smart and fascinating but that was all long ago maybe joshs love was the only love beta knew my jaw felt tight as i looked into joshs dark unhappy eyes i know you did buddy she loved you too i said it with no knowledge of its truth but it sounded fair if she could have loved anyone maybe it was this little boy who was so unsullied by the sin she saw in everyone else then whyd she have to die jordy josh asked his face frowning into tears he was repressing god how do you explain death to a fiveyearold i couldnt do it i didnt have a clue i took one of joshs hands in mine someone took her away josh i fumbled for an explanation to help but josh didnt need my words he had his own one of the bad people did it he said folding thin arms over his stomach the little martian man from the looney tunes cartoons peered at me from joshs tshirt his head peeking above joshs crossed arms and daring me to contradict the boy i didnt know what defined a bad person but josh was correct to a degree yes a bad person killed her she said they were here josh added mournfully and wiped his nose with the back of his hand bad people were here i asked trying not to sound too stupid in front of this bright little boy this was no news to me though i was stupid much of the time it seemed and beta thought just about everyone was pretty bad yeah she said they were josh blinked at me then glanced around as though bad people might creep up right behind us i tented my cheek with my tongue thinking what did she say about the bad people josh who were they you can tell me i just hoped i wasnt on the dishonor roll josh shrugged with the same idontknow attitude id experienced far too much lately he must be learning it from all the adults around him she just said all the bad people were going to pay pay for what they were going to pay her so she could build this place to talk to god he said glancing toward his house my eyes followed his relieved to see his front yard empty the church they were going to pay her for the church i took joshs shoulders and made him look into my eyes josh listen to me what you just said to me is very important could you tell someone else about it would you tell chief moncrief josh considered his civic duty would he give me a ride in the patrol car and lemme run the siren he asked seriously yes he will and ill call you every time we get a new childrens book at the library i offered this literary bribe didnt have the glamour of the patrol car but it was enough josh took my hand and followed me into the house a glass of milk two slightly stale cookies and a phone conversation with junebug later i dispatched josh home junebug was still on the line when i came back in so now do you believe my blackmail theory i demanded it gives us something to work on which is only a shade better than nothing we need some solid proof jordy junebug opined so lets go over to betas and get it i insisted look its coming up on three i told shannon wed meet her there around then and shed help us look around shannon eh junebug asked shes still miz harcher to me i must not have your charm we all have our small burdens to bear you going to be there or not ill be there he huffed see you shortly i replaced the phone in the hook the bad people indeed josh i thought from the mouths of babes i knew something was wrong the moment i saw the door of betas house it stood ajar shannon might be visiting a small town but she was a bigcity girl and didnt strike me as the type to leave front doors open i jogged up the path to the porch it creaked when i stepped on it shannon i called no answer the second step creaked louder than the first and i paused again shannon its jordy poteet the wind answered me brushing across my face and bringing me the scent of honeysuckle from a neighbors bush i pushed the door open calling shannons name again into the dimness of the entry hall i walked into the living room the curtains were still drawn as beta probably left them but in the light of the doorway i could see the whole room had been trashed chairs were knocked over books spilled down from the highstanding bookshelf drawers from a desk lay yanked free of their snug home i had taken four steps into the room when i heard and saw shannon she lay crumpled by the sofa and the cushions were stained with the blood from her face her arms were flung outward as though ready to give a hug but not a kiss her lovely face was a wet mass stained with blood and hair and what looked like bone her citified black tshirt was ripped at the collar and i could see her bra strap and a white expanse of shoulder the acrid smell of bullet fire pervaded the air in contrast to the sweet honeysuckle on the porch i crouched by her hearing her wet intake of breath before i tried to find a pulse i couldnt bring myself to touch her neck i found a pulse in her wrist the beat had almost faded but it was still there like a last echo on a stage i stumbled through the mess to the phone hearing the porch boards creak under weight junebugs shadow fell into the hallway call an ambulance i hollered shes been shot the next few minutes were a daze junebug bolted back to his car and radioed for help i held shannons cooling hand telling her that help was on its way for her to hold on i dont know if she heard me there was no replying grasp on my fingers and the only noise she made was her breathing i held each breath of mine until she drew another one the ambulance came along with two of junebugs officers someone pulled shannons fingers from mine and i watched them take her off in the ambulance wordlessly i turned back and walked into the house that still smelled of gunfire i stood by the gorestained couch and suddenly needed to sit down but not there i sagged and a strong arm one that felt familiar caught me here jordy junebug said gently sit here he steered me to an easy chair in the corner under a lamp i trod right over the books and smashed bricabrac that littered the floor i sank into the chair junebug squatted by me and over his shoulder i saw a wall of crosses they were of every size and shape some of metal and some of wood and right away i saw they formed a larger cross that stood well over seven feet tall home decor a la harcher i thought crazily it made the scene even more unreal i sunk my face into my hands listen jordy junebug said tell me what happened i told him remembering that it was only two mornings ago id had to relate a somewhat similar story if i kept finding bodies i wasnt going to get invited anywhere shannon wasnt a body i reminded myself she was alive for now i felt cold despite the spring warmth outside junebug squeezed my shoulder when i was done you okay for the first time in all this he sounded like my old friend and rival i looked up at him with gratitude not a common occurrence with me and he smiled grimly i just cant believe this junebug what the hell is going on here one of junebugs officers the nervous one with the cropped hair thatd been at the library stuck his head around the corner busted window in the back bedroom chief he reported crisply looks like the pane was smashed and the window forced up from outside thanks keep checking around let me know what you find junebug shook his head surveying the wrecked room he walked through the mess and i followed him the destruction wasnt quite complete one shelf of cheap glass over a secretarystyle bureau glittered intact and another row of bibles stood on the topmost shelf probably out of the attackers reach pictures on one wall of a younger beta a far primmerlooking shannon in her baylor graduation gown and of a nearsightedlooking couple from the forties peered back at us still hanging straight from the wall shards from a china collection that had seen far better days crunched under my feet junebug glanced back at me maybe you were right jordy beta mustve been hidin somethin in here this aint from any struggle shannon had with her attacker somebody was either looking for something or being a vandal if someone broke in shannon mustve walked in on them i guessed she told me she had an appointment with reverend hufnagel before she was meeting us back here she mustve surprised the intruder is that the story youre peddling now poteet a nasal voice behind me demanded billy ray bummel sauntered in like he owned the place he sniffed the air like a wine connoisseur inhaling tenderly over a glass of vintage red theres been a crime here i do believe i was ready to tell him the only crime was his continued employment by bonaparte county but junebug had his own ax to grind lay off jordy billy ray he didnt have anything to do with this billy ray whirled on the law like it was a misbehaving dog and how are you so sure about that chief let me remind you that mr poteet here has found both members of the harcher family dead in the past two days shannons not dead i argued he waved off that technicality and tried to get as close to my face as his stunted height would allow not yet and why not because youre a lousy shot probably because chief moncrief here caught you before you could snuff out that poor young things life what is it that spawns your violence against womenfolk poteet he was about to see what spawned my violence toward balding onionbreathed lawyers junebug intervened stop it billy ray jordy you take two steps back and dont pay him heed there was a snapping noise and i saw junebug pulling on plastic gloves billy ray jordy was on the phone with me immediately before all this happened he wouldnt have had time to get over here trash this room and shoot shannon we are not talking about running across houston here junebug we are talking about being three streets over he would have had plenty of time billy ray fumed the struggle of doing such calculations draining his energy junebug began picking through the debris of beta harchers den carefully not looking at billy ray nonsense he told billy ray about me finding out what beta had told josh bolstering the theory that beta was using blackmail to build funds for her proposed church billy ray didnt care for that theory he turned back on me youve spun a might tricky web here poteet he sneered i guess you think havin lived in the big city youre going to outfox us reglar folk let me just divest you of that notion mister youre going to have a lethal injection pumped into you if shannon harcher dies and even if you dont youre gonna have one for killing beta i bet my uncle bid could sue you for saying something like that to me i said hopefully my temper was in full force now id seen a lovely young woman lying near death and now this little minnow of a barracuda had the audacity to accuse me with no proof of course i wouldnt sue you as an officer of the court the people of bonaparte county suffer enough every time you open your mouth as their representative of law and order id see about suing you just as you of course what could i ask for as restitution i have no burning need for cheap suits and i just dont think that i want a cardboard diploma from a mailorder law school with a postoffice address billy ray showed he had some hot blood by having it all rush right to his face one big vein popped up on his forehead and i wished for a shrimp deveiner the little lunk might have actually tried to hit me our arguing had brought the palefaced young deputy back into the room but junebug kept shuffling through the dross of betas den the young deputy stepped between billy ray and me but it was hardly necessary i wasnt going to stoop to hitting the worm and he wasnt about to strike me and get a rep for slapping around taxpayers and fellow civil servants jordy junebug said in his regular polite slow drawl what was the name of eula maes first book the question was so unexpected billy ray and i quit glaring at each other and turned to him junebug stood setting an open bible on a table a yellowed piece of stationery was in his hand and he peered at it like it held the wisdom of the ages i had to think over eula maes impressive publishing credentials the rose of san jacinto i finally said and she published it right junebug said not a vanity press if thats what you mean i answered misunderstanding it was published by one of the big new york houses junebug chewed his lip yall better look at this i nudged in front of billy ray and scanned the aged letter junebug held in his hand my breath caught at the end blossom street mirabeau texas january ms eleanora parkinson parkinson literary agency east nd street new york new york dear ms parkinson ive written a romance novel set during the texas revolution the working title is the rose of san jacinto its the story of a young woman who is torn between her arranged marriage to a mexican officer and the gallant rebel that she loves the book is in finished form and is around words i havent been published before but my sister thinks its good please let me know if you would be interested in representing this novel to publishers sincerely patty quiff patty who the hells patty billy ray muttered i found my voice eula maes sister her older sister she died in oh about cancer billy ray drew in a long breath like a bloodhound scenting a deer well well well isnt this interesting junebug pulled a plastic bag from his back pocket and eased the document inside doesnt prove anything yet billy ray billy ray coughed kind of indicates to me ol eula maes been pulling the wool over the literary eyes of not just mirabeau but new yawk as well she was working on her latest book when we got there billy ray had tried to send me home but junebug said i could stay he told billy ray that eula mae was a friend of mine and i could talk to her perhaps a bit easier than either of them eula mae greeted us with her usual civility and charm today she wore some long dashikitype of robe speckled with bright purples oranges and blacks like the plumage of a tropical bird her eyes darted from face to face as though we were predators of the rainforest she bade us sit down in her living room for which the operative word was wicker i hadnt seen so many swirls since my teenage job in an ice cream shop junebug and i settled on a couch with a back of dizzying arabesques and billy ray perched next to us on a straightback chair yall wait just one second and ill get us some tea she trilled heading into the kitchen you ought to have someone watching the back door billy ray hissed at junebug she might try and go over that rose hedge in the back i dont think thatll be necessary billy ray junebug said mildly the cat i hadnt befriended the other day wandered in and eyed our merry band he regarded me with disdain junebug with curiosity andperceptivelybilly ray with contempt he hissed at the assistant da arching his back probably the only time billy ray has seen a back arch in his presence and scurried from the room i liked cats better all of a sudden eula mae returned with a tray of icedtea glasses each topped with a sprig of mint from her garden we made momentary small talk as she served us nervousness hit me like a rock and i sipped at my tea for once not wanting to say anything finding shannon wounded had dulled me reading the letter by eula maes sister had stunned me and now i sat in my friends parlor with law and order on each side to debate fraud and murder god i wanted a cigarette eula mae sat in a comfortable chair next to the wicker sofa across the coffee table from billy ray to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit junebug raised a warning hand to billy ray and for once billy ray leashed his tongue i dont suppose youve heard that miz harchers niece was shot today at her house junebug said eula maes face crumpled oh my lord no i hadnt heard she paused i didnt even know beta had kinfolks still around here girls from houston junebug replied someone shot her in the face dont know yet if shell live or not young girl too early twenties how horrible eula mae shook her head then looked uncertainly at me jordy found shannon harcher junebug said as if that explained my presence he also found another witness that said basically that beta was extorting money from folks to finance a church she planned to start over in houston i saw the fight for control on her face the wrinkled corners of her lipsticked mouth jerked just once her silver bracelets choking with charms tinkled as she smoothed out her skirt and why are yall telling me this trying to give me the plot for my next potboiler she laughed and it sounded jagged we think shannon harcher walked in on someone ransacking the house looking for something maybe something beta was holding over their head and using to get money junebug explained so answer me junebug eula maes voice rose i dont know anything about beta getting killed or this shannon girl getting shot why are you here to see me junebug set his mouth in a thin line we found a letter there eula mae a letter apparently from your sister to a literary agent asking about representing a book shed written called the rose of san jacinto eula mae did not withstand adversity as well as her heroines her face blanched the lines in it seeming to darken as she frowned one hand flew up to her forehead like a startled bird returning to roost ii she stuttered i saw billy ray starting to uncoil like a striking rattler perhaps junebug i suggested eula mae should have some legal representation present if youre going to accuse her or no eula mae thundered and i fell silent no lawyers she whispered and her eyes flicked across each of our faces no one else who else knows about this junebug just the three of us he answered softly ii want your help each of you please she whispered this woman seemed crushed not like the eula mae who always tried to run the library board meetings who played her local fans like a string quartet who had beaten the odds to make a living as a writer even her curly uncontrollable hair was listless her eyes usually sparkling with gossip and merriment stared at the floor what kind of help i asked i want you to help my sister she said which left us all silent eula mae waved a tired hand and began an explanation a few weeks back the baptist church committee came by looking for items for their rummage sale i gave them a box of old books that had been my sister pattys i didnt think to look through themthey were just old books of hers writers shed admired as a teacher welty balzac thoreau turgenev robert penn warren i gave them those books and never gave it a second thought till beta paid you a visit i said finishing her sentence for her eula mae stared at me and through me it didnt matter what id said shed gone through the box i donated and found a letter patty wrote to an agentabout her book eula maes tongue flickered across her lips i never knew patty even wrote a draft of such a letter she never sent one she was a wonderful writer but she was just too afraid of rejection i kept urging her to send it but she didnt want to hear anyone say no to it then she thought people around here would tease her for writing a romance novel i suggested she publish it under a pseudonym but she just laughed she said if she ever did itd be under a joke name like jocelyn lushe she just made up that name out of the blue tears formed in eula maes eyes junebug offered her a handkerchief and she took it wiping her eyes after patty died i just hated the thought of that manuscript sitting there i started submitting it but i was afraid no one would touch it if they knew a dead woman had written it those romance houses they want to know they can buy a book and expect others to follow from the same author build a series and an audience so i said the book was mine and i used the jocelyn lushe name it didnt seem like i was taking credit for her or stealing from her because it wasnt my name it was her pseudonym i didnt plan on continuing iti just wanted to get pattys book published so i did and it did really well it made a lot of money the publisher started asking me for my next manuscript she paused and wiped her eyes again i didnt want to stop writing those books was like having patty back around shed had gobs of notes for ideas so i went through those and wrote another book then i got a threebook contract and i just had to keep writing them stealing from a dead womanyour own sisterto make yourself famous billy ray snorted shaking his head at eula mae with contempt he got as good as he gave think what you want billy ray she snapped there have been eleven jocelyn lushe books i wrote ten of them and theyve done damned well i didnt steal from patty i kept her dream alive i did all the hard work but beta found out junebug prompted she nodded miserably beta found out she came to me with the letter id never known patty had written it it would have been just like her to write it then not mail it just slipped into that book to mail when she got her courage up i guess her cancer took all her courage she dabbed at her eyes and when she looked up again they blazed free of tears beta told me as payback for helping to remove her from the library board that shed expose the first book as being pattys not mine shed call my publisher the romance writers of america the news stations in austin it could have been very professionally devastating so why didnt she just do that billy ray demanded she wanted money money for her silence eula mae replied so you gave her i finished eager to hear and have my theory entirely justified eula mae blinked at me no i gave her so who gave her the other i started but junebug shushed me whend you give her this money eula mae junebug asked she sniffed wiping her nose with the handkerchief the week before she died i met her at her house shed been babysitting little josh schneider the schneiders dropped her off at her place and i gave her cash she wanted more but i said no i decided i wasnt going to keep paying blackmail to that horrible woman and and so you killed her billy ray interrupted im gonna guess you didnt tell her no more payments you agreed to make one final payment at the library two nights ago you killed her to shut her up and stop the extortion but you still needed to find that letter so you broke into betas house tore up her den looking for it and when shannon harcher walked in on you you shot her in cold blood the assistant district attorney leaned as far forward as he could spewing his accusation like he usually spewed bad breath eula mae trembled that sir is whats known as a damnable lie she retorted and one of her characters couldnt have said it better i leaned over and took eula maes hand i dont know who killed beta eula mae said but it wasnt me i had nothing to do with that had you told her you werent going to pay her any more money junebug asked quietly she shook her head she told me shed want more later but not when i decided the day after id paid i wasnt going to give in to that holierthanthou witch you didnt need too miz quiff billy ray asserted youd already decided to take action and you did well this little scandal should help your book sales her eyes blazed like an irate devils you little shyster she barked i mightve expected that from you i told you this cause i said i wanted you to help my sister help me keep her dream alive dont tell anyone what beta knew do what you like to eula mae quiff but dont ruin jocelyn lushe billy ray shook his head no way miz quiff theres no way to keep that quiet when your trial starts miz quiff junebug said not using her christian names i didnt take that as a good sign where were you between two and three this afternoon her hand trembled in mine here editing a manuscript she paused alone did you see or talk to anyone he pressed she shook her head no i did not billy ray stood i think weve heard enough chief junebug looked up at him not wanting to get up from the wicker sofa the air in the room had taken on a dense thick quality i felt choked junebug finally rose to his feet im sorry miz quiff im going to have to take you down to the station for further questioning junebug please she gasped i didnt do it i didnt kill beta i didnt shoot that girl you know me you know i couldnt he stared into her face his mouth worked for a moment then he found his words youre under arrest for the shooting of shannon harcher you have the right to remain silent do you understand eula mae sagged against me and i held her up she only needed a moment she found the strength in herself and stood straight i stood next to her listening to her miranda rights she said she understood everything he said to her i felt like i didnt understand a damned thing eula mae had lied and taking credit for her sisters work wasnt too acceptable but i didnt think she was a killer the handcuffs chief billy ray said when her rights were read thats not necessary i assure you eula mae looked shocked at the very suggestion billy ray began a whiny protest but junebug shook his head the police chief took her by the elbow and led her toward the door i finally found my voice eula mae do you want me to call my uncle bid god no she retorted you better get me a real lawyer shannon shot and eula mae arrested youre kidding right sister was incredulous no im not he arrested her i poured dr pepper over ice cubes and listened to them pop i forced a grilled cheese sandwich into my mouth it was tasteless what does junebug think eula mae did read one of her books to beta and bore her to death sister snorted he and billy ray must be out of their minds what proof do they have i chewed id come straight home to find mark watching gory films in my room while mama napped and sister ran midafternoon errands id called a respectablesounding lawyer in the bavary yellow pageshaving the biggest ad does make a difference in dire straitsand hired him for eula mae id made some food i didnt have an appetite for and tried to eat sisters demands for information kept my mouth busy its a case of sorts eula mae doesnt have any alibis shes got a key to the library and she sure as hell had a motive sister pressed me for what motive in particular but id decided to keep eula maes reasons to myself i wasnt going to be the one to wreck her career hell maybe this wouldnt wreck it but obviously eula mae thought her literary reputation was worth at least the phone jangled sister scooped it up with a quick hello you listen here junebug she said after a moment if you work late tonight you come over to the truck stop and ill fix you up with some of my peach cobbler i want to have a word with you silence while sister listened dont you jaw that old line at me hewett moncrief you sound like one of those ventriloquists dummies sitting on billy rays knee eyes rolling she handed the phone to me jordy here hey junebug said subdued i guess yall can open the library my officers are busy doing sceneofcrime work over at miz harchers house theyre all finished up with the back room at the library thanks i might even reopen this afternoon im going nuts just sitting around here well i would like for you to come over right now and give a statement about finding shannon harcher okay i said let me make a couple of phone calls and ill be down we both hung up i called the hospital they wouldnt provide information about shannons condition i asked for ruth but they said she was on duty in the emergency room i had a feeling she was working on shannon i called adam hufnagel his wife tamma answered sounding like shed caught a bad cold and had just woken up what did you say she asked after id asked for adam i sighed trying not to sound impatient i need to speak with adam hes trying to take a nap jordy hes had a hard day well maybe you can help me tamma do you know did he keep his appointment with shannon harcher today there was a moments silence yes he mentioned he saw her why do you ask her voice held the edge of suspicion shed shown when she confronted me in her husbands office if you have an extension please put him on it i said i have news he needs to hearyou both need to hear there mustve been something in my tone because she didnt argue i held while she roused him when he came on the line i waited until i heard tamma pick the phone back up shannon harcher was shot today at betas house junebug and i found her shes in critical condition at the hospital theyve arrested eula mae i said adam wheezed and tamma was silent why eula mae i dont want to get into that but apparently i was right beta was profiting from her involvement in your churchs activities like your rummage sale just thought youd like to know you might want to be a little more choosy with your volunteers i hung up not wanting to further my conversation with those two i called candace told her what all had happened during the course of the afternoon including eula maes confessioni trusted candace to keep a secret to the grave and asked her to open up the library i asked her if shed mind working late so folks could use the library a bit longer than usual since itd been closed for two days she didnt mind a whit and kept inquiring as to my wellbeing i told her id see her shortly i finished eating and told sister id be home later than usual we went upstairs and checked with mark hed laid in a big supply of borrowed videos and wasnt averse to taking care of mama i put the vcr on pause and told him about shannon marks dark eyes grew wide can we go down to the hospital to see her i shook my head not now shes in intensive care im sure maybe later is she going to die was it gross do you think shes in a lot of pain i dont know mark and yes it was gross i glanced at the videotapes hed borrowed from friends every one a bloodbath i dont think ill ever want to see one of those movies again myself mark looked at the collected arnolds and dirty harrys with new eyes he pushed the off button and the vcr fell quiet maybe not these tonight maybe ill just read a book for a change i went to the police station and made my statement it was fairly short and simple billy ray wasnt around to taunt me this time he was too busy arguing with eula mae and the lawyer from bavary id hired apparently she and her lawyer were getting along just fine they could both yell you deaf i nearly felt sorry for junebug i picked up my notes on the case and shuffled through them i thought a lot of questions were still unanswered by eula maes arrest i stuck my notebook under my arm and headed out i parked in front of the library it was nearly four and we usually closed at six on thursdays i suppose it was hardly worth opening for two remaining hours but i figured candace and i could wrap up any loose ends from having been closed for a while plus we might stay open a bit later let the curiosity seekers get it out of their systems going in was a little harder than i thought it would be my hand froze as i reached for the door betas bludgeoned face eyes wide open in death wasnt waiting in there for me this time but i couldnt erase her easily from my thoughts i made a concerted effort and instead of betas battered head i saw shannons bloodied face my fingertips massaged my eyes too much death too much suffering for one little town i heard the door open and candace was there wrapping her arms around me you okay she breathed against my chest yeah god what a week i said then chortled nervously my own laughter sounded tinny in my ears we put arms around each other and walked into the library together the air had the same dense quality about it that beta harchers house had i told myself that it was just from the library being shut up for two days not death lingering in the air like some foul fog the old airconditioning system sputtered and cranked away but it hadnt yet dispelled the foreboding pressing atmosphere shed brewed coffee in the only brewer we hadback in the room where betas body had lain i set my notebook on the counter and i went back there the tape outline was still down etching where she fell i didnt know if i was yet allowed to pull the tape up but i did yanking it up violently i wasnt about to velvetrope this section of the library and charge a quarter a peek i felt madmad that beta had hurt people mad at what id been through mad that shannon was lying near death even mad that little josh schneider got an awful early introduction to what death meant candace watched me waiting for me to talk if eula mae killed her i finally said that means beta died for i never thought of a life in monetary terms i realized i was lying as soon as i said it id thought of how much money mama would need to live her limbo existence over the next twenty years i closed my eyes feeling more anger and shame i got up poured coffee and went back to my tiny office i sat down and candace sat across from me she was watching me with a concern that made me uneasy i wonderednot for the first timewhat it would be like to kiss her instead i coughed i suppose we should reshelve and check in books in the drop slip i said attempting to sound professional doesnt look like were going to get any takers today candace shook her head fraid so i felt creepy when i got here and i didnt know how long youd be at the station so i called some of the regulars old man renfro and gaston leach both said theyd be over shortly followed undoubtedly by the town curious wholl want to tour the death scene shall you be the docent or shall i i said i sipped at my coffee i kept thinking about eula mae in jail and accused of murder and attempted murder something niggled at my mind something in all this that didnt fit i thought of matt blalock and simmering hatred i thought of ruth wills an accusation of poisoning that didnt stand up i thought of hally schneider who had been right about a secret connection between beta and eula mae yet still seemed awfully nervous for an innocent bystander i thought of bob don who seemed to want to help me and fought violently with beta less than a week before her death i thought of the hufnagels and how their church wasnt good enough for betas ambitions and i thought of my mother her presence on betas list still unexplained billy ray thought he had his woman now but i wasnt convinced i went over to the localauthors shelf eula mae was currently the only mirabeau resident with fulfilled literary aspirations and her collected works sat in a row i plucked her first novel from the shelf the copyright was in eula maes name id thought for a moment that if it was copyrighted under the jocelyn lushe pseudonym that eula mae would have had an easy out no one could have necessarily accused her of lying but it wasnt so shed claimed each book as her own i replaced the rose of san jacinto on the shelf and went back to candace theres still that was in betas savings account that didnt come from eula mae i told candace so where the hell did that come from she embezzle from the girl scout cookie fund the bells above the front door jangled and from my office i saw old man renfro and gaston leach come into view i couldnt have conjured up a more unlikely pair old man renfro always wore a threadbare suit he mustve had a whole armoire of them snowy white hair topped his dark wise face he was retired from the post office and when he had tired of reading peoples addresses hed ended up spending his days at the library it would not be unreasonable to guess hed read everything in the library at least once even the childrens section reading them to his several grandchildren according to what id heard hed attacked the shelves methodically moving through the dewey decimal system as if it were a grocery list and devouring every book his real name was willie but every one called him old man renfro gaston leach was what every kid in high school aspired not to be he was a gawky youth that might one day the charitable among us said turn from ugly duckling to swan we could only pray hed develop some social skills to go along with any external improvements he had a mind id have killed for and a face id have committed suicide over his parents apparently had little concern for gastons ability to interact with others because they sent him out in tacky clothing the dead wouldnt wear and bought him eyeglasses with lenses that could double as drink coasters not to mention the pairing of his first name with his last his thick mop of black hair fell in a bad cut across his forehead today he was resplendent in toolong gray trousers that hung low on his bony hips and a shirt with a nauseating orange plaid never failing to accessorize incorrectly he held up his pants with a westernstyle brown belt and wore black shoes hed missed being cool by several feet today glad to see yall are back open old man renfro proclaimed well miss harcher did manage to close the library for a while but not in the way she thought she would gaston was less philosophical the new mccaffrey come in while yall were closed he demanded turning those powerful lenses on the newarrivals bin no gaston i said having no idea i hadnt checked our mail drop but i didnt want to get into another long discussion with gaston about the relative merits of the sciencefiction selection at the mirabeau public library oh gaston muttered highbeaming reproachfully at candace she mustve bribed him to come over apparently the idea of being supportive of folks he saw every day was an alien concept that couldnt be right i thought gaston explored alien concepts every day what with his reading list old man renfro took gaston by the elbow and steered him to a chair in the periodicals section candace and i followed candace says that theres been a shooting and that eula mae has been arrested for that crime and for miss harchers murder old man renfro said his voice was a carefully modulated tenor he was one of those gentlemen who is very careful about how he speaks because hed grown up in a house where it hadnt mattered and hed made a conscious decision to be correct if his voice was any deeper he couldve subbed for james earl jones i nodded so i guess im not under suspicion any more but i cant believe that eula mae is some calculating plotter having read her books neither can i old man renfro agreed with a tad of asperity yes eula maes strong suit has always been characters i retorted i didnt feel picking on eula maes writing skills was helpful at this critical time her character hasnt always been above reproach old man renfro said turning his own wordplay but i find it hard to believe eula mae would willingly hurt another person much less a young woman she didnt know whatll happen to eula maes cats when shes in jail gaston wondered maybe shell donate them to science gaston dear ill take care of her cats dont you worry candace patted his arm looking a mite green i only know what i read from sayers christie and hammett old man renfro tented his fingers across his face but if eula mae was going to kill someone i dont see her swinging a baseball bat or firing a gun i think a nice quick poison would be her choice not to sound morbid but i dont think eula mae would want to see someone die at her feet she would much rather spike their iced tea with something that would not act immediately get out and leave their final sufferings to her overactive imagination i opened my mouth and shut it again before flies made it a home he was absolutely right what i dont get is why miz harcher was even in the library when she got killed gaston interjected wiping his nose without benefit of facial tissue she didnt even like this place i quickly explained junebugs theory that beta had intended to incinerate this den of evil old man renfros eyes hardened and gaston wheezed with dismay at the thought of all his unread anne mccaffreys piers anthonys and andre nortons that would have gone up in smoke i dont understand that candace put in she ran a hand through her lovely tawny hair and frowned does that mean the killer was here to help her burn down the library maybe thats how the killer lured her here i said offering to help her burn down the place she hadnt been able to censor or close that wouldve appealed to beta and the person mustve been someone she wasnt afraid of old man renfro added someone it wouldnt bother her to be alone with i dont think she was afraid of anybody candace said i thought of that list of names i think more folks were afraid of her than the other way around i pulled out my notes and flipped to the questions i wrote this up after she was killed my eyes flicked to old man renfro and gaston there are things mentioned here that arent mentioned in the paper can i count on yalls discretion old man renfro nodded and him i didnt worry about gaston was another problem though anything he knew about the case hed brag about to his classmates in a futile attempt to move up the high school food chain now gaston dont go blabbing about what we talk about here if you doand rest assured i will hear if your lips start flappingim going to cut back on the sciencefiction orders no new david brins or greg bears do you understand me he nodded like a scared addict afraid that his supply would be terminated i could almost imagine gaston stealing tvs so he could hit the used bookstores in austin to keep the narcotics of his favorite literary pastime available i opened the notebook and went down the list of questions i still dont know why beta had made that list of names and bible verses but i suspected it had to do with blackmail she knew eula mae had faked her first book and eula maes quote talked about an enemy writing a book some of the other quotessuch as tammas and bob donsalso hinted at secrets preferably kept i realized though i still didnt have answers to most of my questions i still didnt know why beta was dressed in black unless it was supposed to be in vogue for nighttime book burnings why her shoes were caked with mud and why the killer used the bat in my office i did know why she was at the library now but her having a key still bothered me if eula mae had met her at the library to kill her beta wouldnt have needed a key eula mae had one so why swipe adam hufnagels key the one found on her person i only had the hufnagels word that beta had taken the key could they have given it to her knowing she might burn down the library did they still hold a grudge for having lost the censorship fight old man renfro looked through my notes humming gaston leaned over his shoulder and i fished out a tissue for him just to protect old man renfros jacket allergies are tough here in the spring i hope at the end of our lives there are no questions old man renfro said softly i used to think i knew who beta harcher was but i didnt who did you think she was candace asked id heard she wasnt always the paragon of religious virtue she pretended to be i added old man renfro leaned back she was a very pretty young woman i remember she used to come into the post office when she was young back in the fifties she had a pen pal in europe i remember that because those were the only letters i ever remember mailing to norway she always seemed to be in a sweet good mood sourness crept in somewhere i interrupted that norwegian pen pal send her some pickled herring that stuck in her mouth old man renfro shook his head i dont like to repeat old gossip especially if theres no way to prove it but i guess when you die by violence you lose all privacy your lifes not the only thing your murderer steals from you his dark eyes met mine there was a rumor long ago that she got her religion on a trip to mexico mexico candace said she wasnt catholic no she didnt get any particular faith old man renfro agreed but back then young ladies could get problems taken care of over the border they couldnt always get taken care of here gaston appeared utterly lost but i swallowed you mean shed gotten in trouble an abortion old man renfro nodded that was just the rumor that swept through town but i dont think anyone really believed it my sister told me shed heard it from a lady who cooked for one of the harchers neighbors of course beta started going to church on pretty much a twentyfourhour basis and i guess that rumor died like most do i shook my head im not going to go chasing thirtyyearold shadows on rumor gaston scanned the list again her shoes were real muddy caked with it candace answered maybe her car broke down again gaston offered helpfully what dyou mean i asked you working for triple a now gaston sniffed naw i just saw her car last week out on the dirt road that goes out to the east side of bavary late last wednesday night i was coming back from my d and d game d and d old man renfro asked sounding as though he thought gaston was engaging in kinky hobbies with bavary housewives dungeons and dragons gaston explained with a sigh its this really cool game where you pretend to be a fantasy character and you have adventures thank you gaston but you said you saw her car i wasnt in the mood to hear about gastons latest escapades as a slayer of dragons and saver of virgins oh well yeah see i wasnt really concentrating on the road because i was mad i hadnt killed the black druid with my enchanted broadsword when i couldve and i was wondering if id have a second chance next week gaston i interrupted again im sure tolkien fans will be in a mad dash to buy your adventure when you get it all written down but where did you see betas car late at night he looked hurt behind those thick lenses and i felt bad i squeezed his bony shoulder sorry i said im just a little jumpy as i was saying gaston began with great dignity i was concentrating on my poor strategy in the game i nearly ran her car down she was barely parked on the shoulder i knew it was her car cause it had all those jesus bumper stickers on it i nodded beta had driven an old ford tempo with enough religious bumper stickers on it to look like a scout car for a billy graham revival anyhow i stopped because i thought her car mustve broken down and it was awful latearound eleven i got out but she wasnt in the car i called out her name but there wasnt any answer i figured someone else had picked her up and she hadnt come back for the car yet where on the road was this i asked not too far out of town he shrugged maybe a couple of miles no more near the blalock farm isnt that interesting i said to candace i was sort of glad shed gotten picked up gaston continued she didnt like me well gaston you did speak out very eloquently against censorship when she tried to i started but gaston shook his head fortunately no grease flew off no thats not it i go to the baptist church she heard about the kind of books i like to read and the roleplaying games i like to play i tried to get some of the other youthgroup kids interested in playing one that doesnt even involve swords and sorcery on a retreat and she chewed me out good gaston said the picture of wounded innocence she said they were satanic and evil of course she didnt know that bobby jay tumpfer and lila duke were sneaking into each others rooms during that whole trip and all i wanted to do was play a game hey gaston was this the trip to lake travis that beta chaperoned i asked yeah she and mrs hufnagel went with us it rained so there wasnt much to do cept listen to miz harcher preach at us sounds like she was warming up for her church with yall i muttered anything else happen on that trip gaston thought no we were all just trying to figure out when bobby jay and lila were going to get caught and what old beta would do if she caught em and nobody really picked on me too much during that trip it seemed a fond memory for him and he paused oh well that was the trip that hallys daddys camcorder got stolen a camcorder i asked yeah one his dad loaned him for the trip he left his room unlocked or something and somebody took off with it there were a couple of other youth groups there too so i suppose someone from one of them took it it never did turn up and hally was awful upset a missing camcorder beta had checked out a book on using camcorders had she swiped it and not gotten the instruction manual at the same time the phone jangled interrupting my thoughts candace scooped it up mirabeau library candace speaking she said her eyes frosted lightly why yes ruth he is one moment she handed me the phone your little friend in white although why shes allowed to wear that color i dont know old man renfro and gaston stared at this unusual ferocity from candace she smiled sweetly at them hello ruth i said jordy hi listen i only have a minute i understand from junebug that you found shannon harcher today yeah i thought you might want to know her condition i tried earlier but they wouldnt tell me anything shes in a coma ruth said her voice lowering shes got a depressed skull fracture theres been a lot of bleeding around the brain shes going to need surgery my god do you think she has a chance i thought of telling mark that she didnt and dreaded it yes i do ruth said the bullet didnt actually penetrate shannons brain it hit and deflected at a fairly thick part of her skull her face is going to need some fixing later but if they can relieve the pressure around the brain id say her chances are good shes young and strong theyre getting in a specialist from austin tonight oh god i hope she makes it i breathed thanks for calling and letting me know i knew youd be worried about her ruth said her voice sweetening and i have a selfish reason for calling too i hoped you might be able to come by the hospital now i have a matter id like to discuss with you i dont know ruth we just reopened the library and im pretty backlogged im sure candace can handle that she seems extraordinarily capable of taking care of all those mundane boring details ruth said please jordy its important ill expect you here in about fifteen minutes meet me in the front lobby i hesitated then decided to take her up on her offer okay fine ill be there goodbye i replaced the phone receiver in its cradle i looked at the trio before me shannon harchers in a coma right now but they think she has a chance shes undergoing brain surgery that last part seemed a good segue so i added they need me to come down to the hospital candaces eyebrows arched they do do they are they looking for a brain donor yes i mean no i muttered look candace can you keep this place open just another hour or so i really do need to go down to the hospital and see how shannons doing sure why not she said its not like i had any other pressing engagements this evening i thanked her and thanked gaston and old man renfro for their help picking up my notebook on beta i dashed into the late afternoon sunlight i hate the smell of hospitals i tried to ignore the heady mix of antiseptic bland food and general illness that pervades that mecca of modern medicine mirabeau memorial ruth met me in the front lobby holding a baby ruth candy bar that she said was her snack for a quick break she munched on it as we walked through the hallways junebug has shannon harcher under police guard she told me whoever hurt her isnt going to get another try you know theyve made an arrest i asked she shook her head i told her about eula mae for a moment there was complete shock on ruths finely featured face she blinked and the surprise dropped away like flaky makeup i suppose they must have had good reason for that yes i can see eula mae killing someone i stopped and waited for an overweight aging candystriper to lumber past us out of earshot really i thought you looked surprised there for a second were you expecting someone else to be arrested bob don matt me im sorry eula mae was arrested i know shes your friend you dont have to take your anger out on me ruth pouted her pretty little lip trembling i frowned i dont like pouters and i especially dont like fake pouters sorry didnt mean to blame you now what was this business that was so darned important ruth the lip slid back in like it was automated ruth took my hand looked both ways down the empty hospital hallway like she was crossing a street and led me into a room it was an empty private patients room the only light burning a dim one from the bathroom she leaned against the heavy door and it slowly closed ruth i began but her mouth didnt let me finish she pulled my head down to hers kissing me hard tangling her fingers in my hair its no excuse but i hadnt been kissed like that in ages her mouth tasted of warm chocolate and caramel my body responded while my mind continued to mull over the implications her hands ran across my body feeling lightly exploring fingernails nipped playfully at sensitive areas and i gasped pulling her closer she broke the kiss but kept her mouth scantly off mine see there we make a good team i knew we would she breathed softly into my face see i can help you and youshe squeezed my buttockscan help me okay ruth i said restraining the urge to kiss her again this sounded more like negotiations of commerce than declarations of affection or even lust what do you mean by all this she kissed me hard again i pulled back how would you like she said pressing her breasts against me to be sure your mothers never in a home it wasnt the question that i was expecting my mouth opened in surprise and she covered it with her own she pulled away and flicked her tongue across my bottom lip i closed my mouth and pulled away from her what do you mean what are you talking about be at my house around ten tonight and ill tell you she said no ruth tell me now i came all the way over here so i could let you know how i felt and see how you felt she laughed sliding her palms along my back and you feel wonderful this is just a warmup darling we need privacy she jerked her head toward the door and i heard a faint murmur of voices beyond talking about an iv drip ten be there jordy you wont regret it she gave me a quick decorous kiss now im going to walk out you walk out about a minute later i dont want my coworkers to gossip about me she turned and walked out leaving me alone in the darkness i stood there counting to sixty then walked out into the brightness of the hallway ruth stood at the far end of the hall at the nurses station talking over a chart with a young nurse i turned and walked the opposite way i sat in my blazer for a few minutes ruth sure liked to dangle carrots in front of your face hoping youd take a bite she knew from my response that i was attracted to her i was physically but i didnt care much for this secretiveness if she thought it was alluring she was wrong i wiped her lipstick from my face with my handkerchief i wasnt sure that i would go see her at ten i started up the engine but i didnt particularly feel like heading back to the library and seeing candace i didnt feel guilty per se but i wasnt comfortable about talking to candace right after id been kissing another woman and i hadnt even kissed candace go figure instead of heading back to the library i drove in the direction of bob don goertzs house id meant to get back to see him but i hadnt had a chance seeing ruth reminded me about the fight she claimed to have witnessed between beta and bob don i thought it was high time i found out a little more about that particular incident odd the whims that take us and forever change our lives i heard glass shatter as i walked up to the goertzes front door the door was made of thick wood and beveled frosted panes that you couldnt see through my first thought was that someone had dropped a glass in the kitchen but my finger hesitated above the doorbell i wasnt even sure what id heard i stepped back from the door and looked up at the sprawling colonial home the car business didnt seem to be hurting too badly i thought i put my head back to the door leaning my forehead against it strangely reluctant to ring the bell i heard voices raised bob dons among them pleading i pressed the button and the bell rang echoing inside the home i heard a shouted no and stepped away from the door thinking this was not the time for a social call id made about three backward steps when the porch light snapped on and the door opened it wasnt just an entrance it was a crutch a woman i recognized from the framed photos in bob dons office leaned against the door she would have fallen if the door hadnt been there in the pictures in her husbands office she looked like a typically meek quiet smalltown housewife now she looked like a streetworn harridan the hairsprayed halo in her pictures was gone a lank length of graying dark hair hung past her shoulder she was in a rumpled pink housecoat that looked as if shed slept in it her eyes dulled as dusty marbles blearily blinked and found me in the porch light mrs goertz i began ready to beat a hasty retreat i wanted no part of a drunken scene sister was right i could smell the whiskey on gretchen goertz like shed bathed in it well here you are i know you i know you her voice sounded like a thumb scraping a dry empty bottle i couldnt remember that id had the formal pleasure of meeting mrs goertz lord knows she would have made an impression on pert near anybody mrs goertz i tried again taking another step back you come in here you come in here and watch me kill him she rasped i stopped moving backward she swayed in the doorway like a snake and i decided to try charm id talked a drunken highschool friend down from the water tower when i was a teenager i could handle a wasted gretchen goertz you doing okay mrs goertz you feeling all right i said in my most syrupy friendly goodolboy voice fuck you she said in clear ladylike enunciation i told you to come on in here and watch me kill him now youre not wanting to kill anyone are you mrs goertz i wheedled god no wonder bob don smoked heavy and kept a pint at work if this was his domestic life she was scaring me and now i wondered what might happen to bob don if i didnt check on him and get her sobered up he hadnt come to the door and i didnt think most men would let their wives hold drunken teteatetes with the neighborhood i moved back onto the porch and she flung the door wide open in better light she looked worse cmon in kid cmon in and see all the hell youve caused me i was firmly of the opinion her hell was a private matter between her and jack daniels i went into the entry hall moving past her not looking at her i saw a living room ahead and headed for that the living room was blasted with light it was oblong with a fireplace in the middle pale and uninspired furniture on each end and a wet bar on the side of the living room that led toward the kitchen the carpet was a light beige and i wagered it was well worn by gretchens slippers as you got closer to the bar an oil painting of gretchen goertz hung above the cold fireplace where a shattered glass sparkled broad swipes of paint made the portrait look better than the model bob don huddled on the couch his broad face in his hands he was crying it was not a hysterical kind of sobbing but a slow methodical weeping like he was cleaning out the closet of his soul i could see the mark of fingernails cutting across his cheek bisecting one of his long sideburns i stepped to his side bob don you okay he looked up at me not registering me for a moment he blinked tears from his reddened eyes oh christ he said his usual heartiness gone oh mother of christ you got to leave jordy just leave i knelt by him listen bob don gretchens drunk and saying shes going to kill you why dont i help you get her settled if you want and you have to leave bob don screamed he jumped to his feet nearly knocking me over i balanced myself putting a hand out to the carpet he leaned down and seized my shoulders in his beefy hands he yanked me to my feet get out get out get out he kept crying not demanding but begging majorleague domestic problem i decided congratulating myself on my quick and reliable insight i thought none of my concern hes not dead so she hasnt carried out her threats and shes too drunk to hurt him goodbye mr and mrs goertz and have a lovely evening bob don hustled me to the entrance like i was a steer straying from the herd but gretchen cut us off she pressed wet liquorreeking hands against my chest while bob don tried to push from behind i jerked away from them both gretchen slammed the front door shut dont leave jordy dont leave she whispered stepping toward me she looked horrible i could see now that makeup was smeared across her face as though shed tried fixing herself up long after the daily bottle was opened jordy has to go now gretchen bob don insisted trying to pull me away from her just go out the back jordy and ill call you tomorrow about that truck you wanted you are not selling him any damn car gretchen goertz screamed i will never forget that scream as long as i live it sounded the way you might scream if you were dead and buried for a year and then god let you have feeling and voice back her voice scraped down my spine bob don wasnt pulling me anymore i was moving on my own accord quit pretending she said more hoarsely dont you leave this house you little bastard not after all the trouble youve caused me dont you walk out jordan poteet she spat out my name like it was phlegm not after youve ruined my life you little shit i stopped back in the living room she followed me in youre drunk mrs goertz so im not going to pay heed to anything you say i suggest you go to bed and get some rest i steadied my voice youre upset and youve upset bob don i dont know what ive done to hurt you but i wont trouble you further im leaving with what dignity i could muster i turned my back on her and headed for the kitchen i figured thered be a back door and i could get out you stay you stay you stay she sobbed at my retreating back ill leave and you stay i paused and heard bob don behind me say gretchen listen shut up she howled at him sobs racked her shut up he can stay and ill leave that way youll have some quality time with your precious bastard son i stopped in my tracks in the darkened kitchen as though her words were glue sticking me to the floor i heard a body hit the floor and over my shoulder i saw gretchen crumpled on the carpet weeping uncontrollably air felt thick in my throat as though it was something alien and vaguely threatening shes drunk i told myself and shes deluded bob don collapsed to his knees cradling gretchen in his arms my legs didnt want to respond to the instructions my brain sent but finally they moved and they didnt head to the back door i stared down at bob don what did she mean by that gretchen you better explain i started but gretchen wrestled free from bob don she staggered to the other end of the living room into a hallway that presumably led to bedrooms she turned back to us her eyes trying to focus leave here bob don and take him with you i changed my mind i aint leaving my house take your things and your bastard boy with you i dont ever want to see you again she fled down the hallway running along the side i could hear her body scraping the wall a door slammed down the hall bob don stared at the floor anger burst out of me unexpected and reckless goddamn it look at me what the holy hell is going on here whats wrong with her why is she saying this shit he looked at me looking older and more tired than id ever seen anyone look forgive me jordy god god please forgive me forgive you its your wife thats damned crazy my voice cracked in fear what the hell do i have to forgive you for he didnt answer and the silence fell hard i stepped away from him but not to leave you better tell me whats going on here bob don i want an explanation my voice was hoarse and shaking i he started and his voice broke in pain slowly he rose to his feet and faced me i am your father youre lying i said when i found my voice it didnt sound like my voice but a boys my throat felt like ice why are you doing this why his eyes met mine and he blinked them clear of his tears there was a thin line of blood down his cheek where his wife had raked him no i am not lying to you im your father im sorry but its true youre as drunk as your wife obviously the ice in my throat moved to my voice my father is lloyd poteet and i dont appreciate the slur against my dead daddy or my mother i was starting to regard you as a decent person but youre not i suggest you and your wife both get professional help if you like ill help you by pouring out all the liquor in your house and i suggest you bandage up your face cause youre bleeding all over yourself good night i turned to leave you cant walk away from me you just asked for an explanation and goddamn it youre going to listen to one he grabbed my arm and shoved me down onto the couch it stunk of whiskey im not staying i began but he pushed me back down and leaned hard on my arms i twisted my face away from his do me the courtesy of listening to me jordan michael poteet he hissed and i sat there thinking i am not going to sit here and listen to a bunch of goddamn lies i tried to move away but my muscles felt like jelly i stared into his face listen to me please bob don didnt ease the pressure of his hands on my arms but his tone softened this isnt pleasant but its true and goddamn it youre going to hear it from me well get your lies over with i retorted i have places to go and people to see i was friends with your mama and your daddy they were my closest friends they were damned good to me but then they had a babyyour sisterand sometimes couples go through a rough time when a child comes along and theyre not quite ready for it i tried to be there for both of them but i ended mostly on your mamas side in the disagreements i cared about your mama and she cared about me and we werent strong when we were together youre sick my mother never even looked at you she loved my father god yes she did she told me shed have to go back to him that shed have to make it work with him so she did go back to him but not without you i gave her you he looked hard into my eyes unwavering shut up dont you talk about my mama like that you piece of trash he didnt even blink lloyd took her back and she took him back he loved you like you were his own and i dont know that he knew he mustve though but he loved you anyway anne made me promise id stay away from them and away from you so i met gretchen right off and married her to try and heal the pain he eased up his weight from me and the couch letting me move his story told and it didnt heal god it never healed i had to sit back and watch you grow up and never tell you all the things i wanted to say i stood stumbling against the coffee table rubbing my wrists where hed squeezed hard i made my lips stop trembling why are you making this up what did my folks ever do to you that you would say such horrible things about them your folks he rasped were decent caring people with just as many flaws and shortcomings as you got youd do well to remember that and not keep them on such a high pedestal i suppose you think this is some joke you can play i said slowly do you just prey on women bob don youve turned your wife into a drunk and now youre attacking a woman whos got alzheimers and cant even answer your slander some damned gentleman you are first of all bob don glared his anger showing it breaks my heart that your mamas sick and second it is not a damned joke i didnt view it that way and neither did beta harcher i didnt want to register that last part i had to what did you say beta harcher yes beta harcher she knew she knew i was your father quit saying that no jordy i dont believe i will just because you dont want it to be so doesnt change a blessed thing god ive been saving up stuff to say to you for thirty years so dont you tell me to be quiet beta harcher i shut my eyes and covered my face the list mother of god bob dons quote talked about dividing preya damsel or two to every man gretchen and my mother oh my god i thought and the quote beside my mothers name from genesis in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children oh god i was a child of sorrow of sin if this is true i whispered waving a finger at him then how would beta harcher know about this how would she have any proof wheres your proof when your mother went back to your father i left mirabeau for a while i went to houston cause it hurt too much to be so near her so your mother didnt ask me to stay away from you in person she wrote me letters i kept them not to hurt her with later or to try to claim you but because they mattered to me to me bob don pounded his thick chest with his fist they were my private possessions mine i thought of another letter id seen today belonging to eula mae and i felt suddenly cold i kept the letters from your mama in a lockbox stored in the attic gretchen found them a few years back but i didnt know she drinks because she knows that someone else mattered more to me than she does shes known that for years she heard me arguing on the phone with beta beta was trying to get me to restart the censorship fight since id replaced her on the board i told her she wasnt going to do anything to hurt you gretchen got mad and she gave the letters to beta gretchen only knows how to torture herself she aint good at torturing other folks i guess she figured that beta could cause me more grief in town than anyone else he shook his head it was like putting venom in the snake beta made my life a living hell i dont believe this i said to him and to myself i needed to keep saying it to myself beta wanted money from me not to show them to you i told her to get the hell out of my office i dont pay money to goddamned blackmailers i steadied myself this this is what you argued about with her saturday he nodded not wondering how i knew about that she said if i didnt pay shed hurt you and your mama she said yall would really pay if i didnt but i told her i wasnt gonna pay no damn extortionist but you did i said faintly you paid her bob don shook his head no i didnt i didnt want that bitch having money from me i saw her the day she died and told her there was no point in keeping the secret no point listen to me jordy listen good this is the truth just think about it lloydyour daddy that raised youis dead he was a fine man but hes gone your mamas sick she needs us both she cant object to us having a relationship my marriage with gretchen has run its course and youve come home to mirabeau theres no reason you and i cant have a relationship as father and son now like ive prayed for like ive always wanted what i whispered you cant be serious you lay this on me with no proof and want me to hug you and call you dad i dont think so bob don i was shaking and something was on my face the back of my hand told me they were tears i mean what do you even know about me what do i know about you i know a lot about you bob don answered his voice softening like he was speaking to a frightened child your little league number was seventeen and you liked to play shortstop you hit your first home run on june a little late but it still counts you hated math from first grade on and you never liked to study it your first girlfriend was a little redhead in the third grade and her name was leslie minter the other boys teased you for being sweet on her but you paid them no heed you got on your sats your gpa at rice was and it wouldve been higher except you didnt do good in economicsyou hated it and didnt want to study it just like math just like your mama you only wanted to work at what you like he paused and took a step toward me but i dont know if youre a happy person jordy i dont know if youve ever really been in love i dont know what you want from your life just shut up i said just be quiet a minute please i felt sick and dizzy and angry and betrayed how did he know all that was he watching me my whole life some distant shadow that followed me wherever i went a lie my whole life was a fat ugly lie okay you need time this is a shock i understand that jordy he wiped the drying blood from his cheek where his wife had scored him and proof i dont have that beta does or did she had the letters oh god i swayed shannon lying shot amidst the wreckage of betas living room you didnt tell me you didnt didnt what someone tore apart betas house today they shot her niece in the face she may not live i stared at this man whod destroyed my world did you do that did you kill beta to keep her from talking and then shoot shannon when you were looking for those letters just what would you have done to get your proof back bob don i didnt i didnt hurt anybody jordy he exclaimed i didnt i hope you didnt i said im not worth killing over im not im not it was too much too much said in this room in the past few minutes and too much unsaid the thirty years before i ran from the room i ran from the house hardly hearing bob don goertz calling after me emotional autopilot steered me away from home i couldnt even look at mama i couldnt ask her if bob don was telling the truth and i couldnt stand the thought of seeing her without asking how do you ask gosh mama this fellow claims im his son any truth to that asking mama anything was as futile as getting a running start to jump across the colorado instinct brought me to the library where a light still shone inside the door was locked and the closed sign was up but i managed to jab my key in the lock and practically fall into the building i got up locked the door behind me and staggered to the checkout counter candace was still there gluing datedue slips into new books she paled when she saw my face i tottered taking deep hard breaths trying to get my emotions under control i failed i cried in front of her i cried like a baby and she came to me wrapping me in her arms letting my face dampen her shoulder when that was over i turned away from her suddenly and deeply ashamed id never wept in front of a woman the last time id cried was when sister broke the news to me over the phone that the doctors were pretty sure mama had alzheimers id been alone with my grief as most men prefer to be i guess i could have driven down to the river that night or into the woods but i needed company i needed candace i brokenly told her what had happened at bob dons she steered me to the couch by the coffee table where we kept the daily newspapers you dont have any proof this is true jordy she said softly then why would he make up such a lie whats his reason for telling me this okay she said softly maybe he did love your mother but maybe youre not his and he always wished that you were do i even look like bob don candace no she admitted your looks are your mothers but your daddy wasnt a big man and you are she studied my face as though seeing it for the first time listen jordy looking at profiles isnt going to resolve this you need to find those letters he says beta took i know i thought of betas living room maybe the person who shot shannon when they were looking for whatever they were maybe they found the letters and took them or maybe theyre still in her house candace added hidden there somewhere or maybe someone else has them now and has destroyed them to keep betas mischief from hurting anyone else i have to find those letters i muttered to myself god its even more important now to find who killed beta i shook my head beta goddamn her she was going to blackmail bob don and maybe even my mother that mustve been why she checked out that book on alzheimers maybe she wanted to figure out how advanced mamas condition was and what she could get out of mama to keep quiet to fund that damned church of hers listen jordy i know youre horribly upset right now but you need to think straight you need those letters but they could also be evidence in a murder trial you need to call junebug call your uncle bid no way i interrupted i dont want anyone to know about this who doesnt have to for gods sake you think i want it going around mirabeau that mama mightve had an affair that im bob dons bastard and tell uncle bid no thanks he already hates my guts maybe you know why now candace said softly i thought about it the years of dislike bid had shown me the utter disinterest in his sisterinlaw the warning hed given me in mamas kitchen to stay away from that lying bob don maybe uncle bid already knew about this the only bright spot was that if bob don was telling the truth i was no blood kin to bidwell j poteet there was a silver lining after all i put my face in my hands you know i always prided myself on being strong on not letting the rough stuff in life get me down right now i feel as weak as a hundredyearold man you are strong jordy you are candace rubbed my shoulder youre the strongest man i know you gave up your career your independence to come home to help your family i couldnt be so brave my family i snorted im not even sure who my family is hot anger flashed in me as i thought of my sacrifices damn her candace i gave up my life my career to take care of that woman and what if she never bothered to tell me the truth about who i am how could they do that to me i thought of my father lloyd poteet of his love his kindness to me his pride in my accomplishments his gentle hands on my shoulders letting me know he was there for me had he known if he had i marveled at the depth of his unconditional love not every man would have so willingly raised anothers child as his own i missed him fiercely jordy please quit beating yourself up over this and if its true beta harcher knew i didnt listen to candace lets face it that witch was my worst enemy that she knew and i didnt god that makes me sick jordy candace snapped shut up for a minute and listen to me quit wallowing in selfpity its just not like you i shut up im going to tell you a bit of wisdom here babe candace brought her face close to mine and her voice fell to a whisper do me the courtesy of not interrupting it really doesnt matter if youre a poteet or a goertz or if youre sired by a man from mars what matters is the kind of person that you are you sweet little idiot youre a good person now lloyd poteet raised you and loved you even if he didnt make you that doesnt mean hes not your daddy for all intents and purposes it just doesnt matter it did matter but i stayed quiet till i sensed she was done speaking i laughed bitterly southerners are always so concerned about the families they come from my friends up north used to tease me about being one of the poteets of mirabeau because i made such a big deal about my family and now i dont even know who i am anymore i sagged against the couch i feel like a nobody you are somebody candace whispered and she kissed me her mouth didnt taste of chocolate like ruth willss but the kiss was far sweeter i lost myself in her i vaguely remembered my arm going around her shoulders her fingers locking in my hair passion and heat rising between us like close campfires her fingertips traced delicious patterns on my face my chest my stomach wanting her burned away the old miasma of death that beta harcher had left on the library and as we made love shuddering together on that old couch the deepest part of myself came through telling me that jordy poteet was still alive i wasnt about to castigate half my family tree for all the lying that they mightve done to me over my lifetime and then lie to candace especially not after making love i dont imagine either of us had thought wed consummate our relationship if we ever had one on the library couch where old man renfro read the houston papers every morning so with candace lying against me her warm back against my chest i told her about ruths advances to me and her request that i meet her later this evening are you going candace asked looking at the floor as though there was an object of monumental interest on the carpet no i dont believe so i said stroking candaces hair im not going to pretend that ruth isnt sexy but shes not real attractive to me you know the difference i wonder what she meant though saying she could help you be sure that your mama was never in a home i rolled my eyes probably just a coy lure to get me over there i am of course above such common ploys maybe she was going to offer you money for your services candace giggled now that ruth was swept under the rug she certainly seems to do well for a nurse in a small town doesnt she though nice jewelry new miata kept woman candace guessed shed fit the bill kept by whom i said kissing her ear maybe thats an angle we havent considered candace considered theres any number of candidates in town but thatd be a damned hard secret to keep im starting to think that adage about no secrets in a small town is a load of crap i answered we seem to be unearthing them left and right adam hufnagel candace said thatd be my guess hes smooth but sometimes i swear hes got his mind elsewhere like maybe on a sweet young thang for a mistress your ability to see scandal everywhere i laughed hugging her is one of your most attractive traits i hadnt expected to smile or laugh anytime soon considering the past two hours candace was good for me youre smiling she said glancing up at me you put it there it was she who smiled this time look about bob don honey if i dwell on that im going to go crazy i have to deal with it no doubt but i want to finish what i started i want to find out who killed beta and shot shannon i want the suffering that crazy bitch caused people to stop and i want to find those letters i paused anyhow if ruth is a kept woman how could she say shed help me that would only work if the money was hers i dont think her lover would take too kindly to underwriting her affairs i dont think you should pursue this anymore jordy candace said carefully turning in my arms to face me she snuggled to me kissing my cheek with small nibbles it felt so good i held my breath youve gone through enough in the past few days just tell junebug what youve learned and let him do it no i said im not going to have mamas possible indiscretions broadcast around town as part of a murder investigation i already know that beta blackmailed eula mae and tried to blackmail bob don and mightve tried to get money out of my mother if she thought she could that list of betas must be a blackmail list some way she thought she was going to get money out of folks for their sins so she could build her damned holyroller church i still dont believe that eula mae couldve killed her i cant let her rot in jail so what was she trying to blackmail folks over aside from those rather vague quotes you dont have a clue no theres more i reminded candace about the books beta had checked out and shannon had returned to me she got that book on video technology and on a trip shes on with hally schneider his camcorder disappears she had a book on book publishing and shed squeezed ten grand out of eula mae shed gotten a book on alzheimers maybe to bone up on whether my mother could remember enough of her past to be blackmailed theres that book on drugs candace said yes there is isnt there and i didnt mention this before but matt blalock had been smoking a joint when i went out to see him im wondering if theres a connection between that drugabuse book and matt being on her list big whoop candace huffed everybody knows those guys in vietnam tried it i dont think that would terribly surprise anyone that matt might smoke marijuana she eyed me you dont do that do you not anymore i said i tried it in college once but id rather smoke tobacco i wonder maybe hallys the one doing the drugs you hear about how bad it is in the high schools maybe but hally really doesnt seem to be into that i dont think he could sneak it too easily around his stepford battleax mother gaston said betas car was out late at night by the blalocks last week candace said i stood wait a minute lets say she was out there sneaking around cause she suspected drugtype activities were going on at matts what would you wear i dont know what dea agents currently find fashionable candace sniffed maybe black ill bet that old toot was out sneaking on their farm at night dressed in black so she couldnt be seen and out back on matts farm the overgrowth is as dense as the day mirabeau was founded perfect to hide a marijuana crop it might stay muddy back there even if we hadnt had rain for a few days remember that tarryblack mud on betas shoes candace licked her lips i think you might have a point call junebug and tell him about it he couldnt do anything we dont have a shred of proof i pulled on my pants and fumbled in my pockets for my keys i think i should go out there and take a look if matt blalocks growing pot in the forest theres no need for you to go stomping around out there candace insisted if bob dons telling the truth he didnt give beta a cent now theres in betas account that she got recently if i can find who else paid off beta i can kill me several birds with one stone i can maybe get suspicion off eula mae find out if bob don is remotely telling the truth and maybe see who might have torn apart betas house and shot shannon i jingled my keys now im going out there and see if ol matt had anything worth being blackmailed over fine im coming with you candace stood no youre not it might be dangerous i am too coming with you no youre not candace and i were obviously on the accelerated course for relationships wed made love and had our first fight in pert near record time and guess who won candace insisted that we eat before going out to the blalock property it was close to nine and i desultorily ate a cheeseburger and fries at the dairy queen candace picked at a basket of chicken fingers texas toast and peppered cream gravy we sat on the same side of the booth sure to fuel gossip and when i pushed my food away candace took my hand i expected you to have more of an appetite jordy she smiled sorry i just hey mr poteet how you one of the highschool boys who id helped in the library once in researching a paper passed by cleaning off the next table fine mike how are you fair to middlin he finished bussing the table and moved on mr poteet i said notice i didnt correct that young man ill just have to get those letters and get bob don to give me a little blood for a test gretchen had already bloodied him so maybe i should have just asked him for some then dont sound bitter were going to find out the truth i slapped my head god i havent called sister i havent told them where i am candace fished a quarter from her purse take my advice youre in no shape to chat with them right now let me i did she came back from the pay phone with a faint smile your nephew is holding down the fort i made up a story that we had to stay late at the library to catch up on work from being closed thanks i squeezed her hands and she squeezed back i looked down at the ruins of my hamburger i dont have much stomach for this lets go we made a quick stop at candaces for her to change into a dark sweatshirt jeans and sneakers i was already in a chambray shirt jeans and boots so i figured i was camouflaged enough she came back to the truck quickly with a heavy dark flashlight in her hand i hadnt even thought that far ahead i was glad she was being the brains mine felt too fried she modeled her black sneakers for me they were expensive looking and im sure would make candace look like a badass on the aerobics floor arent they cute she said i got em for the ladies soccer league over in bavary charming i murmured just what every aspiring nancy drew needs she huffed and handed me an old dark windbreaker and an astros baseball cap dark navy with an orange a stitched in the middle cover up that blond hair of yours smarty i bowed and pulled the cap low on my head the drive out to the farmtomarket road that eventually curved away from mirabeau and into the east side of bavary was brief and uneventful the night hung above us heavy with clouds the moon peeked through occasionally like a flirtatious girl i could hardly see any stars and i wanted to my daddy had always told me wishes on stars were the best kind to make i parked the blazer far off the road on the side opposite the blalock property we shut the door softly both of us suddenly aware of how far sound travelled in the hush of night crickets chirped busily as though gossiping about our errand the air felt cool the heat of spring had temporarily fled i shivered in the navy windbreaker walked around to the passenger side of the blazer and hugged candace close well have to be very quiet i told her no talking let me have the flashlight and stick close to me she nodded and took my hand her palm felt good against mine we dashed across a weedeaten field across the farmtomarket road and then began our careers as trespassers we crept into the deepening gloom of the overgrowth i kept the spot of light moving low on the ground shadows blurred together as trees grew closer in this part of texas we have trees called lost pines and there were a lot of them to be found in these woods theyre called lost because you have to get farther east toward arkansas and louisiana to hit real heavy texas pine forests these pines had gotten separated from their eastern brothers and taken root here the idea of wandering trees made me think of the last scene of macbeth unluckiest of plays thin and soaring the lost pines bunched around us forming natures own maze my shoulders kept bumping against their trunks and i could feel an occasional needle fall against me we wandered for at least thirty minutes moving in a widening circle i didnt know the legal boundaries of the blalock property but i was willing to guess that wed crossed them long ago we didnt speak i kept playing the light across the needlestrewn dirt and candace kept her fingers dug into my belt freeing my hands i played the light a little higher and she saw them before i did silently guiding my arm back to where id shined the light fronds of five poking up in fairly even rows there were a lot of rows a lot of money i bit my lip thinking those are pot plants candace whispered in my ear she disengaged her fingers from my belt what should we do now weve got some proof lets get the hell out and call junebug let me think a second i mumbled back i played the light a little higher above the fronds and thats when i saw it a small box fastened to a tree not four feet away from us my arm lashed out and i grabbed candace in an iron grip dont move i said in a normal tone of voice booby trap she froze like lots wife her arm muscles bunched and tensed under my fingers slowly and deliberately i played the light directly around our feet about three inches from candaces left foot there was a wire i kept the light on it and squeezed her arm twice jordy she hissed thats the trigger by your foot ill move first okay im going to step to your right then i want you to follow me exactly exactly candace do you understand i sensed her nod in the darkness you dont step where i havent already stepped you hit a wire and those boxes blow buckshot in your face they blow off your head you understand me yes her voice was frightened but steady okay im moving now i pressed the light down on the ground shuffling my feet slowly to her right i put my back to her and she looped fingers in my belt again keeping the light tightly focused on the dark earth i moved forward away from the wire candace stuck to me like ugly on an ape god only knew how many other wires we might have passed by i didnt think we could have made it unawares passing many no ones luck was that strong if theyd strung wires higher than our feet we would have hit them but from what id heard about such traps i didnt think it likely they were strung that way we shuffled along for several minutes at an agonizingly slow pace every movement made me wonder if hot lead would pepper our bodies the clouds parted and the moon glanced through casting a little more light through the arching pines wed gotten a fair distance away and i felt candace sag against me are we clear of them she breathed im not sure well take it slow for a while longer we scraped our shoes along we hadnt gone too much farther when candace gave a gasp and reaching around me snapped off the flashlight i didnt make a noise and i whirled two other lights fanned through the trees searching less than thirty feet away my heart exercised enough over the course of this unforgettable evening jumped back into my mouth where it felt right at home heres their track a course male voice hissed in darkness his light played along where wed been dragging our feet trenching out a nice little path in the forest for homicidal drug dealers to follow i seized candaces arm and ran tearing through the brush if we didnt move theyd track us easy id rather risk hitting a wire than begging for my life from a pot harvester bullets whined above our heads and candace yelped i didnt think she was hit cause she started running harder than me you just dont know the adrenal surge you get when someones shooting at you i couldnt imagine the high was any less than what you got from the plants these folks guarded another bullet thundered and bark exploded from a trunk a few feet left of my head i yanked candace to the right and barreled into the bushes we ran for several more feet and then hunkered down she pressed her face against my back not wanting to look up i heard footsteps running along past us and i kept as still as stone the moon flirted again hiding behind one of the long thready clouds that streaked the night sky i cursed myself for my stupidity i should have brought a gun i shouldnt have brought candace i shouldnt have come up here myself my own stubbornness might get us killed candaces fingers twined with mine in the silence and the darkness we crouched there in the bushes letting minutes pass i heard footsteps coming back along the forest floor and i risked a peek through the foliage i saw a dark form striding along a shotgun nestled under one arm faint moonlight gave a profile i knew hair pulled back high cheekbones confident body the eyes i couldnt see but i had looked into them enough to know they were intelligent and catlike ruth wills i held my breath as she passed within ten feet of us candace kept her eyes buried in the side of her arm ruth went by and i heard a mans voice unfamiliar and tinged with a spanish accent call to her in the distance i didnt hear her answer i hunkered back down and counted to two hundred i wasnt sure it was enough but i wanted the hell out of there slowly candace and i crept along the forest floor not using the flashlight stopping in the pitch blackness and waiting for the moon to be kind and dimly light our way eventually the forest spat us out on a stretch of the farmtomarket road i got my bearings and figured we were about a mile from the car we hiked back keeping a ways off the road without flashlight one pickup passed and we hid in a ditch waiting for the truck to disgorge jamaicans with uzis the truck whizzed past only tossing out a clint black tune from a cranked radio we made it back to the blazer the tires werent slashed and no one lay in wait for us we got in the car i started the engine with a minimum of noise and keeping the lights out shot down the road god in heaven candace yelled at the top of her lungs apparently i hadnt heard her entire decibel range we could have gotten killed jesus christ jordy okay so now we have proof i said placatingly assuming they dont torch the crop and clear out because they think someones onto them they mightve thought we were just deer deer dont drag their feet for half an acre babe they saw our tracks she fumed okay heres the plan ill drop you at home and you go straight to bed i will go and call junebug and no jordy heres the plan we go straight to the police station right this minute and we tell junebug everything damn it everything i unfortunately for candace still had control of the steering wheel i pulled up a few minutes later in front of her house to the station she barked can i use your phone i asked sweetly since the phone was already closer i won candace stood there while i called the police station junebug was at home but i got his deputy i explained what had happened and he told me to stay put and he and junebug would be over shortly i hung up quickly so i couldnt claim id heard him theyll be over shortly i informed candace fine i look a wreck candace stormed off to the bathroom she shut the door and i bolted easing her front door shut behind me i had decided to keep my appointment with ruth i wanted to see if shed show up i was late and so was she i made sure that i cleaned off any pine needles from my person i was certain she hadnt seen me but i didnt want to give her any clues as to where id been spending my evening i parked in front of ruths modest little home and she wheeled into her driveway a few minutes later she pulled herself out of the miata dirty in jeans and a black windbreaker i saw her glance at her watch then wiggle fingers at me i wondered if those fingers had pulled the trigger that had nearly blasted my head off i steadied my nerves and my anger and put a smile on my face mama always said to smile in adversity and i was grinning from ear to ear im a wreck she purred not too differently from candace sorry im late come on in she unlocked her door and i followed her into her den contemporary danishstyle furniture decorated her home travel posters of faraway places covered the walls prague london beijing calcutta i didnt see peru represented but maybe she didnt want to advertise the competition she stopped and i nearly bumped into her she turned into my arms and kissed me hard i forced myself to respond but even as beautiful as she was id rather have bit into an overripe lemon i could use a shower she murmured against my throat how about joining me business first sweetheart i said cordially pulling her arms from my shoulders i believe you have a proposition for me business before pleasure she laughed i like that in a man i need to get back home ruth and i dont like to beat around the bushes no i preferred running through them to avoid getting shot i swallowed you didnt ask me to come over here for just a roll in the hay did you no whats your financial situation jordy dearest im totally broke really she stared into my eyes im sure everyone thinks im keeping mama at home out of nobility it started that way but now its necessity i dont have the money to put her in a decent place and i doubt i ever will on a librarians salary i leaned down and kissed her roughly she responded and i broke the embrace so whats this proposition you going to show me the pot of gold or you just gonna share a winning lottery ticket her lovely lying face studied mine for a long while i made myself think of how little money i actually had left i hoped i looked a little amoral and desperate considering my position i probably put on a good show i wasnt found wanting on whatever internal scale she used i need you jordy the same way i need matt he was in dire straits too you know his familys farm sure wasnt paying for itself and his computer work wasnt steady enough to help matt i dont understand i lied what does he have to do with this you were there when he was smoking some dope and you didnt blab on him to your buddy the chief of police why matt talks to you obviously i smiled and made myself ruffle her hair i figured what matt does is his own business not mine anyway drugs arent such a big deal i knew plenty of folks who did coke and such up in boston pot was a little too pedestrian for them its not too pedestrian for the simple hearty folks of bonaparte county she laughed its a booming business she watched my face and i inched up one corner of my mouth in a halfsmile im glad to hear business is good the local economy needs a boost and so does my own pocketbook good she said heres the deal i run the operation you take orders from me i hope being something of a good ol boy you dont have a problem with that no maam i drawled matt blalock provides the land and two of the vets from his support group farm it and distribute it actually youre already somewhat involvedtheyve been using their support group meetings for a distribution time for several months now blood rushed to my face and she saw it using my library for this iim surprised i heard myself say she shrugged were careful ive got plots scattered all over bonaparte and bastrop counties we mostly sell into austin but were selling more here too i thought you might help us since so many young folks use the library for school papers and such youd be a good contact for them i made myself smile get a joint with their joyce thats the idea you catch on fast jordy i knew youd be a natural at this i tried not to bristle at the compliment just how secure is this operation arent you worried about getting caught we move the planting sites around we protect them with booby traps so if someone stumbles across your crop and gets killed you dont get the cops coming in i said dryly we can move quickly if we have to ive done this for quite a while jordy she sat on the couch and weve got a friend in a high place i thought and the answer came to me in inspiration let me guess reverend hufnagel it was her turn to be surprised i shrugged as though my deduction was no big deal i saw him and matt talking brother adam claimed matt wanted the church for a vets meeting i just didnt quite buy it i didnt mention my trick phone call to matt where hed said there was no vets meeting for the week well cancer and chemotherapys one of our best business references ruth laughed god she was cruel i wanted to wipe her kiss from my mouth poor reverend hufnagels chemo last year was real hard on his body i was his nurse his pain got so bad i kidded him about trying pot to relieve it and he took me up on it you could have knocked me over with a straw but he was dead serious hes a real weakling about pain i couldnt imagine the agony of chemotherapy and didnt particularly want to try he developed a quick liking for it of course he couldnt let anyone know hed lose his church so now he just hooks up with matt every few nights and smokes a joint before bed i dont think that prissassed little wife of his knows i sat down next to her quietly beta put you on her list of sinners there is death in the pot i thought her quote for you was about when she thought you tried to poison her i see now the operative word there was pot just a coincidence ruth said easily i dont think so ruth she was all in black when she was killed and there was a lot of mud on her shoes im thinking she was out traipsing around in the dark somewhere maybe checking out one of your little secret plantations maybe she got some proof on you and matt i paused maybe you killed her and then shot shannon when you were trying to find that evidence ruth frowned i offer you a business proposition and you accuse me of murder and here i thought you were a gentleman she stood went into the kitchen and poured herself some water i didnt have anything to do with betas death or shannons shooting beta didnt know anything about my sideline when she was in the hospital i just pretended i was going to poison her to scare her i knew no oned believe her and i wasnt going to hurt her i just wanted to put the fear of god in the old girl your professional ethics are charming i smiled she took it as humor not as an insult so are you in youve told me a lot do i even have a choice sure you do if you dont want in just keep your mouth shut i mean you wouldnt want anything to happen to that sweet mama of yours would you or maybe your sister or her boy im in i lied easily enough as long as you had nothing to do with betas murder i want no part of that i didnt kill her matt and reverend hufnagel them i dont know about she put down her water glass and came to me wrapping her windbreakered arms around me how about we seal the contract the right way she kissed me hard and demanding is this how you conduct all your negotiations i asked a moment later yes she smiled even with our friend matt of course he had certain limitations but i do admire initiative and enthusiasm i can tell i pulled away from her well seal our deal laterwhen weve agreed on my percentage shall i call you tomorrow i dont like being turned down twice jordy she snapped an unpleasant gleam showed in her eyes not turned downjust delayed i have to get back home or theyll think somethings wrong you dont want me attracting undue attention do you sense made her relent all right im working the day shift but ill be off at three i told her id call her then i stumbled out into the night to my car i felt dirtier than after id run through the brambles i took a long hard drink of air and started the engine i was about halfway down the long street she lived on when a mirabeau police car shot past me i saw it slow in front of her house i had the strongest feeling that junebugd paid a visit to matt blalock and hed turned in his boss i wondered if ruth would look as good in bonaparte county jail orange as she did in hospital white beta harchers house stood dark and foreboding in the faint moonlight i tried not to think of it as the scene of bitter blackmail attempted murder or even as the lair of the woman who should have been voted most likely to cause suffering i just tried to think of it as a house i needed to break into id thought that if junebug had indeed descended on matt blalocks farm and not to do so immediately wouldnt be politically advantageousmost citizenry didnt view drug crimes favorably hed gone in with force quite possibly there was no longer a guard at betas home there wasnt i parked several houses down and checked the flashlight candace had left in my car i tried to walk nonchalantly down the street at this late hour but no one really ambles in mirabeau past eleven at night if theyre not staggering home drunk i gave it up and jogged over to the back of betas house like i said before most yards in town dont have fences and betas backyard tumbled down to the shores of the colorado i snuck around to the back keeping an eye on the neighboring homes they stayed dark in slumber the back door was still locked and so were all the windows i tried the window that shannons attacker broke in through was efficiently boarded shut i weighed the choices in my mind i needed those letters mama had written bob don after an evening of having a near stranger claim paternity of me getting shot at and being offered gainful employment by our local drug czarina a little breaking and entering seemed mild if i got in trouble i got in trouble and id explain it to junebug later i wrapped my dark windbreaker around my hand popping out a pane of glass in betas back door sounded deafening but there was no neighborhood call to arms maybe the constant murmur of the river inured the folks to sound i slipped inside i kept the flashlight off and eased to the front windows the drapes had been closed good i didnt want anyone to see my light i made a quick pass upstairs just in case there was a room labeled heres what youre looking for no such luck there was a small bedroom a dusty guest bedroom that smelled stalely of disuse and another smaller bedroom with shannons luggage still sitting in it the poor girl hadnt even had a chance to unpack i went back downstairs to the den the police hadnt tidied up after shannons attacker books and broken bricabrac covered the floor my light played along the carpet and found a stain of gore shannons blood i reminded myself i was dealing with someone who had few compunctions about killing i played the light along the room and it caught the bible that junebug had pulled patty quiffs yellowing letter from i remembered hed opened the bible to the letter then set the good book on the side table i examined the bible it was open at the book of job who could have only suffered more if hed lived in mirabeau and gotten on betas bad side eula maes quote about your enemy writing a book came from job i straightened up and cast the beam across the other shelves and the floor lots and lots of bibles some still on the uppermost shelf i dragged a chair over to the big builtin bookshelf and climbed on it i opened one and let the pages flip past my thumb until i got to a piece of paper that wasnt covered with holy scripture the book of isaiah where my quote had come from i turned the light on the page a picture of me stared back at me it was a photo thatd been on the front page of the local newspaper the mirabeau mirror when id gotten the librarian job thatd been the biggest civic news in town that week in the picture i looked a little startled as though getting the library job was an honor i hadnt expected across the picture of my face written in heavy red ink were the words fire purifies my throat felt thick and i swallowed i wondered for one moment if the library had been her only intended target for arson maybe shed have burned my house down with me and my family inside and hummed a little hymn for our sinning souls i dropped the bible and the newspaper clipping on the floor the next two bibles apparently werent being used in betas odd filing system the third one i checked fell open at the beginning in the book of genesis mamas quote about bearing children in sorrow came from there i let the bible fall noisily to the floor and pulled three letters yellowed and crackling with age out of a small manila envelope mama had loved the man she wrote them to and shed written them to bob don goertz i tried to remember to breathe as i read through them mama had always been sentimental to a point but id never heard her speak to daddy with such tender emotion for her privacy i wont record them here but the last one was the hardest to read because she asked bob don to stay out of her life and her unborn babys she begged him if she loved her and their child to follow her wishes she could not hurt lloydshe loved him tooand there was little arlene to consider i read the last one through three times i switched off the flashlight and leaned against the dusty bookshelf oh mama i finally said why didnt you ever tell me i should have heard this from you i put the letters in my jacket pocket feeling cold anger that beta harcher had touched them read them kept them here to hurt me and my mother i tried to think about bob don but he just appeared in my mind as sort of a shapeless blob that i couldnt picture as my father i was putting back the bible that contained mamas letters when some paper slipped out the back a photo and another letter i stared at that photo a long while feeling cold in my veins a much younger uncle bid and beta harcher smiled at me from the picture looking merry under a ferris wheel the letter was to beta from a woman whose name i didnt recognize and mentioned uncle bids name the postmark was from norway i put the letter and the photo with mamas letters some bibles remained and i flipped through the rest of them they were empty except for one notable exception i guess beta felt she had holy words to spare because shed scooped out most of them from this particular volume the pages had been cut away so you could hide something in the closed bible the something there was a videotape according to gaston hally schneider had a camcorder stolen on a trip beta chaperoned shed checked out a book on how to operate a camcorder if my guess was right the proof beta had gotten on matt and ruths drug operation was on this tape i tapped the tape against my forehead thinking and let the scarred bible tumble to the floor i tucked the cassette into my jacket deciding i needed to get to the nearest vcr possible and see this tape i snuck back out of the house into the cool spring night clouds hid the stars now and the breeze was brisk strong with the woody scent of river i eased around the corner of betas house glad that the moonlight seemed to be gone i was about halfway across her yard when a twig snapped and i froze i glanced around didnt see anything didnt hear anything probably a raccoon i told myself i ran on to the car and headed home the den lights blazed when i opened the front door even though it was near midnight mark and mama sat watching a talk show i found it real hard to look at mama but i made myself she stared at the tv screen not laughing at the jokes somewhere in that muddled mass of neurons that was her brain there were memories of bob don and the truth shed never bothered to tell me i felt incredibly angry with her but i knew chewing her out would do only me good not the time or the place i swallowed the fury i felt and let it start to burn an ulcer in my gut mark bolted up from the couch now he didnt look like a wisecracking thirteenyearold but more like a worried little boy have you heard anything about shannon my news on her was hours old i hoped it was still current i told him what ruth had told me when id seen her at the hospital his face pinched with concern mark why isnt mama in bed i asked pulling the videotape out of my jacket alzheimers patients can be notoriously active at night much to the annoyance of caregivers wed tried to control mamas nocturnal activities as much as possible but mark was a lax mamasitter she wanted to watch tv mark shrugged ill bet i looked at the television the vcr had taken flight where the hell is the vcr oh its hooked up in your room sorry i forgot ill go get it never mind you and mama watch tv down here i ran up the stairs junebug called he wants you to call him as soon as you get home mark yelled after me i made a noise of acknowledgment shut my door and slid the tape into the vcr id half expected the tape to show an unsteady walk through the blalock property like a press escort of a drug raid with narration and here we have some actual cannabis grown by the alleged perpetrators this wasnt it the scene that unfolded was a nature hike of sorts but more along the paths of biology than botany it started slow an empty bedroom spartan and unadorned like you might find in a cabin i pressed the fast forward button with great haste tamma hufnagel and hally schneider walked into view it looked like the camcorder was somewhere above them possibly on a tall bureau or bookshelf i let go of the fastforward tamma and hally hugged kissed and disrobed with still a fair amount of speed even without help from the vcr oh shit i said half laughing with shock they were not much into foreplay it wasnt long before they were sweatily making love it appeared that they were not strangers they handled each other with graceful familiarity tamma cooed his name a lot hally didnt say much her mousiness had faded she barked out sexual orders to him with the ease of command i heard the doorbell ring and thought junebug is going to find this fascinating i pushed the fastforward button to see if there was anything else on the tape i hadnt gotten too much further when there was a crash and a scream from downstairs i flung the door open and ran down the stairs nearly tumbling down them in my haste my eyes took the scene in one glance mark lying on the floor not moving with blood welling from the side of his head mama cowering on the couch crying and tamma hufnagel standing in the middle of the room steadily holding a gun aimed at my mother that gun swung around and the black eye of its barrel stared into my face hands on your head jordy tamma said with that same wavery voice of innocence shed used with me when i talked to her at the church announcement board i obeyed whats this all about tamma i said i was halfway down the stairs and wondered if she wanted me to come the rest of the way down i decided to wait for an invitation i kept looking at mark and his bloodied head i saw his back heave the shallow motion of breath thank god you have something i want jordy tamma insisted mousy brown eyes glared into mine she didnt exactly look a threatening figure in a dark sweatshirt with painted bluebonnets on it jeans sneakers and a long denim jacket i dont know what you mean i answered but that gun isnt going to solve any problems put it down and lets talk no thank you just give me the videotape that you took from betas house i told you i dont know what youre talking about look you dont have a lot of time for this she said which i thought didnt bode well for me you beat me into betas house tonight i peeked in the windows and saw you searching after you left i went into her house and found that carvedup bible its not hard to figure out what she hid there id like it please i opened my mouth and she saw the protest coming dont make me shoot your mother in front of you jordy the gun stayed on me but tammas eyes flicked to mama i didnt see much christian mercy in them okay okay i yelled ill give you the tape its upstairs ill get it i turned and took one step up before she shouted at me no you do what i say you step on a crack jordy and ill break your mothers back thats how this works you understand me yes she went over and pulled mama to her feet mama went unprotestingly tamma took mamas arm and pressed the gun to mamas head the barrel made a neat circle in her temple you see where this is jordy tamma demanded we understand each other we understand each other perfectly i answered calmly and i thought but just wait till i get that gun away from you you bitch i stayed put and she and mama came up the stairs behind me the gun still pressed into mamas head okay jordy march you dont turn a corner till i say so you make any sudden moves and shes dead yes i understand can i start up the stairs now yes it was like a game of simon says i thought talk jordy what do you know tamma demanded i dont know anything i answered starting to walk slowly up the stairs i could hear mama whimpering a little bit as tamma hauled her up after me im going to guess that adam wasnt at home the night beta died maybe he was over at his buddy matts toking up some gange im sure the ladies church auxiliary just wouldnt understand that you were with beta you went with her to the library she never had to steal a key you were there because she was blackmailing you now since you dont have much money im going to guess that you were going to help her to burn down the library as your payment shed made a tape of you and hally making love on that youthgroup trip shed taken hallys camcorder and caught yall redhanded not quite it jordy hally made the tape for fun beta found the tape during the trip so she stole it and the camcorder id reached the top of the stairs and didnt move till they were on the second floor with me i walked slowly down the hall toward my room with a killer and my mother in tow look tamma i said this just isnt necessary if she was blackmailing you maybe you could get off with a lesser charge she didnt appreciate negotiation mama squealed and i guess tamma jabbed her hard with the gun i shut my mouth we were at my room tamma and mama stopped in the doorway the tape was still playing on the vcr hally was lying back on the bed and tamma lay between his legs tamma saw the screen and her face turned a sullen angry red her eyes smouldered looking at mine you son of a bitch you watched it her voice was killing cold i thought it was of someone else i thought beta had taped never mind she screamed turn the tv off and give me that tape i obeyed sliding the tape out of the machine and gingerly handing it to her shed gotten upset and shed taken the gun away from mamas head i tensed she took the tape and stepped back watching her i said well betas quotes about yall were right she said hally and other fools make a mock of sin and she said your sin will find you out ol beta was pretty perceptive shut up infatuated boys do incredibly stupid things shed had to let go of mamas arm to take the tape tamma stuck the tape in a jacket pocket the gun swung back to mamas temple i see youve involved my cousin in all kinds of depravity i murmured watching the gun at mamas head mamas eyes watered in her confusion and a big tear ran down her cheek hally had nothing to do with all this really then whyd he go through with a lastminute convenience date with chelsea hart so he could have an alibi thats why did he hold beta while you hit her with the bat tamma snarled at me forget about baiting me you moron he didnt have anything to do with betas murder i just told him he couldnt be with me and to be sure he was with someone that night he didnt know what i was planning but he could guess i said quietly thats why hes so nervous why he tried to put blame on eula mae he knows you did it i jerked my head at the silent tv you think hes still going to be infatuated with you knowing that youre a killer he doesnt know that she responded then screamed stay still at mama who had dared to move slightly mama closed her eyes my hands curled into fists dont even think of trying something jordy tamma snapped get downstairs now she jerked the gun away from mama and pointed it at my heart are you going to kill us all tamma i asked quietly thats three more deaths on your conscience then what kill shannon so she doesnt wake up someday and identify you is that tape worth five lives that tape was worth one life betas avoiding prison for her murder is worth as many lives as i decide downstairs her calm was eerie she put the gun back on mamas head and stepped away from the door just like before jordy you go down the stairs first and your mother and i follow we walked slowly down the stairs and i started counting the number of steps i had left in my life there seemed to be one for each heartbeat im sorry mama i managed to croak out mama didnt answer me id reached the living room mark stirred very slowly look i turned to tamma as she pushed mama toward me catching mama i set her on the couch let them go mama cant possibly testify against you or identify you she just isnt aware of whats going on and mark hes just a little boy i cant believe you want to kill a little boy her eyes said no she didnt want to kill a little boy but what she wanted wasnt relevant im really sorry jordy but this is all your fault if you hadnt interfered if youd left things alone mark and your mama wouldnt be in this mess im sorry but she didnt get a chance to finish either her sentence or us a pounding swelled on the front door accompanied by a nonstop ringing doorbell jordy anne bob dons voice bellowed goddamn it open up tammas head jerked toward the door bob don sounded like a oneman swat team they know youre here tamma i said trying to sound mild you better surrender i bit my lip jordy jordy goddamn it open up bob don bellowed the door vibrated in its frame hes not going to go away trust me i said give it up tamma she licked her lips tongue darting like a rattler on the floor both of you she pushed mama down from the couch you too jordy or i shoot her jordy jordy anne darlin bob dons words slurred together i watched the gun pointed down at my mothers head i got on the floor pressing my palms to the carpet mama took that moment to let everyone know she was damned tired of having a gun pointed at her rude visitors pounding on her door and lying on the floor she screamed and she screamed loud tamma shrieked shut up and i jumped on top of mama pressing my body over hers i was sure tamma would shoot her the scream pierced my ears for about three seconds when the front door caved in bob don swayed in the doorway and staggered in taking in the scene goddamn he exclaimed what the hell get back bob don tamma demanded from my position on the floor with mama still yelling underneath me i couldnt see bob dons face i looked up and saw tamma still had the gun leveled at us what the hell you doin little girl give me that i heard bob don roar and tamma whirled the gun up in the direction of his voice and she fired bob don cried out and i heard a heavy fall i kicked out tammas legs and she hollered and fell on her back near my feet the gun was still in her hand and she struggled to get it pointed in my direction her chest was the closest part of her to my feet and i kicked out hard catching her in the right breast and the arm she screamed and let go of the gun it landed a few feet away i scrambled across the floor for it and she did too i nearly closed my fingers around it but she fell on me biting and kicking i squirmed and booted the gun out of her reach as we fought it slid across the room and under mamas easy chair i tried to get a grip on her shoulders but as i did she kneed me in the groin yelping i let go she broke free from me and scrabbled like a crab toward the chair panting i chased her stumbling to my feet in pain trying to run without using my molten legs seeing me coming after her she grabbed one of mamas heavy antique candlesticks and swung it at my head i was a harder target than beta harcher i ducked but felt the whoosh of air as the heavy brass passed near my hair the second swing around i grabbed the candlestick and wrestled it out of her hands tossing it aside i completely forgot all the gentlemanly manners that mama and daddy ever taught me and i punched tamma hufnagel in the jaw hard i got a grip on her shoulder and she was still conscious adrenaline fueling her spitting at me i belted her again and her eyes rolled white i let go of her and she crumpled to the floor i staggered around for a second breathing glad to be alive jordy it was junebug and another officer coming in with service revolvers drawn she did it she killed beta she tried to kill us i managed to gasp standing over tamma and pointing at her would you please arrest her junebug rushed over to tamma keeping the gun aimed at her pulling out handcuffs mama lay sobbing on the floor while mark murmured in a broken voice for his mother i stood oh god oh my god i stumbled past the couch and the coffee table toward the busted door bob don lay behind the couch still a red stain spreading across his shirt oh god i screamed kneeling beside him somebody call an ambulance the next morning candace found me in the waiting room outside of the intensive care unit i had abandoned conversation with a prim elderly lady whose husband was undergoing arterial surgery shed asked who i was there for and i didnt know what to say a near stranger my friend my father i fumbled on my own words so badly im sure she thought i had a speech impediment i finally had mumbled something about a friend getting shot and she turned up her nose to me probably thinking i frequented cheap honkytonks with a dangerous crowd i wasnt drunk with liquor but with exhaustion id stayed up all night pacing the waiting room then talking on the phone with junebug after tammas confession and then wearing out a new track of carpet while i waited for a doctor to tell me whether or not bob don would live or die candace sat by me on the couch handing me a cup of coffee winking and trying gentle teasing to raise my spirits you better look out jordy you know us and couches i may have to take you right here the prim lady gathered up her knitting and fled to a remote corner of the room not wanting to hear about us and acrobatics on furniture candace gave me a timid kiss and i kissed back hell of a night she said rubbing my neck one way of putting it i agreed wearily i feel like i could sleep for a week how are you im fine i was just down seeing mark arlenes with him still she said dr meyers said yall can take him home today good i said im sure he cant wait to tell all his friends how his uncle jordy nearly got him killed candace ignored that jab of selfrecrimination and they released eula mae last night of course she volunteered to stay with anne this morning while were all down here she said she cant wait to talk to you so she can pirate all this for her next novel i guessed candace looked hard into my eyes you can quit with the jokes you dont fool me a bit you going to stay here awhile i cant leave him candace not till i know hes going to be okay i mean i dont think of him as my father but he got shot trying to help me i know babe she said patting my hand you know bob dons pretty special i know you already got a man in your heart that you think of as your daddy but you got a big heart jordy could be room in there for two yknow junebug told me they arrested ruth and matt i offered changing the subject and getting myself in trouble candaces eyes hardened they did they found another videotape in betas house this one with footage of the pot crop she mustve taken that camcorder she stole from hally and taped the field for evidence i guess she planned on hitting them up for money too she coughed you know i did not appreciate you running out on me like that i didnt want to involve you any more doofus could have gotten yourself killed she sniffed and that was the extent of the fight at least for the moment she cleared her throat and continued i talked with arlene she said the police are talking to hally but they dont think he had anything to do with killing beta and i heard billy ray offered adam hufnagel a plea bargain to testify against ruth and matt i imagine hell take it he seems to be in deep shock that tamma did all this he should be she very nearly got away with it how for gods sake and why resort to murder candace asked i leaned back on the couch she was a lot smarter than anyone gave her credit for when beta found out that tamma and hally were loversand how she did who knows but she did and she found that tape of thembeta made tamma start giving her more control over church functions and therefore church money tamma couldnt do a thing out of fear that beta would show the tape so she had to agree to whatever beta suggested so candace pursed her lips the afternoon that bob don saw tamma leaving betas looking so scared and upset beta had given her the penance to get the tape back burning down the library that night and thats when tamma decided to put a stop to the threats she realized that if it looked as though beta planned to burn down the library but was killed before she could light the matches so to speak id be a real big suspect she decided to frame me for betas murder bitch candace said tonelessly she hugged me hard she put out the bat on the path to the library already wiped clean of prints she watched and made sure that id picked up the bat and then took it inside with me perhaps beta had told her already about threatening me with closing the library and tamma made sure she was there to see beta assault me she was the one who told junebug and billy ray that id said in anger that i couldve killed beta you do have a mouth on you candace agreed so tamma met beta at the library and killed her yeah according to tammas confession beta wanted to pray before they torched it like the library was going to be some burnt offering before god tamma said she put on her gloves and hit beta halfway through the lords prayer i shivered then she planted the key on betas body that i dont get candace said she wanted it to look like beta had managed to get her own key somehow if she had a key she didnt need anyone on the library board to let her in the story about beta swiping adams key was pure fluff betas little list though put attention on other people besides you thats right sugar tamma didnt know about that list she did tell junebug though that beta had bragged to her that when her church was built she was going to have pews in it with contributors names plaqued on them along with an appropriate bible verse sick isnt it but how did tamma know youd be at the library around the time of the murder candace asked she didnt that was bad luck on my part tamma told junebug that id scared the hell out of her she had just killed beta not a minute before i walked in after i left tamma went home and got there before adam got back from having his therapeutic joint with matt blalock when the police started asking for alibis adam made up the story that theyd both been home watching an old john wayne movie he never dreamed his wife needed an alibi worse than he did he was only worried about someone finding out about his smoking dope tamma mustve been searching for that videotape when shannon surprised her candace said tamma claims they fought for the gun and it went off by accident of course it went off in a closed room and nearly deafened tamma when i called the hufnagels to tell them about shannon being shot i thought tamma sounded funny like she had a cold and i had to repeat myself for her to hear me it was from the shock of the gunshot hows shannon doing candace asked shed gotten out of surgery an hour or so before bob don was rushed in theyre very hopeful god that poor girl candace snuggled next to me it felt great lord all this suffering that beta and tamma caused i grunted in agreement and hugged her close candace murmured one of junebugs deputies went by the goertzes to see about getting gretchen to come to the hospital they found her passed out in bed she wont be coming down today at least im not sure gretchen would come anyway candace i think she hates him now maybe its for the best cause i dont think he ever loved her a runty figure lounged in the doorway watching me i let candace go sugar would you excuse me id like to talk to uncle bid in private please candace rose and left murmuring a hello to bid he didnt answer he just kept staring those glassy dark eyes at me he lit up a cigarillo the knitting lady fuming worse than the smoke gathered up her yarn and fled i see you survived the night bid drawled at me from all accounts thats something of a miracle perhaps six flags over texas will design a stunt show after your adventures he snickered i stood and smiled down at him cut the crap with me bid i know what you are and although i didnt think it possible i dislike you more than ever he squinted through smoke with his intimidatetheprosecution eyes whatever do you mean that extra in betas savings account that i thought for a while either ruth wills or bob don had paid off beta with thats your money i dont know what you mean jordy i pulled the photo and letter id found at the back of the bible in betas house last night id kept them in my back pocket as close to my heart as a picture of uncle bid would ever get not really a good likeness of you bidwell you had a lot of hair then i dangled the photo in front of his face watching his shock then admired the snapshot myself it was an old photo black and white in a sleeve with a state fair of texas border around it a younger beta and a younger bid smiling arms around each other beta had a wisp of the famous state fair cotton candy in the corner of her mouth and she looked like a funloving kid youd said you never dated her that she was too wild for you but you lied you got her pregnant and you paid for her to go to mexico for a quiet little abortion then you dumped her she turned to religion for solace like a drunk turns to the bottle thats an ugly lie jordy bid observed mildly puffing on his foul little cigar you thought she didnt have any friends she could dare confide in here so you were safe you were wrong she had a special friend i held up the letter that had been with the photo shed confided in letters to her pen pal kirsten koss of stavenger norway old man renfro told me he remembered beta having a scandinavian pen pal kirsten wrote this very supportive letter to beta calling you by name and telling beta that she could make it past having an abortion that it wouldnt ruin her life i eyed

back into the chair and waited some more finally a nurse came into the waiting room you mr goertzs son hes been asking for you you can see him now i mumbled a vague assent and followed her into intensive care the rooms were more like patios with an open wall that faced out onto the nurses station so they could see the patients at all times wires made him look like a christmas tree without lights there were wires to his heart his guts his arms calm agreed with bob don his eyes were shut and i stood next to the bed for a long time studying his face hey i finally said he opened those big blue eyes and blinked at me hey there jordy how you better than you bob don he grinned and i saw it hurt him theyd taken the bullet out from near his heart last night and mirth didnt make him feel
