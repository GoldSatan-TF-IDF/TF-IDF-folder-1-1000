conn iggulden quantum of tweed chapter one albert rossi would be the first to tell you that breaking into the world of professional assassination is no easy task in almost any job you are allowed to make the odd mistake with red faces all round and perhaps a new office nickname not so with hit men if assassins had a theme tune it would be something solemn and deeply dignified adagio in g minor perhaps soft rock would not be appropriate for such a serious business bonnie tyler would not do at all it might have helped if albert had spent his earlier years in the army becoming a grim and yes somewhat suave dealer in death he did not do this however because albert rossi was a late starter up to the age of fortynine his life had proceeded in an aimless fashion much like the windows of his beloved menswear shop in eastcote middlesex things changed but things also stayed very much the same sadly his debt to the bank rose every year alberts life took a lurch onto a new path when he was driving home one monday afternoon the bank had taken to writing rather unpleasant letters to him and adding to his overdraft for each one he had tried replying he had even tried charging them for his own letters to his horror this seemed only to encourage them lately he had begun to receive statements with a red border and the word bailiff around line three perhaps he was distracted that monday the threat of bailiffs will do that to a man his car a nissan micra was also not appropriate for an assassin but in fairness it was fantastically appropriate for the owner of a mens clothing shop he may have been listening to bonnie tyler but moments of immense stress often blur details to this day he cannot remember why he shudders whenever he hears total eclipse of the heart the first he knew of his career change was when a small man wearing a poorly cut suit and smart black shoes ran out in front of him the brakes of the car were excellent but as albert panicked he locked the wheels and skidded at the moment of impact the little man popped into the air so quickly and completely that at first albert dared to hope it hadnt happened at all to his horror he saw a smartly shoed foot sliding into view at the top of his windscreen the little man had ended up on the roof in the stunned moment that followed albert swallowed nervously with trembling hands he turned off the radio rather than have bonnie tyler belt her way through a chorus that could only be slightly sinister in the circumstances the silence was eerie the sort of silence that is interrupted by a dead man sliding into view can never be the nuns in a reading room kind eerie is very much it for the slight squeak of a sizenine brogue on your windshield it did not help that albert recognised the brand of socks as one he had marked down to per cent of its full price the road was empty though suburban houses seemed to press in on all sides there had been the squeal of brakes and the thump surely the windows would be positively filling with girl guides and miss marples noting his number plate and groping for the phone as albert stepped out he was tempted to just push the little fellow off and make a dash for freedom a man who can sell a jumper with suede strips on the front is made of sterner stuff than that however albert took hold of a wrist and tried not to look at the rest of the man as he felt for his pulse there wasnt one he checked his own wrist for the right spot and couldnt find one there either its a lot harder to do than your average medical drama makes it look focusing on the task albert did not hear the stranger approach he felt something poke at his kidneys was he being mugged honestly whoever it was could not have chosen a worse time dont turn round came a deep voice in his ear just tell me the name of the man you ran over albert wondered if he had struck his own head in the accident had the air bags gone off was it possible not to notice an air bag going off he made a strangled sound as he tried to peer into the nissan micra without moving his head his name the voice went on just that there was a delicate scent of male aftershave in the air albert noted dimly unlike the voice and his entire day up to that point it was actually quite nice i i hit him with my car albert said i didnt have time to ask him you expect me to believe it was an accident you dont know who this is look im truly sorry i was driving along hawthorn avenue and to his amazement the man at his ear chuckled relax mr dangerous driver i didnt really think you were a professional it was so neat thats all i was lining up my shot dont turn round albert froze all over again the fact that he was being poked by an actual gun was too much to take in could he hear sirens in the distance no chance that was another part of real life that the medical dramas had not represented accurately on the television the police were always in the next road ready to fire up the sirens and arrive in seconds with screeching cars that did not seem to be the case in hawthorn avenue eastcote albert thought he would be dead on the side of the road by the time the police eventually turned up he suspected his own expression would be one of total bafflement look the police are on their way he said in the complete absence of proof im sorry if i made you angry angry the man chortled he was very jolly for someone in what albert was beginning to realise was probably not a jolly profession you saved me a job i wouldnt have bothered with an alibi if id known you were going to come along and flatten my target for me albert suspected he was going into shock he wasnt certain what this entailed but he was feeling lightheaded and faintly nauseous which probably fitted the bill he wondered how an assassin would react to having someone throw up on their shoes will you kill me now albert asked not for free old son you havent seen my face and you did do me a favour i could just drive away in fact albert said almost pleading there was silence for a moment if you sneak a single look at me ill take it badly understand your number plate is on the road so i can always find you albert felt the pressure on his kidneys vanish and he opened the car door with shaking hands he couldnt look at the body again presumably it would fall off when he built up a respectable speed the second important event of that day occurred as albert tried to start his car and put it into reverse gear whilst looking determinedly out of the back window perhaps it was fate that led him to accidentally select first gear and run his second man down that morning the micra leapt forward eagerly bumping once then twice albert gave a cry of appalled despair he would have driven off if he hadnt remembered his number plate on the road a black mobile phone was spinning by his front tyre next to it was a pistol complete with silencer albert snatched them all up crunched the car into reverse and then he was off back down hawthorn avenue leaving the dead behind chapter two the police did arrive in the end they had received reports of a hitandrun from a retired teacher named miss morrison and one girl guide who was home sick from school the missing number plate had foxed them all however though albert spent the night waiting for a knock on the door it did not come what did come was a call on the new mobile from stephen hawking or someone who sounded very much like him not as neat as we were expecting said a metallic voice you are not paid extra for bystanders albert could only listen in growing horror as he realised it was not stephen hawking at all the money will be left in the usual place the voice continued at that very moment albert changed careers no he said suddenly leave it in the rubbish bin outside eastcote station at midnight very well the disguised voice said flatly which was not too surprising albert switched off the phone gasping in all his years of herringbone jackets of burlington socks and renting tuxedoes he had never experienced a fraction of the excitement that filled him then he wasnt certain when the bins were emptied so at five minutes past midnight he was there rummaging in the bin and pulling out a package wrapped in creased brown paper when he had brought it back to his flat above the shop and opened it with shaking hands he discovered it held ten thousand pounds after finding a charger for his new phone hed discovered there were other jobs on offer he had learned not to refer to them as slayings after stephen hawkings initial pained silence obviously by now he knew it wasnt the famous physicist calling him but it was somehow comforting to imagine the kindly genius there on the other end if the bank had been even slightly reasonable albert would never have accepted ten thousand pounds had gone some way to keeping the wolves away just not far enough he wondered if every assassin had an overdraft and for a moment felt for them as a group before dismissing the idea no doubt assassins spent their leisure time driving to casinos in aston martins with buxom women probably the lucky swine after retrieving a file from the same bin albert read feverishly about the activities of peter schenk a wealthy and worryingly ruthless businessman schenk owned a number of shady operations from betting shops to a junkyard and a bailiff company just reading that made albert want to run him over it was the section on hobbies that gave albert his inspiration most weekends schenk flew a hangglider over at dunstable near luton albert imagined the man drifting past blissfully unaware as albert aimed fired and kept eastcote in menswear and golf balls for another decade it wasnt as if schenk was a decent old buffer with a fondness for chocolate and cats the file made it clear that schenk was every bit as dangerous as those who rested their hopes in albert rossi on a saturday morning in june albert shut the shop early having selected a long black coat from the rack a per cent cashmere mix one of his best he placed the coat gun and phone on the passenger seat of his micra and set off dunstable is mostly famous for its gliders those longwinged fibreglass birds that drift over the vast natural ridge with grace and speed they are winched along the ground until the breeze slips under the wings and they rise aloft like huge kites on a string of steel wire they are flung into the heavens to swoop and soar amongst the clouds so beautiful are they so able to shrug off the bonds of gravity and the sullen earth below that in those first moments of glorious flight you almost forget that what youd really like is a bloody engine there is also a sheer cliff to the north of the airfield that attracts those fans of hanggliding who thrive on risk and adrenalin young fliers gallop madly to the edge and throw themselves into space the delicate wings are toys of the air for a brief time until they land and have to be walked all the way to the top again it was a beautiful sunny day with the sky a bowl of perfect blue when albert arrived he left his micra in the car park of the gliding club and walked out beyond the buildings in a sense he realised he was leaving civilisation behind he had murder in his heart and the strong sensation that he should have chosen more appropriate shoes albert saw no sign of his intended victim as he reached the base of the cliff and began to make his way up the path he followed wound around the hill sometimes barely more than a track stumbling up it albert had his first glimpse of schenks hangglider on the ridge bright yellow and jerking in the wind as its owner checked every strap before launch albert continued doggedly peering up at schenk each time he came into view far below he could see tractors racing across the grass of the airfield to retrieve the gliders as they came to rest it was a peaceful scene but he reminded himself that he had not come for tranquillity he was the angel of death and he set his jaw in what he hoped was a grim expression imagine if you will the face of a spaniel who has just been given a piece of bread covered in hot colmans mustard there you have it exactly that was alberts expression admittedly it was not what he hoped for but that is often the way with men of a certain age when he was close to the top albert stopped in frustration two bodyguards accompanied his target they wore dark suits and sunglasses which was more than enough to let him know their role in schenks life albert could hardly take aim while they looked on shaking with tension albert saw a small track leading across the face of the final ridge he didnt hesitate and edged his way along it his back pressed to the rough stone mere inches from the abyss the track narrowed until he was convinced a sudden gust would snatch him off he couldnt turn and the tips of his black oxford shoes were actually over the edge with nothing but air below albert was staring upwards as peter schenk launched above his head rising into the blue sky it was time albert tried to draw his gun as schenk began to race his hangglider in great swoops back and forth across the edge of the ridge the silencer snagged in alberts coat and he pulled the entire thing over his head in his panic one last yank revealed the gleaming weapon but sent the coat fluttering down albert steadied himself as schenk came zooming along drunk on danger and adrenalin albert felt rather the same way himself he braced one arm with the other and fired until the silenced gun was empty in response schenk brushed a hand across his face as if batting away a wasp in a rage albert considered throwing the gun at him at that moment schenk looked across and saw albert on the ledge halfway up a cliff as if suspended in midair to his astonishment albert waved weakly at him for an instant schenk wavered in his flight his hand slipped from the control bar and his hangglider drifted too close to the cliff face it was then that the yellow wing snagged and tore itself apart in a heartbeat it went from a swooping bird to a collection of struts and ragged cloth albert watched peter schenk spiral all the way down overcome with something like remorse his debt to the bank would be reduced of course but a man had lost his life to save a menswear shop somehow albert could not regret it there had been something quite poignant in the way schenk waved back at him before falling life albert reflected did have a way of catching you unprepared chapter three the following morning albert stirred from troubled sleep to reach out and pick up the phone by his bed he had bought the oldfashioned item in a fanciful mood then found that a rotary dial was nowhere near as much fun as he remembered calling a mobile number took ages as he pressed the bulky receiver to his ear he realised the ringing was still going on he leapt out of bed like a salmon crossing the room to the still dusty coat he had retrieved from the bottom of the cliff it was the special phone and he tried to calm his breathing as he took the call yes mr hawking he said then clapped a hand over his mouth there was a long silence at the other end before he heard the mechanical voice he knew so well you think this is stephen hawking the voice asked even through the electronic disguise albert could hear the surprise its my nickname for you thats all he said wincing it will do good work yesterday for a man known as bullet you are more imaginative than i was told to expect albert rossi digested this for a moment thinking back to the assassin he had run over in his micra two weeks before i work with whatever is to hand he said trying to sound calm and generally relaxed i have another job are you available albert thought of the money he still owed and the constant drain on his bank account from the general lack of interest in eastcote menswear despite the terror he had experienced on the cliff at dunstable despite the sweat that had dribbled into his eyes he had never felt more alive cufflinks and bow ties were nowhere near as exciting perhaps one day he would even visit a casino and not just to use the mens room this time absolutely he said drop the details off with the money the usual place oh and ill need some bullets i see what kind albert panicked there is something about a pistol that makes grown men want to pick it up hed spent part of the previous evening posing with it in front of a mirror where had he left the thing as the voice asked again he spotted the handle sticking out from under his pillow not the handle the grip he reminded himself or possibly the butt he really had no idea new sweat broke out on his forehead as he read out the tiny lettering on the gun um colt government dot fortyfive it was heavy and square in his hand but he felt more confident just holding it a colt a piece of america in an englishmans hand glorious very well ill put a couple of full clips in the envelope albert was not exactly what you would call a ladies man the great flames of youthful passion had passed him by with the exception of one long summer in his late thirties when he dallied with an attractive widow and had even thought about asking her to marry him the fires of his heart had turned to ash when he discovered she was also running around with the local butcher rather than compete with a man who could woo with sausages albert had sent her a dignified letter and ended it those golden days were still among his favourite memories but as the sum total of a mans experiences with the opposite sex it was somewhat lacking perhaps as a result the group of teenage girls hanging around the entrance to eastcote station at midnight left him slightly flustered as he waited for them to leave he checked his watch at intervals they seemed in no hurry and all he could do was stand near the crucial bin and read a newspaper he may have had an air of innocence despite his deadly new profession it takes time to grow into a hardfaced assassin even for one who had begun so promisingly alberts wideeyed nervousness may have caught the interest of the girls in the way that a mouse will attract a pack of feline predators it is hard to say it may have been the amount of alcohol the girls had consumed or the fact that they had a vague idea of asking a stranger to buy more either way they surrounded him like lions on a wobbly zebra they were loud when they screeched with laughter they were also loud when they whispered albert could only cringe and stammer answers as they fired questions at him when he dropped his newspaper and bent down to pick it up one of them patted him on the bottom and then was almost sick laughing at his horrified expression you a dirty old man then another asked grinning albert tried to reply but to say he was out of his depth is to imply that he had some concept of depth he was not even in the pool hes got a long coat i think he is a dirty old man albert knew about blushes of course the lady he had once adored had read romantic novels by the yard though as he reflected later and with justifiable bitterness not a single one had a butcher as its hero she had even read a few choice passages aloud to him perhaps hoping that they would inspire albert rossi to similar efforts blushes were mentioned every second or third page in those he was not as familiar with the wave of heat and embarrassment that seemed to begin at his shoes and work up to the stiff collar of his shirt he suspected small eskimo children could warm themselves on him at that moment in a sort of daze he imagined they would bless him for saving them from a hard winter and only roll him out on the coldest of days he could almost see the stern eskimo mother wagging a finger at the little ones and telling them not to waste their albert when it was a mere forty degrees below zero the mind is a strange thing and it is worth remembering that albert was under a lot of stress with an effort he shook his head clear of eskimos im just waiting for someone he said the first girl was perhaps sixteen she was dressed in a way that was clearly meant to be appealing there was a lot of flesh spilling out of her top most of it jiggled when she laughed and he could hardly point out the chip that had fallen into her cleavage without revealing that he had noticed her cleavage he decided against that my mum warned me about men like you she said cheerfully all they want is sex albert gaped at her but he found nerve enough to reply id be satisfied with a bit of peace and quiet he said firmly it is after midnight ooh he wants you to satisfy him sal her friend hooted dirty old man a distant rumble under his feet saved him from worse one of the girls yelled traaaain and the whole painted pack scooted into the station albert watched them go with a feeling of relief mingled with regret he had not talked to a female for a long time perhaps if he went to a casino in his new role as assassinforhire he would meet some russian beauty at the roulette table he shook his head unlikely even for a fantasy now that the street was quiet he sidled over to the bin at last under the halfeaten kebabs and free newspapers was a thick brown envelope almost a package it looked bulkier than the one for peter schenk but he didnt want to open it there he hurried down field end road back to his flat tucking the envelope safely under the gaberdine coat he was wearing for just that purpose a dirty old man would not have the style to carry off gaberdine wool he told himself it would more likely be a blend or he shuddered at the thought textured polyester standing in the doorway of the kebab shop by the station holding a large doner with salad special sauce and a bright green chilli pepper police constable george thompson watched him go despite his profession pc thompson was not suspicious by nature he had been amused at first to see a group of young girls harass a rather primlooking man over by the station yet there was something strange about the mans reactions as he hovered around the bin on the crest of the hill the police officer had been chewing slowly and deliberately on his doner with only vague interest when he saw albert rossi search the bin that interest had sharpened considerably when he saw the man come up with a thick envelope and go hurrying off down the road with it pc thompson had very blue eyes weary after a long shift if albert had been looking into them he would have seen them go cold and hard much like the final piece of the kebab the policeman was a believer in instinct and he chose to spend his last hour before bed walking slowly along field end road after the unsuspecting albert rossi then noting the door number of his little flat on the balcony above the shops chapter four four days later albert responded to a knock at the door of his flat his bed was covered with plans and diagrams as well as the collins encyclopedia volume four dees he opened the door cheerfully with a piece of buttered toast in his mouth and a cup of tea in his hand when he saw that his visitor was a uniformed policeman he choked on the toast so suddenly and violently that pc thompson seriously considered calling for an ambulance after a good ten minutes of pounding albert rossi on his back and then supporting his redfaced frame pc thompson found himself in a small kitchen settling the man into a chair and fetching him a glass of water which albert sipped while they waited for his eyes to stop bulging sorry about that albert wheezed went down the wrong way not a problem sir are we feeling better now i am officer i dont know about you though albert smiled in a sickly way hoping his terror at the sight of a policeman had been put down to inhaling toast and not considered suspicious behaviour it did not help that this particular policeman looked exactly as albert rossi expected policemen to look he was vaguely aware that they had done away with height restrictions but pc thompson was not only tall he also had a neat and fairly bushy moustache he was slightly red in the face too though albert had to concede that it might have been from the exercise in the doorway in short george thompson could easily have been cast as the serious middleaged policeman in any film about sherlock holmes albert became increasingly uncomfortable as the man pulled up his own chair and looked around under normal circumstances sir i would have asked you to invite me in for a chat im not sure you ever did that with all the choking going on albert waved the idea away he hoped the gesture would be read as both a welcome to his kitchen and a thank you for the mans sterling efforts on his behalf but pc thompson only looked for the fly albert was apparently trying to scare off how may i help you officer albert tried as the silence stretched its probably nothing sir but if youre sure youre all right all fine now officer toast dislodged would you like a cup of tea not on duty sir thompson replied shaking his head sadly as if all the worlds ills could be laid at the feet of tea i have to open the shop in a minute albert prompted thompson nodded and to alberts silent horror produced a notebook from his chest pocket this is only a routine inquiry sir if you understand its just that your bank reported an unusual transaction i was in the area and i said id pop in and have a chat about it nothing formal mr rossi a banking matter albert asked in surprise and relief well they have persecuted me for some years now pc thompson i am happy to give my side of the story and perhaps youll appreciate then its about the twenty thousand pounds in cash that you paid in the day before yesterday sir if you dont mind thompson said checking his notebook for a moment im sure it can be explained but when large amounts of cash are moved about it generates a warning flag at the organised crime unit sir for an instant the policemans eyes grew wistful they get all the bells and whistles sir money no object with them as i say i was just passing and i said id drop in and check it was all above board albert felt his eyes beginning to bulge again as his mind raced the haunting strains of albinonis adagio in g minor seemed to fill his ears somewhere around the bit with dramatic chords it was not a pleasant sensation pc thompson waited and the silence grew longer and longer alberts mind was a complete blank he couldnt say it was his savings after almost a decade of reporting losses on the shop he toyed with the idea of saying he had found it but he had a suspicion that honest subjects of the queen were meant to hand large bags of cash to the authorities not pay their debts with them he opened his mouth slowly in the hope that the action would force an idea out what would a fellow assassin say to such a question did they even pay income tax he thought it was unlikely suddenly an idea tickled his forebrain gambling albert rossi said in triumph he reached into his pocket for a large linen handkerchief shaking it out with a flourish and wiping his forehead gambling sir pc thompson replied there was more than a hint of displeasure in those few words and albert rossi swallowed nervously in a casino albert added knowing he couldnt name the winner of any horse race roulette was the sort of thing he expected assassins to do though he had only ever seen it in the films he braced himself for more questions knowing that his future depended on how well he remembered oceans eleven a popular film about a casino robbery that hed watched only for the suits in fairness the suits were the best bit i see sir so youre saying you won twenty thousand pounds in one evening sir albert sensed the trap for all he knew casinos kept records of large wins oh no i only ever play for small stakes it was over a year or two you must have a system sir thats a lot of money roulette was it punto banco blackjack albert wiped his forehead again he could feel his armpits getting damp hed never heard of punto banco he imagined himself nodding happily and the policeman saying but actually sir a punto banco is a small fish from the river amazon or something like that he decided to play safe roulette mostly sounds like a good club sir which one was it again pc thompson leaned forward slightly in his seat but albert relaxed visibly a few years before hed been caught short in london and had popped into a plushlooking establishment he remembered the name the ingot in quebec street lovely place very attractive dark blue carpet he closed his mouth with a snap aware that hed gone a little too far not many men notice the carpet sir pc thompson said frowning to alberts relief he began to put his notebook away im an observant man officer albert replied trying a smile that he hoped looked more confident than he felt he could hear a phone ringing in his bedroom and his eyes swivelled in that direction if thats all officer thompson i have to take that call some sort of waistcoat emergency sir pc thompson said sourly there was a hint of disappointment in his eyes could well be officer you never know in this game the policeman rose and carefully set the chair back in its place well i wont keep you sir gambling does explain how you came into possession of twenty thousand pounds in used notes yes ill be in touch if theres anything else the policeman didnt sound satisfied albert noticed there was a definite note of frost in the air as he left harefield hospital is an emergency facility on the northwestern edge of london specialising in the treatment of heart and lung ailments most of the patients are elderly and very often the task of the staff is simply to prevent imminent death and then send them offsite to other wards to recover from their ordeal john halliday was not a normal patient in any sense not only was he younger than the others by about forty years but his injuries had come from a car accident or so the police claimed even they were not sure as he had been found unconscious and badly injured on hawthorn avenue in eastcote some twelve days before for six of those days he had hovered on the edge of deaths dark doorway holding on to the handle perhaps but with fingers slowly slipping then he had surfaced for a time and sheer rage seemed to aid his recovery from that point he had a memory of talking to a welldressed man in the road then a vision of a nissan micra coming straight at him as soon as he was awake he had questioned the nurses and even read his own chart with a sinking feeling the impact had created a blood clot in an artery as a result hed had a heart attack and been rushed to harefield halliday had not been a pleasant man before the heart attack on the morning of september when planes were hijacked over new york the last communications sent by mobile phone and picked up across the world were with one exception heartfelt and moving messages of love that exception had been the one left on the answering machine of john halliday it had come from his own brother i havent got long now his brother had said over the noise of roaring aero engines i just wanted you to know that you are a complete shit being run over and suffering a heart attack had done nothing to improve the personality of a man already capable of inspiring such dislike he had not seen a white light or spoken to an angel if he had he would have punched that angel in the kidney according to the nurses the police still wanted to speak to him though it seemed they thought of him as some sort of bizarre victim it hadnt helped that his false teeth had been knocked out in the collision with albert rossis micra a very young policeman had bagged them as evidence much as an iphoneusing schoolboy might have regarded a relic from the distant past like a codpiece or a cassette player without the teeth halliday had experienced enormous difficulties making himself understood his mood had worsened still further when his dentures were finally returned some wellmeaning soul had decided that they needed to be disinfected presumably they had been popped into a glass of neat bleach out of kindness but the result was the pink plastic gums had whitened as much as the false teeth when he smiled now people backed away as if from a shark perhaps even a shark in an advert for colgate toothpaste with real gleam halliday did not understand why they hadnt found his gun but there was no police guard sitting by his bed and over the previous week they appeared to have forgotten about him as it happens halliday did not want to speak to the police at all he might have vanished from the medical care unit on a quiet night if they hadnt put him on a catheter it worked a lot better than handcuffs he discovered you can wrench and struggle against handcuffs with practice and skill you can even pick the lock a tube leading straight up your penis is quite a different matter he resolved to wait someone would pay for every humiliation they would pay for the shockingly white smile the bed baths and the bruises they would pay for the irritating old lady across the room who kept throwing grapes at him they would pay for every moment of pain and weakness he had suffered he did not yet know the name of albert rossi if he had it would have given focus to waking moments filled with the desire for revenge halliday could have made a certain phone call from the bed he was not used to the idea of subcontracting work but a single call could set very dark forces in motion the idea was certainly tempting however this was personal perhaps a more personal debt than he had ever known before halliday knew about debts up to that point in his life he had settled every last one of them himself with cheerful thoughts of murder and micras wafting through his head he fell asleep once more chapter five albert rossi sat on a chair by his bed sucking his finger where he had caught it trying to reload the colt pistol he didnt have the internet himself but a visit to the local library had revealed that it was a semiautomatic and though obsolete had once been a favourite with american armed forces he liked that he liked everything about the gun he found his fingers drawn to it as it lay on his paisleypatterned quilt caressing the metal with all the attention he might have given a lover if hed ever had one who wasnt more interested in beefsteak and kidneys the colt was wonderfully impersonal it was almost as if you could point it at someone and say bang then watch them fall over that hadnt actually happened with peter schenk but it might have done albert was still avoiding thinking about the consequences or even the basic reality of his new profession the idea of say sticking a knife into someone would have simply horrified him the greasy brown envelope lay torn on the floor and the contents were spread all over his coverlet he had begun to understand that there was both good and bad news about the life of an assassin the good news was that honest decent family men were not likely to become targets at least in his limited experience so far the file he had read could only be described as disturbing and there were photographs in it that he never wanted to see again the bad news was that the sort of men who did attract the notice of paid killers usually had some inkling of the dangerous life they led just as peter schenk had employed armed guards so this new man victor stasiak had entrusted his safety to two ferocious dogs and armed guards running him over was not a serious prospect and sadly the man had no passion for hanggliding as albert read through the file he noted a longterm interest in photography but the potential for violent sudden death seemed limited there whoever had the task of researching the targets had done an incredibly thorough job that much was obvious as well as three different addresses around london and one in the lake district albert had all the details he could possibly need the house in cumbria looked the most promising if only because it was isolated and less likely to attract the attention of half a million metropolitan policemen among them one pc george thompson with his unpleasant interest in used notes and bank accounts albert had even negotiated when the voice called back to confirm he had received the envelope in alberts experience negotiation was an achingly embarrassing thing he had once offered per cent of the price for his washing machine only to be told that comet was a bit different to wembley market in wembley market he had offered half the asking price for a bottle of shampoo but they said it was full price or he could push off they hadnt said push either one of his least favourite memories was having a kitchen installed three years before whenever he made the builders a cup of tea the price had mysteriously gone up in the end he had spent the night in the tudor lodge hotel rather than bankrupt himself with yet another conversation in his new persona as killerforhire he had assumed a gruff voice and told his caller he wanted double the usual fee to his amazement and delight the voice had agreed just like that twenty thousand pounds was a lot of money by almost anyones standards it would clear alberts debt to the bank and might even leave enough over for a trip to a casino albert stroked the pistol as he considered getting out of the life after that hed been lucky but it couldnt go on one last job and he would be done with death he told himself hed keep the gun obviously for home defence or as a memento he smiled wryly as the memory of an old latin lesson came back to him a memento mori a reminder of death he made his plans that night and the following morning left a note on the shop door that said he would be closed for a few days experience suggested that not too many eastcote residents would be disappointed by that but it was basic good manners he walked past the butchers shop on the way home and could not help glowering through the window the nissan micra is quite a small car and his particular problem was that he didnt know exactly what equipment he would need to gain entrance to a mansion in cumbria albert had access to a small garage below the flats and over the years he had filled it with the same things as most other people an ancient canvas rucksack caught his eye metal bowls and a tin cup clanked inside from some old camping trip on a shelf he found a roll of duct tape albert was perhaps the only man in england who pronounced the t instead of referring to it as duck tape he spent a long time looking at a pair of pliers before putting them back with a sigh a hammer seemed generally useful and he found a roll of rope that he had bought as a makeshift washing line years before his best find was a pair of ancient binoculars looking as if they had last been used to search for german battleships in the channel a very old tool roll was helpful in putting his little kit together and at last the micra was loaded and ready to go according to his aa road atlas cumbria was just shy of three hundred miles away as he drove through ickenham towards the motorways that would take him north he worked out his journey times in calm anticipation victor stasiak did not know it but death was heading up the m towards him when it isnt raining cumbria is ranked among the most beautiful parts of england it is difficult to confirm this because its always always raining the inhabitants delight and frolic in it telling themselves that at least gardeners will be pleased gardeners are sometimes washed away in cumbria it has mountains as well however so those gentlemen are rarely washed far they usually end up in a gully of some kind albert had an umbrella of course it was a beautiful thing bought from james smith and sons on new oxford street it had struts and spars and it hummed in the wind as he heaved it open into a wet cumbrian gale he had also chosen a tweed jacket expecting it to help him blend in up north it is a littleknown fact that one stage of making tweed cloth involves leaving it to soak in urine sheep urine is much prized but for obvious reasons is extremely difficult to collect they wont stand still human urine is the only remaining choice and as a result there was a faint odour of wee around albert as his jacket grew damp he had parked his car in a town his map told him was called keswick and was walking down a rainy street where every second shop sold waterproof clothing and hiking boots or heavy jumpers or oldfashioned sweets for some reason perhaps hikers take comfort in barley twists or lemon drops as they wait for the rain to stop it never does though so some of them never come down albert had a huge choice of places offering bed and breakfast down every side street he picked one at random and lugged his heavy bag and umbrella through the door he told himself wearily that tomorrow would do well enough to despatch victor stasiak from this world to the next chapter six halliday stood outside the main entrance to harefield hospital shivering slightly in a grey drizzle he was out more importantly the catheter was out he was free he had made a call at last from inside the hospital and a long black car was now sliding through the rain towards him parking itself on a set of red lines usually reserved for ambulances he opened the door wincing slightly as the stitches in his groin pulled with the motion it was a mystery to him why the doctors had decided to approach his heart from as far away as a vein in his leg perhaps they enjoyed the challenge from his chart he had learned that a tiny cage had been inserted in his heart a stent as they called it it held the vein open and allowed the blood clot to disperse he frowned at the thought of the strange thing keeping him alive presumably they knew their business he was walking again after all he set his jaw as he slid into the back seat of the car and nodded to the driver he knew his business as well in ten years of successful work he had not suffered a single injury or come close to talking to a policeman until a complete stranger had run him over in a side street with a nissan micra it was frankly humiliating but he knew how to handle problems like that i need another gun he growled the driver nodded and opened the glove compartment handing back an oiled colt government and two clips of ammunition halliday tested the mechanism with swift muchpractised moves before showing his teeth in a savage smile the driver blinked into the mirror at the white glare but wisely decided not to notice where to the driver said halliday didnt have to think hed had time to plan in the endless days in the ward eastcote the tudor lodge hotel it would do as a base for a few days while he found out everything he needed to know he didnt like to admit it but he also needed more time to recover his heart had been damaged while part of it was blocked shut the slightest exertion set off sharp pains across his chest and made him gasp as if hed been running a fast mile although he hated the idea halliday was forced to admit it might be time to collect his savings and retire there was just one last job to do first as the limousine pulled away from the hospital they passed a lone police car coming the other way both of the uniformed occupants looked over at the black car but they couldnt see through the darkened windows john halliday smiled to himself he had nothing to fear from their questions now he hadnt given them his real name and they could search for nigel farnsley all they wanted he gripped the pistol tightly taking comfort from the familiar weight someone was definitely going to pay for what had been done to him alberts first problem after breakfast was confirming that victor stasiak was in residence a man with at least three houses the ones albert knew about could not be pinned down easily in one spot albert had brought enough money for a week at the bed and breakfast if that failed he knew he would have to try his luck in london that was not a pleasant prospect london was full of potential witnesses and there was something about the empty ruggedness of cumbria that appealed to the assassin in him as a boy he had read the thirtynine steps by john buchan which involved gentlemen wearing tweed chasing other more unsavoury gentlemen across the moors of scotland he could not recall all the details but in his hiking gear with the wind and of course the rain he felt glorious in waterproof goretex trousers with a rucksack and a large map flapping in the wind he might as well have been invisible as he trudged up hill and down dale and sometimes up dale and down hill there were a few others like him hardylooking men for the most part out enjoying the rain and the cold for cumbria it was a fine morning keswick town lies on the edge of a huge lake named derwentwater albert hadnt wanted to park too close to his quarry but as the morning wore on he found hed underestimated the distances involved at first he took long deep breaths and strode along the edge of the lake by the time hed worked his way through the valley of borrowdale he was weary he slogged through honister pass and began the long ascent of the fell known as rannerdale knotts it looked over the lakes of buttermere and crummock water and as he read each name on the map albert rossi began to wonder if hed somehow wandered into the set of the hobbit he reached the summit by the early afternoon fairly close to exhaustion only the sight of buttermere village below raised his spirits victor stasiak had his holiday home there and it was high summer when the rain warms a bit albert stood panting chewing on something called kendal mint cake which seemed to be a kind of brittle glass made of sugar he worked a piece out from where it had impaled the roof of his mouth and stood looking down on the houses below it was a little depressing to see a nice road running close by clearly he could have spared himself the hike but his aim of scouting the area from a safe distance had certainly been fulfilled albert could feel the weight of the pistol in his rucksack it could also have been his flask or the paperback book he had brought with him or the binoculars or even the bulky file with all the vital details of victor stasiaks life but in his imagination it was definitely the gun victor stasiak was excited an observer would have seen no betraying sparkle in his eyes as he flipped and tugged his tie into a windsor knot gazing into a long mirror as he did so the face that looked back was heavyjowled and serious with a solid jaw almost submerged in the layers of good living freshly shaved and gleaming rolls of pink fat disappeared into his collar if the same observer was feeling unkind he might have described it as the face of an elderly carp with thicker lips than are usual on a man when victor stasiak tensed his jaw the lower lip overrode the top one a determined carp then a carp who has met most of lifes little irritations and triumphed over them a carp in fact who tended to leave lifes little irritations in graves around the cumbrian countryside victor stasiak cared nothing for scenic beauty his entire purpose in choosing a holiday home close by buttermere lake was its suitability for burying his competitors lets assume for a moment that they were at least dead first it wasnt always true but lets assume it anyway with a soft grunt victor stasiak finished with his tie and held out his arms for a long cashmere coat that would have caught albert rossis interest immediately his manservant raised it at the right moment so that the fleshy arms vanished into the long sleeves and shortfingered heavy hands poked out at the other end it was a good coat and proof against the worst cumbrian weather yet such things were wasted on the man they contained the reason for victor stasiaks excitement lay not with the prospect of an invigorating walk or even the finest of cashmere he was looking forward to meeting his second in command in one of the most scenic spots in buttermere he was looking forward to it because he had discovered the man had been cheating him over a number of years victor stasiak smiled at his reflection a contented carp looked back he had chosen the spot carefully a bridge over the longest waterfall in cumbria he would enjoy seeing his colleague falling onto the rocks below it was a rare event for victor stasiak to get his own hands dirty with such things but the betrayal was a personal thing for him he smiled again a personal personnel issue to be able to make a pun even a weak one in english was a source of some pride for him he flexed his hands imagining them around a throat it would be a good day bring the car round to the front he told his servant have jonas and walker follow me in the audi with the dogs yes sir his manservant said bowing low it took time to train his staff to the right level of obedience but victor stasiak believed it was worthwhile for a man who had grown up in the steelyards of a lithuanian port such things were a simple joy hat victor stasiak said a heavy black bowler was held out and he fitted it carefully onto the dome of a head almost as perfectly round as the hat itself victor stasiak was not a fool he knew the english bowler hat had not been in fashion for sixty years or more as a younger man he had been impressed by a bond film in which the villain wore such a hat complete with a metal rim capable of decapitating statues victor stasiak had never thrown his hat at anyone but the idea of a razorsharp ring of steel available to him when all else failed was very much in keeping with his character in addition it suited him as well as the smell of wet tweed which gives the house of lords its distinctive odour it is another littleknown fact that britain has the most extensive network of numberplaterecognition cameras in the world most motorways main roads and town centres are covered by it the information is kept for up to five years and a policeman with an interest in a particular vehicle could if he so chose call up video records of its travels over that entire period pc george thompson was well aware of the irritating criminal tendency to swap their own number plates for those of a tractor or just an innocent car of the same make every year tractor owners in particular were forced to contact the metropolitan police and point out that while they would love to have been doing a hundred miles an hour in london it simply wasnt possible in a massey ferguson he doubted albert rossi had gone to those lengths to avoid detection and he was not disappointed thompson sipped at a cup of dark orange tea and tapped idly at a computer in uxbridge police station it was six oclock in the morning and he had come in early to gain access to a computer that usually took eleven closewritten forms even to touch he had found the password jotted down in the desk drawer and if anyone checked the records would show his absent colleague had become fascinated by a particular nissan micra george thompson looked grim as he sipped and tapped and then worked the mouse for a bit he could not have explained his suspicions about albert rossi the sudden appearance of cash was certainly interesting so were the weak excuses rossi had offered to explain his good fortune fishing brown envelopes out of station bins was another black mark against him yet there was something more thompson could feel it he was a believer in instinct and when his return visit had found the shop closed and albert rossi apparently vanished his instincts had stopped gently prodding and begun a more determined assault as he sat in the office and followed the video record into cumbria thompsons suspicions picked up a cricket bat and looked meaningfully at him something was up he was aware that he didnt have a shred of real evidence his superiors were unlikely to fund a day away from his desk on nothing more than a series of hunches yet he had a week of leave to use up and there were worse ways to spend it he made up his mind his rover could put him in cumbria by noon at the latest where was the last hit from the cameras he checked again and nodded to himself four miles outside keswick a traffic camera had recorded the little micra buzzing its way north keswick thompson knocked back the last of the tea at worst he would have a halfday by a pleasant lake but it was just possible that he would also discover what the hell was going on chapter seven albert rossi approached the house he had marked on his map creeping down a hillside in darting movements as he passed from tree to tree he reached the bottom hidden behind an enormous privet hedge that ran the length of the drive at almost exactly the moment two black cars swung round to the front door as albert watched the rear one was loaded with burly men and two snarling alsatian dogs he sank lower into old vegetation suddenly terrified that he would be seen he hardly needed his binoculars twenty yards from him the front door opened and victor stasiak came out sheltered from the rain by another man carrying an umbrella albert felt his pulse race at the sight of his quarry the tendency to wear black bowlers had been mentioned in the file but even if stasiak had been bareheaded there was no mistaking the heavy frame the coat was very good quality albert noted a little enviously it seemed crime paid rather well the experience with hanggliding and peter schenk had not prepared him for the sheer excitement of a hunter facing a dangerous enemy or at least looking at him from under a hedge albert rossis heart pounded wildly and his hands shook as he took hold of the pistol more for comfort than anything it was heady stuff for the owner of a mens clothing shop the thrill lasted just long enough for victor stasiak to climb into the back seat of the first car a huge mercedes the car door was shut by his manservant and in just a few seconds both vehicles purred their way past albert rossi in the undergrowth down the long drive and were gone the gates closed slowly on unseen motors albert tutted to himself but he was not disappointed at the very least he had confirmed stasiak was in cumbria he watched as the house became quiet once more an experienced assassin would probably not have done what albert rossi decided to do next the more professional members of that deadly craft have learned the hard way to make plans and stick with them they have also learned not to commit small crimes that could get them caught in possession of the tools of their trade they do not speed on motorways and they park carefully perhaps above all else they do not steal a postmans bike when it is left within twenty feet of them by a cheerful cumbrian albert watched as the gates to the estate opened once more his gaze flicked to the red and black bicycle leaning against the hedge then to the greyhaired man whistling as he approached the main house with his letters albert rossi did not remember making an actual decision but he was out of that hedge in a flurry of leaves onto the bike and pedalling furiously through the gates before his brain caught up as he turned into the road heading in the same direction as the black cars albert wobbled out of control most men assume they will be able to ride a bike for ever there is even a phrase like riding a bike that indicates its a skill you never lose once you have gained it the truth is that childhood skill does not always equal middleaged skill and albert very nearly crashed into a tractor on the first bend admittedly the driver of the tractor was distracted as he considered how to reply to a letter accusing him of doing eighty miles an hour in piccadilly that combination of distraction mild rain and lack of skill very nearly ended the career and the life of albert rossi after a moment of flashing images he found himself in a second hedge scratched and redfaced as the tractor driver shouted something unprintable and went on feeling much better about his own troubles flushed and sweating albert pulled himself out and resumed the chase he was still working on instinct and he peered ahead at every turn of the road for a glimpse of black cars life is full of small choices that can have large effects if president lincoln had chosen to stay at home rather than go to the theatre much of history would be very different if victor stasiak hadnt decided to send one of his men running into a corner shop in buttermere village to buy a cigar albert would have been unlikely to catch up with them puffing wearily with his legs already aching he stopped at the edge of the village and was rewarded by the sight of the two cars waiting at a kerb with engines running with a huge effort he steadied his breathing the gun was back in his rucksack and his prey was in sight he could only hope victor stasiak wasnt heading towards the motorway albert rossi had visions of the bikeless postman calling the police and fresh beads of sweat broke out on his forehead if the local constabulary spotted him he would surely be searched the gun would be found realising his danger albert stepped off the postmans bike but as he leaned it against a fence stasiaks cars moved off with a low growl albert made a similar sound in the back of his throat visions of twenty thousand pounds and freedom from the bank floated across his imagination he leapt back on keeping his head down as he pedalled after them heading through the village and out into the open countryside victor stasiak climbed slowly out of the car without bothering to acknowledge the bodyguard holding the door and an umbrella he could hear the roar of the waterfall nearby but as was often the case in cumbria he would have to walk the last part to get up to the bridge that crossed its highest point the rain was particularly heavy that day but even so there were one or two families and hikers trudging up the hill victor frowned at the sight of them it was a few minutes to noon and he needed privacy to carry out the unpleasant business he had planned as he stood there another black car crunched to a halt on the broken ground and his best friend for thirty years got out auguste nerius was a thin man wiry and still blackhaired despite his age victor suspected he dyed it but he had never asked nerius had been with victor in the shipyards running a small stolencar ring and a betting consortium when the authorities had finally closed in on them they had taken ship to the united kingdom just two more immigrants with a bagful of used notes the seed money had given them something of a jump start and their shipping contacts meant they could import almost anything they had got in at the beginning of a massive cocaine market in the seventies and made several fortunes victor greeted his oldest friend with a broad smile and patted him on the back lets walk he said without explanation as always he was impossible to refuse and nerius merely shrugged and followed he had always been the planner a man of few words while victor was the one who met clients and impressed them with his ruthlessness and charisma it had been a good partnership as they turned together to walk up the path victor shook his head in sadness some men are never satisfied no matter how much they own nerius had been like a brother to him but that made the betrayal all the more painful and the anger more fierce neither man took any notice of the middleaged cyclist who leaned his bike against a tree and stood with his hands on his knees gasping and redfaced after a time albert lay down on his back and wheezed at the grey clouds overhead victor stasiaks bodyguards stared at him as they brought the dogs out of the second car and let them sniff around on short leashes but there was nothing about albert rossi to arouse suspicion unless perhaps you worked for the post office and recognised the bike victor and nerius led the way and the bodyguards followed the small group left albert behind as they strolled along the winding track that would take them across the very top of the waterfall chapter eight victor stasiak was beginning to regret his taste for the dramatic he suspected he should have taken nerius somewhere quiet and simply put a bullet in his head his bodyguards were good with shovels and cumbria is almost designed for the easy disposal of dead colleagues with hidden valleys and clefts by the hundred yet for his oldest friend victor had imagined a grand finale a few last words then a silent fall onto the smooth black boulders far below he had not imagined a child licking an ice cream and watching them both with dull fascination nor the two mums walking a squalling baby back and forth across the bridge in his imagination the bridge over the waterfall had been deserted and windswept he frowned to himself nerius was still waiting for whatever was so important that his boss and friend had to summon him to such an odd place victor looked at him and drummed his fingers on the wooden railing of the bridge did the latest shipment come in all right he said at last nerius shrugged and nodded britain was that wonderful combination of an island and a trading nation so that ships came and went twentyfour hours a day it really wasnt difficult to get a small highvalue item like cocaine into one of the great ports with the best will in the world the customs officers couldnt search every container victor usually left that side of things to nerius while he set up the meetings and links in the chain further down the girl with the ice cream stepped closer to stare at the two men talking in a strange language victor glowered at her without making the slightest impression he had been intending to confront nerius with his knowledge see the awareness of real danger creep into the mans face then pitch him over the railing he couldnt really raise the subject with the prospect of having to wait another half an hour for the bridge to clear yet nerius was growing suspicious he could sense it he needed a topic to pass the time inspiration struck him and victor stasiak relaxed im thinking of retiring nerius old friend he said ive made my money and im not a young man any more nerius looked sharply at him searching his face with his eyes the two mums had finally rocked the baby to sleep and one of them was calling for the little girl to come with them victor nodded to himself his bodyguards were further down the track trying hard to look as if they were just out walking two savage alsatians weve um weve had some good times victor went on vaguely the little girl wandered off looking back at them with every step as she followed the two mums for the first time the bridge was empty as he tensed for action victor saw what looked like a scout troop rounding the closest bend led by a bearded man in shorts oh for gods sake victor stasiak said theres no privacy here in moments the bridge filled with boys peering over the edge while their harassed scoutmaster warned them constantly that they would fall if they leant that far out victor tried not to listen but he learned more about that bridge and waterfall in the next minute than he had ever wanted to know to his surprise nerius suddenly spoke the words hoarse from a man who weighed them like gold and spent them only rarely i am pleased to hear that i can take over victor we can work something out victor stasiak blinked at him in surprise he opened his mouth to reply but the scoutmaster was already pointing further down the hill the group began to move away swiftly victor checked both directions seeing only the backs of young scouts hurrying to catch up with the rest he failed to see albert rossi brace himself against a tree some way off the path albert was muddy and exhausted from scrambling over rough ground but at last he was close enough to bring his gun to bear on the two men i would have liked that nerius victor stasiak went on yes i can say it to you now i would have liked you to take over after me i have no sons nerius you would have made me proud he checked the paths again finally they were alone a hundred yards away albert rossi wiped sweat from his eyes and rested the long silencer on a small branch squinting along it there is only one small problem old friend victor said nerius raised his eyebrows in silent enquiry small dogs should not show their teeth to big dogs nerius when they do they get hurt what do you mean nerius asked in genuine confusion i mean you should have told me about the shipment from the ukraine old friend it should have turned up on the books and it did not did you really think i wouldnt find out about you stealing from me nerius understood suddenly that he was very alone he stepped away from victor stasiak and his muscles tensed to run in doing so he gave albert rossi a perfect clear shot with a grim expression albert squeezed the trigger then squeezed it again much harder so that his hand shook with the effort safety catch he whispered to himself flicking it across with his finger and resuming his position squinting along the barrel his mouth fell open in surprise in that brief moment of inattention the situation on the bridge had changed dramatically victor stasiak had nerius by the throat the smaller man was struggling violently hammering at the hands that held him they staggered left then right as albert rossi looked on in astonishment it seemed almost rude to interrupt his kill in such a way as if they were not taking him seriously at all the wooden bridge across the waterfall was well built and solid it was quite capable of preventing boy scouts from falling to their deaths with a little care it was not however capable of withstanding the sixteen stone of victor stasiak combined with the twelve stone of auguste nerius suddenly slamming against the railing it gave way and both men flailed in horror as they plunged over the edge and tumbled to the rocks far below for reasons albert did not understand victor stasiaks spinning bowler hat landed on the wooden bridge and stuck there quivering for the second time in his brief career as an assassin albert rossi watched men fall to their deaths he was obscurely disappointed hed been looking forward to using the gun and if it hadnt been for the rotten safety catch hed he caught himself realising lots of different things at once he would be paid a small fortune for a start victor stasiak was definitely dead and that meant hed succeeded at least as far as stephen hawking was concerned more pressing though was the sudden shouting of bodyguards nearby combined with the barking of dogs albert rossi was fairly certain they would see that a terrible accident had occurred however he suspected the sight of an armed man wrapped around a nearby tree might make even a simpleminded bodyguard a little suspicious he could hear alsatians barking furiously as the bodyguards came sprinting up to the bridge instinct alone made him toss the pistol into the river far below before standing up and trying very hard to look like any other hiker who happened to be wandering past albert rossi reached the bridge at the same time as the bodyguards the alsatian dogs growled and lunged on their short leashes their black eyes frightening one of the men was already gesturing wildly speaking into a mobile phone in a language albert couldnt understand albert felt it would be suspicious to ignore the scene so he sidled close to the broken rail like any other interested passerby he was looking at the sprawled bodies far below when one of the guards grabbed him by the scruff of the neck you go go away now the man said gesturing down the path with a frown at the mans bad manners albert did as he was told trying not to let them see how his legs were shaking that was it he told himself that was the last job hed take he could still recall the moment of puzzled terror as victor stasiak caught sight of him in midfall the look in the mans eyes had been an awful thing to witness and albert shuddered as he reached the bottom of the track to his surprise there was a policeman standing by the postmans bicycle but albert had been dealing with worse things than that and he strolled on passing the police car parked nearby he was close enough to hear the radio splutter as the message came in about a boy scout troop who had been splashing around in the pools below only to have two men bounce off the rocks around them that was a trip they wouldnt forget albert rossi thought with a smile he wondered if there was a badge for that as he made it back to the road he realised he didnt regret the decision he had made albert rossi was cut out for a lot of things but the life of an assassin was too noisy too fraught with danger and frankly too stressful he almost looked forward to quiet days back in the shop or he could even retire a thought struck him he owed himself a visit to a casino first he began to whistle walking along a leafy lane towards buttermere chapter nine pc george thompson almost choked on his lemonade when he saw albert rossi again for a moment he thought there would be a nasty repeat of their first meeting but this time with rossi thumping him on the back he had been sitting at a table under a cafe awning coincidentally close to the nissan micra he had followed north when the man himself strolled by whistling to himself as if he didnt have a care in the world as a general rule policemen dont enjoy the sight of cheerful carefree people and pc thompson was no exception he finished coughing out the last gulp of lemonade hed inhaled and stood up suddenly to bar albert rossis path they faced each other in mutual suspicion and surprise for the first few moments albert could not reconcile the face of the policeman with his recent experiences in alberts mind the policeman had a definite context and a cafe in cumbria was not it for his part pc george thompson could hardly believe how bedraggled and muddy albert rossi was he looked as if hed leapt through a hedge hiked over a mountain and slid down a hill until a tree arrested his descent all of that was in fact true it had been a busy morning for albert rossi mudspattered and weary though he was he was also feeling very pleased with himself he recognised the moustache and smiled afternoon george albert said cheerily or i suppose its evening by now i didnt expect to see the long arm of the law so far out of london pc thompson narrowed his eyes at this casual use of his first name im on leave for a couple of days he said grimly might i ask your reason for suddenly visiting the lake district he remembered rossi as a nervous little man not this breezy fellow in hiking gear with a mischievous expression albert rossi was in the pleasant situation of knowing he had committed no crime barring the theft of a bicycle oh he had intended terrible dark deeds no doubt about it but as it happens none of them had actually come off he didnt even have the gun any longer all in all it had been a lovely holiday and he couldnt resist tweaking the nose of a policeman who had lost his power to intimidate just getting away from the smog george dont you know bit of fresh air hiking in the rain seeing gods creatures up close that sort of thing i see so it wouldnt have anything to do with a large amount of money in used notes then it was admittedly a stab in the dark to see what reaction he would get albert rossi only chuckled and tutted in gentle reproof no casinos around here george just hills and waterfalls and things beautiful you should try it a bit before you go back now lovely to see you but ive a long drive ahead albert rossi even considered patting the policeman on the shoulder though in the end he thought that might be a step too far he felt pc thompsons stare between his shoulder blades as he reached his car and dumped the rucksack into the boot perhaps he can be excused the cheery wave he gave the policeman before settling himself in and tuning the radio to his favourite station bonnie tyler began to build towards a powerful chorus and albert grinned to himself put the car in gear and went home a week later albert took some of the money he had been paid and walked it through the polished doors of the ingot in quebec street london he stood in the entrance and breathed in the atmosphere the dark tables the quiet hum of talk the click of chips and the tinkle of ice in glasses he was wearing a rather nice dinner jacket and hed worried it would be too much in london but he was able to relax when he saw how smartly dressed the other patrons were as he changed a thick wad of cash for chips he wondered how many of them were assassins enjoying the fruits of their labours probably not more than half a dozen at most he thought by the time he came out some six hours later darkness had fallen in london albert took out a large linen handkerchief and wiped his forehead as he stood in the discreet light from the club it had been an extraordinary evening he felt wrung out as if he had lived a year in just a few frantic hours he could feel damp patches under his armpits despite the doublestrength antiperspirant he had put on earlier he had won for one golden evening the gods had looked down on albert rossi and actually smiled he had never had an evening like it in the beginning he had put a hundred pounds on black and doubled his money it was meant to be his farewell to the life the insane bet that would be his final twofingered gesture to natwest and their letters to all bad men and assassins everywhere flushed with that success he had picked a number at random and put two bloodred chips on it to his amazement the croupier had pushed a big pile of chips over to him just moments later it is perhaps not too surprising that albert rossi went a little wild at that point hed bet on the low eighteen numbers hed bet on the high hed bet on odd numbers then the double zero to his delight a crowd had gathered around him and at the peak of it all hed even had the experience of seeing the croupier check with the floor boss the floor boss had looked at albert rossi a slight smile had crooked the side of his mouth perhaps he saw only the owner of a gentlemans clothing shop in the ingot that evening yet for those few glorious hours albert was a little more than that he was an assassin retired and he won again after the floor boss nodded to let the stakes ride they brought him drinks and a plate of canapes that he wolfed down as he hadnt eaten since lunch he nodded to the croupier to put a thousand on number seven while he was still chewing on an avocado and prawn delight and it came in the perfect silver ball answering every one of his prayers he had felt drunk on the magic of it all finally the universe had given up treading on albert rossi he only wished the manager of his local natwest branch could be there to witness his triumph the man would bite through his own hat in frustration albert was sure of it in the end albert pushed a tower of chips onto the square for black and watched as the silver ball bounced around clicking and spinning somehow he knew his luck had run out long before it came to rest in a red slot a sigh went around the group who had gathered to watch they looked at albert hungrily their eyes gleaming as they stared at the remaining stacks of chips by his right hand every one of them was well dressed but for the first time in his adult life albert was immune to such things there was a moment of silence as they waited for him to ride the loss and risk it all if he had been nothing more than a man who sold coats and socks he might have been taken in by the false friends on all sides yet albert rossi had stared death in the face mostly as it was plummeting past him with a quiet sigh he had stood up stepped back and asked to have his remaining chips cashed in outside a light drizzle began that couldnt even begin to dampen his mood despite that final loss he had a thick bundle of notes in every pocket of his jacket and coat he shook his head in quiet disbelief staring at his hands in the rain as if the magic they had contained might still be seen somehow he knew it had gone and gone for ever it was a last gift and he would retire with it the road outside the casino was still busy at that time of night umbrellas hid the faces of passersby and albert jumped when one of them stepped in close to him without warning he looked down at a colt government pistol complete with sinister black silencer albert gaped at the weapon then looked slowly up into the face of the man carrying it it was the first time he had actually seen the flinty features of john halliday and there was nothing to reassure him there we meet again albert halliday growled at him though this time you have no car handy to run me over albert was already wearing a surprised spaniel sort of expression as the new information sank in it became by degrees spaniel found next to a chewed slipper the dazed happiness drained slowly away leaving him feeling dizzy and slightly ill memories flashed at him and he made a soft moaning sound was it good manners to congratulate a man on being alive when you were the one who had run him over albert had no idea that was an accident he said spluttering oh i could have believed that halliday said leaning still closer and sticking the gun into alberts midriff one look at you and the words clumsy careless bastard spring to mind but theres more isnt there i made contact with my employers and do you know what they said do you know what they told me his voice had risen and a few passersby glanced over at the pair of men standing against a wall one of them raised his eyebrows for a moment before hurrying on but thats all you get in london even if you run down a road naked albert sighed they told you id been carrying on with your jobs a faint hint of rebellion came into his tone surprising them both pretty well too as it happens halliday responded by jamming the gun further into alberts stomach making him wince they did say that yes but they do not appreciate sporting amateurs in this game albert i hardly had to mention it before they employed me to sort this little problem right out i have money on me albert said looking into hallidays insane eyes enough to pay you back for the jobs i did you could just take it and go no one would ever know im finished anyway thats a very decent offer mr rossi a month ago i might have accepted a nice offer like that halliday smiled which revealed a white glare of teeth and bleached gums that made albert blink however there is the little matter of evening up the scales albert i believe in scales you see in balance when a man runs me over causing me a ruptured spleen and a heart attack there has to be justice do you understand im not here for the money im not even here to make a point about bleeding amateurs im here for justice now that albert was looking for it he saw that halliday was not in fact in the best of health the assassin looked very pale and beads of sweat stood out on his forehead halliday swayed as he stood there and he kept blinking as if he was having trouble keeping albert rossi in focus for the first time albert thought about shoving the man away and trying to make a run for it what happened next happened very quickly indeed out of the crowd a burly figure stepped up suddenly and dropped a heavy hand onto john hallidays shoulder right whatevers going on im getting to the bottom of it right now youre both nicked it was perhaps the wrong thing to do to a man who had released himself too early from a heart ward there was a dull thump and halliday collapsed in a sprawl pc george thompson saw the gun for the first time as it clattered onto the pavement his jaw dropped open and as he looked up he saw a wisp of smoke from a hole in albert rossis jacket their eyes met and without a word albert folded on top of halliday bloody hell pc thompson said to himself in awed wonder he had chosen to wear plain clothes to follow albert rossi but he reached into his textured polyester coat and removed a police radio snapping out the details of the incident over the crackle of static in the middle of london paramedics and police would be only a minute or two away but pc thompson knelt and took hallidays pulse anyway the man was dead his false teeth halfway out of his mouth pc thompson stared at them in confusion sharks werent in it when he reached albert rossi he patted the mans cheek and took his wrist but with a sudden gasp albert pulled it away and sat up shaking his head groggily his gaze took in the crouching policeman looking as if hed seen a ghost as well as the dead body lying next to him slowly with shaking hands albert rossi opened his coat and pulled out a bundle of banknotes tied with a gold band his eyes widened as he saw a hole all the way through them then he reached further to another bundle in his jacket breast pocket there was a hole in that bundle as well but there was also a slightly misshapen bullet bloody hell pc thompson said again better than body armour i think you did me a bit of a favour there george albert said weakly
