marion lennox crowned the palace nanny a book in the marrying his majesty series chapter one dr elsa langham disappeared after a car accident four years ago mrs elsa murdoch took her place the invitation had been sitting on the table all day a taunting reminder of her past the international coral society invites dr elsa langham foremost authority on coral alcyonacea to submit a paper at this years symposium in hawaii the ics hadnt kept up with her change in direction eightyearold zoe was asleep in the next room totally dependent on her and dr elsa langham was no longer an acclaimed authority on anything she read the invitation one last time sighed and finally dumped it in the bin i dont know why theyre still sending me invitations she told the skinny black cat slinking out from under her chair im mrs elsa murdoch a mother to zoe an occasional student of starfish to keep my scientific hand in and my cats need feeding she rose and took a bowl of cat food to the back garden the little cat followed deeply suspicious but seduced by the smell of supper four more cats were waiting elsa explained the terms of their tenancy as she did every night fed them then ignored five feline glares as she locked them up for the night they knew the deal but they didnt have to like it at least you guys go free every morning she told them you can do what you want during the day and so could she she told herself she could take zoe to the beach she could study starfish she could be mrs elsa murdoch until a miracle happens she thought to herself pausing to look up at the night sky not that i need a miracle i really love zoe i dont mind starfish and im incredibly lucky to be alive its justi wouldnt mind a bit of magic like a rainbow of coral to appear in our cove or prince charming to wave his wand and take away my debts and zoes scars enough the cats werent interested in wishes and neither was anyone else she smiled ruefully into the night turned her back on her disgruntled cats and went inside she needed to fix a blocked sink where was prince charming when you needed him the little boy would live prince stefanos antoniadisdr steve to his patientswalked out of theatre savouring a combination of triumph and exhaustion hed won the boys mothera wornlooking woman with no english but with a smile wide enough to cut through any language barrierhugged him and cried and stefanos hugged her back and felt his exhaustion disappear he felt fantastic he walked into the scrub room sorely tempted to punch the air in triumphand then stopped dead this wasnt fantastic this was trouble two months ago king giorgos of the diamond isles had died without an heir next in line to the throne of the mediterranean island of khryseis was stefanoss cousin christos the only problem was no one could find christos worse if christos couldnt be found the throne belonged to stefanoswho wanted the crown like a hole in the head in desperation hed employed a friend who moved in diplomatic circles and whose discretion he trusted absolutely to search internationally for christos that his friend was here to tell him the news in person meant there must be a major problem they told me youve been opening a kids skull chopping bits out and sticking it back together his friend said with easy good humour how hards that seven hours i get paid by the hour stefanos said grasping his friends hand but he couldnt make himself smile what news from your point of view as an investigator this man was the best and he knew the issues involved youre not crown prince of khryseis not he closed his eyes the relief was almost overwhelming it hadnt always been like this as a boy stefanos had even dreamed of inheriting the throne that his almost pathologically shy cousin swore he didnt want but that was in the past king giorgos was bound to have sons and if notchristos would just have to wear it almost twenty years ago stefanos had moved to the states to pursue a medical career his dream since then had been to perfect and teach surgical techniques so wounds such as the ones hed treated today could be repaired in hospitals less specialised than this one anywhere in the world so youve finally found christos he asked feeling the weight of the world lift from his shoulders sort of his friend said but there was something in his face which made stefanoss jubilation fade his expression said that whatever was coming wasnt good christos is dead steve the man said gently in a car accident in australia four years ago thats why you havent been able to find him dead he stared at his friend in horror christos my cousin why how you know he left the island soon after you apparently he and his mother emigrated to australia neither of them kept in touch it seems his mother held his funeral with no fuss and contacted no one back on khryseis three months after he died so did she dear god its the worst of news his friend said he hesitated but theres more stefanos knew it he was replaying their conversation in his head his friends first words had been youre not crown prince of khryseis christos had been first in line to the throne followed by stefanos but christos was dead therefore it had to be stefanos unless theres a child his friend told him a child he said numbly a little girl christos married but his wife was killed in the same accident their child survived she was four when her parents were killed shes now eight stefanos didnt respond he was staring at his friend but he was seeing nothing he was working on groundbreaking surgical techniques his work here was vital a child her names zoe his friend said shes still living in australia with a woman called mrs elsa murdoch who seems to be employed as her nanny but steve yes but he already knew what was coming christoss death means the child takes the crown he said gently zoes now the crown princess of khryseis that means youre prince regent stefanos still didnt answer there was a chasm opening before hima gaping void where his career used to be he could only listen while his friend told him what hed learned ive done some preliminary checks from what i gather of the islands constitution youll be in charge until zoes twentyfive the islands rule and the consequent care of your cousin as crown princess lies squarely on your shoulders nowdo you want me to find an address for this woman called elsa chapter two royalty was standing on elsas beach sunlight was shimmering from the surface of a turquoise sea the tide was at its lowest for months their beach was a mass of rock pools and there were specimens everywhere theyd swum far out to the buoy marking the end of shallow water and a pod of dolphins had nosed in to check them out theyd dived for starfish theyd floated lazily in the shallows floating eased the nagging ache in elsas hip as nothing else could finally theyd made each other crowns out of seaweed pods and now queen elsa and her consort princess zoe were marching back to the house for lunch and a nap to find royalty waiting for them royalty without seaweed for a moment elsa thought shed been out in the sun too long the man was dressed like a prince from one of zoes picture books his uniform was black as night tailored to perfection his slickfitting suit was adorned with crimson epaulettes tassels braid and medals his jacket and the top collar of his shirt were unbuttoned but for some reason that made him look even more princely a prince trying to look casual uhoh her hand flew to her seaweed crown and she tugged it off as icy tendrils of fear crept round her heart royalty was fantasy not real zoes father had always been afraid of it but his stories had seemed so farfetched that elsa had deemed them ludicrous look zoe said puzzled and the eightyearolds hand clutched hers zoe had only been four when her parents died but maybe she remembered enough of her fathers paranoia to worry or maybe the sight of someone dressed as a prince on a queensland beach was enough to worry anyone i can see him elsa said wow do you think hes escaped from your sleeping beauty book hes gorgeous zoe said relaxing a little as elsa deliberately made light of it he must be hot elsa said cautiously do you think he came in a carriage like in cinderella if he did i hope it has airconditioning elsa retorted and zoe giggled good great zoe giggling was far more important than any prince watching them from the sand dunes she would not let anything interfere with that giggle maybe hes looking for us zoe said worry returning maybe hes from khryseis maybe he is neither of them had ever been to khryseis but the fabulous mediterranean island was part of zoes heritagehome to the father whod been killed when she was four according to the internet khryseis was an island paradise in the mediterranean ruled up until now by a king who was as corrupt as he was vindictive zoes father christos had spoken occasionally of the old kings malice now those stories came flooding back and elsas fears increased accordingly the manthe princewas walking down the sandy track towards them tall tanned and dropdead gorgeous elsa stopped and put down her pail she held zoes hand tighter a lesser mortal might look ridiculous in this situation but despite his uniform this man looked to be in charge of his world strongly built aquiline features dark hooded eyes cool authoritative and calm and then he smiled the combination of uniform body and smile was enough to knock a girls socks off if she had any socks that was she thought humour reasserting itself as she decided it was ridiculous to be afraid she wiggled her toes deep into the sand feeling the need to ground herself oh but that smile down she told herself fiercely hormonal response was exactly what wasnt wanted right now act cool she met the mans gaze and deliberately made herself match his smile or almost match it her smile was carefully that of someone passing a stranger his smile on the other hand was friendly his gaze dropped to zoeand his smile died that always happened no one could stop that initial reaction instinctively elsa tugged zoe closer but zoe was already there they braced together waiting for the usual response try as she might she couldnt protect zoe from strangers her own scars were more easily hidden but zoes were still all too obvious but this wasnt a normal response zoe the man said softly on a long drawnout note of discovery and pleasure you surely must be zoe you look just like your father neither of them knew what to say to that they stood in the brilliant sunlight while elsa tried to think straight she felt foolish and that was dumb she was wearing shorts and an old shirt and shed swum in what she was wearing her sunbleached hair had been tied in a ponytail this morning but her curls had escaped while she swam she was coated in sand and salt and her nose was starting to peel ditto for zoe they were at the beach in australia they were appropriately dressed she thought struggling for defiance whereas this man im sorry im in uniform he said as if guessing her thoughts i know it looks crazy but ive pulled in some favours trying to find you those favours had to be repaid in the form of attending a civic reception as soon as i landed i left as soon as i could but the medias staked out my hotel if id stopped to change they might well have followed me here i dont want zoe to be inundated by the press yet whoa there was way too much in that last statement to take in first of allwas he really royal what was she supposed to do bow not on your life sowho are you she managed and zoe said nothing im stefanos prince regent of khryseis zoe your grandfather and my grandfather were brothers your father and i were cousins i guess that makes us cousins of sorts too cousins that was almost enough to make her knees give way zoe had relations this mans voice had the resonance of a greek accent not strong but unmistakable that wasnt enough to confirm anything christos didnt have any cousins she said which was maybe dumbwhat would she know orhe always said there was no one so did his mother and i didnt know theyd died he said gently zoe im so sorry i knew your father and i knew your grandmother and i loved them both im very sorry i didnt keep in touch im so sorry i wasnt here when you so obviously needed me elsa was starting to shake she so didnt want to be shaking when zoe was holding her hand but it was happening regardless she was all zoe had andshe might as well admit itfor the last four years zoe was all shed had you cant have her it was said before she had a chance to think before her head even engaged it was pure panic and it was infectious zoe froze im not going with you she whispered and then her voice rose in panic to match elsas im not im not and she buried her face against elsa and sobbed her terror elsa swung her up into her arms and held the little girl was clutching her as if she were drowning and stefanosor whoever he waswas staring at them both in bemusement she looked at him over zoes head and found his expression was almost quizzical good one he said dryly you dont think you might be overreacting just a little she probably was she conceded hugging zoe tighter but there was no room for humour here you think we might be a bit over the top she managed prince charming on a queensland beach she looked past him and saw a limousinea bentley no less with a chauffeur to boot overreaction she didnt think so youre frightening zoe youre frightening me i didnt come to frighten you so why did you come she heard herself then realising she was sounding hysterical she knew zoes father had come from khryseis she knew hed been part of the royal family what could be more natural than a distant relative here on official business dropping in to see zoe but then there was his statementive pulled in some favours trying to find you hed deliberately come searching for zoe prince regentthat made him prince in charge while someone was incapacitated the old king or when someone was a child no zoe hush she said catching her breath deciding someone had to be mature and it might as well be her i was silly to panic stefanos isnt here to take you away she glared over zoes head as much to tell him dont you dare say anything different he comes from the island where your papa grew up im sorry i reacted like i did i was very rude and very silly i think its time to dry our eyes and meet him properly zoe hiccuped on a sob but thered been worse things than this to frighten zoe in her short life and she was one brave little girl she sniffed and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand and turned within elsas arms to face him she was a whippet of a child far too thin and far too small the endless operations had taken their toll it was taking time and painstaking rehabilitation to build her up to anywhere near normal maybe we both should say sorry and a proper hello elsa said ruefully and zoe swallowed manfully and put a thin hand out in greeting clinging to elsa with the other hello she whispered hello stefanos said and took her hand with all the courtesy of one royal official meeting another im very pleased to meet you zoe ive come halfway round the world to meet you and then he turned his attention to elsa and you must be mrs murdoch shes elsa zoe corrected him elsa then if thats okay with elsa stefanos said meeting her gaze steadily she had no hand free left to shake and she was glad of it this man was unsettling enough without touch soshe didnt know where to go from here did you invite a prince home for a cup of tea or for a twelve course luncheon you live here he asked his tone still gentle there was only one place in sight her bungalowa tired rundown shack is this place yours yes can i come in and talk to you your chauffeur would it be too much trouble to ask if you could ring for a taxi to take me back into town when weve spoken i dont like to keep my chauffeur waiting theres no taxi service out here oh now what what was a woman to say when a prince didnt want to keep his chauffeur waiting she needed an instruction manual maybe she was still verging on the hysterical she gave herself a swift mental shake im sorry a taxi wont come out here but we have a car itll only take us fifteen minutes to run you back into town im not normally soso inhospitable its the uniform i expect it might be he said and smiled and there it was again that smilea girl could die and go to heaven in that smile i dont want to put you to trouble if you can cope with a simple sandwich youre welcome to lunch she managed andof course well drive you into town after all youre christoss cousin so i cant be all bad it was a teasing question and she flushed i loved christos she said almost defensively and i loved amy zoes mama and papa were my closest friends she managed a shaky smile for their sakeyoure welcome the house was saggy and battered and desperately in need of a paint a couple of weatherboards had crumbled under the front window and a piece of plywood had been tacked in place to fill the gap the whole place looked as if it could blow over in the next breeze only the garden fabulous and overgrown looked as if it was holding the place together stefanos hardly noticed the garden all he noticed was the woman in front of him she wasstunning stunning in every sense of the word he thought natural graceful free free was maybe a dumb adjective but it was the thought that came to mind she was wearing nothing but shorts and a faded white blouse its top three buttons undone so he had a glimpse of beautiful cleavage her long slim legs seemed to go on for ever finally ending in bare feet tanned and sand coated this woman lived in bare feet he thought and a shiver went through him that he couldnt identify was it weird to think bare sandy toes were incredibly sexy if it was then count him weird but it wasnt just her toes it wasnt just her body her face was tanned with wide intelligent eyes a smattering of freckles and a full generous mouth with a lovely smile breathtakingly lovely her honeyblonde hair was sunkissed bleached to almost translucence by the sun there was no way those streaks were artificial for there was nothing artificial about this woman she wore not a hint of makeup except the remains of a smear of white suncream over her nose and her riot of damp saltandsandladen curls looked as if they hadnt seen a comb for a week quite simply hed never seen a woman so beautiful are you coming in elsa was standing on the veranda looking at him with the beginnings of amusement probably because he was standing with his mouth open is this a holiday shack he managed forcing his focus to the housethough it was almost impossible to force his focus anywhere but her the information hed been given said she lived here surely not no she said shortly amusement fading its our home i promise its clean enough inside so you wont get your uniform dirty i didnt mean no she relented and forced another of her lovely smiles i know you didnt im sorry he came up the veranda steps zoe had already disappeared inside and he heard the sound of running water zoe gets first turn at the shower while i make lunch elsa explained then she sets the table while i shower it was said almost defiantly likedont mess with the order of things she was afraid he thought butthis woman was zoes nanny she was being paid out of zoes estate hed worried when hed read thata stranger making money out of a child now he wasnt so sure this wasnt a normal nannychild relationship even after knowing them only five minutes he knew it and the fear shed be wanting reassurance that he wouldnt take zoe away he couldnt give it he watched her face and he knew his silence was being assessed for what it was why hadnt he found more out about her his information was that zoes parents had died in a car crash four years ago since then zoe had been living with a woman who was being paid out of her parents estatean estate consisting mostly of christoss life insurance that information had him hoping things could be handled simply he could take zoe back to khryseis and employ a lovely warm nanny over there to care for her maybe this could even be seen as a rescue mission this woman sunburned freckled and barefoot standing with her arms folded across her breasts in a stance of pure defence said it wasnt simple at all mrs elsa murdoch was not your normal nanny andchristos and amy had been her best friends im not here to harm zoe he said mildly no that was a dumb statement he conceded as if she was expecting him to beat the child i just want whats best for her good she said brusquely you might be able to help me there are a couple of things i could use some advice over that wasnt what he meant they both knew it did you know zoes the new crown princess of khryseis he asked and she froze the what the crown princess of khryseis i heard you i dont know what you mean i think you do he said softly your face when i said it doesnt mean a thing she whispered im tired confused and hungry and your uniform is doing my head in come in and sit down while i make lunch and take a shower but if you say one wordone wordof this crown princess thing to zoe before weve discussed it fully youll be off my property so fast youll leave your gold tassels behind got it umgot it he said right she said and turned and marched inside leaving him to follow if he felt like it or go away if he felt like it her body language said the second option was the one she favoured the moment he got inside he took his jacket off he pulled off his tie undid the next two buttons of his shirt and rolled up his sleeves it was a casual gesture of making himself at home and it rendered her almost speechless outside hed seemed large inside tossing his jacket on the settee rolling up his sleeves taking a slow visual sweep of her kitchenliving room he seemed much larger it was as if he was filling the room the space not taken up with his sheer physical size overwhelmed by his sheer masculinity he was six one or six two she thought not huge justmale and more goodlooking than was proper and way too sexy sexy where had that word come from she shoved it away in near panic this is great he said and she fought for composure and tried to see the house as he saw it it was tumbledown of course it was there was no way she could afford to fix the big things one day in the not too distant future zoe might be able to go to school and she could take a proper job again and earn some money but meanwhile they made do where did you get this stuff he asked gesturing to the room in general its amazing most of it we found or we made he gazed around at the eclectic mix of brightly coloured cushions and faded crimson curtains the colourful knotted rugs on the floor lobster pots hanging from the ceiling with shells threaded through to make them look like proper decorations a fishing net strung across the length of one wall filled with old buoys and huge seashells there were worn pottery jugs filled with flowers from the garden bird of paradise plants crimson and deep green you found all this he demanded i used to have an apartment at the university she told him small my parents left me this place and i came here at weekends im a marine biologist and wei used the cottage as an occasional base for research zoes parents were what you might call itinerant they had a camper van and most of what they owned was destroyed in the accident so zoe and i scrounged what we could find we made a bit and we filled the rest by beachcombing she met his gaze full on defying him to deny her next assertion zoe and i are the best beachcombers in the world i can see you are he said he paused youre a marine biologist yes she faltered and tried for a recovery very parttime until zoe goes to school zoe doesnt go to school i homeschool her here at the moment so meanwhile youre living off christoss life insurance shed opened the refrigerator and was lifting out salad ingredients she froze she didnt turn around she couldnt if she had he might have got lettuce square in the middle of his face what was he suggesting thats right she said stiffly im ripping zoe off for every cent i can get i didnt mean im very sure you did mean finally she turned carefully placing the lettuce out of throwing range what is it you want of us mr whoeverthehellyouare because theres no way im calling you prince i dont know why youre here but dont you dare imply im acting dishonestly dont you dare i already did he said holding his hands up as if in surrender im sorry so am i the door swung open zoe appeared looking wary the little girl was in clean tshirt and shorts her hair was a tangle of dark wet curls she was far too thin elsa thought trying to see her dispassionately through stefanoss eyes she was so scarred the burns had been to almost fifty per cent of her body and twenty per cent of those had been full thickness shed had graft after graft thankfully her face was almost untouched but her skinny little legs looked almost like patchwork her left arm still needed workher left hand was missing its little fingerand there was deep scarring under her chin shed protect this child with her life she thought but protection could only go so far this man was part of zoes real family she had to back off a little okay its my turn for the shower poppet she said trying to make her voice normal you sounded angry she said doubtful im crabby cos im hungry she tugged zoe to her in a swift hug ill have a shower in world record time can you set the table and talk tostefanos hes your papas cousin he knows all about khryseis maybe he could show you exactly where he lives on the internet we have pictures of khryseis bookmarked and with a final warning glance at stefanos she whisked herself away she didnt want to leave at all she wanted to bring zoe into the bathroom with her she wanted to defend her with everything she had zoe crown princess zoe had far too much to deal with already if stefanos wanted to take on part of zoes life then he had to contend with her zoes life was her life shed sworn that to zoes mother and she wasnt backing down on it now she couldnt she was so afraid chapter three zoe set the table while he watched her the little girl was watching him out of the corner of her eye not meeting his gaze directly table done she turned to a corner desk holding a computer the machine looked like something out of the dark ages big cumbersome and ugly she checked the internet waiting until the khryseis information downloadedseemingly by slowboat from china but finally the websites in khryseis were on the screen by the look of the bookmarks she and elsa spent a lot of time browsing them he tentatively showed her where he lived on the islandor where hed lived as a child she reacted with silent politeness he checked the other bookmarks for the island they were marine sites he saw research articles about the island worth noting so you and elsa spend a lot of time studyingfish he ventured and got a scornful look for his pains echinoderms right good what the hell were echinoderms and then elsa was back same uniform as beforeshorts and faded shirt she was tugging her curls back into a ponytail still she wore no makeup and without the suncream her freckles were more pronounced her nose was peeling and her feet were still bare she walked with a slight limp he noted but it was very slight a twisted ankle maybe but that was a side issue he wasnt about to focus on an ankle when he was looking at the whole package she was so different from the women in the circles he moved in that her appearance left him stunned awed even hed implied she was dishonest there was nothing in this place in her dress in anything in this house that said she was taking advantage of zoe his investigator had shown him christoss financial affairs if they were both living totally on christoss life insurance how much outside work do you do he said carefully neutral and elsa pulled up short you mean how much of my obviously fabulous riches are derived from honest toil and how much by stealing from orphans he had to smile and to his relief she returned a wry smile herself as if she was ordering herself to relax im not accusing you in any sense of the word he assured her whats in front of my eyes is zoe in need of your care and you providing that care christoss life insurance wouldnt come close to paying for your combined expenses you dont know the half of it so tell me she shook her head im sorry but christos never spoke of you as a cousin or as a friend as far as i know neither christos nor his mother ever wanted to have anything to do with anyone from khryseis how can my finances have anything to do with you i do want to help is that right she said neutrally she shook her head im sorry look can we eat i cant think while im hungry and after a morning on the beach i could eat a horse she almost did there was cold meat and salad and freshly baked bread which she tipped from an ancient breadmaker she cut doorstop slices of bread and made sandwiches she poured tumblers of homemade lemonade sat herself down checked zoe had what she neededthe sandwich shed made for zoe was much smaller almost delicate in comparison to the ones shed made for herself and for himand then proceeded to eat she ate two doorstop sandwiches and drank three tumblers of lemonade while zoe ate half a sandwich and elsa prodded her to eat more those legs are never going to get strong if theyre hollow she teased and zoe gave her a shy smile threw stefanos a scared glance and nibbled a bit more she was trying to eat he could see that was his presence scaring her the idea of frightening this child was appalling the whole situation was appalling he was starting to have serious qualms about whether his idea of zoes future was possible except it must be he had to get this child back to khryseis oh but her little body it didnt take his medical qualifications to realise how badly this child was damaged the report hed read had told him that four years ago christos his wife and their fouryearold daughter had been involved in a major car accident christos had died instantly amy his wife had died almost two weeks later and zoe their child had been orphaned no details there was a story behind every story he thought and suddenly he had a flash of what must have happened a camper van crashing a fire a death a woman so badly burned she died two weeks later and a child a child burned like her mother he knew enough about burns to understand you didnt get these type of scars without monthsyearsof medical treatment without considerable pain hed arrived here thinking he had an orphaned eightyearold on his hands on his hands shed seemed like one more responsibility to add to his list her nanny was listed as one mrs elsa murdoch hed had visions of a matronly employee taking care of a schoolaged child in return for cash his preconceptions had been so far from the mark that he felt dizzy despite the mansized sandwich on his plate he wasnt eating the official reception had been midmorning thered been canapés and hed been watched to see which ones he ate which chef hed offend so hed eaten far more than he wanted elsas doorstop sandwich was good but he felt free to leave the second half uneaten he had a feeling elsa wasnt a woman who was precious about her cooking actuallywas this cooking he stared down at his sandwich and thought of the delicacies hed been offered since hed taken over the throneand he grinned so whats funny elsa demanded and he looked up and found she was watching him once more she was wearing her assessing expression he found it penetratingand disturbing he didnt like to be read but he had a feeling that in elsa murdoch hed found someone who could do just that ive had an overload of royal food he told her this is great so you wouldnt be eatingwhy im full of canapés i can see that about you she said a canapé snacker can i have your sandwich then he handed it over and watched in astonishment as she ate where was she putting it there wasnt an ounce of spare flesh on her she lookedjust about perfect where had that description come from he thought of the glamorous women hed had in his life how appalled theyd be if they could hear the perfect adjective applied to this woman and once more he couldnt help smiling yep were a world away from your world she said brusquely what the will you stop that what she asked all innocence mind reading not if it works its fun she rose and started clearing dishes he noted the limp again but almost as he noted it it ceased zoe was visibly wilting zoe poppet you go take a nap unless she paused unless stefanos wants us to drive him into town now i need to talk to you he said there you go she said equably i mind read that too so zoe pop into bed and well take stefanos home when you wake up you wont get angry again zoe asked her casting an anxious look across at him and he got that too this childs mental state was fragile she did not need angry voices she did not need anyone arguing about her future this place was perfect for an injured child to heal he thought a tropical paradise he had another paradise for her though he watched with concern as elsa kissed her soundly promised her no anger and sent her off to bed there was no choice he just had to make thisnannyaccept it she washed he wiped she protested but he was on the back foot alreadythe idea of watching while she worked would make the chasm deeper they didnt speak maybe the idea of having a prince doing her wiping was intimidating he thought wryly and here it was again her response before he could voice his thought an apron beats tassels for this job any day i need a camera she said handing him a sudsy breadboard to wipe no one will believe this arent you supposed to rinse off the suds youre criticising my washing im more than happy to let you do both im more than happy to do both she paused she set down her dishcloth and turned to face him wiping her sudsy hands on the sides of her shorts she looked anxious again and territorial and really really cute why the limp he asked and she glanced at him as if he was intruding where he wasnt wanted its hardly a limp im fine next question wheres mr murdoch he asked and her face grew another emotion what she said dangerously uhoh but he couldnt take the question back it hung between them waiting for an answer my researchers said zoes nanny was a mrs elsa murdoch ms she said and glared so never a mrs whats that to do with the price of eggs its merely a polite question polite okay she even managed apolitesmile so wheres your princess sorry im mrs so there has to be a mr i believe im simply reversing your question is there a matching princess why would you want to know that exactly she said and smileda smile that confounded him as she turned back to her washing only there was nothing left to wash she let the water out and wiped the sink with care she waited for him to dry the last glass then wiped his part of the sink as well as if it was vital that not a speck of anything remained this woman confounded himbut he had to focus on their future he must zoes needed back on khryseis he said and elsas hand stilled midwipe she couldnt disguise the fear sweeping over her face she stays here i believe im her nearest living relative he said mildly as such i can challenge your guardianship she didnt move her hand seemed suddenly to be locked on the sink she was staring downward as if there was something riveting in its depths oh he couldnt mistake the distress on her face no but it had to be said like it or not the stakes were too high to allow emotion to hold sway im her cousin he said gently but as firm as he needed to be its obvious youre struggling to care for her i can you cant she whirled to face him at that her voice was low enough not to disturb zoe but loud enough to make him feel her fury and her fear shes been with me for four years im her godmother and her guardian her mother was my best friend and i promised amy id care for her her father was a colleague and i loved him too youdid you know any of them i knew christos yeah close family she mocked he never mentioned you not once he said royalty on khryseis was a shambles the king was concerned only with himself the king controlled all three of the diamond isles and the original royal families of each island were helpless christos was frightened of the royal family he came here to escape what he saw as persecution he hated them okay he thought stick to facts get over this patch of ground as fast as possible and move on king giorgos gave christos a dreadful time he told her keeping his voice as neutral as he could christos and his mother left khryseis when he was seventeen did he tell you he was first in line to the crown of khryseiss original royal family no he was thats why giorgos made life hell for him he made life hard enough for me and i was only second in line so we both left and made our lives overseas but when giorgos died giorgos is dead without an heir so christos should be crown prince its taken weeks to get this far to find he was dead no one on khryseis knew hed died his mother wasnt well when her son died he could see facts and emotions swirling fighting for space as she took in his words i guessi imagined it was up to her to tell others if she wanted but she was frail already and her sons death made thingswell she died three months later so zoe lost her grandmother as well her eyes flew to his she hadnt expected that response he thought and wondered what she had expected yes she whispered thank you for recognising that it did make things much harder so then you stepped in there was no one else and now we have a mess he said choosing his words with care yes christos hated the royal family but it was king giorgos he feared and giorgoss line is finished the three diamond isles have splintered into three principalities as christoss only child zoes the new crown princess of khryseis shell inherit full sovereign power when shes twentyfive but until then like it or not im prince regent whether i want that power or not the islands desperate for change the infrastructures appalling but i only have power for change if zoe lives on khryseis for at least three months of every year otherwise the power stays with an island council thats as impotent as it is corrupt elsa she has to come home she didnt say a word she was a really selfcontained woman he thought hed shaken her out of her containment but hed done it with fear of losing zoe she had her selfcontainment back now and he had no idea what was going in her head he wouldnt be privy to it until she decided to speak again she poured two tumblers of water she walked outsidenot limping now he thought and found he was relieved he could cope with an injured childbut not an incapacitated nanny as well there were two ancient deckchairs on the porch she sank into one of them and left it to him to decide whether to sit on the other the chairs were old and stained and the one left vacant looked to be covered in cat fur his trousers were jetblack with a slash of crimson up the side ceremonial uniform it brushes off she said wryly not looking at him gazing out through the palms to the sea beyond he sat you have a cat he asked feeling his way five she said and as he looked around she shook her head they wont come near when youre here theyre feral cats cats are a huge problem up herethey decimate the wildlife only zoe loves them so weve caught every one we can if theyre at all approachable we have them neutered we feed them really well at dusk and again in the morning we lock them up overnight where we feed themin the little enclosure behind the house that way they dont need to kill wildlife to eat apart from our new little black one theyre fat and lazy and if you werent here theyd be lined up here snoozing their day away you can afford to feed five cats mistake once again she froze youre inordinately interested in my financial affairs she said flatly can you tell me why theyre youre business youre spending zoes money and youre responsible for zoe how you didnt even know she existed now i do know shes family good then she said go talk to zoes lawyers theyll tell you we put her money in a trust fund and i take out only whats absolutely necessary for us to live and the cats she sighed we catch fish she said i cook the heads and innards with rice thats my cat food for the week so yes i waste rice and some fish heads on our cats shoot me now im not criticising you are she said bluntly you said im struggling to care for her tell me in what way im struggling look at this place he said before he could stop himselfand her simmering anger exploded im looking i cant see a palace if thats what you mean i cant see surroundsound theatre rooms and dishwashers and airconditioning i cant see wall to wall carpet and granite bench tops so how does zoe need those its falling down so if it falls down ill rebuild we have isolation which zoe needs until she gets her confidence back we have our own private beach we have my workyes im still doing research and im being paid a stipend which goes towards zoes medical costs but youre paying zoes medical costs your investigator didnt go very far if he didnt find that out her parents hadnt taken out medical insurance she said in this country the basics are covered but there have been so many small things the last lot of plastic surgery was on her shoulder the surgeon was wonderfulthats why we used himbut he only operates on private patients so we had to pay you had to pay whatever you cant keep doing that try and stop me she said carefully neutral again shed obviously decided it was important to keep a rein on her temper where does that leave you where i am stuck in the middle of nowhere with a damaged child she put her drink carefully down on the packing case that served as their outdoor table she rose you know im not enjoying myself here and i have work to do i correct assignments online and i try to do it while zoes asleep when she wakes well drive you back into town but meanwhilemeanwhile you go take a walk on the beach calculate cat food costs do whatever you want i dont care i believe any further dialogue should be through our lawyers and she walked deliberately inside and let the screen door bang closed after her chapter four she was true to her word she wouldnt speak to him until zoe woke up he took a walk on the beach feeling ridiculous in his ridiculous uniform he came back and talked for a while to a little black cat who deigned to be sociable finally zoe woke but even then elsa only spoke when necessary ill give you the address of my lawyer she said i already know who your lawyer is of course you do she said cordially silly me youre being obstructive she said yes i am whats obstructive zoe asked not letting your cousin stefanos have what he wants what does he want you might ask him zoe turned to him puzzled what do you want to get to know you he said refusing to be distracted by elsas anger your papa was a very good friend of mine when he left khryseis we didnt writehe wanted a clean break i should have made more of an effort to keep in touch and ill be sorry for the rest of my life that i didnt that he married and had a little girl called zoethat he diedit breaks my heart that i didnt know it makes you sad very sad but apparently zoe knew about sadand she had a cure when im in hospital and im sad elsa tells me about the fish shes seen that day and shells and starfish elsa keeps saying the seas waiting for me to get well she brings in pictures of the beach and the house and the cats and she pins them all over the walls so every time i wake up i can see that the sea and this house and our cats are waiting for me his gaze flew to elsa she was staring blankly ahead as if she hadnt heard but she had heard he thought she surely had and he knew thenas he watched her stoical face he realised that he was threatening her foundations he was threatening to remove a little girl she loved with all her heart hed never thought of this as a possibility that a nanny could truly love his little cousin hed come here expecting to meet mrs elsa murdoch paid nanny instead hed met elsa marine biologist friend protector mother to zoe in every sense but name after the shock of learning of zoes existence his plan had been to rescue his orphaned cousin take her back to khryseis and pay others to continue her care or if zoe was attached to this particular nanny then he could continue to employ her to give the kid continuity it had to be option two only if he broached it now elsa might well lock the door and call the authorities to throw him off her land so do it when he had so little time i need to go back to khryseis tomorrow he told zoe and glanced sideways to see relief flood elsas face elsas said shell drive me into town now but ive upset her she thought i might want to take you away from her and id never do that i promise so if you and elsa drive me into town now can i come and visit again tomorrow morning he looked ruefully down at his ceremonial trousersnow liberally coated in cat fur if im welcome is he welcome zoe asked elsa if you want him to come elsa said neutrally stefanos is your cousin zoe thought about it he was being judged he thought and the sensation was weird judged by an eightyearold with elsa on the sidelines doing her own judging orit seemed shed already judged if you come you should bring your togs zoe said togs your swimming gearif you own any without tassels and braid elsa said still obviously forcing herself not to glower as a farewell visit she added warningly because if you really are zoes cousin then i accept that she should get to know you thats gracious of you he said gravely it is she said and managed a halfhearted smile the drive back to town started in silence elsas car was an ancient family wagon filled in the back withof all thingslobster pots there was a pile of buoys and nets heaped on the front passenger seat so he was forced to sit in the rear seat with zoe she could have put the gear in the back he thought but she didnt offer and he wasnt pushing it so she was chauffeur and he and zoe were passengers you catch lobsters he said cautiously we weigh them sex them tag then and let them go she said briefly from the front you have a boat the university supplies one but i only go when zoe can come with me its really fun zoe said i like catching the little ones you have to be really careful when you pick them up if you grab them behind their necks they cant reach and scratch you we have lobsters on the diamond isles he told her my friend nikos is a champion fisherman do you fish zoe demanded i did when i was a boy they chatted on elsa was left to listen and fret he was good she conceded he was wriggling his way into zoes trust and that wasnt something lightly achieved like her father before her zoe was almost excruciatingly shy and that shyness had been made worse by peoples reaction to her scars stefanos hadnt once referred to her scars to the little girl it must be as if he hadnt noticed them the concept for zoe must be huge here was someone out of her papas past wanting to talk to her about interesting stuff like what hed done on khryseis when he was a boy with her papa she shouldnt be driving him back into town she should be asking him to dinner even asking him to sleep over to give zoe as much contact as she could get only there were other issues like the crown like the fact that hed said that zoe had to return to khryseis like crazy stuff that she couldnt consider like asking a prince of the blood whether hed like to sleep on her living room settee she thought suddenly and the idea was so ridiculous she almost smiled he was leaving tomorrow hed stopped talking about the possibility of zoe coming with him maybe hed given up she glanced into the rearview mirror and he looked up and met her eyes no she thought and fear settled back around her heart prince stefanos of khryseis looked like a man who didnt give upon anything the township of waratah cove had two threestar hotels and one luxury sixstar resort out on the headland past the town without asking she turned the car towards the headland and he didnt correct her money she thought bleakly if she could have the cost of one nights accommodation in this place can you stop here stefanos asked and she jammed her foot on the brake and stopped dead maybe a bit too suddenly wow zoe said are you crabby or something or something she said neutrally glancing again at stefanos in the rearview mirror your nanny thinks i spend too much money he said amused and she flushed was she so obvious elsas not my nanny zoe said amused herself what is she shes just my elsa my elsa it was said with such sureness that he knew he could never break this bond if he was to take zoe back to khryseis he needed to take them both he had to get this right so why did you want me to stop here elsa asked because the ambassador to the diamond isles leaked to the media that i was coming here he said bitterly thats why i had to find myself a uniform and attend the reception ive already had to bribeheavilythe chauffeur they arranged for me so he wouldnt tell anyone my location i imagine therell be cameramen outside my hotel wanting to know where ive been and i dont want a media circus descending on zoe i can walk the last couple of hundred yards maybe you should check your trousers elsa said and there was suddenly laughter in her voice cat fur isnt a great look for a royal prince thanks very much he said and smiled and unaccountably she smiled back hers was a gorgeous smile warm and natural and full of humour if hed met this woman under normal circumstances maybe hed never have noticed her he thought she didnt move in the circles he moved in plus he liked his women groomed sophisticated able to hold their own in any company shed be able to hold her own this was one feisty woman he needed to learn more about her he needed to hit the phones extend his research come up with an offer she couldnt refuse unaccountably he didnt want to get out of the car the battered family wagon loaded with lobster pots smelling faintlyno more than faintlyof fish unaccountably seemed a good place to stay he thought suddenly of his apartment in manhattan of his consulting suite with its soft grey carpet its trendy chrome furniture its soft piped music they were worlds aparthe and mrs elsa murdoch but now their lives needed to overlap enough to keep the island safe the islanders safe zoe safe until today hed seen zoe as a problema shock to be muted before the islanders found out now suddenly that obstacle was humana little girl with scars attached to a woman who loved her they were waiting for him to get out of the car if he left it any longer a media vehicle might come this way one cameraman and zoe would run he thought and itd be elsa who ran with her elsa wasnt family it wasnt her role to care for zoe forget the roles he told himself sharply now he must protect the pair of them he climbed from the car and tried to dust himself off he had ginger cat fur on black trousers suddenly elsa was out of the car as well watching as he shrugged on his jacket do your buttons up she said almost kindly you look much more princely with your buttons done up and hold still if a car comes ill stop but lets see what we can achieve before that happens and before he knew what she intended shed twisted him round so she could attack the backs of his legs and the seat of his trousers with a hairbrush its actually a brush zoe uses for her dolls she told him sweeping the cat fur off in long efficient strokes but seeive rolled sticky tape the wrong way round around its bristles its very effective he was so confounded he submitted he was standing on a headland in the middle of nowhere while a woman called mrs elsa murdoch attacked his trousers with a dolls hairbrush she brushed until she was satisfied then she straightened turn round and let me look at you she said he turned very nice she said back to being a prince again what do you think zoe is he ready for the cameras his top buttons undone zoe said thats because its hot he retorted but elsa shook her head no class at all she said soulfully i dont know what you modern day royals are coming to she carefully fastened his top button while he felthe felthe didnt know how he felt he was only aware that when the button was fastened and she stepped back there was a sharp stab of something that might even be loss there you go your highness she said like a valet whod just done a good job making a recalcitrant prince respectable off you go and face the world while zoe and i get back to our cats and our lobster pots and she was in the car turned and driving away before he had a chance to reply his first task was to get his breath back to face the media with some sort of dignity his second task was to talk to the hotel concierge i need some extensive shopping done on my behalf he said fast oh and i need to hire a car no not a limousine anything not smelling of fish would be acceptable then he rang prince alexandros back in the diamond isles as well as being a friend alexandros was crown prince of sappheiros and alex more than anyone else knew what was at stakewhy he was forced to be in australia in royal uniform when he should be in theatre garb back in manhattan problem his friend asked i dont know what dont you know the childs been burned shes dreadfully scarred there was a sharp intake of breath hell is she shes okay its healing but my idea of leaving her on the islandshell have special needs you were never going to be able to leave her anyway i dont have a choice he snapped you know i cant leave my work yeti cant break promises but theres a nanny a good one a mrs elsa murdoch shes not like any mrs elsa murdoch ive ever met there was a lengthy silence on the end of the phone then how many mrs elsa murdochs have you met alexandros asked with a certain amount of caution uhoh alex and stefanos had known each other since they were kids maybe alex had heard something in his voice that he didnt necessarily want to share just the one he said another silence shes young alex ventured yes aha theres no aha about it theres a mr elsa murdoch no i rest my case he said hey stefanos like me youve spent so much of your life pushing your careeravoiding family maybe its time you did a heads up and noticed the elsa murdochs of this world alex he couldnt think what to add next you want something more alex asked something specific if notmy wifes waiting for me not a bad thing for a prince to have you know a wife especially if that prince needs to care for a child with injuries this isnt a joke i dont believe i was joking alex threw back at him okay so this mrs elsa murdochyou want to tell me about her how had he got himself into this conversation he didnt have a clue ill leave you to your wife he said stiffly excellent alex said ill leave you to your mrs elsa murdoch and your little crown princess steve yes take care and keep an open mind speaking as a man whos just marriedit can make all the difference in the world elsa lay awake far into the night staring at a life shed never envisaged a life without zoe shed never thought of it four years ago shed been happily married full of plans for the future working with matty and her good friends and their little girl one stupid drunken driverwhod walked away unscathedand she was left with nothing but the care of zoe up until today shed thought zoe depended totally on her up until now shed never really considered that the reverse was true as well without zoe no she couldnt think it it left a void in her life so huge it terrified her hed backed off hed said he was leaving tomorrow zoes needed back on khryseis she reran his words through her mindshe remembered almost every word hed uttered he hadnt backed off zoes needed back on khryseis she was zoes legal guardian but if it came to a custody battle between elsa with no blood tie and no means of giving zoe the last operations she so desperately neededor stefanos a royal prince a blood relative with money and means at his disposal able to give her every chance in life what choice was there she felt sick and tired a letter lay on her bureau she rose from her tumbled sheetslying in bed was useless anywayand read it for the thousandth time it was an outline of costs for cosmetic plastic surgery to smooth the skin under zoes chin and across her neck shed sold everything she had there was no money left stefanos not if it meant losing zoe not who was she protecting here herself or zoe damn him she should be welcoming him she thought knight on white charger with loaded wallet not if it meant giving up zoe to watch them go to watch him go where had that thought come from nowhere she did not need to think he was sexy the fact that he was dropdead gorgeous only added to her fear she did not need her hormones to stir they were stirring she walked outside stood on the veranda and stared into the dark prince stefanos of khryseis cousin to zoe a man about to change her life a man about to take her child fifteen miles across the water stefanos was doing the same thing watching the moonbeams ripple across the ocean thinking how his life had changed because of zoe andelsa a barefoot poverty stricken marine biologist of a nanny he had a million other things to think about so why was he thinking of elsa it was midmorning when he arrived and they hadnt left for the beach yet there was a tiny seeping wound under zoes arm it was minuscule but theyd learned from bitter experience to treat small as big this was a skin graft area if it extended zoe could lose the whole graftan appalling prospect elsa had found it while she was applying zoes suncream and now she was hovering between wait and see or ring the local medical centre and get it seen to now only it was sunday their normal doctor would be away waratah cove had a small bushnursing hospital manned by casual staff over the weekend less experienced doctors tended to react to zoes injuries with fear dreading undertreating if she took zoe in shed be admitted and transferred to hospital in the city simple as that and they were both so weary of hospitals her worry almost made her forget stefanos was comingbut not completely the sound of a car on the track made her feel as if the world was caving in landing right on her shoulders she hated this she just hated it she tugged a tshirt over zoes scarred little body and turned to welcome him and almost gasped this was a different stefanos faded jeans tshirt scuffed trainers great body really great body a body to make her feel she was a woman again she had to do something about these hormones they were doing things to her head shed married matty his picture was still on the mantel get a grip hi he said and smiled at the two of them and elsa couldnt resist she had to smile it was as if he had the strength to change her world just by smiling hi zoe said shyly and smiled as well and elsa looked at zoe in astonishment two minutes earlier the two of them had been close to tears stefanoss smile was a force to be reckoned with i thought youd be at the beach he said and then he looked more closelymaybe seeing the traces of their distress is something wrong we thought we wouldnt go to the beach this morning elsa said repressively zoe loathed people talking about her injuries shed had enough fuss to last one small girl a lifetime stefanos had never mentioned her scars maybe he hadnt even noticed ornot why not he said gently and suddenly he was talking to zoe and not to her as if hed guessed theres a bit of my skin graft come loose zoe said once again it was as much as elsa could do not to gasp zoe never volunteered such information shed had the best doctorsthe bestbut almost every one of them talked to her and not to zoe oh they chatted to zoe but in the patronising way elders often talked to children for the hard questionseven things like is she sleeping at nightthey turned to her as if zoe couldnt possibly know so what had stefanos done different she knew he hadnt treated her as an object of sympathy and hed talked directly to her simple but so important whereabouts stefanos asked still speaking only to zoe under my arm at the back is it hurting no butits scary zoe said and her bottom lip wobbled can i ask why elsa will have to take me to hospital and theyll make me stay there and i dont want to go her voice ended on a wail she turned her face into elsas shirt and she sobbed zoe stefanos said in a voice shed not heard before gentle yet firm he squatted so he was at her eye level zoe will you let me take a look i dont know if i can help but im a doctor will you trust me to see if i think you need hospital he was a doctor there was a loaded silence zoe would be as stunned as she was elsa thought you still cant have her she thought her instinctive response overriding everything else but she had the sense to shut up the last thing zoe needed was more fear because astonishingly zoe was turning towards him she was still hard against elsa but hed cut through her distress youre a doctor yes but youre a prince people are allowed to be both my papa was a doctor she said but a doctor of science he studied shellfish did christos get his doctorate he said with pleasure hey how about that i wish id known still he was talking to zoe your papa and i used to be really good friends he taught me where to find the best shells on khryseis only i always wanted to find the pretty ones or the big ones and he wanted to look for the interesting ones sometimes hed pick up a little grey shell i didnt think at all special and off hed go telling me it was a multiarmpit hairy cyclamate or a wobblysaurus rex or something even sillier zoe stared in astonishmentand then she giggled you could forgive a lot of a man who could make zoe giggle elsa conceded anda man who could make her giggle as well will you let me see what the problem is he asked gently and zoe lifted her tshirt without hesitation which was another miracle all by itself and here was another miracle he didnt react zoes left side was a mass of scar tissue but stefanoss expression didnt change by as much as a hairs breadth he was still smiling a littlewith zoeand she was smiling back his long fingers probed the scar tissue with infinite gentleness not going near the tiny suppurating wound but simply assessing the situation overall he had such long fingers elsa thought big hands tanned and gentle she wouldnt mind umwhoa attention back to zoe fast what sort of medical supplies do you have here he asked still speaking only to zoe and elsa held her breath this was a question every doctor or nurse she knew would address to her but this whole conversation was between the two of them we have lots of stuff zoe volunteered sometimes when im just out of hospital the nurses come here and change my dressings it costs a lot though cause were so far out of town so elsa keeps a lot of stuff here and shes learned to do it instead well good for elsa and dumbly elsa found she was blushing with pleasure can i see he asked ill get it she said and headed for the bathroomand even that was a minor miracle for zoe to let her leave the room while a strange doctor was examining herdefinitely a miracle she didnt push it though she was back in seconds carrying a hefty plastic crate she set it down and stefanos examined its contents and whistled you have enough here to treat an elephant he said you dont have an elephant hidden under a bed somewhere do you once again zoe giggled it was the best sound it made her feelit made her feel no she would not get turned on because this man made a child giggle only she already was she was fighting hormones here as hard as she could and losing it had been too long youre a sick sad spinster she told herself and then rebuked herself sharply not a spinster she glanced across at the mantel and mattys face smiled down at her from its frame sorry she told him under her breath sorry sorry sorry you know im sure i can fix this stefanoss words tugged her attention straight back to him zoe if you and elsa trust mei think all this needs is some antiseptic cream a couple of steristrips to tug it togethersee its at the end of the graft so we can attach the strips to good skin on either side and tug it together then we can pop one of these waterproof dressings over the whole thing and you could even go swimming this morning which seeing i brought my bathers is probably a good thing he grinned and elsa thought im in trouble here im in serious trouble but they were moving on stefanos rose and washed his hands with the thoroughness of a surgeon then he lifted zoe carefullybeing mindful of where her scars were without zoe noticing he was mindful elsa thought he sat her on the kitchen table and proceeded to do his stuff he was skilled she just had to see those fingers gently probing she just had to listen to him chat to zoe distracting her as he worked he was so careful so precise and she thought of all the doctors whod treated zoe over the past four years and she thought this man was a blessing this man wanted to take zoe away this man was zoes cousina prince this man was a doctor with all the skills needed to take care of her she was a marine biologist with nothing he was applying the waterproof dressing now and he glanced over his shoulder to say something to her and he saw her expression shed tried to get it under control but he could seeshe knew he could see theres nothing to be afraid of elsa he said gently and she thought you dont know the half of it nothing to be afraid of when he was threatening to turn her world around iyou came here to talk she said and it was really hard to get her words out i came here to swim he said are there any other problems to sort before we swim nothing i can treat ingrown toenails snakebite measles zoe giggled again and wriggled down from the table she was totally at ease now completely relaxed in his company he couldnt take her away she thought frantically zoe would always want her wouldnt she theres nothing to be afraid of she told herself but she knew she was lying there was everything to be afraid of everything she held dear but for nowit seemed they were going for a swim chapter five the swim was glorious fun and deeply scary glorious in that the weather gods had decided this was another day out of the boxbrilliant sunshine but not too hot the water cool enough to refresh but not so cold they couldnt stay in for as long they wanted turquoiseclear so they could see everything on the bottom fun because stefanos made it fun he twisted and turned under the water teaching zoe new tricks tickling her toes on the sandy bottom making her play as a child should play as zoe had been unable to play shed been isolated for so long she should be with other children but there were so many complications twice elsa had tried to send her to school but each time shed ended up with a major infection and back in hospital so if it couldnt be a bunch of kids whooping and hollering around her stefanos was definitely next best he was a fabulous swimmer and he knew how to make zoe laugh of course he was and of course he did elsa thought with what she recognised as dumb and irrational resentment she loved that zoe was falling for stefanoss charm but she was also fearful of it she was fearful of falling for stefanoss charm herself because he wasgorgeous shed seen him yesterday in full royal regalia and thought he was gorgeous then shed seen him this morning in his jeans and tshirt and thought he was just plain yummy now clad only in his board shorts she could hardly keep her eyes off him lean and tanned every muscle delineated he was a doctor for heavens sake he must spend his life indoors where had he got those muscles he was scaring her not only because of what hed suggested yesterdaythat he take zoe away not only because of his effect on zoe but because of his effect on her mathew had been dead for four years now her friends told her it was time to move on shed never had the slightest urge to move on until right now and nowwhat her body was telling her what her hormones were telling her felt like a betrayal mathew mathew mathew she murmured over and over and because zoe was perfectly safe with her big cousin because stefanoss sole desire seemed to be to make the little girl laugh she left them to it stroking strongly out across the entrance to the cove she put her head down and swam as she never swam for it wasnt safe to do this when no one was here to watch zoe shed always gloried in swimming it was her quiet time her time of peace she was swimming now hoping her head could settle so her jumbled thoughts could somehow untangle so she could find the strength to stand up to this unknown prince and his terrifying charm she lost track of time she swam and swam and finally when she raised her head she realised zoe and stefanos were out of the water standing on the beach and watching her and that felt strange too that this man was watching her she caught a wave back to the beach surfing in with the agility shed always gloried in the sea had always been her escape it could be again she thought if the worst happened if he took zoe away they strolled down the beach to meet her her wave washed her into the shallows she wiped her eyes and looked up to find stefanos standing above her smiling holding out his hand to tug her up she nearly didnt take it she was so disconcerted but thatd be petty zoe was standing beside him beaming waiting for her to stand she took his hand he tugged her up and she came up too fast she stumbled and he steadied her which was a tiny gestureprince steadies elsaand why the feel of his hands on her waist should have the power to totally disconcert her she didnt know youre beautiful he said and she was disconcerted all over again do you she fought for breath and took a while finding it do you mind im only speaking the truth right she said and headed up the beach fast she grabbed her towel and disappeared underneath at least here she could get her face under control beautiful matty had thought she was beautiful until then no one after him no one she wasnt even wearing a bathing suit neither she nor zoe did they both wore shorts and tshirts itd be unfair for her to wear pretty bathers when zoe had to wear scarcovering clothes and she had scars herselfnothing like zoes but bad enough and besides she thought grimly she was mousy shed always been mousy and she always would be mousy mathew had thought she was beautiful because hed fallen in love with her mind hed been academically brilliant and hed loved that she could keep up with him her intelligence was a turn on but her body not so much that hed ever said beauty was in the eye of the beholder and in mathews eyes she was his brilliant wife matty dammit why wasnt he here andwhy was he starting to fade it was terrifying that when she thought of him now the image that came straight to mind was the photograph on the mantel photographs were becoming the reality and reality moved on whether she willed it or not all this she thought under her towel all this she thought while she rubbed her hair dry zoe and i think your hair will dry faster in the sun his voice made her jump theyd followed her up the beach youre not being paranoid she demanded of herself and she knew that she was its lunch time zoe said puzzled you never take this long to dry your hair and i never have a prince of the blood waiting to see when ill come out from my towel she thought but what the heck there was no choice she emerged she wrapped her towel around her hair and she checked on zoe another surprise she was wrapped sarongstyle in her towel youre dry stefanos dried me she said and he was really careful of my scars once again a jolt here was another adult with the responsibility and skills to help her look after this injured child if he lived down the road shed welcome him with open arms he lived on the diamond isles khryseis a world away from her world lunch he said smiling at her and there was a trace of sympathy in his smile that said he understood her turmoil he couldnt help it he couldnt stop it but he understood how could you understand she thought youre not having her youre not what had he said theres nothing to be afraid of did she believe him no way lunch was the same as yesterday only zoe ate more without being prodded then stefanos disappeared to his car and returned with a box cherries shed seen them in the shops last week theyd been twenty dollars a small box and theyd still been hard not fully ripened these were almost the size of golf balls deep burgundy shining and luscious stefanos was looking smugdeeply pleased with the fact that her jaw and zoes jaw had dropped to somewhere round their ankles the concierge at my hotel knows someone who flies up here from wherever cherries grow he told them theyre hot off the plane twenty dollars wouldnt pay for transport from the airport elsa thought how much had these cost theyre not to be wasted he said severely and zoe needed no further prodding she popped one into her mouth really fast theyre not just for eating he told her lifting two pairs of cherries each pair joined at the stem and looping them over zoes ears cherry earrings are my favourite accessory you wear them too zoe said and he promptly did a prince was sitting at her kitchen table wearing cherry earrings her foundations were getting shaky have a cherry he said kindly they go off fast i hear not in range of us they dont she said and ate a cherry and then another and thenwhy notanother im up to nine already zoe crowed zoe was showered and shiny clean her face was flushed with pleasure and she was popping cherries in with an enjoyment elsa had never seen for four long years for operation after operation this little girl had been cheated of her childhood and nowstefanos had arrived and joy was flooding in without warning tendrils of fear wound their way round her heart yet again but this time it was different it wasnt just the fear of zoe being taken away it was stronger maybe stefanos could give zoe a better life than she could if he cared for his little cousin and loved her and made her laughwhat right did she have to stand in his way youre not eating he said gently and draped cherry earrings on her as well there were the cherry familymama cherry papa cherry baby cherry she smiled and ate another cherry but there were icicles forming inside shed only ever wanted what was best for zoe if this was what was best let me show you what else i have in my car he said watching her face he could see her terror she thought this man saw things she didnt want to reveal to anyone maybe it was the man himself who terrified her the most presents zoe said hopefully and he grinned exactly he said coming right up this is exciting zoe said it is she was desperately trying to match zoes pleasure outwardly succeeding inwardly failing and then he was back carrying suitcases one soft blue leather the other pink suitcases a wave of nausea swept over her so strongly that she rose and made a move towards the bathroom stefanos dumped the suitcases and stopped her elsa no he said softly i told you before you have nothing to be afraid of youre taking zoe away she hadnt meant to say it to say it in front of zoe was unforgivable but her terror was too raw too real for her to disguise it i do need to take zoe to khryseis he said still in that gentle reassuring tone that must surely be a learned bedside manner yes we are going to elongate your ears and swap your legs for your arms but trust me im a doctor trust me he said now as zoe rose her panic matching elsas i want to take you both to the diamond isles zoe is the crown princess of khryseis khryseis needs zoe and zoe needs you so i need you both thus im asking if youll both come home with me it was importantreally importantto get her expression right zoe was staring at her and shed seen terror stefanos was zoes cousin this was zoes life not hers she had to get fear off her face and show courage youyou scared me she managed at last and to her relief her voice came out calm i saw the suitcase and i thought you might be wanting zoe to go away today she doesnt even have a passport it will take a few days to get the documentation through his gaze was holding hers zoe i think i frightened elsa he said rueful how can we stop her being scared you could go away elsa thought but she knew zoe wouldnt say that zoe was entranced with her big new cousin and why shouldnt she be stefanos was a prince zoe was a princess and hed pulled zoe onside simply by acting as if the two of them needed to reassure her prince and princess together hey elsa its okay he said and reached to take her hand his hold was strong and firm andreassuring how could touch be reassuring how could his touch warm her when she was so cold she was beginning to shake she should pull away she couldnt does khryseis have a beach zoe asked and elsa knew right then that this was a done deal elsa likes beaches the little girl told her cousin we looked at khryseis on the computer and elsa said she bet there were more fish than we could count and more starfish starfish he said bemused and his hand was still holding hers she should pull it away but how could she how could she find strength to pull from such a touch the real name for starfish is echinoderms or asteroidea zoe was saying importantly they have two stomachs they use one stomach to digest food while the other stomach turns inside out to pull its food in but the really cool thing is that if they lose an arm they can grow another one if i was a starfish i could grow another finger and if you find just one leg of a starfish still joined to just a little bit of its body a whole new starfish can grow how cool is that really cool he said sounding stunned its what me and elsa are working on she told him sounding about twenty years older than her eight years and the internet says khryseis has some really weird starfish she turned to elsa her eyes shining with small girl excitement elsa can we go no she wanted to scream no instead she took a deep breath she tried a tug on her hand but it wasnt released sweetheart maybe we could work things out so you could go she whispered i need to work zoes face fell i cant go without you she said her bottom lip wobbling id be scared so would i elsa thought but once again she held her tongue i need you both to come stefanos said he was watching the two of them focusing as much on elsa as he was on zoe the pressure on her hand remained was he trying to warn her she wondered it didnt feel like that it simply felt as if he was feeding herstrength it was a crazy concept but it seemed the only one that would fit thats why ive brought two suitcases he told them finally he released her hand hed set the suitcases on the floor and he flipped one open from the top he lifted a shiny new laptop computer shed seen these advertised they were wortha tenth of zoes next operation this is for you he told her setting it on the table whether you decide to come or not you work from home why cant that home be on khryseis because there was no because she couldnt think of one apart from the fact that the thought left her terrified she glanced at the mantel mathews face smiled at her steadied her there must be a because because my husband is buried here because this is where my grief is that wasnt a good because because this guy in front of me makes my body react as i dont believe its ever reacted well that was something she needed to dismiss how weak a because was that because id have no control over zoes life because people would stare at her scars because as a royal shed be on display and it could well destroy her here at last were valid reasons but before she could voice them stefanos had lifted parcels onto the table these are for you he said softly to zoe because youre one of the bravest young women ive met because i know how much your bodys hurt over the last four years and i know how beautiful you are inside and out im so sorry i wasnt here for you when your parents died but i am now these are to make you even more beautiful than you already are zoe looked uncertainly at elsaand then tentatively unwrapped the top parcel it was a pink blouse it had tiny buttons shaped like butterflies it had soft puffed sleeves designed to reach zoes elbows a tiny white mandarin collar was designed so the top buttons could stay open but the collar itself would stay high just high enough to hide the scars and there was more elsa had searched for clothes like these as far as her budget could afford it shed even tried making them that was a joke trying to learn dressmaking from an instruction manual to say her attempts had failed was an understatement but after one night stefanos had found these there were three pairs of trousers capri style like long shorts one red and white one a lovely soft blue and one a deeper shade of pink there were four more blouses each with the same soft high collar there were hair ribbons to match and pretty sandals and a couple of dainty bracelets there was an exquisite lilac party dress with white lace and a vast bow at the back it came with a lilac choker with stars embroidered in white within minutes zoe was surrounded by a sea of clothes she looked up at elsa and her eyes were shining theyre beautiful she breathed can i keep them what sort of question was that there was no way she could refuse this gift she just wished so badly it hurt that shed been in a position to give these to her herself they might not fit stefanos warned casting elsa a thoughtful glance and then directing his attention back to zoe i had to guess sizes but ive organised a dressmaker to visit you this evening and let them out or take them in as you need we can change anything tooshe has my authority and my authority elsa whispered i hope youll agree stefanos said gravely and met her gaze and held what was she thinking of course i agree she said shakily she hugged zoe and managed a smile theyre lovely your cousin has been wonderfully generous she bit her lip but youre not my cousin stefanos i cant take the laptop its part of a debt he said softly i owe you so much you owe me nothing i loved christos he was my friend too no he said and suddenly he was almost stern you dont understand christos was my family that i didnt know he was deadthat zoe has been alone for so longit touches my honour im asking you to take this and it doesnt begin to repay the debt i owe you it touches my honourit was a quaint phrase oldfashioned he meant itabsolutely i she took a deep breath if they were going to talk about oldfashionedthen its my honour to care for zoe she said and she tilted her chin zoe is not related to me by blood but im her godmother and her guardian i wont let that go im not asking you to he said evenly im asking for you to give khryseis a chance im asking you to come with zoeas her nanny as well as her guardianand if you do this then you will be paid i want you to help me introduce her to her birthright and then come home without her no zoe said shed been examining her pile of clothes with joy but this wasnt a child who could be bought she looked at the clothes with longing and then pushed them away suddenly panicking i dont want them if i cant have elsa you can have elsa stefanos said evenly im asking you both to come he smiled at elsa ignoring her obvious panic simply smiling at her as if he understood what she was thinking she was being slightly foolish but he wasnt about to threaten her his smile lied she thought desperately this man was a prince about as far from her world as it was possible to be he was accustomed to having his charm work for him he thought now that he simply had to smile and shower gifts and hed get what he wanted do you know what a royal nanny earns he asked and she caught her breath i dont want to know now thats just dumb he said knocking back a fabulous job because you havent heard the terms i rang a couple of friends last night they have nannies in europe and they kindly rang a couple of the top agencies and asked whats the going rate for the best nanny in the world they asked and he gave her a figure she gasped she stared across the table at him and he smiled back at her thats what im offering he said softly starting today she could be paid for doing what she loved caring for zoe but thisthis could never be about money because she did what she did for zoe for love for nothing else elsa zoe needs to come home anyway he said gently im sorry but its not negotiable ive also talked to people here in social services and to lawyers from your family court i have more chance at success in gaining custody than you might think the court would look at what zoe stands to inherit theyd look at the home im prepared to give her the consensus is that she should have the right to learn about khryseis its her heritage he turned to zoe and spread his hands zoe your father was the crown prince of khryseis and youre now the crown princess if you agree id like to show you the place where your papa grew up id like to introduce you to an island that i know youll love to live in a palace thats exciting to see what your fathers life could have been if hed lived im asking elsa to come as well and id like you both to consider khryseis as a place to live he glanced at elsa and then glanced away her emotions were written on her face she thought ill sign legal documents with international legal authorities he said and now he was speaking directly to elsa we need zoe for at least three months a year for ever elsa whispered until zoes old enough to know whether she wishes to accept the crown he said and suddenly he sounded stern its her birthright elsa and neither of us have the right to take that away from her she was close to tearsbut she would not cry not in front of zoe zoe was taking her cues from herto disintegrate on her own behalf would be cruel and he knew what she was thinking hey its not so bad you could think of it as a holiday he took her hands again strong and warm and sure youve been on your own for so long elsa will you let me share she would not cry but the feel of his hands youve been on your own for so long that was what it felt like four long years of fighting to get zoe the medical treatment she needed fighting to keep her own career viable enough to put food on the table fighting to forget the ache in her hip and to stop the grey fog of depression and loneliness taking her over a holiday in khryseis three months a year if she said yes shed lose zoe you wont lose her stefanos said strongly and surely i promise you that ive spent the last eighteen hours finding out exactly what youve done for zoe the money youve spent your own money her eyes flew to his distress gave way to indignation how did you find that out who are you to to enquire i have friends in high places elsa so does zoe now in future shell have the best medical treatment money can buy anger fear anguishthey were a kaleidoscope of her emotions but they should be her emotions not zoes this was zoes future and she must not deny her her own terror had to be put aside what do you think zoe she asked feeling inordinately pleased when she got her voice right stefanos is offering us an initial threemonth holiday on his island while we see what its like its beenits been a shock but i dont think its something we should be scared of his island looks really beautiful on the internet its your island zoe stefanos said gently but firmly so let me get this right elsa said opening the laptop to give her something to look at rather than stefanoss face he saw too much she thought he knew how scared she was and he was sympathetic but still he was determined she couldnt afford to be seduced into doing what was wrong for zoe seduced it was the wrong word but it was the one that popped into her head becausebecause because he was too big and too male and too sexy and shed been alone for far too long it felt dangerous to even be in the same room as him maybe he should be worried she thought dryly if he knew what this scary ridiculous part of her was thinking nanny jumps prince whoa well at least that pulled her out of the fog she decided fighting an almost hysterical desire to laugh maybe she ought to focus on slightly morerealistic issues let me get this straight she said again and watched him smile how much of what she was thinking was obvious to her fury she felt a blush start from the toes up christoszoes papashould have been crown prince of khryseis she managed staring fiercely down at the laptop as if she was totally absorbed in its keyboard how come the king wasnt his father stefanos nodded still serious potted history the diamond isles were principalities for hundreds of years he told her then the prince of sappheiros invaded the other islands and declared himself king subsequent armies kept the islanders under iron rule and his line continued as long as there was a direct male heir six generations later king giorgos died without a son the islands have continued supporting their own royal families even though they havent been able to publicly acknowledge them and now they can take their rightful place giorgoss death meant christos was heir to the throne of khryseis under the old rule men and women inherited equally therefore zoe inherits after christos as her closest adult relative im prince regent until she can take the throne at twentyfive currently the islands being run by a council set up by giorgos theyre corrupt and useless the only way for us to unseat them is for zoe to come home and for us to take over us i was thinking me he said suddenly converting from history lesson to the personal but in the longterm he smiled at her considering maybe you can find a way to be useful as well useful the concept made elsa gasp what was she letting herself in for this manthis princewas moving way too fast and she had no idea where he was going like how and then as he paused as if he wasnt sure how to answer she decided this was deeply scary and a girl had to set some limits can we get some ground rules in place she ventured searching wildly for some way to ground herself employment as a palace nannywhat did she know of such a job what did royal nannies do in the absence of a job description maybe she ought to list her own ground rules he asked quirking one eyebrow again he seemed to be on the verge of laughter and the sensation made her feel crazy no washing no ironing and definitely no scrubbing the stairs on hands and knees she said wildly while he and zoe looked on with astonishment no attending royal banquets and sitting at the bottom of the table where i dont know anyone neither will i wear a calflength uniform with a starched collar and nanny embroidered on the front nor will i curtsey or walk out of zoes presence backwards no shoe shining no but we do still need to go zoe said cutting into a tirade that was gettingwell more than a bit irrational elsa paused she looked at stefanoss hiked eyebrowsboth of them were hiked now his lips were twitching maybe she was being just ever so slightly over the top she struggled for calm hysteria wasnt what was needed she told herself severely nor was treating this as a crazy joke she needed to stay practical and focus on zoeregardless of whether or not stefanos was laughing at her in her short life zoe had faced her parents deaths and then more hospitals and doctors and paramedics and social workers than elsa wanted to think about almost all of them talked over her head it made zoe mad but usually she became quiet and passive not now shed been listening to elsa in astonishment but with an attention more suitable to one twice her age now she turned to stefanos and frowned elsa doesnt have to do all that stuff does she no stefanos said definitely i think elsas been reading too many fairy tales but there really is a palace there really is a palace he said and smiled at her and you really are a princess hed hooked zoe elsa thought frantically just because he had a smile to die for just because he was logical thoughtful and he sounded as if he cared just because he was smiling at zoe now with kindness and also the trace of a challenge convincing her that this could be some sort of magical adventure he was glancing at her with a quizzical look that was kind as well as knowing how could he be kind what did she know of the man what did she know about the island whatwhat medical facilities are on the island she managed trying valiantly to sound grownup sensible and in control or at least as grownup sensible and in control as zoe zoe will have me to care for her he told her matching her tone and theres specialist backup in athens there are no paediatricians on khryseis he hesitated education has hardly been king giorgoss concern he admitted at last in fact hes actively discouraged it even i havent been able to work there giorgos wouldnt permit me to practice medicine on khryseis so ive built my career elsewhere there are no medical facilities at all she asked incredulously theres one elderly doctor and a midwife up until now the fishermen have taken really ill islanders to athens youre kidding me sadly no andand now and now we go back to the island and think about the future from there youll get more medical staff thats one of my first priorities the islands not big enough to support a huge range of specialties but there will be good basic medicine with fast transfers to athens at need he hesitated elsa you will be looked after he said gently but strongly you both will so no elsa you will not be asked to scrub stairs or polish silver youll be on the island as zoes friend and as her nanny for as long as you wish to stay ill ask nothing more of you this isnt a trap elsa i promise you no strings his face broke into another of his magical smiles our islands lovely elsa zoe we can work things out the three of us please his smile caught her and held demanding a response how could she resist an appeal like this and despite her fears a tiny trickle of excitement crept in she had no idea where this man was coming fromor where he was goingbut his smile was mesmerising and as well as that she and zoe had eaten sandwiches for lunch almost every day for four years shed had to chop wood to cook and to heat their water woodchopping jarred her hip so much that sometimes it was hard not to just give in but there was never the choice of giving in but nowstefanos was offering them a home in a palace on an island in the mediterranean he was offering her a wellpaid job shed have no more money worries no woodchopping did he realise how enticing it sounded this man might appear seriously sexy but right now it was the lack of woodchopping that was more seductive i do need to keep my research skills up she muttered fighting to sound practical and reserved and wary of course i see you doing the same things youre doing now with zoe homeschooling we can get a tutor zoe youll need to learn greek i already know greek zoe said proudly you already know christos spoke greek to her as a baby elsa told him feeling a bit smug herself as she noted his astonishment we figured it was part of who she was so weve kept it up elsa speaks it now too zoe added and we both read it there are two old greek ladies in waratah cove we visit them once a week and talk with them and elsa does their shopping and says its payment for our lessons if we went away id miss them her face clouded and the cats how can we go away without our cats yeah the cats elsa said as if it was a challenge he grinned at that thats one more thing fixed zoe open the blue suitcase she opened it fascinated to display cat food bulk cat food a suitcase of cat food so were supposed to open the suitcase and come home when they need a refill elsa said and she couldnt help sounding waspish thats fixed too he said his grin teasing her to smile with him theres a guy who works round here tending gardens doing odd jobs ive arranged for him to visit every night at dusk feed the cats lock them up then let them out at dawn in perpetuity and if any other stray comes along then hes to do exactly what youd do take it in get it neutered tell it the house rules he can even do your two greek ladies shopping if you want nowany more objections mymy house elsa stammered i told you he does gardens and odd jobs hell maintain this place as long as we want you found this guy when the concierge at the hotel earned his keep last night he said and grinned again he brought his wife in to help his wife knows you and knows what you need so there you go local knowledge and my cash yeah your cash she said breathless we cant take it see what you dont understand is that you can he said zoes a princess youre nanny to a princess are there any other problems the medical facilities ill be there and as i said there are fast flights to athens until we get other medical facilities organised we can cope he took her hand again and held and with his other hand he took zoes khryseis needs a team he said a royal team prince regent princess zoe and nanny elsa do we have it yes zoe said there were no arguments left the only one that was still swirling round and round in her mind was i dont want to be a nanny to your prince but that was dumb she glanced at the mantel where matt still smiled definitely it was dumb he glanced to where shed looked saw what shed been looking at didnt ask a question itll be fine he said softly and the pressure on her hand strengthened then before she knew what he was about he put his hand under her chin and tilted itand kissed her it was a featherlight kiss quickly over and why it had the capacity to make her feelmake her feel no she had to stop thinking about how it made her feel because that was nonsense but his hand was still under her chin forcing her to meet his gaze i will keep you safe he said strongly and surely and zoe too youve worked too hard for too long elsa murdoch now its up to zoe and me to see you have some fun just say yes and what else was she to do i guessyes she managed but she didnt add yes your royal highness because that would be agreeing to all of it the whole royal fairy tale ridiculous chapter six two weeks later they left australia luxuriating in first class seats on a direct flight to athens to be followed by a smaller plane to khryseis ill be on khryseis to meet you stefanos had said in one of the scores of calls hed made since then but our people will take care of you all the way they hadnt seen him since that fateful lunch hed had to leave things are chaotic hed said i need to get back to the island straight away but i promise i wont let that disorder touch you it wasnt touching them now they were in first class airline seats they had a cocoon each with every conceivable gadget including one that turned the seats into beds at the flick of a switch a hostess had already made zoes bed for her with crisp linen and fluffy duvet and she was fast asleep elsa was staring out of the window and seeing what was probably hawaii she was trying not to gibber shed been on one overseas flight in her life to tasmania she didnt remember all that many gadgets and duvets and cocoons on that flight she remembered being served a packet of nuts and a warm beer she was about to be a nanny to a princess the princess was bone weary her little body still wasnt up to strength the last weeks had been excitement plus and elsa had worried about the wisdom of letting her go at all but its imperative stefanos had said in his deep grave voice and dumb or not she believed him if zoe wasnt there he had no power to replace the council he had no power to stop the corruption he told her was endemic so once again why rail against something she had no control over now as zoe snuggled into sleep she thought with this level of luxury maybe her little charge could enjoy herself maybe she could enjoy herself amazingly her hip wasnt hurting normally sitting for more than a couple of hours made it ache unbearably but her hip obviously decided it liked first class treatment thank you very much and it wasnt only her hip thinking it she was on her way to live in a castle as a nanny a nanny she reminded herself a paid servant shed get to eat in the servants quarters while zoe ate in state shed use chipped pottery while zoe swanned round in party dresses using cutglass crystal and silverware attended by butlers andand whatever else royalty had umthis was zoe she was talking about maybe she couldnt see that happening and tucked in her bag was a document prepared by stefanoss legal team read from all angles by her local lawyer and then faxed to a team of international lawyers in canberra for a final check the document said that if at any time zoe seemed so distressed that it was damaging her mental or physical healthand that decision was to be made by a team of independent australian medical experts flown out at stefanoss expensethen zoes fare back to australia would be paid immediately and so would hers so maybe itd work butshe was a marine biologist not a nanny stefanos had promised her starfish yeah great she shoved that thought as far back in her head as she could shed like to be rid of it completelythe ache to follow her own dreams but zoe came first zoe was more important than dreams and maybe those dreams could still be resurrected if zoe was unhappy theyd come home catch she didnt want zoe to be unhappy but we can make it a game shed whispered to zoe as shed watched her little charge drift towards sleep you being a princess in a castle with a prince zoe had said sleepily isnt he nice he is nice elsa admitted umall things considered hes very nice which was why she had to remember that he was a prince and she was a nanny a nanny with a sliver of a career left as a marine biologist who could maybe be happy with starfish certainly a nanny with no interest whatsoever in a prince even if he was as dropdead gorgeous as stefanos especially if he was as dropdead gorgeous as stefanos she closed her eyes two seconds later the hostess was beside her can i make your bed up for you maam here are your pyjamas she handed her a pair of pink silk pyjamas there was a wellknown australian politician sitting in the seat diagonally in front of hershe recognised him from the newspapers he was wearing blue silk pyjamas as he read the financial pages what a shame stefanos wasnt with them she thought hed look really cute in blue pyjamas see she told herself sternly thats what nannies are paid not to think what are nannies paid to think not about lost careers not about lost dreams and not about dropdead gorgeous prince regents stefanos paced the palace balcony and waited for them feeling ridiculous the staff were beside themselves with excitement so much so that hed given in and done the dressup thing again hed done it twice now once in australia at the formal reception and again today hopefully there wouldnt be too many more occasions where he had to feel so ridiculous but maybe there would be this whole situation was crazy he told himself for maybe the thousandth time since hed heard the news of christoss death he was automatically prince regentisland ruler until zoe turned twentyfivebut although the regency gave him some powers the thing he wanted most was denied to him he wanted the island to be a democracy but as regent he had no power to change the constitution democracy would have to wait for zoe to turn twentyfive since he was a kid hed dreamed of khryseis being a great and wonderful place to live but nowhed fallen in love with his medicine he was good at his job his research was vitally important and he loved what he did what could he do here but tinker round the edges protect the islanders from the worst of the excesses theyd endured in the past thenwhattry and remember his general medicine so he could treat the islanders minor ailments until zoe came of age in what seventeen years then hed go tamely back to the states and pick up where hed left off to a career that was waiting for him yeah and pigs would fly he had no choice he had to care for the island he had to care for zoe and elsa she needed care as much as zoe he thought elsa had stood up to him with the air of a battered warrior a woman accustomed to having her world shift and accepting those shifts with as much dignity and grace as she could muster hed seen how much the thought of losing zoe terrified her but once shed realised how needful it was shed simply got on with it he had the feeling that even if he hadnt offered her a generous salary shed still be doing exactly what she was doing taking care of zoe no matter what life threw at her what had life thrown at her he needed to find out more about herand her husband why was he no longer on the scene she still wore a wedding ring umwhy was that relevant he should have found out his enquiries had been professional it had seemed wrong to pry but he wanted to know he did already know some things for oneshe seemed loving for some dumb reason that phrase had been playing in his head since hed met her her fierce devotion to zoe was touching something in him that hed learned to ignore a long time ago he didnt do emotion since hed left this island as a teenager hed been totally committed to his medicine yet here he was not only realising hed have to abandon the work he was passionate about but in the stillness of the night as he lay trying to find a way he could sort all his commitments alexandross idle teasing kept rising up to taunt him wife family no he remembered the horror of his fathers death and his mothers anguish as shed insisted he take a scholarship to the us to keep him safe he remembered grief and homesickness and his mothers death had cemented his knowledge that love caused nothing but pain work had been his salvation then as it could be his salvation nowwhether or not it was the work he desperately wanted to do if you please a delicate cough sounded behind him and he jumped a foot the old palace butler moved like a cat one of these days the old guy was going to give him a heart attack he turned and tried to look as if he hadnt had a fright yes i believe theyve arrived sir the old man said gravely he glanced out at the magnificent formal driveway an ancient rollsroyce was proceeding in state down the avenue the flag of khryseis flying proudly from the grille the butler was beaming with pride and anticipation that was what this was all about stefanos thought grimly giving the islanders back their identity which was why he was wearing this ridiculous uniform but there were other imperatives hammering at him back in new york he had a surgical list still waiting he couldnt let those kids down hed have to return before he could finally commit himself to this place the car had pulled to a halt and the driver stepped out he must be eighty as wellhalf the retainers in this household were in their dotagebut like most of the staff he was also wearing the imposing uniform of the khryseis royal household since giorgoss death since the islanders had discovered they could revert to their own royal family the excitement had been building the isle of sappheiros now had its own royal family in its palace so did the isle of argyros khryseis the smallest of the islands was last to revert to rule by its original royal family and the islanders were looking to stefanos to make this good and they were also looking to this one little girl coming home a child who must be protected at least he could share that responsibility he thought once more feeling grateful for elsa ruling the island might be his duty but with elsa here he didnt need to commit emotionally if he kept zoe safe and her nanny happy then that was the extent of his obligations the crown princess was loved by a woman called elsa which meant the love bit could be shelved as not his business elsa and zoe climbed from the rollsroyce and if they werent quite clutching each other they came awfully close this is really scary zoe whispered and elsa couldnt agree more it was a palace a real honest to goodness palace vast and ancient turrets battlements spires and flags vast entrance steps and grecian columns all set against a magical backdropsapphire seas golden beaches white cliffs with mountains in the background internet pages theyd read had told them that khryseis was the most impoverished of the three diamond isles but once it had been fabulously wealthy this palace backed it up elsa had never seen a building so fantastic or big i hope we dont have to dust and hoover it she whispered to zoe and zoe giggled the tension eased only then stefanos strode out of the vast front entrance and the tension zoomed back again ooo er elsa muttered and zoe clutched her hand and gave another shaky giggle striding down the great granite steps towards them stefanos looked like something out of history romantic history hes a real prince again do you think he wears a sword zoe whispered awed hey he is elsa said as he got closer and they could see the great golden hilt emerging from its scabbard be good zoe its only stefanos he wont hurt us zoe said and it was the child who was trying to reassure the adult some nanny she made elsa thought telling her charge to be scared actually she wasnt a great nanny at all she looked down at her scuffed trainersshed needed comfy shoes for the flight and these were all she had for the last four years shed lived in jeans and sweatshirts if her royal duties demanded better clothes theyd need to wait until pay day zoe however looked beautiful in her sparkly new clothes her dark curls held back with diamanté butterfly clips her pretty blue sandals adorned with butterflies she looked every inch a child of royalty underneath her carefully chosen clothes were scars which were still healing but her new clothes hid them and gave her confidence as this man coming towards them was giving her excitement im going to be a princess she whispered and im going to be a nanny elsa whispered back stefanos said we could still look for starfish the child said picking up on her nerves and amazingly trying to reassure her he did didnt he elsa said and fought for a bit more backbonethe courage to pin a cheerful smile in place and turn to greet her employer what in the world was she doing here and why did the sight of the man strolling towards her make her knees feel as if they were turning to jelly welcome to khryseis princess zoe stefanos strode towards them and he greeted zoe first he took her hands and stooped to kiss her cheeks it might be a normal greek greeting but here now it seemed a truly royal gesture zoe looked suitably amazed im not a real princess she told him as if admitting a falsehood you are stefanos said gently your father was the crown prince christos and youre his daughter this is where you belong its a really big palace it is elsa says we might have to dust and hoover she ventured and stefanos turned to elsa and his dark eyes lit with laughter welcome to you too he said and it was her turn to have her hands grasped and her cheek kissed was this the way royalty greeted nannies i promise you no hooveringand im so glad you decided to come whew this was a formal gesture she told herself wildly hed kissed her cheek and smiled at her why that had the capacity to make her insides melt shed been isolated for too long she was starting to feellike she had no business in the world feeling zoe was never coming alone she managed no he said but something in his tone said that such a concept wasnt unthinkable shell be so much happier with you sheshe will it was really hard to breathe while he was smiling at herwhile he was so closebut she had to start as she meant to go on and thank you for making us feel right at home by the way sorry by wearing your casual gear she said and managed to smile it makes me feel ill fit right in his eyes met hers laughter meeting laughter but he couldnt respond how he wished he was aware their conversation was being listened to even if she wasnt there were only three staff members within sight but every window was open and the palace curtains were inched back enough to allow the servants to hear hed deliberately not lined the staff up to meet zoe but the islanders desperate need for a new royal family had to be met would you like to see your bedrooms he asked them both umbedrooms elsa said plural i want to stay with elsa zoe said urgently and stefanos smiled a reassurance i dont blame you come and see what weve organised youll need to meet a couple of people first the housekeeper the butler well leave the rest of the staff for you to meet tomorrow oh goody elsa whispered and stefanos smiled in sympathy theres a photo shoot here after lunch he added apologetically christos was well loved on the island and theres huge interest and pleasure that his child is coming home to ban all photographers would have had cameramen scaling walls so ive permitted a representative from each of the islands media outlets you have more than one elsa said incredulous its not a complete backwater he said gently and she flushed you have multimedia outlets and you have only one doctor i knowpriorities that need fixing they will be fixed but i havent managed everything in two weeks he took zoes hand and grinned down at her encouragingly you want to see your bedroom you have a fourposter bed with curtains yes please zoe said breathlessly she turned with him and they headed up the grand entrance steps leaving elsa to follow im the nanny she told herself trying not to feel bereft and hopelessly out of her comfort zone staying in the background is what im supposed to do stefanos and zoe reached the top step and paused looking back to her they looked fabulous she thought prince regent and his crown princess zoe looked lit up like a fairy on top of a christmas tree holding her big cousins hand with confidence are you coming stefanos said gently she met his gaze and realised that once again hed guessed how she was feeling zoe still needed her she thought wildly she wasnt being put out to pasture yet im coming she called the chauffeur was lifting their bags out of the boot and she grabbed the top one the heaviest leave that to the staff stefanos told her im the staff she said determinedly and to her amazement he chuckled i dont think so he said i expect the staff to conform to a certain standard in their uniform i need to tell you that your standard falls a long way short until we can get you outfitted as befits your statusas a friend of the crown princess then his tone became gentle and the laughter faded youve worked hard already he said looking down at her from the top step and he spoke loudly and clearly enough for his voice to carry into all those open windows youve cared for my little cousinfor our crown princesswith all the love at your disposal it would be my honour to grant you a holiday for as long as you want your nominal title is nanny to zoe but my command to you personallyto you bothis to have fun chapter seven their apartments were stunningtwo apartments with an adjoining door rooms almost big enough to house a tennis court theyre built for the crown prince and crown princess stefanos told them while zoe and elsa stared in incredulity this is something out of a museum elsa murmured you know the ones i mean this is the bed where charles the first spent the night before the great wiggery foppery of seventeen sixtytwo the great wiggery foppery stefanos asked bemused or maybe it was the great gunfire pirouette with catherine wheels she told him desperately striving for humour in the face of splendour that was just plain intimidating im australian so my knowledge of royalty is distinctly hazy but my grandma had a book on bedrooms of the world i read it when i was seven and i had chickenpox they all had descriptions like queen anne had dropsy in this very bed and threw up on this very pillow and no dont ask me what dropsy is are we really going to sleep in here while elsa was covering her nerves with nonsense zoe was awed into hushed delight theyve changed the sheets since the great dropsy plague stefanos said gravely i think it might be safe to sleep in them again zoe giggled which was the whole point of the exercise elsa reminded herself if she could keep zoe giggling but for how long well sleep in this one zoe said and proceeded to clamber up onto what was surely intended as the crown princes bed it was vast with four golden posts a golden canopy and rich burgundy curtains drawn back with gold tassels then elsa will sleep in the other one stefanos said motioning through the open door to a bedroom almost as large and a bed almost as luxurious the giggling stopped zoes bottom lip trembled no she said this is too big by myself we sleep in the same room at home why cant we sleep in the same room here we can elsa said theres no need to worry prince stefanos though well fix it youve been sharing a room with zoe stefanos asked i have she met his gaze with open defiance so you had only one bedroom in that little cottage zoe has nightmares she said even if we had ten bedrooms we wouldnt use them im not sure the staff will approve of a trundle bed in here theyre wanting zoe to be real royalty so zoe gets the fourposter and i get a trundle there needs to be some delineation im her friend and her guardian yes and her nanny so i am she said figuring that here was a line in the sandher first test zoe would not be made to suffer from the demands of royalty so its back to the trundle zoe will not sleep alone i dont like alone zoe said relaxing now she was sure elsa was on her side well sort it out stefanos went on in a voice that said this issue wouldnt go away if you think leave it he said and she met his gaze headon zoe take a look at the beach zoe lookedwhile elsa met stefanoss gaze and held he smiled at her and she thought dont you dare you smile at me and you think you can get away with murder the scary thing was that she suspected he could look at the beach elsa he said gently and she tore her gaze away from his and looked the palace gardens led down to a wide stretch of golden sand a cove of shallow water and low rolling waves wow zoe breathed can we swim as soon as youre settled he hesitated watching elsa who forced her thoughts back to beds if he thought he could get his own way simply by smilingshe took a deep breath and started to form a cogent argument about trundle beds but hed moved on lunch is in half an hour he told them well organise the beds later meanwhile ill leave you to get settled the butler will let you know when lunch is ready and hell show you the way cant we just come down in half an hour elsa asked youd get lost he told her and there was that smile again and now we have you both here we dont intend to lose you make yourselves at home and ill see you at lunch he went out elsa was left with confusion an unaccountable fear and the knowledge that the room was bleaker for his going what was it about the man in his presence she felt about the same age as zoe this was crazy it was just his uniform she told herself the fairy tale bit he looked soroyal stefanos said were getting our photos taken after lunch zoe ventured looking worried should i wear something pretty you look very pretty right now she said and gave the little girl a swift hug a hug she needed just as much as zoe but maybe we can find you something even prettier what about your new dress they came down to lunch looking nervous zoe was wideeyed with wonder clutching elsas hand as if it were a lifelinebut she wasnt subdued stefanos thought as he watched them walk down the stairs towards him she looked like a little girl about to go to a birthday party where she didnt know anyone it was a bit scary but it might turn out to be fun elsa on the other hand looked nervous in a different way it was as if she was nervous of her royal surroundings more she was nervous of him she was still wearing jeans and sweatshirt zoe was in the most extravagant of the clothes hed bought for herher beautiful party dress beside her elsa looked subdued she looked even more subdued when she saw him waiting for them at the foot of the stairs it was this uniform he thought regretfully it was enough to scare him after the media call he could take it off but until then he had to be a prince so he was a prince zoe was a princess elsa looked as if she didnt want to be here at all and she was still limping he hadnt noticed when shed arrived but watching her coming down the stairs he saw it again she was holding the balustrade with her spare hand and doing her best to disguise it but she was being careful the way she swung her left leg forwardthere wasnt full movement in her hip and it looked as if coming downstairs hurt last time hed seen her hed seen the faintest trace of a limp shed brushed it aside when hed enquired and hed had so much on his mind then that to assume it was a temporary sprain had been the easiest option now thoughthere was a lot he had to find out about this woman like what was the damage with her leg like why she was coming to lunch and a media call in faded jeans and sweatshirt looking scared up until now he would have described her as spirited and feisty what was it about this place that was sucking the spirited and feisty out of her he glanced up at the massive chandelier above his headtwo thousand crystals the housekeeper had told him and he didnt doubt it for a minuteand he thought whats oppressive about this he smiled at them and zoe let go of elsas hand and bounced down the last few steps to greet him she gazed up at the chandelier and breathed deeply in small girl satisfaction its really really beautiful she said so are you he told her and she giggled he glanced at elsaand caught her unawares there was a wash of pure unmitigated pain on her face it was gone as soon as it had come quickly turned into a smile but he knew he wasnt mistaken were hungry she said a trifle too fast and he thought she was still in defence mode excellent he said in fact more than excellent when you see whats in front of us he led the way into the dining room and paused at the door smiling down to zoe again this is a welcome lunch for you he said gently specially made by everyone who works here and it wasa feast that promised a small girls heaven the delicate finger food looked as if it had been designed to tempt and tantalise a little girls appetite there were tiny cheesy biscuits in the shape of animals fingersized sausage rolls chicken wings with tiny chefhat wrappers around their tips so a small hand wouldnt get greasy strawberries and grapes and slivers of watermelon tiny chocolate cakes with a dusting of sugar miniature sponge cakes with the tops turned into wings and fixed in place with a mix of red jelly and cream petite eclairs with creamy custard filling around them the room was a mass of fresh cut flowers a wondrous fantasy feast of beauty and pure delight zoe sat down and gazed at the table in awe elsa wont have to tell me to eat here she breathed thats what we hoped he said and glanced at elsa againand got that look again raw pain you dont approve he asked and she caught herself and managed to smile but her smile was strained she was having trouble disguising how hard it was to summon it at all its wonderful she said so why do you look unhappy he asked gently elsas a bit sad cause she hasnt got any pretty clothes zoe said and popped a strawberry into her mouthand then looked mortified she swallowed it manfully and looked even more guilty isis it okay to start absolutely its okay to start stefanos said and handed over the sausage rolls zoe took twoand then looked at how small they were and took another thank you very much she breathed and stefanos glanced at the door he knew at least six members of staff were behind there holding their breath that shed like their offering that shed be a kind child that she could be a princess to be proud of she was all of those things he thought and it was thanks to elsa elsa who didnt have pretty things to wear so you dont have any dresses he probed and she cast him a glance that was almost resentful i didnt bring any and im not sad because of that its justim just a bit overwhelmed you mean yesterday there was just you loving zoe he said gently and now theres me and a palace full of staff and an island ready to love her its crazy to think like that she said but she did so back to the clothes he said gently can i ask why theres nothing but jeans im a marine biologist why would i need dresses there was a loaded silence zoe ate two sausage rolls and a strawberry and then thought about what elsa had said and decided she might add her pennyworth elsa did have pretty clothes the child told him considering an eclair only she got too skinny and they looked funny on her we kept them for ages but then she said you know what zoe im never going to be this size again they might as well make someone else happy so we packed them up and took them to a church fair and mrs henniker bought elsas prettiest yellow dress and she looked awful in it and elsa cried i did not elsa said fighting for dignity i had hay fever you only get hay fever when you cry zoe said wisely giving your clothes away made you really sad the bond between these two was amazing up until now hed thought it was elsa who did all the giving suddenly a new view was opening up zoe was eight going on thirty elsa wassometimes ninety sometimes a kid she was trying for indignant here but it wasnt coming off zoe had exposed her and she knew she was exposed why did you lose weight i stopped eating for a while she told him in a voice that said no more questions were welcome ive started again we might need to buy you some clothes he said and watched as vulnerability disappeared to be replaced by indignation you dont need to buy me anything i like my jeans i like your jeans too he saidand he did they were exceedingly cute mind she could do with a bit more flesh on her frame she was almost elfin and that limp what happened to your leg he asked and got another scared look pleasejust leave it im here to be with zoe while she gets to know the country her papa came from i intend to stay in the background can we leave it at that he considered her gravely and shook his head zoe whats wrong with elsas leg he heard her gasp he didnt look at her this woman had cared for zoe for four years if hed known of christoss death he would have been there for his little cousin the responsibility was his but he hadnt even known of zoes existence that hurt on all sorts of levels and one of those levels was the fact that this woman seemed to have put her life on hold for zoeand it might be worse than that hed watched her come down the stairs and realised this was no twisted ankle she was protecting her hipas shed been protecting her hip two weeks ago on the beach but hed been too preoccupied to see it she hurt it when my mama and papa died zoe said not picking up on the undercurrents she was back considering food this meal was a huge success he could practically hear the chefs sigh of happiness from here are you going to tell me how badly he asked elsa i broke my hip she said discouragingly you were in the car accident with zoes parents yes and your husbandhe hadnt put two and two together but he did now and he didnt like it elsas matty was killed too zoe said and she was suddenly grave and mature and factual my mama and papa were in the front seat and matty and elsa and me were in the back a great big truck came round the corner on the wrong side of the road and hit our camper van and our camper van started to burn elsa pulled me out but she couldnt pull anyone else out we were both really really sad i was in hospital for a long timei can hardly rememberbut i do remember elsa coming in a wheelchair to see me she says my grandma came to see me too but i cant remember that i remember being in a bath a lot and crying but elsa was always there and then my grandma got sick so elsa took me home with herand now were living happily ever after she was suddenly back to being a little girl again happy and optimistic only this is a better place for happy ever after isnt it elsa there was nothing wrong with my beach elsa said making an unsuccessful attempt to glower and zoe giggled as if shed said something silly no but our beach doesnt have cream puffs these are really good can i have another one please be my guest stefanos said and he handed her the platebut his eyes were on elsa so why are you still limping and once again it was zoe who answered mr roberts says she should have another operation mr roberts came to see elsa last time i was in hospital and he said when are we going to fix that hip young lady and elsa said when i have the time and the money and like thats going to happen soon and mr roberts said she had to get her piher priorities right and she said she did zoe dont elsa said looking desperate please sweetheart this is nothing to do with prince stefanos no but hes nice zoe said as if that excused everything can i have one of those cakey things with wings please what would happen if she just got up from the table walked right out of here straight to the ferry then on a plane back to australia she had a return ticket that was one of her stipulations about coming it was a first class ticket if she traded it for economy shed have enough to live on until she could start back to work zoe didnt need her only of course zoe did she looked happy and contented but shed been here for less than a day she was still clutching her she was happy because this was exciting and stefanos was kind and the rest big and too goodlooking for his own goodand did he know how sexy he looked in that uniform he was doing her head in and her head had to stay intact she had to stay practical she needed to find a role for herself here that wasnt tied to zoe or stefanos or the palace she could do this she thought she just had to stay detached from stefanos and his dangerous charm this man was important to her only in his relationship to zoe he was good to zoe he made the little girl laugh but he hadnt gained so much trust that elsa could walk away she didnt ever want to walk away not from zoe the thought hurt on so many levels that the pain in her hip didnt even register in comparison what are you thinking stefanos asked watching her quizzically from the head of the table to make you look like that inothing i dont think ive been appropriately sympathetic i dont know what appropriate sympathy is neither do i he said softly but if it helped id find it for you see there was the whole problem she had so much going on in her headhow to fit in herewhat she was going to do with herself while zoe settledhow she was going to make a life for herself after zoe stopped needing her as stop she surely wouldand across it all was stefanoss gorgeous smile the way his dark eyes creased at the corners the way he seemed to read her mind he left them for a while as she drank coffee urgent royal business he said and that made her even more nervous by the time he returned she was climbing the walls you dont need me for this she said and pushed her chair back zoe are you okay to do this photo thing withwith your cousin ill go up to the bedroom and unpack no zoe was out of her chair in a flash darting round the table to grab her hand you have to come with me not so settled then neither would she be she thought if someone told her she had to meet the press ive arranged for elsa to come with us stefanos told zoe and her heart hit her boots excuse me ive promised the press they can meet zoe and you and me youre the woman whos been caring for our crown princess for the past four years he said steadily the islanders would have taken zoe to them in a heartbeat all of us owe you a debt that touches our honour he rose and held out a hand to zoe and the little girl hesitated for a moment and then gave him hers it was that sort of gesture strong sure commanding royal if zoes brave enough to have her photograph taken surely you can he told her yes but zoes a princess she said on a wail look at me im not even a proper nanny youre not he agreed youre our friend and as our friend he hesitated elsa giving zoe clothes seemed appropriate for you however it seems almost insulting and i ask you to accept that its not my intention to insult you nevertheless ive made some fast phone calls and the owners of our two main dress shops are here already setting out a selection of clothes for zoes coronation youll need evening wear and we cant get that here but for nowit would please me if you could choose something more suitable than jeans and sweatshirt for your introduction to our island she stared at him in stupefaction you want me to buy clothes i want you to take the clothes that i will buy for you he said this will be my pleasure to dress me his eyes creased involuntarily into laughter i dont think were quite there yet she stared at him feeling a tide of colour sweep upward exexcuse me levity he murmured obviously fighting to get back to being serious you need to excuse me but this is clothes elsa no big deal i wear jeans zoe says you dont not before the accident im a whole new me since the accident then is it possible he said gently that you can be a whole new you again i please elsa she stared down at her battered sneakers her worn jeans they were like her skin she thought yet another skin she was being asked to change povertystricken single mother to royal childminder single woman to wife eager student to earnest professional married woman to grieving widow skins skins skins she hardly knew who she was any more what harm could one more change do fine she said your gratitude is overwhelming he murmured and there it was againthat hint of laughter did you like it when they told you that you had to wear a sword she demanded ino then pay me the compliment of allowing that i feel the same she whispered thank you very much for providing clothes i accept and im grateful its justive learned from past experience that it hurts to change direction im doing my best to smile while it happens but youll need to excuse me when my smile falters she chose a simple green sundress zoe and stefanos chose a whole lot more presumably the photographers and journalists had been told to wait for stefanos refused to hurry and was only satisfied when heand zoehad decided she had enough clothes to make herpretty pretty was a strange concept shed stopped worrying about her appearance four years ago now dressed in a lovely light sundress with shoestring straps and a skirt that twirled and swished as she walked she decided there were definite upsides to shedding skins she feltnice free it was a novel experience but it didnt stop her hanging back as she finally followed stefanos and zoe to the palace media centre at the door stefanos stepped back and motioned for elsa to precede him no way she shook her head and dropped deliberately further back and there was no time for him to react the door was open cameras were flashing and questions were flying zoe cast her a panicked backward glance but stefanos lifted her up and held her in his arms it was the best thing he could do elsa thought holding her in his arms zoe would feel totally protected the press was absolutely riveted on zoetheir princess coming home which left her mind free to wander where it willed she kind of liked the way she looked in this sundress and her new sandals were pretty clothes maketh the woman the man her eyes flew back to stefanos she could see why hed decided to wear his uniform but it was more than clothes she thought he looked confident sure in charge he was assuming the mantle of control of this country he had a job to do and hed do it and he held zoe as if she was his own his body language was totally protective and in his arms zoe felt brave enough to venture shy answers of her own responses the media lovedresponses elsa knew would go straight to the heart of any islander the prince and his little princess she watched them pose together she watched stefanos tease zoe into laughter and the weird sensations shed been feeling since the first time shed seen him standing on her beach were consolidating to something firm and definite and true her vision of matty was fading still furthernot disappearing entirely she knew it could never do thatbut fading to a place where he could be mourned without the constant piercing pain that had been with her for years she could be pretty she could change her skin yet again with no betrayal of matty what on earth was she thinking crazy crazy crazy a latecoming journalist jostled past her nudging her out of her introspection hauling her back to reality get back to earth fast she told herself harshly this is one of zoes fairy tales and maybe she ought to listen and may i introduce dr elsa murdoch stefanos was saying and she was suddenly being looked at by everyone in the room doctor she hadnt used that title since its mrs she started but he wasnt allowing her to get a word in elsadr murdochwas in the car crash that claimed prince christoss life stefanos said and his voice was gentle and full of compassion also killed were zoes mother amy and elsas husband mathew zoe still bears the scars physically as well as mentally and so does elsa elsa is a world expert onwhat did you call starfish zoe echinoderms zoe volunteered stefanos was still holding her tightly and she obviously felt confident enough to answer or asteroidea she added with aplomb thats the one stefanos said encouragingly so for the last four years dr murdoch and zoe have been conducting echinodermor asteroidearesearch while theyve gradually healed from their injuries dr murdoch has cared for zoe with total love and commitment and for that this country owes her an enormous debt of gratitude hey she said startled enough to forget nerves and reply with spirit that sounds like youre about to give me a gold watch and a pension you deserve much much more than that he said smiling im hoping dr murdoch can stay here he told the reporters im hoping shell be a constant presence in zoes life i need to be away from the island for a few weeks between now and christmasthere are ends i need to tie off before i can stay here permanentlybut zoe and i hope elsa will be happy here for ever and her tingle of humour and enjoyment disappeared just like that whoa what was he saying that she and zoe would be staying but he was leaving i need to be away from the island he was planning on coming and going at will whilewhat had he saidzoe and i hope elsa will be happy here for ever she stayed rooted to the spot while more questions were aimed at stefanos was his work still important to him how committed to the island could he be if he was returning to the states exactly how much time would he stay here and would he still play a ceremonial role you know im a neurosurgeon he was explaining to the press but of course theres work for me to do here now medical as well as political however there are commitments to be honoured in the states before i can take on a permanent role this was never in the contract she thought wildly he was leaving stefanos was fielding the final questions he was saying hed be here until the coronation and then hed return by christmas he was intending to get the council sorted within the week she was no longer listening he was leaving hed organised her to wear a sundress while he wore a sword the way she was suddenly feeling maybe she needed a sword as well chapter eight the media session had taken its toll on zoe jet lag and excitement had finally caught up with her as the last of the reporters left the little girl almost visibly drooped come on sweetheart lets get you up to bed elsa said as stefanos brought zoe back to her she carefully didnt look at stefanos the things she needed to say to this man couldnt be said in front of zoe in fact maybe they needed a soundproofed room im thinking you need a carriage your highness stefanos said grandly and scooped the little girl up again and carried her up the stairs once again elsa was left to follow her anger and bewilderment were building by the minute stefanos was leaving he was assuming shed stay and take care of zoe in a place she didnt know in a country she didnt know she was furious but as she limped up the stairs after them her anger receded leaving her flat and deflated like zoe she was so tired shed been tired for years but this was worse jet lag no it was betrayal and betrayal hurt she stopped at the top stair and thought i dont want to go on i dont want to watch stefanos tuck zoe into bed and make her smile i dont want to see zoe seduced into this life of media attention of shallowness of wealth with only me to protect her royalty had destroyed christoss childhoodhed told her that stefanos had left the island as well and hed left for a reason how could she possibly assess the risks royalty posed for such a vulnerable child as zoe regardless stefanos was obviously intending that she take on the burden of protecting zoe that was what hed said for ever she didnt follow him into the bedroom she made it to the top stair and sat if zoe needed her stefanos would come back for her she thought but the way the little girls eyelids were drooping as hed carried her she doubted if shed notice if elsa wasnt there and if she went in now she might explode that he demand she drop the threads of her life in australia on command and yet manipulate her so he could still do what he wantedthat he could return to his old life in manhattan and leave her to care for zoe in a place she didnt understand there were weary chuckles from the end of the corridor stefanos was making zoe laugh bully for stefanos she felt dizzy as well as angry and confused and all the rest of it her hip hurt she put her head on her knees and folded her arms over her head this was jet lag and more desolation homesickness betrayal the world could go away footsteps sounded down the hall approaching her on the stair and pausing she opened her eyes a pair of black hessian boots was in her field of vision stefanos jet lag too huh he said and he was smiling again she knew he was smiling she could hear his smile its not jet lag she said without looking up its anger and disgust and deception thrown in for good measure zoes your cousin what do you mean by abandoning her im not abandoning her he said sounding surprised youre going back to manhattan only for a few weeks why didnt you tell us there was a pause and thenamazingly an honest answer because i thought you wouldnt come if i did how very perceptive he sighed and sat down beside her im sorry i should have told you before but i have an urgent surgical list to do before christmas i had a paper on echinoderms to write up before christmas she retorted believe it or not it was important someone else is finishing it for me right now youre saying your echinoderms are more important than my surgical list youre saying your life is more important than my life he hesitated elsa im sorry of course i dont think that but you dont understand so make me understand she flashed at him are there no other surgeons in new york i cant hand this over why not i cant explain this while youre angry you dont have a choice she said wearily from my point of view youve conned me into bringing zoe here youve seduced the two of us with your promise of palaces and lovely clothes and happy ever after but what do i know of this life how do i know zoe is safe here it was your assurance of safety and care that brought us here how can you calmly say youre going away and leaving us when weve scarcely set foot in the place she was staring downstairs at the massive chandelier below them wishing she wasnt in these clothes hed bought her wishing she could wave a magic wand and be home with her beach and her starfish and even her disgusting fishhead cat foodsomewhere where she knew the risks and could face them for her small charge knowing exactly where she stood but it seemed that stefanos wasnt backing down he was hesitating over what to say to her but she could see that manhattan was a done deal just explain she said wearily and for a moment she thought he wasnt going to say anything and then he did i work with overseas aid agencies he said slowly into the silence as if he didnt yet know that he should admit it aid agencies what sort of aid agencies what part of this could she believe but you said you work in manhattan i do patients come to me how aid agencies send them he said bluntly his tone implying hed decided he might as well tell her and get it over with whether she believed him or not international aid agencies know what i do and they contact me at need i intersperse these operations with my normal surgerythat way i can afford it mostly i treat people with head injuries from africa neurological stuff for children especially as the brain continues to grow scar tissue causes major problems i work on techniques to remove the worst of the scar tissue without it reforming i had to cancel some desperate cases when i realised i needed to find zoe and get this place sorted those kids are still waiting now youre here i need to go back finish what ive promised and try to hand over my techniques to others to take them forward you cancelled she was staring at him in horror you cancelled them for zoe for the welfare of the whole island if zoe wasnt back here by the end of next week then shed forfeit the throne she frowned trying to keep up but then youd inherit you think i want it i want to carry on my work she swallowed hard trying to take this in soso you really are abandoning us no he said flatly i cant this place is a mess hell elsa theres one doctor on the whole island and thats just the start of it the local school only takes kids up to sixteen and then theres nothing theres no infrastructure the council needs replacing with good solid people and theyll need support how can i walk away and leave that to zoe i havent heard about this i keep it quiet he shrugged my wealthy patients come to me in part because of my social position to be honest their fees pay for the other work i do so i have to pander to them honestly honestly he said she stared at him said nothing stared at him still why did she believe him she did believe him and if she did believe him she took a deep breath summoned the words she needed and said them i could help she said there was a loaded silence he rose and stared down at her as if shed suddenly announced the arrival of aliens youre kidding me he said at last i dont say what i dont mean she said and rose as well tell me what you need me to do and ill do it she wasnt feeling very steady she put her hand on the balustrade to support herself and suddenly stefanoss hand was over hers you cant he said softly i cant help how do you know i cant she tilted her chin sure i dont know anything about this place sure i was angry just then but ill get over it you can teach me if your works so important then i can try the silence extended she really was exhausted she thought if it wasnt for the balustrade and stefanoss hand elsa im starting to think theres nothing you cant do he said softly into the silence theres no end to your generosity zoes parents die and you abandon your career and take care of her i arrive and tell you shes needed here and you upend your life and abandon your echinoderms and come with her and nowyour anger turns to an offer of help just like that if i said i had to leave tomorrow would you try and handle the council yourself maybe i could she said and jutted her chin and he laughed a lovely deep chuckle that had her confused veering towards anger again if only she wasnt so tired no dont be angry my lovely elsa he said softly and he placed a finger under her chin im not laughing at you indeed i never could but no your generosity is amazing stunning and if i could maybe id be tempted but the island needs a ruler who knows it like it or not i was raised here i know the islanders i know the problems no i dont want to rule here i want to practice my medicine i wont be able to practice the medicine i want here but thats a small sacrifice in the scheme of things ive already started a training scheme back in new york i just have to hope my work keeps going if you could bear me to be away for these few weeks it will make all the difference you should have told me i should have told you he agreed indeed im starting to think i should have told you many things then as she pulled slightly away from him his hands came to rest on her shoulders thank you elsa i cant believe your generosity and i will keep you safe i will keep zoe safe i know you will unaccountably her eyes filled with tears dammit she would not cry she would not cry but he was too big and too close and too male matty she thought but it was a faint echo of a love that was gone onlywhy did it feel as if she was betraying him now youre as exhausted as zoe stefanos said softly she shook her head and tried again to pull away from himand staggered on the staircase but she didnt fall this man had promised to keep her safe and that was just what he was doing that hip he said holding her steady its fine its not fine its on my list to do something about but not now nows for sleeping and before she realised what he intended she was lifted into his arms and he was striding down the hallway just the same way hed carried zoe as if her weight was nothing putwhat do you think youre doing put me down in a moment he said not breaking stride you need to go where zoes going she wanted to struggle she really did but suddenly all the struggle was sucked out of her his arms were strong he was big and capable and he was carrying her like a child for elsa who hadnt been treated as a child sincewell since she was one the sensation was indescribable she could melt into these arms she thought she could let herself disappear stop struggling let these arms hold her for ever was this what jet lag did to a girl he was at her bedroom pushing open her door with his foot the interconnecting door to zoes room was open and she could see through zoe was asleep already she suddenly felt inordinately proud of herself that she was a good guardian or nanny or whatever she was supposed to be shed checked on her charge even when she wasnt exactly in control herself and then she realised that stefanos was carrying her through to zoes room and she saw why zoes vast fourposter bed had been moved closer to the door zoe was fast asleep in it and on the other side of her massive bed was another bed a matching fourposter velvet curtains a vast canopy eiderdowns and cushions the room had been turned into a twin room with two beds that were so ridiculously enormous that she gasped with incredulity wh i know its a bit crowded stefanos said smiling down at her in a dumb indulgent genie sort of way that for some weird reason had her heart doing backflips youll just have to slum it slum it matching fourposters im probably going to have to pay out on workers insurance too he said morosely do you know how much these things weigh it took eight of us to get it in here youyou she could hardly get it out idiot he suggested laughing down at her and her heart did another backflip definitely idiot she said trying for asperity and failing miserably ithank you she was so far out of her comfort zone that she could hardly make her voice work but there was something else she badly needed to say andat the press conferencethank you for calling me doctor its what you are not since zoe needed me ive been her mama since then if i called myself doctor everyone thought i was medical it just confused things so you stopped being doctor and started being mama as youd stop being on holiday and start bossing councillors if i asked it of you you know youre one special lady i am not he grinned and lowered her onto the bed and when he let her go she was aware of a sharp stab of loss you want some painkillers for your hip its not hurting im very sure it is its fine right then he said and smiled again she could hear his smile even when she didnt look at him it was a smile that crept all around her enveloping her in its sweetness you want help to undress no she said and then as she reran his question in her head she found her voice no andand dont think im not angry any more that you didnt tell me i still am its just got to wait until morning thats my girl what if i organise lunch tomorrow so we can talk about it i dont think i dont think you can think right now he tugged an eiderdown from the foot of the bed and tucked it around her youd be more comfortable if you undress but i dont think i can help you there he said his voice suddenly unsteady no she said and then couldnt think why shed said it her voice didnt seem to belong to her youll be okay he said looking down at her with all the tenderness in the world as if he cared as if he really cared youll be cared for here he said echoing her thoughts you and zoe will be safe well get that hip fixed you can play with your starfish and live happily ever after there was a lot to object to in that statement he seemed to think he was reassuring her i hate starfish she muttered you hate starfish they dont do anything they just blob you move em and they just blob some more i hate em youre studying them doesnt mean i dont hate em youre done in sweetheart im not done in and im not your sweetheart youre not are you theres a complication to avoid go away i will he said but he didnt he stood gazing down at her and she didnt want him to go she was half asleep allowing images from the pastgrief pain worry even starfishto be supplanted by this gorgeous prince of the blood prince of the blood she wasnt actually sure what the term meant but she knew what it looked like there was a prince of the blood smiling down at her right now tucking in her eiderdown looking gorgeous in his fabulous uniform he was still wearing his sword i love your sword she said dont encourage me he said im starting to look in mirrors and swagger so you ought she whispered life should hold a little swagger his smile softened he stooped so his face was really close to hers and he placed a finger on her lips to hush her she didnt know and she didnt much care it was enough that he was touching her it was suddenly incredibly important that he touch her youve lost your swagger he said softly almost as a whisper lifes sucked it right out of you let me fix it for you i dontyou cant matty she thought desperately but hed faded even more what remained was the memory of how grief felt how loss felt how she couldnt afford to fall elsa he said softly and as if in a dream she murmured back mmm is it okay if i kiss you of course it wasnt the idea was ridiculous but this wasnt real it was a dream and in her dream it was okay to kiss a prince in her dream she could put her arms around his neck link her hands and tug him downward in her dreams she could open her lips and wait for his lips to touch them in her dream he kissed her he kissed her of all the dumb stupid complicating things to do this must surely be the stupidest but she lay in her toobig bed tucked under the vast eiderdown looking up at him with eyes that were dreamy and close to sleep but not quite she was watching him she was smiling at him and then her hands came up to hold himhed have to be inhuman to resist she was beautiful she was so different from any other woman in his world slight and sexy her sunbleached curls were so fine they looked as if theyd float her eyes were gorgeous in her toothin face a man could drown in those eyes she had eighteen freckles hed counted them when maybe the first time hed seen her how many times had he recounted and her lips were so kissable what made elsas lips more desirable than any other womans because they belonged to elsa and because she was responding amazingly she was tugging him down to her and there was no way he could resist these lips this mouth this woman he sank so he was sitting on the vast bed and he gathered her into his armsand he kissed her with all the tenderness in his heart she melted into him what had provoked him to ask permission to kiss her he didnt know all he knew was that the desire had become overwhelming and when his mouth met hers hed kissed women in his time none like this she was warm and tender close to tears and close to laughter exhausted by jet lag and by fear of losing zoe intimidated beyond belief by her surroundingsand yet she was courageous beyond belief and she was melting into his arms as if she belonged here she was kissing as well as being kissed her lips were demanding opening aching for him and taking him as well as giving herself she felt right she felt likehome home and heart there was a ridiculous thought and as the acknowledgement of how crazy it was hit home other realities slammed in he did not need to be attracted to this woman this woman meant family he did not do family all this flooded through his consciousness like a shock wave breaking the passion of the kiss causing his arms to stiffen a little causing him to break away or maybe it was elsa who broke away he hardly knew all that was certain was that she was still in his arms but the kiss had ended and he felt a flood of regret so deep it threatened to overwhelm him and elsas eyes were clouding as well distancing herself from him her arms untwining themselves from around his neck and pushing against his chest pushing him away whatwhat do you think youre doing she whispered and he knew her confusion was at least as great as his what do we both think were doing he said ruefully and looked down into her face and saw fear fear where had that come from surely she couldnt be afraid of him he was a prince in a royal palace and she wasa royal nanny he stood up as if she burned taking a swift step back from the bed if she could think that butyou neednt worry she whispered im not thinking youre about to rape and pillage i have a scream that can be heard into the middle of next week good for you he said unsteadily dont patronise me i never would she closed her eyes it was a defence he knew but he never doubted for a moment that shed sleep he stood looking down at her for a long moment trying to think of what to say trying to think of how he could take this from here go away she muttered again go away it was the only sensible thing to do of course it was the sensible thing to do go away he repeated to himself and it was a direct order but only he knew how much effort it cost him to turn on his heel and walk out of the door if zoe hadnt been asleep in the next bed maybe it was just as well she was chapter nine elsa woke and sunlight was streaming in though the massive french windows of their bedroom the crystals from the chandelier above her head were sending glittering sparkles across the room zoe was sitting on the end of her bed fully dressed in another of the lovely outfits stefanos had bought for her she was cuddling a kitten a small grey kitten with a white nose white paws and a tiny tip of white on the end of his tail go say hello to elsa zoe said and put the kitten down and watched in satisfaction as the small creature walked along the coverlet crouched down and put a paw out to tentatively touch elsas chin whatwhere did he come from elsa managed doing a speedy visual check of the room in case stefanos was lurking behind the curtains not that she was afraid of stefanos not exactly but she wouldnt put it past the man to lurk stefanos gave him to me zoe said with deep satisfaction he said i must be missing my cats at home and hes mine to keep his name is buster yours to keep elsa said cautiously this needed thinking about there were things like quarantine laws it was easy enough she knew to get animals from australia to europe but taking them the other way shed just woken up and here was another instance of stefanoss arrogance hed have planned this before last night she thought before shed known he was leaving hed assumed he could talk her round he had talked her round but something wasnt making sense zoe was up and dressed shed gone to sleepwhatat five or six pm she checked her wristwatch eleven she sat bolt upright and yelped buster bolted for the far end of the bed where his new mistress scooped him up and held him close youre scaring him she said reproachful im scaring myself how can it be morning already its been morning for ages zoe said i woke up and waited and waited but you kept sleeping and then i opened the door and there was a really nice lady sitting in the corridor and she said her name was christina and shed been waiting for me to wake up she helped me have a bathits a really big bath elsa you should see itand she helped me with my clothes and then she took me down for breakfast and stefanos was there so we had a really yummy breakfaststrawberries elsaand then stefanos took me to the stables and gave me buster and i brought him up to show you but you were still sleeping and stefanos said we had to let you sleep for as long as you needed to so weve been really quiet only weve just been watching this was just about the longest speech zoe had ever made she sat back on the bed and cuddled buster the kitten and elsa smiled at her in pleasure and wonder the asyetnotmet christina must be good to have zoe smiling after a bath to be remembering it with pleasure but there was another part of her that was saying uhoh stefanos was truly seducing them she thought watching zoes face flush with excitement hed already seduced her little charge zoe might be hugging her kitten but every time she said stefanoss name her voice took on the hush of hero worship hed given her strawberries for breakfast hed given her a kitten bribery she thought and what was he trying on her seduction of another kind butshe kind of liked it matty matty matty she thought fiercely but it didnt work wherever matty was however much shed loved him he was no longer protection against stefanos do you want to get up now zoe said stefanos wants to take you out to lunch he said you both need to talk privately about boring stuff so he asked if id mind staying here with christina and buster and christina thought she might show me the beach if thats okay with you she added but her tone said elsas agreement was never in doubt it couldnt be in doubt elsa inspected the request from all angles there was a lot to consider like going out to lunch with stefanos hed suggested it last night she didnt remember agreeing he said to tell you its a picnic he said to tell you shorts are manmandatory and swords are optional i dont know what that means it means stefanos is being silly she said a bit too abruptly and zoe looked at her in astonishment dont you like stefanos no yes i dont know do you want christina to run you a bath zoe said seriously the bath is lovely its really really deep i believe i can run my own bath elsa said though i should take a shower i hope your cousin stefanos is taking one too preferably cold why would he want to do that zoe asked astonished i have no idea she said and summoned a grin i know im being stupid but i think it might be me who needs to take a cold shower she went to showerbut then she changed her mind this wasnt a place for denying oneself her hip would definitely like a bath back home she survived on tank water showers had to be fast of necessity here she had a feeling if she wanted to stay in the bath all day playing with the amazing selection of bottles of luxurystuff no one would say a word of protest so she did if not for a day for almost an hour she might have used one too many bottles of smelly stuff she conceded as she soaked on she was fighting to keep an airway free through bubbles finally reluctantly her conscience got the better of her she wrapped herself in a fabulously fleecy white towel used several more towels getting rid of the bubbles and padded back to the bedroom she opened her wardrobe and gasped yesterday shed accepted two dresses and a couple of shirts and sandals some time during the night her selection had been augmented bywell by enough clothes to keep a girl happy for a year this was really intrusive she should be angry butshe tugged out a lovely jonquil blouse and a soft pair of linen shorts she held them up in front of her and any attempt at anger disappeared if you need to change direction then you might as well enjoy it she told herself and thought she was about to go on a picnic with stefanos and she had new clothes and she felt terrific and maybe changing direction wasnt bad at all he was leaving she wouldnt think about that shed cope she always had coped with what life threw at her and if life was now throwing bubbles and new clothes at herand lunches with princesa girl might just manage to survive she came down the staircase looking wideeyed with apprehension selfconscious in her neat lemony blouse white shorts and new sandalsand very very cute shed twisted her curls up into a knot he liked it he thought he liked it a lot hed like it better if he could just untwist it have you been standing there for hours waiting for me she demanded as she saw him hours he agreed and grinned did she have any idea how cute she was her eyes were creased a tiny bit from a lifetime spent in the sun but that was the only sign of wear her nose was spattered with her eighteen gorgeous freckles if he didnt know for sure she must be close to thirty hed have pegged her as little more than a teenager and she smelledshe smelled wow he said as she came close and she grinned lily of the valley sandalwood and fig and anise there would have been lavender in there too but i couldnt get the bottle open thank god for that he said faintly and then counted freckles again umdont you believe in cosmetics pardon most of the women i know wear makeup he said lamely kicking himself for letting his mouth engage before head well good for them she said encouragingly do you too do i what ive spent so much time in doctors waiting rooms over the last four years that ive read enough cosmetics advertisements to make me a world expert theres mens cosmetics as well im sure princes use them fake tans the obvious one does your tan rub off on your towel no he said appalled and she arched her eyebrows in polite disbelief youll need sunscreen he said sounding lame and the look she gave him then was almost scornful go teach your grandmother to suck eggs im australian i put sunscreen on before my knickers and then she heard what shed saidand blushed it was some blush it started at her toes and worked its way up a tide of pink she could feel it he thought and her knowledge that it was happening made it worse he loved it soso this is royal beachwear she managed moving on with an obvious struggle he glanced down at his casual chinos his linen shirt and his boat shoes whats wrong with this looks great for being a prince and lazing on a sixtyfoot yacht on the mediterranean she said its not great for rock pools though and thats where i hoped wed be going somewhere rock pooly she was defending by attack he thought but she was still blushing last night hed kissed her right now all he could think of was that kiss and how he could repeat it he may well get his face slapped he thought shed been way out of control last night exhausted and vulnerable right nowher defences were up and even if he wanted tookay he did want toshed be sensible enough for both of them the kitchen staff have set us up with a picnic basket he told her theres a great little beach i know a few minutes drive from here i believe it even has rock pools what time will we be back does it matter yes she said definite i want control here i should even be deciding where were going isnt it usually the guy who gives orders she finished for him im sure it is and if its a prince then it probably works double but sleeping beautys for wimps i fight my own battlesand i set up my own defences can i tell zoe four oclock if you like i do like she said youre on probation after that kiss last nighti dont know why you did it but it scared me im happy to have a picnic but lets make it quite clear this relationship is purely business of course he said courteously but he was aware of a stab of disappointment he didnt know what was happeningbut what he did know was that he didnt want to be on a business footing with elsa so why are we going on a picnic she asked as they headed out along the coast road arent there urgent princely things you should be doing there were urgent princely things he should be doing but for nowthey were ensconced in a gullwing mercedesa sl a car with doors that opened like wings from the centre a car that looked like a weird seagulla crazy wonderful car it had belonged to the king but it had obviously sat in mothballs for the last fifty years finding it had been a highlight of the past two dreary weeks and nowit felt great the sun was shining they were cruising smoothly around the curves of the scenic coast road the mercedes motor was purring as if it was finally allowed to be doing what it should be doingand for the moment that was how he felt too as if hed got it right beside hima beautiful woman with freckles so were going to the beach why she prodded again and he shook off his preoccupation with elsa the woman and gullwing the car and tried to think of what shed asked i want to be private not so you can kiss me again no he said startled and then thought actually that wasnt such a bad idea just as well she said but her voice was strained he glanced across at her and thought shed come close to admitting that last nights kiss had affected her as much as it had him so you want to talk to me she ventured we need to depend on each other he said trying to sound suitably grave and princely maybe its time we got to find out a bit more about each other without kissing without kissing hard to sound grave and princely while saying that so you can figure whether i can take on this island no he grew serious then im not asking that of you its my responsibility but i did thinkeven before last nightthat you deserve an explanation of who i amof whats behind the mess of this island so that while im away you have a clear idea of the background he was manoeuvring the car off the main road now turning onto a dirt track through what was almost coastal jungle once upon a time this had been a magnificent garden but that was a long time ago now he parked the car under the shade of a vast wisteria draping the canopy of a longstrangled tree as the cars batwings pushed up the wisterias soft flowers sent a shower of petals over their heads it was right to come here stefanos thought matters of state had to wait a little this feltright elsa was gazing around her with awe and the beginnings of delight a tiny stone cottage was also covered with wisteria it looked ramshackle neglected and unused this looks almost like home she breathed without the termites you have termites my house is wood veneer she said darkly veneer over termites so whats this place my home he said and she stared your home but you live in manhattan now i do this is where i was brought up she stared around her puzzled but a prince wouldnt live here i wasnt raised as a prince my father scratched a living fishing he was killed in a boating accident when i was sixteen accidents to the islands original royals are littered throughout our historynever anything that could definitely be attributed to the king but terrifying regardless after papa died my mother insisted i go abroad she sold everything to get me into school in the states christos left soon after for the same reasons only christoss mother had a little more money so she was able to go with him so you left the island when you were sixteen alone yes he said flatly i had no choice mama was terrified every time i set foot on the island so she insisted i didnt return she died of a heart attack just before i qualified as a doctor and its to my eternal regret i wasnt here for her i hopei hope she was proud of my medicine ive always hoped that what i do was worth her sacrifice he shrugged awkwardly who can tell but there it is so she was eyeing him cautiously sympathetic but wary why are you telling me this i want to tell you why i left the island and i want to explain how important my medicine is to me he hesitated thats all dumb really but after last nightit seemed important that you know you can practice medicine here she said still cautious i can he said i will the old doctor here is overjoyed that ill be joining him butnot practising neurosurgery id need a population considerably bigger than this island to justify equipment technology ancillary staff so no youll be a good family doctor she said softly and he smiled i hope so if im not im sure youll tell me nowlunch yes please she climbed out of the car and gazed around her it was a pictureperfect setting a tiny house nestled in a tranquil little cove she thought of stefanos growing up here using this place as his own private paradise he had it all his career his title his good looks his life so why did she feel sorry for him it wasnt what hed intended she thought glancing at him as he retrieved a picnic basket from the car but suddenlysuddenly she thought she hadnt had it too hard at all shed lost matty but shed loved him and hed loved her her own parents had died young but her best friend amy had always been close and then thered been zoe how hard must it be to walk alone how would he react if she told him she felt sorry for him she wondered and then she glanced at him again at the sheer good looks of the man the way he smiled at her the teasing laughter behind his eyes all this and sympathy too this man was too dangerous for words he suspected it was a picnic to surpass any picnic shed ever had lobster crunchy bread rolls butter curls in a thermos to keep them cool a salad of mango and avocado and prawns lemon slivers strawberries tiny meringues a bottle of sparkling white wine this is enough for a small army she gasped as he spread a blanket over a sandy knoll overlooking the sea i doubt the royal kitchen appreciates the concept of enough do you think you can make a dent in it ill do my best she said and proceeded to do just that she concentrated on eating as if it was really important it probably was he conceded shed missed last nights dinner and this mornings breakfast but she probably didnt need to concentrate quite as hard as she was she seemed nervous and that made two of them last night had left him floundering and quite simply he didnt know how to go forward this was a woman unlike any other a widow a woman with a past but a woman who was facing the future with courage with humour and with love quite simply she left him awed and nowhe felt as if he were treading on eggshells and he was already sure he was squashing some in the end it was elsa who broke a silence that was starting to seem strained so tell me about the island she ventured she was lying on the rug looking out to sea she was on one side of the rug he was on the other and the picnic gear was in between it was starting to seem a really intrusive arrangement but itd be really unwise to change it he thought no matter how much he wanted to ill show you the island he told her when youve finished lunch ill give you a quick tour its far too big to see in a daybut i do want to give you some impression of what were facing we hey you offered to help he said and then smiled at her look of panic but no elsa relax i meant we as in all the islanders she managed a smile in turn not we as in the royal we not we as in we are not amused no so theres still nothing for me to do there is he hesitated trying to figure a way to say what needed to be said he couldnt but still it needed to be said there are three things he said at last some time before i go back to manhattanbefore the end of the monthid like to take you to athens i want you to buy a dress for the coronation it was such an unexpected request that she looked blank it was left to him to explainwhy hed woken at three this morning and thought he had to do this hed fit it into his schedule somehow i want you to have a gown thatll do justice to your role on the island he said simply i want you to stand by zoes side at the coronation and look royal yourself youre her guardian ill stand by her side as prince regent but youre guardian to the crown princess you should be received with equal honour there was a lengthy silence at that then a dress elsa said cautiously you meannot a nice nannyish dress with a starched collar and nanny embroidered on the breast i had in mind more a princess di dress or a princess grace dress something to make the islanders gasp yeah right she said dryly yeah right that would be two positives that means you agree that means theres no way i agree i wish it he said oooh she said is this insubordination elsa sorry she managed a shaky smile its an amazing offer she shook her head as if shaking off a dream but its nuts for one thing you have way too much to do to be taking me shopping how could you possibly justify putting off your surgical lists for something so crazy and secondthe clothes youve already arranged for me are bad enough she faltered then her colour fading as she realised what shed said im sorry she said again i meantheyre lovely and im very grateful buti dont know how to explain this is me stefanos i might be changing direction but im still me i dont do princess di or princess grace please let me keep being elsa you can be elsa in a couture gown yeah right she said again but no so okay thats sorted what next what else did you want to talk to me about it would give me pleasure to see no flat definite youre royalty and im not lets move on uhoh he wasnt having much luck here and the next one was more important maybe he should have voiced it first except when hed thought this all through in the middle of the night the thought of taking her shopping had distracted him it was still distracting him maybe now though he needed to get serious its not just shopping he said softly id like you to see an orthopaedic surgeon in athens i want you to get your hip repaired now she said astounded now he said youre in pain im not you are the pin in your hip hasnt held you need a complete joint replacement uhoh he thought watching her face maybe hed gone about this the wrong way she stood staggering a little as she put weight on both feet but she righted herself fast her eyes were flashing fire how do you know she said carefully enunciating each syllable that the pin hasnt held i rang brisbane you rang brisbane the fire in her eyes was suddenly looking downright explosive you mean you rang my treating doctor he was suddenly in really dangerous territory this woman might change direction at will but she was never going to be compliant or boring oror less than the elsa he was starting to have enormous respect for respect respect didnt begin to cover what he was feeling you wouldnt tell me whats wrong with your hip he said trying to sound reasonable but he was wrongfooted and he knew it hed wanted to sound caring and concerned andmaybe even magnanimous instead suddenly he was feeling unprofessional and interfering and about the size of a rather small bug so you just asked she said and her anger was starting to make her stutter you thought youd just ask my doctor what was wrong with me how did you do that did you say hi doctor this is a casual acquaintance of one of your patients could you tell me whats wrong with her hip orthis is prince stefanos leandros antoniadis from khryseis and i order you to hand over my servants medical records or she paused for breath or this is doctor antoniadis and i have a woman here who cant even get up the stairs without limping so can you send me her recordsas one professional to another it wasnt like that elsa i owe you so much hed risen to face her now he tried to take her hands but she wrenched them away as if he were poison ivy you owe me so much that you cant even grant me privacy she demanded i have to know whats wrong with you zoe depends on you we need to get it fixed before i leave before you leaveitll take weeks months even a week in hospital and at least a month in rehabilitation when you get back from manhattan when things are settled when zoes happy then ill think about it maybe possibly but its my business mine stefanos zoe will cope zoe will not cope i will not ask it of her now whats the third thing i dont think its wise i dont think any of this is wise she said but ask me anyway it can wait i might not be speaking to you tomorrow tell me now it was just hell hed messed this hed messed this so badly he wanted to back off but she was waiting breathing too fast and he knew that not to finish it would make it even worse than it already was the third request its none of my business so tell me and let me decide he hesitated but he did need to get to know this woman even as her employer he should know her id like you to tell me about matty matty your husband you think i dont know who matty is she seemed almost speechless of course you do im going about this the wrong way but yesterdayi didnt even know how he died i should have asked you about him and im so sorry i didnt matty was your husband and you loved him he must have been really special speechless didnt begin to describe how she was feeling what was it with this man hed brought her here for a picnic hed fed her lobster and wineand then hed talked of buying her ball dresses and phoning her doctor and now he wanted to talk about her dead husband her head was hurting her hip was hurting she wanted to hit him count to ten she told herself come on elsa you can cope with this personally stefanos had overstepped the mark the knowledge that hed phoned her doctor and found out information was hugeit threatened to overwhelm her but that was personal asking her about matty was personal this man was her employer nothing else so why not tell him about matty it was too confusing how could she tell him about matty without betraying matty yet how could the act of telling him about matty be a betrayal unlessunless it was far too hard take me back to the palace stefanos she said wearily im sure you have work to do but i have work to do too she said if i cant help rule your island then ill just have to go back to starfish there are some great starfish how many times do i have to tell youi hate starfish she snapped bitterly irrationally and shoved the picnic basket aside and lifted the picnic rug and shook it and if the sea breeze just happened to be blowing in the direction of stefanoswell the gods must have meant him to get a face full of sand but his phone was ringing and he was retrieving it from his pocket he didnt seem to notice she was throwing sand at him like a twoyearold having a tantrum frustrated she folded the rug nicely and gathered the gear together and waited for him to finish of course i can do it no you know i promised from now on this is what i do what she said as he snapped his phone shut a twoyearold with croup he said in the village near here would you mind if we stopped on the way back thoughitd mean you miss out on your rock pools okay enough of the tantrums she pulled herself together my rock pools can wait of course they can croup are you working already our island doctor has more work than he knows what to do with ive told him ill start helping at once well get more medical staff here before i leave but for nowhes stuck in a clinic on the far side of the island and the childs mother has newborn twins at home and isnt well herself its probably just reassurance if you can wait of course i can wait she said remorsefully im not really a brat i know youre not a brat youre he hesitated no lets just go the drive to the village was done in silence stefanos was feeling just about as low as it was possible to feel this morning it had seemed a good ideasensible evento take elsa to the beach hed decided to show her he wasnt born a princethat they had more in common than she thought hed offer her a beautiful dress a shopping trip to athens hed have to push to find time to do it but she needed some sort of gesture to show how much he appreciated her care of zoe andit hadnt escaped his mind that watching elsa buy a beautiful gown might be a whole lot of fun for him too time out for both of them the other things had been added because they were also starting to feel urgent every time he noticed her limp now he felt bad and he needed to find out about matty okay the last wasnt essential but it seemed essential to himmore and more he didnt fully understand whyit was simply the way elsa was making him feel so hed set his plan in place and in doing so hed alienated her just about as far as he possibly could good one he told himself feeling something akin to pond scum only pond scum might have more selfrespect he knew the place he was going he drove slowly through the nearby village and hesitated do you want to come with me would you mind staying in the car im happier here she said motioning to the village street ill poke around and talk to people that looks a nice peaceful little park if you take hours dont worry ill be under a tree asleep once again shed taken his breath away he thought of the women hed taken out beforecolleagues new york singles women who were smart and savvy and stood up for what they wanted so did elsa he thought but only when it was needed nowshed made no fuss shed released him from any pressure and he knew instinctively that if it took hours she wouldnt fuss at all thank you he said stefanos yes i might need a bit of money she said diffidently i dont have any local currency and its been so long since lunchi might need an ice cream and how good was that he thought as he drove away without any more pressure shed ensured she had enough money for phone calls and help if he really didnt come back for her only she neednt doubt that hed definitely come back for her the old doctor was rightthe little boy was suffering mild croup easily handled at home what was needed was reassurance and his mother got that in spades just by stefanoss presence our prince the young mother said over and over here in my kitchen he smiled and cradled one of her twins and shared a cup of tea with her as the twoyearold slid into sleep the young father came home reacted with awe that stefanos himself had come decided his wife obviously needed more support if the prince himself suggested it and before he knew it the childrens aunt was unpacking a suitcase in the spare room fast enough to also join the prince in yet another cup of tea there was nothing to this family medicine stefanos thought with wry humour though his house calls might well need to get a bit faster could he be content with family medicine it had its own skills he was out of date hed have to brush up on his general medical knowledge but he would it could give him satisfaction if onlyif only the work hed been doing wasnt so imperative elsa wasnt in the park but he found her easily she was standing in front of the butchers shop happily licking an ice cream cone reading the literature in the shop window with her gorgeous bare legs her flyaway curls her ice cream she stood out like a sunbeam hi she said as he climbed out of his car to join her maybe he should get himself a less conspicuous car he thought ruefully these wings were crazy the locals were staring at the car and starting to cluster how goes your patient she asked all cured really im a fabulous doctor he said modestly i prescribed one aunt and lo the problems solved do they sell aunts in bottles sure they do can we go ummaybe but have you seen this she asked licking her cone with care womancumeightyearold she made him feel see that was the trouble he didnt know how he felt this was something new something frightening something he didnt know what to do with is this beach far she asked what beach read the poster she said with exaggerated constraint he read the poster it was handwritten big and to the point turtles hatching kemps ridley lagoon tempio urgent assistance needednow helena do you know where lagoon tempio is iyes can we go she asked she took a final lick of her cone decided against more and tossed the remainder in a nearby bin you want to go to this beach he said cautiously aware that the eyes of many people were on him yes to his astonishment she was suddenly deadly serious she wiped her hands on her hips and faced him square on please he stared at the sign it made no sense whos kent ridley kemps ridley lepidochelys kempii its the smallest and most endangered of the worlds sea turtles and they breed together all the females nest on the one night so hatchings are huge if its really kemps ridleyi cant imagine it is but please stefanos i need to go the sudden passion in her voice stunned him the vibrant excitement didnt you tell zoe youd be back by four he said astounded at the change in her i told you i told zoe id be back by four she said impatiently i was scared you meant a spot of seduction stefanos we need to hurry there was a snort from behind them the onlookers were close enough to hear this was a busy shopping street in the middle of the afternoon and every person here knew who he was maybe they didnt know who elsa wasbut they were surely interested shed just made them a whole lot more interested so many people spoke english these days he thought elsa okay i know you didnt want to seduce me she conceded you just wanted to ask me a whole lot of questions i failed to answer but i wasnt to know that so im safe but the turtles arent if whoever wrote this posterhelena helenas my mother a voice volunteered and elsa turned with eagerness your mother shed slipped easily and fluently into greek your mother is saving turtles they started hatching this morning a middleaged man wearing a butchers apron told her my mothers excited too these turtles used to come here in large numbersthe mass nesting is called an arribadas my mother saysbut forty years ago scientists and tourists were coming to see so the king bulldozed the beach it broke my mothers heart but this yearthis year theyve come back she wants me to help but i have my shop i put her sign up in my window but it was all i could do does she have helpers i sent my boy down to help her the man told her but there are so many birdsmy mother can only save a few stefanos elsa said and fixed him with a look he was starting to recognise yes as far as i know theres only one known nesting ground and thats in mexico to have a kemps ridley hatching ground right here where i can helptherell be a million predators feasting on them stefanos we need a royal decree or something a royal decree he said blankly we have to save those turtles she took a deep breath steadied stefanos if you help me save the turtles then illillill even let you buy me a princess grace dress there was a ripple of stunned laughter through the crowd more and more people were clustered around them now with more arriving every minute this was their prince regent and the princesss nanny so what do we need he said simply people lots of people she was speaking with passion and she was waiting for him to act people the school he said what about the school he turned to the crowd is the school bus available itll be taking the schoolchildren home someone told him it should be back here in a few minutes whos in charge of it my son someone else called okay stefanos said im commandeering the school bus can you tell your son that ill pay him double the going rate to transport any islander and any child to lagoon tempio theres as much ice cream as they can eat for a week for anyone who comes there he grinned at the ice cream vendor ill reimburse you and ill also reimburse you for closing the shop now that goes for anyone who wants to help he glanced at the butcher phillip can we set up a barbecue on the beach if were going to get people there we need to feed them can you contact the baker and marios at the café ill reimburse you for anything anyone eats or drinks tonight portia he turned to another woman standing by a battered jeep can you take dr murdoch there now ill pay you for your trouble by the way everyone this is dr murdocha marine biologist who also happens to be the best thing thats happened to this island for a long time elsa ill organise things here ill phone the palace and ask that zoe be brought down to join us he smiled at elsa she was all fire and pleading and pure adrenalin wideeyed with excitement he put his finger to his lips and then he placed his finger on hers lets do this together he said and he smiled if only because i really want to see you in that dress and im so sorry i upset you okay everybody lets go save some turtles chapter ten it took half an hour of phone calls and arrangements before he got to the beach himselfand when he did the sight before him almost blew him away lagoon tempio was a sheltered cove about fifteen minutes from the village hed heard stories about turtles hatching here in the past but hed only ever known it as a clear felled barren stretch of land but gradually the land had been recovering the beach was surrounded by thick vegetation again a horseshoe cove protected from winds and tides a perfect place for turtles to come to breed because of the clear felling it had fallen off most of the islanders radar until now he looked down to the beach and there were people there were so many people his heart sank uhoh had he been guilty of overkill if elsa was on a turtle saving mission maybe bringing this many people here was hardly helpful maybe hed done more harm than good hed encouraged every islander to come thinking some would take up his invitation obviously everyone whod heard of it had come but even as he thought hed created chaos he emerged from the narrow track that led onto the beacha track that looked as if it had just been created this afternoon by people pushing throughand he saw that he hadnt or elsa and helena hadnt let it happen the adults were in lines forming corridors from the top of the beach to the water they were standing like sentinels or maybe windmills would be a better description for overhead were birds hundreds of birds many of which he didnt recognizeocean feeders migratory birds birds who knew that here was a feast for all at the top of the beach were sandy mounds and from each mound came a stream of hatchings tiny turtles two or three inches across struggling out of their sandy nests and starting gamely towards the water with the mass of seabirds above theyd stand no chance but nowthere were corridors of people from each mound he recognised helenashe was in her eighties one of the islands stalwarts she didnt sound eighty she was booming orders in a voice to put a sea captain to shamebut beaming and beaming alone she couldnt have saved more than a tiny proportion of these hatchings but now where was elsa where finally he saw her up to her waist in water in the midst of a group of children then as helena called out to her she was out of the water darting up the beach pulling people from one corridor to start another hatchlings were coming from beyond the trees at the end of the beach more mounds within moments elsa had more adults formed into more corridors there were islanders arriving all the time and she was using them all with her new corridors in place she was off again back into the shallows whooping and yelling at the birds above and encouraging the kids to do the same amazingly zoe was in there with them whooping as if she was just one of the kids the little crown princess was yelling and laughing and gloriously happy and so was elsa she was soaking dripping with water laughing at something someone said and then flying up the beach to lift a tiny hatchling which had turned the wrong way lifting it with a base of sand and then setting it safely near the waters edge so it could meet the waves the way it should are you here to help she called out to him and he realised hed been spotted where do you need me in deep water she called if you dont mind getting wet i cant get protection deep enough there are so many turtles for all the mounds to hatch together we need boats he said and lifted his phone yes but meanwhile meanwhile ill do it he snapped a command into the phone tugged off his shirt and shoes and headed for the water what followed was an extraordinary evening and night and at the end of it hundredsmaybe thousandsof baby turtles were flippering their way into the deep thanks to the islanders turtle saving skills elsa had moved constantly working her corridor teams in shifts making sure no one stayed in the water for more than twenty minutes a miniature drill sergeant in action she and helena had formed a formidable team helena was frail though and she was almost weeping with joy to have this help by dusk elsa had sent helena home youve done so much shed told the old lady and helena had gripped her hands and wept openly this is thanks to you to you and your prince i thank you embarrassed elsa had headed back into the water and stayed there as the afternoon turned to evening as phillips barbecue faded to cinders as the mass of turtle hatchling eased and finally it could be left to a dozen people taking turns he finally dragged her off the beach he made her dry herself almost forcefed her a steak and an apple and watched over her while she ate i should be back helping she muttered impatient you can be but not now not until youve had a break someone had brought a vast mound of pillows and blankets zoe and a couple of other island children were lying cocooned in blankets watching the flames giggling sleepily to each other he recognised one of the children as phillips daughtera child about the same age as zoe they were lying side by side it seemed zoe was making a friend she lookedhappy so was elsa she was flushed and triumphant and glowing the scene was weirdly domestic family in his mind was suddenly a piercing stab of what hed once had a longing did you see them elsa said softly speaking almost to herself we saved thousands they face so many dangers in the water but nowthanks to helena they have a chance thanks to you helena was on her own she whispered shes been watching the mounds if one mound had hatched she would have had a chance to save some she hadnt realized or shed forgotten that kemps ridley turtles lay their eggs in synchronisation so they all hatch together therell be another hatching in twentyfive daysthats set as well ive worked it outthats before your coronation so youll still be here kemps ridleys lay in synchronisation twentyfive days apart isnt that amazing arent we lucky she looked up at him then and she smiled but its you she said on a note of awe youre a prince the islanders moved today because you asked them to if theyd thought about itif helena had had the time to individually pleadthen maybe shed have got half a dozen people to help her but you said come and they came they came because of you and i cant thank you enough theres no need for you to thank me he was watching her and he was feelingweird she was slight and feisty and sandcoated and bedraggled hed hurt her today he hadnt meant to but he was starting to realise how hed got it so wrong and why she was tugging his heart strings in a way he didnt recognise or maybein a way he did but until now hed been afraid to face do you know how rare these turtles are she said softly i cant believe it theyre so endangered to have a breeding site on this islandi so wish matt was here that set him back a bit pushed what he was thinking to the side it didnt completely obliterate it though even if she didnt tell him about mattyhe could compete with someone whod died four years ago he thought and then realised where his thoughts were taking him and thought who cared they were going there anyway this is wonderful she said softly into the firelight they had the fire almost to themselves now the children were nestled in their beds on the far side of the barbecue but the rest of the islanders had either gone home to rest or were back on the beach on their shift i can stay here she said i can do so much work here what about your starfish she looked startled what about my starfish have you really lost your enthusiasm she looked at him as if he were a sandwich short of a picnic enthusiastic about starfish according to zoe its what you love i love zoe you dont love starfish as opposed to kemps ridley her voice was awed kemps ridley turtles on an island where my zoe needs to be this is awesome but your research i can work around that too she said ive already handed over my initial starfish researchthere were any number of students just aching to take it on but if i can do this and keep zoe happytheres so much helena says there are plans for development of this beach something about moving the towns refuse station close by shes worried we can protect this beach he hesitated andi hope we can get tourism going the islands desperate for income its hardly touched she whispered looking out through the trees where the lights of a score of torches showed the turtles still had safe passage it could be the best eco resort matt and i had such plans there it was again matt maybe this was going to be harder than hed thought maybe what was going to be harder he knew more and more he knew he watched her face and he thought he wanted this woman so much it was too soon way too soon stupid even okay we have that settled she said not noticing his silence ill stay here and love zoe and save turtles youll have to figure your own direction but i have mine she rose and wiped her hands on her shortsa gesture he was starting to recognise lets move on if youll excuse me i have work to do id be honoured to help he said andi will be here longterm i will be part of this island elsa he reached out and took her hands she stood looking down at them in the firelight the linking of fingers not a good idea she whispered we could work this together sorry its just a thought im quite happy for you to help with the turtles any time you want she said and he knew she was deliberately misunderstanding him but for nowyour patients and the islanders need you and the turtles need me zoe needs me thats enough for one girl wouldnt you say dr antoniadis steve prince stefanos she retorted still watching their linked hands my employer im not your employer why what else would you be she asked and she carefully untangled their fingers separated their hands took a step back and looked at him with eyes that were carefully watchful i need to go back to the beach will you stay here and watch over zoe ill go back to the water your hip must be hurting my turtles are important she said theyre my job let me have that at least she retorted and before he could respondbefore he even knew how to respondshe turned and headed back down to the beach leaving him to try and figure where to take things from here he stared down at the fireand then focused heading for the flames were three tiny turtles how had they made their way back here theyd built this fire purposely far back from the beach out of sight of the mounds so the light couldnt distract the hatchlings from their course maybe these three had been distracted by a torch had deviated from their course and ended up here he scooped them up before they could get close enough to the fire to harm themselves elsa he called into the night and in seconds she was back looking straight to zoe but zoe slept on elsas face slackened in relief and he thought how much had she worried how many infections dramas had she endured during these four years of getting zoe back to health its just turtles he said swiftly and she looked down at his hand he had one hand cupped over the other but tiny flippers were peeking through they felt weird a handful of flippering they were justhere he said in case she thought hed collected them from the beach done something less than noble he didnt know what but he was starting to suspect she thought he wasnt exactly hero material hell he wished he could be what in the world are they doing here she asked opening his hands and taking them into her smaller ones with all the tenderness in the world hey guys the oceans thisaway i guess if they walked far enough the ocean is thataway he said yeah but changing directions easier she whispered i ought to know come on guys ill take you where you need to go what do you mean changing directions easier he asked she looked up at him in the firelight and shook her head if you need to explain it you cant do it she said you justfollow your heart thank you stefanos for saving my turtles and thank you for giving me another direction ill make the most of it your hip has nothing to do with direction she said some things still hurt no matter what direction youre travelling chapter eleven for the next three weeks she immersed herself in this new life and felt herselfunfurl that was what it felt like she thought as if she was coming to life again for the last four years shed been constantly worried constantly battling for their survival here zoes welfare was more than taken care of it was stefanos who inspected the little girls grafts who worried about her medically who even told her to back off a little she was fussing others cooked for her cleanedelsa was an honoured guest free to do as she wished and she was free zoe had made a friend her own age pip daughter of phillip the butcher granddaughter of helena defender of the turtles she was friends with every one of the castle staff now she was happy and confident and more than content that elsa do her own thing so elsa was making her own friends the turtle breeding grounds was a project which had her waking up every morning aching to get up and go the only problem wasin the moments when shed sit opposite stefanos at meals and watch his face as the palace secretary outlined what needed to be done that day she feltbleak he was doing the right thing the honourable thing but for zoe and for her this new life promised excitement and freedom for stefanosthere was still a conflict that seemed to be tearing him apart she didnt know what was happening with his practice in manhattan the plan was to leave straight after the coronation and do what needed to be done and return she tried to talk to him about it but it was as if after their appalling picnic hed decided hed overstepped the boundaries his life was separate only overlapping with her need to be with zoe oh his bleakness wasnt overt outwardly he was cheerful and confident and purposeful it was only that she seemed to know this man she seemed to sense how he was feeling his trouble was the one cloud on her horizon actually no sometimes it felt more than that like a fog she could see rolling in to envelop him but she had no idea what to do about it the fact that sometimes she had an urgent desire to take him and hold him and love himwell that was just plain dumb andshe suspected it might not even help meanwhile the coronation was almost on them and shed made her promise it was time to buy a dress zoes coronation dress was exquisite stitched by hand by a team of dressmakers who smiled all the time they worked who said what a pleasure it was to be able to do this what a joy so cant i get my gown made here as well she asked stefanos knowing how stressed he was and how little he could spare the time to be away but its my one bright day he said i think ive worked hard enough to earn one free day he surely had what hed achieved in these last weeks was little short of miraculous the island council had been reformed three councillors had been invited to stay on five had been retired stefanos had done it with tact but with an underlying ruthlessness that left her awed the governance of the island was now under the control of the council with ultimate responsibility resting with stefanos the royal coffers were being used with a speed that made her blink advertisements were already appearing on the mainland for teachers for engineers builders nurses unemployment on the island had been running at over fifty per cent no longer there were schools and hospitals to build roads to repair water mains to install electricity to supply to the inland area giorgos and his predecessors have held on to our taxes for hundreds of years stefanos told her when she questioned how the island could possibly afford what he was starting alexandros on sappheiros has split the royal coffers into three so theres more than enough to get things moving he worked with a ruthless efficiency that left her awed but still there seemed to be this aching need she heard him late at night her balcony overlooked the sea and so did his shed walk outside to watch the sea and shed hear him talking discussing operations questioning results talking to colleagues about cases they needed his help with he was needed elsewhere he was working frantically so he could leave fitting in as much medicine as he could as well hed found a locum to work here while he was away to leave him free and hed come back hed promised that hed come back but he didnt want to she heard it in his voicethat coming back would tear him in two and she couldnt help but firsther dress ive organised a seaplane to pick us up and take us to athens for the day hed told her at dinner the day before three weeks ago zoe would have reacted to this proposal in fear now she simply looked up and said am i coming too shed been tucking into her dinner as if she had hollow legs the difference in her health since she had been here was astonishing ive asked pips mama if you can stay with pip for the day stefanos said is that okay ooh yes zoe said pleased and pips mama says its okay if pip comes back here and sleeps for the night christina will look after both of you and youll have buster to keep you company i thought i might take elsa shopping in athens for something beautiful to wear to our coronation and i thought i might take her to dinner afterwards from the start hed been able to wind his cousin round his little finger and this was no exception elsa would like that zoe said seriously she says she doesnt like dresses but she does really and boys are supposed to take girls out to dinner hey elsa said startled half laughing half horrified im here its not like youre talking behind my back but she was ignored itll be a date zoe said in satisfaction you have to kiss her on the way home who says elsa demanded pips big sister went out on a date last week pip says when the boy brought her home he kissed her goodnight pips sister is eighteen elsa retorted im too old for that nonsense youre not zoe said seriously youre still quite pretty gee thanks she hesitated stefanos it really isnt necessary you promised stefanos pointed out a bargains a bargain ive saved your turtles twice he had too the second hatching twentyfive days after the first had been orchestrated so that as far as they knew every single hatchling had made it to the water it was a fraught journey the turtles had before them the sea was full of dangers but stefanos had done everything humanly possible to see they had every chance and the price a snip an agreement to buy a dress athens or nothing he said it has to be special all right she said grudgingly youre very gracious stefanos said and he was laughing at her laughing at least the bleakness had lifted for the moment that conversation had taken place last night and now stefanos was waiting in the hall a car was waiting to take them down to the harbour to the seaplane in minutes shed be climbing aboard an aeroplane with a prince are you coming or do i have to come up and carry you down he called from below in the entrance hall she went there was something about this day that made her feeldizzy sitting in the seaplane across from stefanos she stared straight ahead are you okay he asked gently fifteen minutes into the flight and she nodded but couldnt even find the courage to answer this was one day out a shopping expedition for a dress followed by a meal why did it feel so overwhelmingly scary stefanos smiled at her and retired to a medical journal medicine she thought he missed it so much orhe missed his own niche of medicine he was already busy helping the elderly doctor on the island with his workload it wasnt the medicine he was trained for but that was the medicine he was reading up on finally they were there athens it was all she could do not to sit with her nose squashed against the car window athens the world not a seasoned traveller stefanos teased and she flushed sure i am i just like looking and then as they swung off the road into a huge car park she frowned where are we its a hospital he said ive arranged an appointment for your hip stefanos she was almost rigid with shock youve interfered enough no he said not enough i know i handled this badly i know i should have gained your permission before i accessed your records but whats done is done im sorry but if id told you about this appointment i was afraid youd refuse to come youd be right then im justified he hesitated but his look was stern elsa this is only a doctors appointment im not chaining you to a bed and operating regardless he gave a rueful smile actually that might be beyond even my level of intrusion but i am one of only two doctors on khryseis and before i go back to new york i need to know youre not doing permanent damage this mans an orthopaedic surgeon the best in athens you need to see him you still should have asked me im asking you now this is my honour elsa and its also sense he said stern again i know i upset youobtaining your medical history without permissionbut it doesnt stop the need i need you to do thisfor you it would be childish for you to refuseno no elsayou will do this she had no choice he was rightshe was being childish but it didnt make it any easier to swallow her temper she followed him into the hospital fuming he was recognised doors opened for him the receptionist of this bestinathensorthopaedicsurgeon practically genuflected you can go right in your highness the doctors expecting you but to her surprise stefanos didnt go in he simply smiled at her gave her a gentle push towards the door and settled his long frame into a waiting room chair as if he had all the time in the world she stared down at him stunned what he said looking up and then he wont bite elsa i thought as he might want to examine you i should stay out here but if youre scared the door was opening behind her she wheeled round and an elderly doctor was smiling a greeting dr murdoch come on in and then he smiled across at stefanos steve welcome home when are you coming home for good my boy by christmas but not to work in neurosurgery the older man said looking suddenly concerned ive heard youll let that go i had this young man working with me for a while as he was training and i was in the states he told elsa it was an honour and a pleasure to work with one so talented he turned back to stefanos but nowto abandon your neurosurgerythere must be some way you can fit that into your new life theres not stefanos said the islands far too small could you work in athens theres a need here no stefanos said abruptly pleaseleave it its elsa were concerned about here not me but what a waste he said softly and then he turned back to elsa well then what has to be has to be meanwhile come with me young lady and lets see what needs to be done about that hip he was as stefanos had promised very good he examined her with care and with skill he already had the xrays from brisbanea fact that made elsa gasp again with indignation but that shouldnt reflect on this kindly doctor she let him take his time carefully assess and then tell her what she wanted to hear youre doing no real harm to the hip itself but it does need to be repaired and it will give you pain until that happens so i can wait she said thankfully can you tell that to stefanos you want me to call him in yes please she said tugging on her shoes tell him and let me get on with my life so stefanos came in he listened while the doctor outlined exactly what he thought but you know this the doctor told stefanos youve seen the scans im too close to treat elsa myself you are the doctor said gently and youd need first rate surgical facilities on that island of yours to be able to do it you know thats what you really need a stateoftheart suite of operating theatres cuttingedge techniques all the things i hear youre doing in new york and an island like khryseis would support that how i have no idea the doctor said sadly and he turned to elsa and smiled this man tries to save the world and i wish i could help him but of course hes right we can only do what we can do so lets do that young lady we need to get your surgery scheduled when but you just said i said the operations not urgent that means it doesnt have to be done as soon as possible the only way to keep you painfree is to give you so much opiate as to risk addiction and i suspect you made the decision some time ago to live with the pain but because its hurting youre not weightbearing evenly that will cause longterm back problems theres tenderness already in the lower spine and im concerned therell be too much pressure on the muscles around the lower vertebrae so when can we schedule surgery we cant elsa gasped i can be back here in seven weeks stefanos said ignoring her can we schedule it just after christmas they left the hospital grounds without speaking elsa should have been furious she tried to dredge up fury all the way to the shops but instead she simply felt bleak the cab stopped stefanos paid she got out and looked around herand she decided there and then to cheer up she was here shopping for a gorgeous dress this was obviously where the wealthy women of athens shopped indignationand bleakness on stefanoss behalfwould have to wait until later what are we waiting for she said do you have the royal credit card i believe i do then lets not let the little pet get cold she said and dived happily into the first shop it was as if her visit to the doctor had unleashed something in her that had needed to be unleashed for a long time her exultationdizzy bordering on hysterialasted until she was standing in front of a mass of mirrors wearing a gown that fitted her like a second skin crimson silk shimmering and lustrous flecked with strands of glittering silver the gown had shoestring straps the bodice clinging and curving around her lovely body then falling in generous folds to sweep the floor she gazed into the mirror in incredulity she met stefanoss gaze in the mirror and stared at him as if he were part of the same fairy tale then she seemed to come to earth with a crash she dragged her gaze from hisand lifted the price tag and yelped well take it stefanos said and grinned as her mouth dropped open hed obviously put aside his bleakness as well one gown down half a dozen to godear he said ddear she spluttered sorry he said and smiled the salesgirl was looking on with incredulous delight you want more maybe the others dont need to be quite so formal stefanos decreed but we do want at least three more and what about some sexy lingerie to go with them sexy lingerie its in the royal nanny dress code he said straightfaced dont tell me you havent read it but i dont need you do need what about your third world kids she demanded dont you need all your money for them theyre not watching he said quick buy stefanos tell you what he said with magnanimity for every dollar you spend on your wardrobe ill donate ten more to my third world medical network i cant say fairer than that now can i so if you refuse to spend youre doing an orphan out of medical treatment stef you want to start calling me steve he asked and suddenly his tone was gentle no she said and then more strongly no youre stefanos prince stefanos and im the nanny but im a nanny who wont say no to a dress or two then she blushed oror even lingerie but stefanos yes you know when you stayed outside while i saw the doctor yes step outside your highness she said smiling sweetly in the interest of third world aid i need to discuss knickers hed booked them into a hotel at first she was incredulous the taxi dropped them outside the most lavish hotel she could imagine she stared out at the ancient grecian columnshow had they incorporated them into a modern hoteland then she gazed back at stefanos for a moment she said nothing and thenten times the cost to a third world orphan you have my word he said solemnly my orders are for you to have fun tonight thats all i ask ill wear my second best frock she said and then more cautiously still i didnt think we were staying the night i dont have a toothbrush i believe these things are obtainable for a small fee he said multiplied by ten of course and you did buy enough lingerie to keep you respectableor maybe not respectablefor a month she blushed how did you know i bought hed been out of the shop how you gave me the receipt he told her so i could multiply by ten right she said and blushed some more then okay so ill buy a toothbrush then she had another thought and her blush moved from pink to crimson but somehow she made herself sound stern but its definitely separate rooms separate suites he corrected her oh of course she said and suddenly she giggled this is ridiculous i have a feeling there hasnt been enough ridiculous in your life i dont need it you know im very sure you do he said gently and maybe the same goes for me maybe we both need a good dose of crazy they ate by candlelight in the hotel restaurant with a view over all of athens a view to die for food to die for a man to die for the setup was so corny she half expected an orchestra to materialise at any minute and strike up with love me tender or something equally soppy and just as she thought it a pianist slipped behind a grand piano and started playing not love me tenderbut close she was wearing her second best dress which was a fantasy of audrey hepburn proportions pale lemon silk with tiny white polka dots tiny waist huge skirt cleavage shed twisted her hair into a casual knot trying for audreys look she thought she looked a bit scruffy for the audrey look but stefanoss long lingering gaze when hed come to her room to accompany her downstairs said she didnt look scruffy at all she was still nervous stupidly nervous should we be talking politics she asked as the waiter brought them plate after plate of food shed never tasted before but would taste forever in her dreams no politics about zoe then no children about your medicine my turtles nothing he said softly just you well theres a boring night she said feeling breathless theres nothing to talk about there we could dance he suggested as the pianist started a soft waltz in the background right and my hip let me dance for you he said he stood up and held her hands and tugged her to her feet i cant you can take your shoes off and put your feet on mine thats ridiculous not ridiculous at all trust me elsa dance with me then he took her into his armsand waltzed he moved with the effortless grace of a panther a dancer who knew every move and who knew how to take her with him she hadnt danced since shed injured her hip shed hardly danced before then but it didnt matter her feet were on his he was holding her weight so her hip didnt hurt so she could move with him as one with him in this slow and lovely dance as if she weighed nothing how had she got herself here shed agreed to buy one dress and nowshe was being seduced seduced no this was payola for what shed agreed to do he was giving her a very nice time and if it was seductionshe didnt care she thought suddenly what did it matter if her employer seduced her employers did these things princes did these things umno elsa murdoch didnt do these things did you dance with your husband he murmured into her earand the fairy tale stopped right then right there pardon she froze in his arms her feet slipped off his and she could have cried she was on solid earth again and the lovely dance had ended i didnt mean to remind me of matty im very sure you did but he was looking confused as if hed been in a kind of dream as well i did dance with matty she said jutting her chin we danced very well you loved matty with all my heart and you grieve for him still iyes what was a girl to say to that after all but something went out as she said ita light an intensity in stefanoss gaze and its going meant grief how could she say shed loved her husband but she was ready to move on how could she think it youll dance again when your hips healed he was saying softly i wont she muttered coming back to earth with a crash i shouldnt elsa i dont want to think about matty she whispered not here not with you they were alone on the dance floor there were maybe ten or so tables occupied but the lights were low the other two couples whod danced with them to begin with had left and there was now just the two of them the pianist had shifted from waltz music to something soft and dreamlike and wonderful there was nothing between them only a whisper of breath only a whisper of fear elsa he murmured and her name was a question his hands slipped from the lovely waltz hold so they were in the small of her back elsa he said for the third time and he bent his headand he kissed her it was a long lingering kiss deep and wonderful hot and warm and strong demanding caressing questioning it was a kiss like shed never been kissed before she was standing in the middle of a dance floor her arms around his neck and she was being kissed as shed always dreamed she could be kissed she was being kissed as shed wanted to be kissed all her life matty stefanos himself had pulled her husband into the equation he was with her stillmaybe he always would be his kisses had been just as wonderful but differentso different another dream another life he wasnt stopping her kissing right back this was the most wonderful dream her hip didnt hurt her worries about zoe were ended she wasnt responsible for anything for anything for anything he was lifting her so he could deepen the kiss cradling her loving her and she thought her heart might well burst as she realised she was so in love with him in love with him she elsa was in love with a prince wasnt cinderella only in story books and almost as soon as the thought was with her the spell was broken people wereclapping she twisted confused within the circle of stefanoss arms and found the tables of diners were all watching them smiling applauding its prince stefanos from khryseis someone called out in laughing good humour with the princesss nanny oh right she pulled back as if shed been burned and stefanos let her go to arms reach but he was still smiling smiling and smiling not the nanny he murmured elsa in your dreams she muttered and it was so close to what was real that she almost gasped not in his dreams in her dreams stefanos im falling in love with you he said simply and strongly and she gasped again you cant im just youre just elsa youre the most beautiful woman ive ever met youre kidding me right she demanded i have freckles eighteen eighteen eighteen freckles i love every one of them elsa ive been trying to figure where we can take this where we if we were to marry he said and her world stilled again mmarry i didnt come prepared he said ruefully i should be going down on one knee right now with a diamond the size of a house in my pocket but ive only just thought of it alexandros said i needed a wife and hes right youve had too much champagne no he said and then more strongly no i know what i want elsa and i want you because alexandros said i dont think i did that very well he said ruefully believe it or not its far less about alexandros than about eighteen freckles eighteen freckles are hardly a basis for marriage i believe youre wrong he said gravely but we could work on other attractions do you possibly think you could love me i know you loved matty i know you still love matty ill always honour that butis it possible that i couldgrow on you like a wart she said cautiously something like that he agreed he smiled and chuckling pulled her close butbut this might be the magic shed longed for but there were buts surfacing in all directions stefanos no she tugged away again trouble surfacing in all directions they were being watched she knew but the piano was still playing softly in the background and maybe they were more private here than if they went back to their table will you be my wife he asked solidly and strongly and there it was a proposal to take her breath away the but was still there forcing her hand no she said no im not changing direction again she stood mute and troubled notnot while you dont know where youre going i do know where im going you dont she was frantically trying to think this through to be sensible when she wanted to be swept away in fantasy only fantasy was for fairy tales and this was real stefanos the problem isyouve committed yourself to staying on the island and youre making the best of it but thats not what i want you making the best of it its not such a bad deal he said puzzled if it includes you im not the consolation prize i would never suggest no you wouldnt she whispered of course not youre too noble and too wonderful and too she hesitated too just plain fabulous the problem is stefanos that even though im falling in love with youand i ami cant see you tied even more to the island tell meyoure thinkingor you have been thinkingthat maybe you can take some slabs of time away maybe you can do some teaching not when youre needed on the island of course but if we can get more doctors if the politics are settledyoure thinking that arent you yes but but i dont think thatll make you happy she said i think thats going to tear you further apart for youll lose your skills youll see others go where you want to go she hesitated stefanos when matty died and i couldnt do what we were doing with coral any morei know it sounds simplistic and silly in the face of what youre doing but it was important to me and i couldnt just do a little bit it would have eaten at me i had to move on i think he said steadily that in marrying you i would be moving on i wont be the cause she said in no way she bit her lip stefanos do what you have to do and then decide you want to marry me if you were to do that i am already youre not she shook her head i cant make you see i dont even know whether i understand it myself but in the bottom of my heart it does make sensethat i say no that i say wait that i say loving isfor when its right she hesitated matty and i matty you asked me about matty she said maybe i do need to tell you just as we finished university matty inherited his fathers company his mother sobbed and said he had to come home and run it so he didhis entire extended family seemed to depend on him and it seemed the only right thing to do he loved me so i went with him but it almost destroyed us for two years i worked on my research while matty selfdestructed and in the end he handed the entire company over to his cousins it left us broke his family thought he was mad but you know what stefanos the one thing i do knowwhen he was killed i thought of those wasted two years youre saying im saying i dont want the heartache of those two years again stefanos oh i want you i dont deny i want youmy love for matty hasnt stopped me feeling more for you than i ever thought i could again but i will follow my own drum and i wont watch you selfdestruct while you follow someone elses so what do you propose i do he said bleakly work it out she said steadily for yourself and for me please stefanos he didnt understand he was seeing her distress but not seeing it either she thought maybe he was only seeing what he wanted to see the cinderella bit the fantasy whereas what she wanted was more love at first sight no love for ever all at once she felt tired weary of the pain in her hip weary of worry weary of the pain inside her heart itd be so good to do just what she wanted she thought to have the world magically transformed so she could sink into her princes kisses and let herself have a happy ever after stefanos he was fighting to change the world she thought he was fighting himself she didnt have the courage to stand by his side as he did it it was too much too soon too scary it was yet another direction but this one was so big so terrifying that if she got it wrong it could destroy them all and if she didnt get it rightif she wasnt sure if she jumped with her heart before her head said it could followwhere would that leave them all oh but she wanted to she mustnt i need to go to bed she whispered youve paid me the most extraordinary compliment a compliment its so much more it is isnt it she whispered bleakly and she stood on tiptoe and kissed him lightly on the lips a feather touch a kiss he didnt understand i know you dont follow what im sayingi hardly understand what im saying myself i only know thati dont know if i can face your demons with you stefanos maybe i need more courage than i have goodnight and thank you and i love you and before he could respond shed turned and fled from the dance floor she didnt stop until she reached her suite until she was inside with the door locked behind her chapter twelve on a sunkissed afternoon in early november the crowns of khryseis were bestowed on zoe and on stefanos crown princess zoe of khryseis was seated on a throne too large for her her dress was pure fantasy she looked adorable she looked very very scared only the fact that her cousin was standing right beside her gave her the courage to stay stefanos prince regent of khryseis the isle of gold had vowed to defend his little cousin care for her and cherish her and take care of her interests until she reached twentyfive years of age stefanos looked magnificent zoe looked exquisite elsa was looking not too bad herself she conceded thinking what a waste why spend all this money on her fabulous gown if her nose was about to turn red but she was fighting tears and crown princess lily of sappheiros glanced sideways at her and smiled and passed over a handkerchief this is dumb elsa whispered embarrassed i shouldnt be here in the front row with you im not even royalty hey ive only been royalty for a couple of months now lily said and from what ive heard youre even closer to zoe than stefanos elsa sniffed the archbishop was watching stefanos sign before his little cousin now it looked so official it looked like another world she could have been up there beaming and waving and being royal too as stefanoss wife her reasons for refusing him were sounding weaker and weaker it was just as well he hadnt proposed again she thought any pressure and she might well cave right in hes gorgeous lily whispered thoughtfully watching elsas face he is she looked dubiously at the handkerchief i need to blow my nose go right ahead lily said grandly i came supplied with hankies in bulk theyre monogrammed with the royal crest elsa nearly dropped it lily giggled and suddenly elsa was smiling again albeit through tears what was royalty but individuals doing the best they could the vows that zoe and stefanos had just madethey werent taking them away from her or no further than they already were and she was right not to join them her doubts still stood the signing was done the orchestra was starting its triumphant chorus a blaze of sound proclaiming that khryseis finally had its own royal family stefanos helped zoe to her feet zoe stood looking out nervously at the vast audience in front of her stefanos held her hand stooped and whispered to her zoe stared up at him then out at the people in front of her and then at a signal from stefanos the music suddenly died zoe took a deep breath she turned back to stefanos as if for approval of something prearranged and she looked straight at elsa i need my elsa she said in a high clear voice elsa can you come up and walk beside me quick blow lily muttered urgently and your nose isnt even red youre beautiful he walked out of the cathedral behind them zoe and elsa his little cousin and her beautiful guardian elsas eyes were looking distinctly watery he wasnt surprised his eyes were feeling distinctly watery too elsa should be walking by his side it felt wrong hed rushed it hed pushed her too hard too fast ripping her out of her comfort zone asking the world of her and then asking her to extend that world zoe was happy again shed been coached with care and kindness and she knew exactly what was expected of her today elsa had raised her beautifully he thought when shed spoken her responses it had been with the gravity of one twice her age so much of that was down to elsas care her constant assurances that zoe was beautiful that the scars and the pain were only skin deep and what was underneath was beauty and joy if hed got it right he could have been walking down the aisle with elsa with zoe between them hed messed it upbadly but he had time he thought he could try again only elsa was right his doubts about what he was doing were still there khryseis needed him his work in manhattan was still calling elsa had the courage to change direction and move steadily forward he kept glancing back elsa knew him better than he knew himself and knowing him she had the sense not to want to be his wife isnt stefanos beautiful zoe was so close to sleep she could barely form words but shed stayed until the last speech had been made shed sat attentive and courteous and elsa was so proud of her she was close to bursting but now shed retired to elsas knee for a hug the hug had turned into a cradling cuddle and it was clear the little girl just wanted to drift off to sleep they were watching stefanos say farewell to the dignitaries stefanos as theyd first seen him only grander i dont have to be scared of being a princess when hes here zoe whispered i wish he wasnt going away me too elsa whispered for what the heck there was no point in lying not even to herself do you think hell come and live with you and me for ever and ever hes said he will maybe not with us but near us thats good zoe whispered her whisper fading so that elsa could hardly hear but ill miss him and miss him and so will buster and so will i elsa told her and watched her close her eyes and drift off into sleep i think i might miss him so much i might have to think about changing direction all over again only of course there was no time for direction changing no opportunity no chance a call came through that night stefanos needed to be in new york within twentyfour hours there were so many things to do documents to sign authority to delegatehe moved as fast as he could elsa woke at dawn to a light tap on her door and it was stefanos come to say goodbye she stood at her bedroom door in her lovely new lingerie feeling shocked bereft and stupidly frightened you will come back she murmured she must have sounded needy for stefanos took her hands in his and tugged her into his arms before she could resist of course ill be back ill be here by christmas he was as she loved him most in his casual jeans an old leather jacket slung over his shoulder unshaven a man in a hurry hell elsa i wish i didnt have to go but these kidsi cant knock them back i so wish you could work from here and we both know that i cant of course the population of khryseis could never support the medical facilities this man needed youll keep zoe safe and our turtles and buster i promise christmas in australias hot isnt it he said you think we can do an australian christmas dinner amys christmas cake she said before she thought about it amys cake this was crazy standing in her bare feet talking to a man she loved with all her heart about her best friends cake its a berry ice cream cake she said amy was so proud of itit was a tradition started by the women in her family who couldnt bear a hot christmas pudding shed start a month before christmas finding berries then building layer upon layer of berry ice cream each layer a different flavour by christmas we might have ten layers then wed turn it out and decorate it with more berries shed make a berry coulis to pour over it was so big sometimes itd last until well into january so you make it every year not she hesitated not since amy died berries are expensive i see he said gravely and took her hands in his then heres my royal decree you use the royal card again to buy as many berries as you needimport them grow themwhatever you have to do to get them you get them and make us amys christmas cake and well eat it well into january he was smiling into her eyes and his smile might as well be a kiss andshe felt like crying is there anything you want me to bring from new york he said maybe seeing her need to be practical to get over the emotion as if she could come home via australia and bring me my cats she said trying desperately to joke i miss them its a bit of a detour youre the prince regent so i am he said and smiled his crooked heartflipping smile then stood looking down at her for a long long moment as his smile faded a door slammed below stairs someone called to him and he swore i have to go will you say goodbye to zoe for me i cant wake her yet of course i will travel safe she smiled i was teasing about the cats i know you were he gave an almost imperceptible nod as though her cats and his safety were inconsequential as if there was something more important hed decided to say elsa just go i will he said but instead he tugged her close and she had neither strength nor will to resist he pulled her tight into his arms against his chest and he kissed her hard and long and aching with need and then he put her away from him ggo she managed i love you he said loudly and strongly into the morning but still he turned and he went she wanted to sob or maybe something louder shed actually quite like to stomp a bit toss the odd pillow yell but zoe and buster were fast asleep she should be too what else was she to do she neednt worry about breakfast it would be on the table in a couple of hours a choice of eight or so dishes eat what you like and certainly dont worry about the cost she was zoes friend and guardian only zoe already had a friend after christmas zoe would try the little school that stood just by the castle gates what was a woman to do then research her turtles and dont deviate become a world authority stay facing in the one direction hope stefanos could find a direction too one that could fulfil his dreams and hope with everything in her heart that his direction matched hers she loved him there wasnt a lot she could do about it flying out of the door wailing wait for me wait for me would hardly be appropriate or sensible or even possible so go back to sleep until its time for the royal day to begin start making amys christmas cake wait for her prince to come home it was a direct flight from athens to new york the details of his surgical list had been faxed through to him so he had a mass of reading to do on the way he leafed through the first case and then the secondand then found himself staring sightlessly ahead superimposed on the printed pages was the vision of elsas tousled curls her bare feet as shed opened the door to say goodbye more than anything else hed wanted to sweep her into his arms take her back to her bed and stay with her for ever and ever and ever shed knocked back his proposal of marriage he was trying to understand her reasons hed spoken too early one night in athens hadnt been enough her hip had been hurting he needed to have her healed and then take her away properlya weekend in paris maybe or a month in paris or new york there was his dream manhattan and elsa ormore he thought manhattan and elsa and zoe and buster his familysomething hed never thought he wanted but now he had such a hunger for that he couldnt see past it buthe had to stay in khryseis and that was the problem he thought elsa knew better than he did that marriage to her would make things better for him but shed knocked back his proposal he had to make things better himself excuse me but are you prince stefanos of khryseis the man in the next seat had been glancing at him covertly since takeoff small a bit unkempt wearing halfrimmed glasses and the air of a scholar hed been reading notes that looked even more dense than those stefanos had been studying i am stefanos said warily because admitting to being royalty was usually asking for trouble so youre the one who seduced our dr elsa from her studies pardon what the hell this man looked angry shes brilliant the man said ignoring stefanoss incredulity she has one of the most brilliant scientific minds in australia in the world she and that husband of hersthe research they did on the preservation of the great barrier reef was groundbreaking if shed kept it up it could have made her a professor in any of the most prestigious universities in the world and then she just hands it over hands it over i dont know what you mean stefanos said her work the man said impatiently and then suddenly seemed to remember his manners david hemming he said professor of marine studies atwell never mind it doesnt matter all i know is that ive never seen such a generous act she had all the research done all the hard work she was just starting to see the academic rewards and suddenly a letter arrives out of the blue saying she can no longer go on with her studies but she doesnt want her research wasted so here it is take it and publish as you see fit just take it forward well i tell you theres at least eight international experts now who are international experts only because of dr langhams generosity dr langham we could never find her he said morosely only then we started hearing about starfish researchreally interesting stuffand dammit there she was only she was calling herself elsa murdoch but just as we were finding out what she was doing dammit if she didnt do exactly the same again package it all up and pass it on no honours for her just good solid research thatll mean species will survive that were otherwise facing extinction and now hed been building up indignation incense personified and stefanos got poked in the chest with a pencil and now shes off again but at least its turtles this time kemps ridley by what i hear and you couldnt get a better woman working on them you know what she sees the big picture already shes contacting international institutions trying to broaden our understanding if shes found this breeding site there must be more shell use that to make them safe how pure energy he said stabbing stefanos again only dont you let her give her work away this time if she settlesif shes allowed to settlethen im guaranteeing those blessed turtles will be safe for a thousand years such is the commitment she generates so you might have seduced her to your island but you make sure she stays or i and half the marine academics in the world will want to know why not and with a final poke in the chest he retired back to his notes leaving stefanos winded stunned the vision of elsa as hed last seen her was still with himbeautiful almost ethereal a freckled imp with her glorious sunblonded curls with her face creasing from laughter to gravity from teasing to earnestness from joy tolove to loss if hed met her when she was twenty when life was simple when she was free to fall in love then maybe hed have stood a chance he knew that for hed looked into her eyes and what he saw there was a reflection of what he believed himself that she was falling in love with him as deeply as he was falling in love with her only life had got complicated hed thought it was complicated for him how much more complicated was it for her shed buried a husband shed said goodbye to two careers shed taken on a child so injured that shed needed almost a hundred per cent commitment and that at a time when elsa was injured herself and along came prince stefanos grudgingly changing direction this once hating the idea that hed be handing over his work his teaching his skills watching others take his work forward while he ceased to be able to contribute she knew his commitment was grudging she had so much generosity of spirit herself that she must know it hed enjoy family medicine he thought and doing everything else he could to help khryseis as a doctor and as the islands prince regent he must hed immerse himself into it all convince elsa that he was content only she knew him he couldnt lie to her and it wasnt entirely the work he wanted to do khryseis wasnt big enough for the medical work he wanted to do but for some reason the academics words stuck hit a chord you know what she sees the big picture khryseis was one of three islands put together he needed to concentrate on these cases hed be operating hours after landing he needed to read his notes but there were things happening in his head apart from his most pressing concerns major things the image came to him of the night hed held the three tiny turtle hatchlings in his hand i guess if they walked far enough the ocean is thataway hed said yeah but changing directions easier shed whispered i ought to know could he somehow change direction but get to the same place by another route there wasnt time to think this through now those kids were lined up waiting for him but he had six weeks to think how much did he want elsa and zoe and khryseis and turtles and cats and amys christmas cake which for some weird reason was becoming a really big thing to look forward to how much did he want them all he lifted his third set of case notes and tried to read but all he saw was elsa chapter thirteen they coped without him it was a strange thing caring for a child whod been dependent for years but who was finally finding her wings zoe couldnt wait to get out of bed in the morning to meet her new friend to play with buster to be allowed to start school medical constraints always suffered stoically were now a nuisance to be ignored she bounced around the palace with growing confidence and pleasure and by christmas there wasnt a member of the palace staff who wouldnt have given their right arm for her zoe was gloriously in love with this new life so was elsa sort of she and helena were working through the issues with the turtles with cautious exhilaration there was so much to be done the turtles habitat had been destroyed once and only part of it had regrown turtles were crossing roads to dig their nests there were threats everywhere and this for a world endangered species making them safe was imperative extrapolating the research was breathtakingly exciting she could make a difference there were so many things she could do but she wanted to be with stefanos every morning she woke rethinking his proposal was she crazy shed turned down a man she could love with all her heart she knew it was more than that but that was the problem her head knew things her heart didnt necessarily agree with will stefanos be home for christmas zoe asked for about the thousandth time since hed left and for the thousandth time she replied he said he would be hes phoning us as often as he can sweetheart and he doesnt seem to be changing his mind and then hes going to stay with you while i have my hip fixed i dont want you to go away she didnt want to go away either but it was organised the day after new year shed fly to athens and spend a month in hospital she should be grateful she was grateful zoe was happy and blooming there were no money problems she had work that truly interested her and her hip was about to be treated so why was a part of her so miserable happy christmas she told herself fiercely on christmas eve as she helped zoe hang her stocking in front of the vast fireplace in the great hall last year shed used a sock in front of the firestove this year the housekeeper had handstitched zoe a gold and crimson stocking with the most beautiful appliquéd father christmas and elves and reindeer it looked beautiful on the great mantel but despite the massive christmas tree the staff had set upor maybe because of itit looked really alone you should have a stocking too zoe said as shed said every christmas since theyd been together stockings are for kids you never get presents stefanos should be home thatll be a present for both of us he should be here now zoe said severely it was almost bedtime on christmas eve shed counted on her big cousin coming today he said hed come maybe hell come in the night like santa claus elsa said maybe we wont see him come if we stay up you think we should go to bed why not she was weary of waiting herself she was riding an emotional roller coaster and didnt know how to get off if stefanos didnt comehed promised zoe hed promised her okay zoe said infinitely trusting she tucked her hand into elsas and tugged her towards the stairs lets go to bed and make it come quicker he had so much to do he felt like santa claus zooming across the world at midnight actually he was only flying from athens to khryseis on the seaplane but he did feel a bit like santa he had so many gifts in his pack he sat next to the pilot gazed out at the blueblack sky and the stars hanging low and lovely in the heavens and he felt that a little bit of magic was around he needed magic in his pocket was a ring almost worthy of the woman he lovedthe ancient ring of khryseis plaited gold with three magnificent diamonds embedded in its depths she wouldnt take it unless she accepted the rest of his sleigh load he thought ruefully a woman of principle was the woman hed chosen to give his heart would she take it hed done so much if there was anything else he could doanything at all he had a mad compulsion to tell the pilot to turn the plane around so much was at stake the woman hed chosen as his lifes partner had knocked him back because of her principles if he didnt get it right this time what else could he do the lights of khryseis came into view and the plane started its descent he could see the palace from here lit up like a fairy palace thatd be the staff celebrating christmas he thought the whole staffthe whole islandwas overjoyed to have their royal family in residence or their royal princess and her nanny he corrected himself for a family required more would she accept him now she must for years hed scorned the idea of a family now it seemed he couldnt live without it hed met one feisty beautiful nanny and his world had changed coming in to land now sir the pilot said looking ahead at the palace lights seems someones keeping the home fires burning i hope so he murmured i think every person on the island hopes so the pilot said enigmatically welcome home your highness santas been and stefanos is home elsa woke to find zoe bouncing up and down on her bed the longsuffering buster being bounced with her come and see come and see come and see santas been santas been santas been despite the tumult of emotions shed gone to bed with and woken withstefanos is homeshe had to smile zoe had been just as excited last year when all shed been able to give her were a couple of handmade toys shed bought at a local market this year should be fun stefanos is home its humungous zoe was saying you should see how can santa have brought it down the chimney humungous nothing shed stuffed in zoes stocking could be described as humungous and stefanos is home stefanos she said cautiously he got home really late christina told me he snuck in after all the staff went to bedalmost morning elsa you have to get up and see what santas brought me so stefanos would be asleep that gave her breathing space shed have time to enjoy zoes stocking with her before she needed to face him it wasnt that she didnt want to see him she thought feeling really confused not exactly there was a big part of her that ached for him there was another part of her that was just plain custard but he was asleep hooray she threw back the covers pulled on a robe and padded downstairs shed never get used to the opulence of this place the staircase was wide enough to fit ten people abreast the king who built this place must have been as fat as a whale she told zoe or he had ten kids to take by the hand every christmas morning zoe giggled and they were both still chuckling as zoe hauled open the double doors to the great hall she stopped dead how long since shed believed in santa claus when theyd gone to bed the christmas tree was a decorator item set up by the staff as a tasteful ode to christmas nowwhoever had come during the night had turned the tree into an over the top muddle the exquisite decorations and silver lights were still under there somewhere but they were now almost hidden hung over the top of them were rows and rows of coloured popcorn threaded together and hung in vast ribbons of garish colour there were paper lanternsevery colour of the rainbow pictures of cats had been placed in tiny silver frames and hung as ornaments there was a collection of motley socks hanging everywhere all bulging the socks have got apples in them zoe said awed tugging her towards the tree that ones a football sock and that one has a hole in the toe and look at my present she was seeing it stunned it was a trampoline an eminently bouncy mat built with a net canopy around it so a child could bounce without fear of falling for a child who needed to be encouraged to stretch scar tissuefor a child who loved bouncingit was the best thing and you have a stocking too zoe said deeply satisfied look she looked on the mantelpiece hung three stockings zoes was bulging with nonsense gifts a tin whistle a boomeranga boomeranga clockwork mouse more pictures of cats and there was a stocking labelled elsa a small parcel bulged in the toe a document rolled and tied with a huge red bow was sticking out the end and there were more pictures of cats the stocking labelled stefanos was empty we should have something for stefanos zoe said anxiously santa didnt come to him we have a couple of gifts in our room elsa said uncertainly we could sneak up and put them in his stocking before he wakes its too late for sneaking said a low gravelly voice and she yelped the voice had come from behind the vast christmas tree zoe darted behind in a flash stefanos she shouted hes here elsa hes here sleeping behind the tree i always sleep behind the tree a sleepy voice murmured full of laughter for years and years but ive never yet caught santa claus has he come hes come hes come zoe was squealing with excitement and hes brought crazy socks elsa hes here stefanos is here come and see there wasnt a choice she should have at least brushed her hair she thought desperately as she tried to organise her smile to be cool and welcoming she walked cautiously around the tree and there he was hed hauled a mattress downstairs and a mound of bedding he was lying back smiling up at them his blankets pulled only to his waist barechested breathtakingly gorgeous buster was on his stomach already kneading his blankets with her soft paws and purring so hard youd swear shed recognised him zoe was snuggling down beside him a little girl with everything she wanted in life youve messed with our christmas decorations she muttered before she could stop herself and his grin widened i threaded popcorn all the way from new york to athens and i made half my fellow passengers help me the rest were on lantern duty and then it still looked a bit empty so santa had to resort to socks and a happy christmas to you too mrs murdoch dr langham my love there was a bit too much in that statement for elsa to think about she opened her mouth to reply and gave up and closed it again no happy christmas he said smiling at her evident confusion happy christmas she managed sounding winded whywhy arent you in your own bed i might have missed present opening have you opened your stocking yet he rolled out of bed hed gone to bed wearing boxer shorts only boxer shorts what more could a girl want for christmas she thought as she watched him stretch and yawn as she thought all sorts of things that surely a nicely brought up girla mature widowhad no business thinking had she opened her stocking nno she managed annoyed that her voice squeaked its bad form to open gifts until the familys together is the family together now he asked gently and he looked at zoe cradling buster and then he looked to her with such an expression that her heart did a double backflip landed on its back refused to start operating again in any mode she considered normal ii guess she muttered no guessing he said suddenly stern you need to be sure zoe im assuming youve guessed this very fine trampoline came squeezing down the chimney in the wee small hours especially for you would you like to try it out for size ooh yes zoe said and flew with buster to the trampoline only to be hauled back by her big cousin buster stefanos said firmly removing the longsuffering kitten from her arms stays on the ground only he didnt stefanos handed buster to elsa and then when her hands were safely occupied and she couldnt fend him off he kissed her just the once but the look in his eyes said there were more where that came from just the once but it was enough to light her world it appears im needing to send out a royal decree for mistletoe he growled his lovely crooked smile warming parts of her she hadnt known were cold honestly cant you people be depended on to organise anything she managed a chuckle but it was a pretty wavery chuckle she was toothrown happy christmas he said again and then obviously decided mistletoe was not absolutely essential and he kissed her again deeply this time long and hard and so wonderfully that finally zoe ceased bouncing put her hands on her hips and issued a royal decree of her own yuck she said and youre squashing buster stop kissing and open presents yes maam stefanos said and swept elsaand the slightly squished busterinto his arms and deposited them both on the settee by the tree then he lifted the rolled document out of the top of her stocking and handed it to her with such gravitas it was as if he was handing over royal title to his land and his kingdom for ever she looked up at him wondering but he was looking grave and expectant waiting for her to discover for herself what it was slowly she unfastened the ribbon holding the roll of documents together buster pounced on the ribbon she set both ribbon and buster on the floor and then looked up at stefanos again half afraid to go further well go on then he said in the same tone of impatience zoe had just used read it she read transfer of title of diamond mine number two on the isle of argyros the income from which to be used in perpetuity for the health of all the citizens of the diamond isles she stared up at him confused he smiled back at her and he didnt look confused in the least im changing my direction he said softly so im hopingif i head in the same direction as you can we walk together ii dont know what you mean he sat down beside her took the documents back and set them aside his face was suddenly grave elsa on the plane on the way to new york i met a man who knew you he told me about your research and you know what else he said about you he saidshe sees the big picture and he spoke in awe he meant you dont just look at the turtles on the beach that need saving you broaden your work you look at their survival internationally and i finally figured it out it was like id needed a swipe to the side of the head to wake me up and i finally got it thats what ive been guilty of seeing only whats before my eyes not thinking big seeing only my work in manhattan and how much it means but your work is important she said confused struggling to understand it is he agreed still grave laughter put aside as he tried to make her see elsa without conceit i can say my work changes lives so when i knew i had to work here i was gutted i knew i had no choicethe islanders are my people and then there was a new imperative youre my people youre my family elsa you and zoe i want you so muchand it was such a shock to realise i ached for a family i ached for you i was so committed to what i was feeling for you and to the needs of the islanders as well that id stopped thinking big it took one stray remark about how wonderful you were to make me rethink i dont think im following your logic she managed cautiously trying to focus on his words rather than the joy and love she was seeing in his eyes the joy and love that was building inside her she didnt know yet what he was talking about but the smile behind his eyes said it was good were too small he had her hands now holding her tight but now im thinking big elsa this document is a plan something about a diamond mine she ventured good one elsa intelligence wasnt on the agenda this morningnor was speed reading all she was seeing was stefanos absolutely its about a diamond mine my love he said and tugged her into his arms and kissed her again long and lingering and lovely but then he set her back from him there were still things that needed to be said there were things she didnt understand and he had to make her see there are six diamond mines on argyros he said softly while she listened in wonder argyros is therefore the wealthiest of the diamond isles but it has no hospital nikos has been talking to me about setting up decent medical facilities there its the same on sappheirosalexandros is already making plans for a hospital and then on the plane i made myself see the big picture separately were small islands we each need good medical facilities but we dont each have the population to set up a major base but together together its too big he said ruefully to land this on you on christmas morning but i cant wait any longer elsa i love you i want you more than life itself but ive already asked you to marry me what i need now is for you to know ive changed everythings changed except my love for you socan i tell you what weve decided the rulers of the other two islands and me how was a girl to react to that her heart was starting to sing bubbles of happiness were floating to the surface and filling the room with joy imim listening she whispered and suddenly so was zoe sitting crosslegged on her trampoline watching with big serious eyes she really was much older than her eight years elsa thought and then she thought that whatever was comingand already joy was starting to overwhelm herit was appropriate that zoe was here to bear witness she thought and then she thought that was a dumb thing to think but she thought it anyway earth to elsa stefanos said laughing softly and tightening his grip on her hands and she thought okay thoughts could come at some other time now was the time for listening its a medical scheme he told her and in his eyes was jubilation excitement a man about to embark on a boys own adventure a medical centre second to none will be built here on khryseis with satellite hospitals on the other two islands fast and easy transfer facilities every specialist we need together well care for the people of the diamond isles as they deserve to be cared for its what i dreamed of as a kid as did alexandros on sappheiros and nikos on argyros three crowns elsa three crowns finally come together to provide care for all oneone big medical centre she was struggling to take it in stateoftheart and with the islands being as lovely as they are and the salaries were prepared to pay we dont expect any trouble staffing them as they should be staffed we dont see islanders needing to go to athens for treatment any more we see mainlanders coming to us his hands moved to her shoulders holding her desperate for her to share his joy alex and nikos flew to new york to work this through with me for such a project for something so wonderful for all of us the diamonds on argyros will be needed but none of us can see a better use for them we envisage offering our medical facilities worldwide and more therell be resorts on each island that are half hotel half hospital come here and be pampered and made well and support our economy while you do he was so exultant now his excitement was practically blazing weve done the preliminary figures and the guys in suits agree with us he told her it will work and heres the tail elsa heres my huge joy with the money raised we believe we can still bring people here from third world countries ill be able to operate as ive been doing and ill be able to teach soso what do you think he paused then he was still holding her by the shoulders his eyes not leaving hers but nowhis excitement faded a little giving way to anxiety he was asking what she thought he was anxious about what shed think youd be here she whispered youd be doing the work you love id be doing all the work i love he said excitement giving way to gravity ill be ruling this island in zoes stead caring for it as it must be cared for ill be doing the medicine i loveill be making a difference and ill be sharing my life with you with me and with zoe he said his eyes lighting with laughter again this much joy couldnt be contained for more than a moment and our cats cats she said cautiously for she was starting to see a theme here there were pictures of cats all over the christmas tree cats plural i made a few calls to australia he said i figuredwell i hoped you might be staying here long term and the guy feeding your cats now has twentythree on his list twentythree she gasped it seems hes waratah coves answer to the pied piper of hamelin hes taken them on as his mission in life dont tell me youre bringing them here she managed zoe said ooh thats not an ooh elsa said torn between laughter and horror its an are you out of your mind i hoped you might say that stefanos said smiling into her eyes with such a look that she might just might be forced to forgive him twentythree catsor anything at all so what ive done is give the guy a job in perpetuity caring for them all with one exception one a skinny little black one he said apologetically i met him that first day when you guys were on the beach and i had to find you it seems hes been pining for youhes hardly eaten since you left and to tell you the truth i sort of fell for him so hes on his way here as we speak my love my love there was enough in those two words to be perfectly adequate thank you very muchshe hardly wanted more only zoe was made of sterner stuff she darted across to the mantelpiece and was flying back tipping the contents of elsas stocking at her feet you have another present and i have six maybe i ought to open some of mine first if you dont mind zoe stefanos said and lifted the tiny crimson box from where it had fallen so far elsas just had paper you have a trampoline and this is important elsa has a cat zoe said yes but hes not here yet so as yet shes giftless okay zoe said obligingly grabbing the longsuffering buster and squatting beside elsa but its really small open it fast elsa open it slow elsa stefanos said and watched as elsa forgot to breathe and tried to make fumbling fingers operate the catch of the tiny box let me stefanos said at last and flicked the clasp and there resting on a bed of black velvet was the most beautiful ring shed ever seen it was gnarled and twisted gold burnished with age and history with three magnificent diamonds set in its depthsdiamonds to take a girls breath away its the ancient ring of this island worn by the ruling princess of khryseis for generations stefanos said softly on her marriage ifif youd like to be married that is if youd like to be my princess he took a deep breath if youd like to be married to me its beeyootiful zoe breathed but elsa said nothing at all she couldnt she was so proud of him she was so in love with him he was giving her another chance you can always change it if you dont like it stefanos said anxious again if you fancy emeralds or something modern when zoe marries shell inherit it anyway so itd be good to have a backup anything you like my darling just say the word i believe the only thing nonnegotiable in this whole deal is who you get to marry and he dropped to one knee if its okay that is if you say yes elsa will you marry me she looked up from the ring he was kneeling before her her prince youre proposing in boxer shorts elsa managed i believe i was wearing a suit and tie last time i proposed look where that got me now im trying a different tack zoe if you run and get my camera i wouldnt mind this moment being documented elsa murmuredweaklyand stefanos grinned but he didnt shift from where he was kneeling zoe stared at them both as if they were crazy hes asking you to marry him i believei believe he is ican you get the camera yes she yelled and whooped in excitement and headed for the stairs i want to be a bridesmaid she called over her shoulder and continued whooping all the way up the stairs so now stefanos said starting to look longsuffering elsamy love but then he had to pause as the butlers long face appeared around the door good morning sir he said happy christmas welcome home will you be wanting breakfast josef stefanos said in a goaded voice yes sir youre a servant to the royal family right yes sir josef said taking in the tableau in front of him and grinning then you no doubt know about summary beheadings boiling in oil and the rest i have read my history excellent stefanos said then i command you to close that door and lean against it and let no one else in for fear of bloodcurdling retribution for the next ten minutes at least yes sir josef said and chuckled and closed the doors servants stefanos said you cant do anything with them these days now where were we exactly where we were two minutes ago i believe she said cautiously you want me to come down on the floor with you i want you to hush he said elsa stefanos will you marry me he said again and again the laughter was gone only love remained only the gravity of a promise to be made for ever and what was a girl to say to that well the obvious one for a start yes he blinked pardon yes i havent used all of my very cogent arguments yet im marrying you anyway andwhy would that be i believe i love you are you sure i cant come down there with you if you must he said and tugged her down so they were kneeling face to face under the christmas tree elsa i love you with all my heart thats exceedingly fortunate because i love you too really absolutely of course i love you more in tassels and with your dress sword and boots but im so far gone ill even love you in boxer shorts are you going to kiss me yet you dont want to know how much i love you you can start telling me she said and smiled as an imperious little voice sounded from the other side of the door they want me in there ive got the camera they really truly want me well i guess you cant tell me how much you love me anyway she said smiling and smiling and maybe even crying a little as well as he tugged her into his arms and held her close because i dont think well know how much we love each other until the end of eternity starting now stefanos said he sighed and called out okay let her in josef let em all in bring on the world the prince and his affianced wife are ready to receive visitors but not quite as josef swung the doors wide they were too busy to receive anyone for mrs elsa murdoch alias dr elsa langham had changed direction yet again the future princess elsa of khryseis was kissing her beloved prince as she intended kissing him for the rest of her life oh yuck zoe said in deep disapproval as she was finally admitted she waited and waited and finally looked around for something to distract her and why is stefanoss stocking empty she demanded of josef did santa forget him i believe his highness has his christmas gift the butler told her and smiled at the pair of them i believe his royal highness has his family the christening of christos mathew romanos antoniadis was an occasion of great joy for the island of khryseis the celebration was huge made more so because it coincided with the opening of the diamond isles medical base to be celebrated the next day the world had come to see to celebrate this wondrous occasion and to welcome these three islands into the twentyfirst century for the difference in these islands in the eighteen months since the old king had died and the new generation of royalty had taken power was nigh on unbelievable already the islanders were prospering the glittering diamond isles finally succeeding in becoming the magical place to live that theyd always promised this medical centre was the icing on the cakea symbol of all they hoped to achieve the staff it was attracting had caused its reputation to go before it and already there were mainlanders waiting to use it already the islanders knew that the network of medical centres could cope with their every need what was more the medical centre was only the start of the new order on every island there was employment optimism and joy and now on this day that joy was exemplified by the royal family of khryseis and this the christening of their new little son father antonio performed the ceremony and the shaky old priest whod loved the islanders for all his life blessed this baby with all the love in his heart afterwards elsa stood on the magnificent lawns of the palace grounds with her husband by her side with her baby in her arms and she thought the joy she was feeling right now could never be surpassed only of course it could joy is to come stefanos was standing with his arm round her waist greeting dignitary after dignitary accepting their congratulations smiling with a pride as deep as it was joyful there it was again that wordjoy zoe wasnt with them she and pip had slipped away up to the palace balcony to play with buster and spike elsa glanced up and saw them two little girls with two cats a zoe who was so confident with her new family that clinging was a thing of the past joy happy my love stefanos asked as the line of dignitaries finally came to an end how can you doubt it so he smiled into her eyes where do we go from here she smiled back at her beloved husband and she smiled again at her sleeping son where indeed another baby absolutely she whispered gazing down at the perfection of her little son more turtles oh yes another cat or two twos enough im thinking of a puppy is there room for a puppy with two cats stefanos asked startled and she grinned i think theres room for anything in our family she said this is the diamond isles place of miracles place of wonder home of our hearts and room for all this season we bring you christmas treats for an early
