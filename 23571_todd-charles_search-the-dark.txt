charles todd search the dark the murder appeared to be a crime of passion the killer having left a trail of evidence behind him that even a blind man might have followed it was the identity of the victim not the murderer that brought scotland yard into the case no one knew who she was or more correctly perhaps what name she might have used since and what had become of the man and the two children who had been with her at the railway station were they a figment of the killers overheated imagination or were their bodies yet to be discovered the police in dorset were quite happy to turn the search over to the yard and the yard was very happy indeed to oblige in the person of inspector ian rutledge it began simply enough with the london train pulling into the station at the small dorset town of singleton magna the stop there was always brief half a dozen passengers got off and another handful generally got on heading south to the coast a few boxes and sacks were offloaded with efficiency and the train rolled out almost before the acrid smoke of its arrival had blown away today late august and quite hot for the season there was a man standing by the lowered window in the secondclass car trying to find a bit of air his shirt clung to his back under the shabby suit and his dark hair lay damply across his forehead his face was worn dejection sunk deep in the lines about his mouth and in the circles under tired eyes he was young but youth was gone leaning out he watched the portly stationmaster helping a pale drooping woman to the gate the thin thread of her complaining voice just reaching him such hardship she was saying what did she know about hardship he thought wearily she had traveled first class and the leather dressing case clutched in her left hand had cost more than most men earned in a month if they were lucky enough to have a job there had been no work in london but hed heard there was a builder hiring down lyme regis way the train was a luxury bert mowbray couldnt afford still jobs didnt wait and you sometimes had to make the extra effort he refused to think what he would do if hed guessed wrong and there was nothing at the end of his journey but a grim shake of the head and no work sorry his gaze idly followed a porter awkwardly trundling his cart fall of luggage across the platform followed by a pair of elderly women the cars were already jammed with families on their way to the seaside but room was found for two more then his eye was suddenly caught by another woman outside one of the cars farther down the train kneeling to comfort a little girl who was crying a boy much younger not more than two clung to the trouser leg of the man bending protectively over them speaking to the woman and then to the little girl mowbray stared at the woman his body tight with shock and dismay it couldnt be mary my god he breathed oh my god turning from the window he lunged for the door almost knocking the widebrimmed hat from the head of a startled farmers wife who couldnt get out of his way fast enough he tripped over her basket losing precious seconds as he fought for his balance her companion stood up younger and stouter and demanded to know what he thought he was doing her red angry face thrust into his the train jerked under his feet and he realized it was moving pulling out no no wait he screamed but it was too late the train had picked up momentum and was already out of the small station a few houses flashing by before the town was swallowed up by distance and fields he was nearly incoherent with frustration and the intensity of his need he yelled for the conductor demanding that the train be stopped now the conductor a phlegmatic man who had dealt with drunken soldiers and whoring seamen during the war years said soothingly overslept your stop did you never mind theres another just down the road a bit but he had to restrain mowbray before they reached the next stationthe man seemed half out of his mind and was trying to fling himself off the train two burly coal stokers on their way to weymouth helped the conductor wrestle him into a seat while a primmouthed spinster wearing a motheaten fox around her shoulders never mind the heat threatened to collapse into strong hysterics mowbray had gone from wild swearing and threats to helpless angry tears by the time the train lurched into the next town he and his shabby case were heaved off without ceremony and he was left standing on the station platform disoriented and distraught without a word to the staring stationmaster he handed in his ticket for lyme regis and set off at a smart pace down the nearest road in the direction of singleton magna but the woman and children and man were gone when he got to the town and no one could tell him where to find them he went to the only hotel a small stone edifice called with more imagination than accuracy the swan demanding to know if a family of four had come in by the noon train he stopped at the small shops that sold food and the two tearooms nearest the station describing the woman first then the children and the man he badly frightened one clerk with his furious insistence that you must have seen them you must he tracked down the carriage that served as the town taxi and angrily called the driver a liar for claiming he hadnt set eyes on the woman or the man much less the children theyre not here mate the middleaged driver declared shortly jerking a thumb toward the back see for yourself nobody like that came out of the station today while i was waiting if you was to meet them here its your misfortune not mine may be that you got your dates wrong but they cant have vanished mowbray cried ive got to find them the bitch the bitch theyre my children shes my wife it isnt righti tell you if shes tricked me ill kill her i swear i will tell me where shes got to or ill throttle you as well you and who else the man demanded jaw squared and face flushed with an anger that matched mowbrays all afternoon he haunted singleton magna and a constable had to caution him twice about his conduct but the fires of anger slowly burned down to a silent whitehot determination that left him grimfaced and ominously quiet that evening he called at every house on the fringes of the town asking about the woman and the children had they come along this road had anyone seen them did anyone know where theyd come from or where they were going but the town shook its collective head and shut its collective doors in the face of this persistent shabby stranger with frantic eyes mowbray spent the night under a tree near the station waiting for the next days noon train he never thought of food and he didnt sleep what was driving him was so fierce that nothing else mattered to him he stayed in singleton magna all that day as well walking the streets like a damned soul that had lost its way back to hell and didnt know where to turn next people avoided him and this time he avoided people his eyes scanning for one figure in a rose print dress with a strand of pearls and hair the color of dark honey by the dinner hour he had gone hardly anyone noticed when a farmer discovered a womans body that evening the blood from her wounds had soaked deeply into the soil at the edge of his cornfield like some ancient harvest sacrifice he sent for the police and the police with admirable haste took one look at her there on the ground and ordered a warrant for the arrest of the man who had been searching for her although there was no identification on the body they were fairly sure she wasnt a local woman and the way her face had been battered there had been a hot desperate anger behind the blows the missing wife then had been found all that was left was to see that her murderer was brought to justice late that same evening mowbray was run to earth roughly awakened from an exhausted sleep under the same tree outside the railway station in a daze not understanding what was happening to him or why he allowed himself to be led off to the small jail without protest afterward the inspector in charge congratulating himself on the swift solution of this crime practically on his doorstep boasted to the shaken farmer on the other side of his tidy desk it was all in a days work just as it should be murder done murderer brought in cant stop crime altogether but you can stop the criminals thats my brief i thought he was the one hunting all over town for his lost family so he was silly bugger all but advertising what he was going to do when he found them but where are they then the husband and the children they arent somewhere in my fields are they i wont have your men tramping about in my corn do you hear not when its all but ready for the cutting my wife will have a stroke shes that upset already the doctors been and gone twice inspector hildebrand sobered he much preferred expanding on his success to any discussion of his failure we dont know where they are yet ive got my men searching now along the roadside more than likely hes done for the lot but so far hes sitting in his cell like a damned statue as if hes not hearing a word we say to him but well find them never fear and theyll be dead as well mark my words probably saved the woman for last she got away from him and he had to chase her just a matter of time thats all well find them in the end he didnt in the end it was scotland yard and inspector rutledge who had to sort through the tangled threads of deception and twisted allegiances by that time it was far too late for hildebrand to retreat from his entrenched position ian rutledge drove through the countryside with hamish restive and moody in the back of his mind around them in the car the warm air carried the heavy smell of newmown hay the scent of phosgene will any of us ever be free of that memory rutledge asked himself of the silent destroyer that had rolled across the battlefields of the front in clouds of gas one learned quickly enough to tell them apartmustard or phosgene or cns but familiarity had made them more terrifying not lessknowing what they could do its no the gas i cant forget hamish said roughly but the haying august fourteen i did na know there was an archduke getting himself killed somewhere in some place id no heard of the hay and fiona dusty with it on the wain and the horses dark with sweat god it was fair that august and the macdonalds swearing like wild men because they couldna keep up wi one macleod yes you told me that the night rutledge began aloud and then quickly stopped corporal hamish macleod had talked to him about the august haying the night hed died in france odd that memory turned on something as simple as the smell of newmown hay and yet he was accustomed to answering the voice in his head out of old habit the somme a bloodbath for months the toll climbing astronomically and men so tired that their minds simply shut down assault after futile assault and the german line still held set against such appalling losses one more casualty was insignificant yet in the midst of such horror the death of a young scottish corporal had incised itself on rutledges soul the man hadnt been killed by enemy fire he had been shot by a firing squad for refusing a direct order in battle and it was rutledges pistol in the shellriven darkness before dawn that had delivered the coup de grace the act had been military necessity not cowardice but exhaustionand the sheer bloody senselessness of throwing lives awayhad broken him hamish macleod had refused to lead his men into certain death military necessity for the sake of every soldier watching an example had to be made for the sake of thousands of men readying for the next assault an example had to be made you had to know facing death that you could depend on the man next to you as he depended on you rutledge could still feel the late summer heat hear the din of artillery the rattle of machinegun fire the cries of wounded men smell the fear and the rotting corpses he could still see the defeated look in his corporals eyes the acceptance that it was a relief to die rather than lead his men back into the black hail of german fire and all for nothing the artillery shell found its mark an instant later buried living and dead officers and men in heavy stinking mud killing most of them outright and leaving the wounded to suffocate before the search dogs could find them many hours later and ironically the next shell sprayed shrapnel into the machinegun position they had failed to take all that long night rutledge had barely survived deaf and blind badly stunned he lay under the corpse of one of his men in a tiny pocket of air it had sufficed he hadnt known until someone told him at the aid station that it was hamishs blood soaking his coat hamishs flesh clotting his face and hair the smell of hamishs torn body haunting him all the rest of that day as he lay dazed severely claustrophobic from a living grave severely shellshocked bruised and disoriented he was allowed a few hours rest and was then sent back to the front and hamish went with him a living reality in his mind a voice with its soft scottish burr a personality as strong in death as it had been in life rutledge never spoke of it he fought it alone silently as certain as the breath in his body that it was only a matter of time before deathor madnessput an end to it that expectation kept him sane and so he had brought hamish home again not as a ghost to be exorcised but as a deepseated presence in the shocked and numbed recesses of his brain where only sleep could shut it out hed shared his thoughts with a dead man for so long it was easier to respond than risk the tap of a ghostly hand on his shoulder to attract his attention or see a white empty face at the edge of his vision demanding to be heard that hadnt happenedyetbut hamish was so real to him that rutledge lived in mortal dread of turning too quickly one day or glancing over his shoulder at the wrong instant and catching a glimpse of the shadowy figure that must surely be there just behind him within touching distance close enough for its breath to ruffle his hair or brush his cheek there was a picnic that august rutledge said desperate to change the drift of thought up the thames beneath a stand of beeches so heavy the sun came through the leaves in purple shadows and that particular memory led to jean she was as dead to him as hamish this very week hed seen her engagement announced in the times to a man whod served in a diplomatic posting in south america through most of the war away from guns and carnage and nightmares hes in line for a position in ottawa frances had said when she called round to offer what comfort there was to give his sister knew everyone there was to knowfew bits of gossip failed to find their way to her away from all this she waved a languid hand in the air and hed known what she meant away from a britain still wearing the scars of death and pain and the poverty of peace away from rutledges torment which had frightened jean jean has a knack for ignoring unpleasantness frances had added wryly you wont let it bother you will you that she found someone else so quickly it simply means my dear that youre well out of it whether youre aware of it yet or not shallow women make damnably dull and demanding wives although i must say even i thought there was more to her or was that wishful thinking on my part too well never mind youll soon meet someone you can truly care about why was it that the mind was so adept at finding its own punishment jeanor hamishto fill his thoughts a bitter choice rutledge acknowledged with a sigh the woman who had promised to marry him or the man whose life hed taken there was no surgery to mend a broken heart nor any to mend a broken mind the doctors had shrugged and told rutledge shell shock makes its own rules when youre able to sleep betterwhen the stress of the great warof your workof your memoriesfades a little so will the reality of hamish macleod but stress was the nature of war stress was the very heart of his work at the yard he lived with death and blood and horror every day it was what he did best investigating murders hardly the most suitable work perhaps for a man back from the trenches but he was trained for no other and didnt have the spare energy to look for any other and a prospective employer might well dig more deeply into his medical file than the yard had done taking him back after the war opening a pandoras box of things best left locked away superintendent bowles knew more of rutledges war yearsrutledge was convinced of itthan anyone else at the yard it was there in his eyes watchful and wary in the sneer that sometimes passed for a smile but there had been no overt attack on rutledges character only the assignments that no one else wanted for one reason or another like the summons taking him now to dorset inspector bartons wifes in the middle of a difficult pregnancy and dorset might as well be on the moon shes that upset about him leaving her and trasks no countryman theyll be sending out search parties for him as for jack bingham hes due for leave in two days or so bowles had claimed not that it mattered rutledge was glad to be out of london loneliness had its own compensations even when it brought hamish in its wake rutledge found his turning from the trunk road at the next signpost and was soon moving more southwesterly into the heart of dorset and with it the scent of hay faded his mind found its way back from the past and slowly focused on the present this was hardy country but it was the difference in light that impressed rutledge more than the authors dark and murky characters there was a goldenbrown tint to the light here that seemed to come from the soil and the leaves of the trees not washed pastel like norfolk nor rich green like kent nor gray damp like lancaster dorset had been wool trade and stone cottage industry and small farming towns strung along old roads that the saxons had laid out long before the norman conquest outlying meadows where cattle quietly grazed rutledge found himself wishing he could ask a painter like catherine tarrant if she saw light in the same way or if it was only his undependable imagination he came into the town of singleton magna almost before he knew it was there the abrupt shift from fields to houses almost as sharp as a line drawn in the earth the railroads tracks parted company with him and ran on to the station slowing as he motored down the main street with its shops still doing a brisk business and farm carts pulled up at the curbs he searched for the local police station it was no more than a cubbyhole next to the towns one bank a small offshoot of the main building that must at one time have been a shop the front window had been painted white with the letters police in black and the heavy green door was nicked by time and hard use its iron handle worn with age the bank it adjoined was more majestic with a handsome porch above its door as if it too had begun life as something else a merchants house or a church office after finding a place to leave his car and stepping out into the warmth of the afternoon he saw a tall stooped man of middle age just coming out of the green door the man looked at him frowned and came over to speak are you inspector rutledge by any chance yes im rutledge the man held out a longfingered hand marcus johnston im representing that poor devil mowbray nasty business nasty and hes not saying a word not even to me god knows what kind of case i can build for him my advice at the moment is to throw himself on the mercy of the courts rutledge whose father had followed the law said only i dont know a great deal about the man or his crime except for the scant information the local people sent up to the yard he was searching the town for his wife i understand and her body has been found but not the others he was after thats right the police have done their best theyve covered the ground hereabouts for miles in every direction no bodies no graves more important no one inquiring about her no distraught husband and sobbing children i mean he sighed which leads to the conclusion that theyre dead and all mowbray will say to me is that they were his children why should he want to kill them a woman passed and johnston tipped his hat to her she nodded and then eyed rutledge with curiosity as she walked on i did some checking before i left london im told mowbray was in france in when the bombing occurred he was sent home on compassionate leave to bury his wife and children they were identified by the constable when they were pulled from the rubble of the building mother and two children dead mowbray himself never saw the bodies he was told it was better to remember them as they were inspector hildebrand believes there must have been a mistake of some sortthe constable felt fairly certain the bodies were mowbrays wife and children but they could have been another family altogether the bombing demolished one building as i understand it and that brought down those on either side fifty or more dead easy mistake for the constable to have madeespecially at night fires injured people everywhere absolute horror and chaos johnston grimaced bombs and tons of masonry dont leave much to look at i dont suppose if it had been another family who died in the raid why hasnt someone come looking for them parents sisters husband home on leave seems odd no one did and discovered the mixup god knows johnston answered tiredly my guess is there was nobody to care about the dead womanand mowbrays wife probably took advantage of that to start a new life makes sense especially if shed grown tired of waiting take happiness while you can no fuss easier than a divorce in france half a dozen men under rutledges command had applied for compassionate leave at one time or another most of them men whose wives wanted to leave them and had told them so in a letter one had been furiously angry private wilson hamish reminded him he said hed have her back or know the reason why he was brought up on assault charges in slough and given six months johnston seemed to know what rutledge was thinking adding hard on the poor sod whos told his familys dead but i daresay she never thought about that only that he wouldnt come tearing home in a rage he squared his shoulders with an effort as if the weight of the world lay on them rutledge studied the long thin face lined with something more than age or exhaustion that was a look he rutledge had seen often enough since he came home from france and recognized this man had lost a son in the war and was still grieving hard the murder of a young woman someone he didnt know and didnt love had less reality to him than the death in a foreign country of the only flesh and blood that had mattered to him johnston was going through the motions for his client that was all he could do thank you for being so frank rutledge said preparing to walk on into the police station johnston seemed to realize how hopeless he himself thought the evidence was he summoned a smile and added early days yet of course early days but there was a hollowness in the words and the smile rutledge watched him move on down the street then opened the door of the station finding himself in a scene of turmoil there were some half a dozen people crammed into a room meant to hold two at best and the sudden sense of claustrophobia that swept over him was so fierce he drew in his breath with the shock of it someone looked up a constable and said sharply what is it you want rutledge from london he managed to say but it came out harshly everyone in the room turned to stare at him making the sense of suffocation worse he could feel the knob on the door behind him jammed into his back ah the constable replied noncommittally come this way sir if you please he led rutledge through the anarchy and into a dark stuffy hall that smelled of cabbage and dust thats the leaders of the next search parties he said over his shoulder weve not found the othersthe man or the children rutledge didnt answer they reached a door painted brown and the constable knocked then turned the knob the room beyond was bright with late sun and a long pair of windows stood wide looking out into a small courtyard overgrown with weeds although the windows provided little air movement they gave the sense of openness he badly neededan escape into light and freedom hamish in the back of his mind sighed with a relief as great as his own inspector rutledge inspector hildebrand if youll excuse me sir the constable left the end of his request dangling in the silence as he retreated closing the door softly behind him hildebrand looked rutledge up and down they said they were sending an experienced man i was with the yard before the war rutledge replied but away through the better part of it hildebrand finished for him he himself was whitehaired with a youngish face rutledge put his age at not more than fortyfive ah well sit down man heres what we have murder victim presumed to be mrs mary sandra mowbray of london matches the general description of the late mrs mowbray or i should say presumed late even londoners cant die twice can they in his wallet mr mowbray had a photograph of her with the children taken in just before he was shipped over to france weve had copies made to circulate so far nothings come of it he tossed a file across the cluttered desk and rutledge found himself looking down at a faded photograph of a woman facing the camera and the sun at the same time squinting a little she was wearing a floral print dress and a single strand of pearls her hair seemed dark blond or a light brown the way the sun caught it her face was oval and pretty with fine bones and a distinct look of breeding handed down from some remote ancestor the children by her side were a little clearer the boy was no more than two wearing a sailor suit and a hat that had fallen to a rakish angle over one eye he grinned squinting while his hands clutched a ball nearly as large as he was the little girl not as childishly plump had the same fairness as the mother she could have been a large four or a small five judging from the shy smile that showed all of her front baby teeth quite clearly her hand clutched her mothers skirts and her head was tilted in a way that promised a sweet nature rather than a rowdy one as she peered up through her lashes with no hint of roguishness when rutledge had scanned the faces he saw that the file also included official copies from london of a marriage license in the name of mary sandra marsh and albert arthur mowbray a pair of birth certificates for the children and the death certificates for all three signed in a scrawl by a london doctor severe injuries from falling debris they all read and the autopsy had gone on to catalog them sad business hildebrand said after a moment young woman with a husband over in france lonely probably told the poor devil she took up with that he was dead well it wasnt altogether a lie was it so many of them did die only not her husband he lived to come home didnt he must have been one of her worst nightmares the chance of running into him some day and as luck would have it he goes from london to the coast in search of work and there she is standing in the station at singleton magna plain as day you think she saw him leaning out the train window rutledge asked reading down the statements of a conductor and several witnesses one of them a farmers wife and her sister the other two stokers returning to their ship stands to reason id say explains why the four of em left town in such haste not a glimpse of them anywhere one or two possible sightings of her at the station probably before mowbray spied her after that she was covering her tracks for dear life i asked around myself didnt leave that to my men very proper rutledge said absently rereading one of the statements still we have only mowbrays word that this was his wife and family as to that i checked with london hildebrand said with satisfaction there were quite a few casualties the night mrs mowbrays street was bombed constable tedley identified her and the children they were in the stairwell of the block of flats where she lived and she didnt show up later to prove him wrong did she and no one came round looking for someone who should have been alive did they straightforward as far as london was concerned rutledge nodded and handed the statements back to hildebrand then he asked how did mowbray catch up to her later has he told you mans in no case to talk deep depression according to the doctor just sits there staring at the floor face drained of emotion stands to reason he said again as if he used the expression often wife died twice didnt she once when he was told shed been killed by the zeppelins and now by his own hand shock thats what it is i daresay any of us would feel much the same not that it explains or excuses of course but you can see how it would happen shock it was something rutledge understood very well in a different voice he asked what weapon did he use now thats an interesting question blunt force to batter her face in which means anything from a heavy stone to a tool of some sort we examined the tools mowbray had with him hammers screwdrivers a pair of saws a level that sort of thing no blood or hair on any of them which says to me he got rid of whatever it was id guess its where he left the other corpses and the wounds where were they in the face mostly repeated blows eight or ten the doctor says but therere marks on her neck too as if hed caught up with her running and grabbed her by the throat pulled her down and then went for the face thats often what you find where jealousy is the motivemake her so hideous even in death that the rival cant bear to look at her anymore doctor says the force used was savage as if driven by terrible anger or fear and no blood on mowbray or his clothing no but then he could have cleaned himself up couldnt he changed shirts even theres no way of telling how many hed brought with him we found one other work shirt in his satchel and a white one for sunday he might have had more rutledge closed the file id like to see mowbray if f may hildebrand got to his feet much good itll do you he said willingly enough let me fetch the key on the way they went along the same dark hallway to the end where the key was kept in a small cupboard then hildebrand turned to another door just to his left and unlocked it the iron key made a scraping sound that jangled the nerves as the door swung open hildebrand said someone to see you mowbray scotland yard on your feet man the man on the cot lying on top of the gray blanket slowly swung his feet to the floor and stared up at his visitors his face was empty and he made no effort to do more than sit as if doing even so much had drained him of life and hope rutledge picked up the chair on the far side of the narrow cell and brought it over nearer the cot the room was wider than it was long and there was no window the air was stale seeming to hover in visible layers around them as he sat down in the back of his mind hamish was pointing that out over and over again after a moment rutledge said mr mowbray the man shifted his feet a little and nodded did you kill the woman who was found in the field the woman dressed in pink rutledge kept his voice low quiet no hint of accusation in it only curiosity she was my wife id never harm her he said gruffly after a time the cabby has said you threatened to kill her hildebrand began from the doorway but rutledge waved him into silence you were angry with her werent you for deceiving you for putting you through such anguish when you believed youd come home and buried her with the children and thensuddenlyshe was alive and so were they and the first emotion you felt was anger a great fierce anger it was the shockand the train wouldnt stopi was beside myselfi said things i didnt mean id never harm her not even for taking your children and going to live with another man mowbray sat with his head held by the palms of his hands on either side of his temples id want to kill him he said huskily for getting around her making her do it id blame him not her his solicitors just left hildebrand put in again told him what to say youve heard more from him already than i have its but rutledge ignored him cutting across the flow of words as if they hadnt been spoken where did you leave the children can you take us to them let us help them he waited for an answer then added gently youd not want the foxes or dogs to find them first mowbray raised his head and the painfilled eyes made rutledge swear under his breath as he met them i dont know the man said wretchedly i dont know where they are tricia was always afraid of the dark id not leave her alone out in the dark but i cant rememberthey tell me i killed her and my bertie but i cant remember night and daythats all i can see in my mind the children its driving me mad rutledge got up from his chair hed seen men break god knew he of all people could recognize the signs there were no answers to be had now from mowbray the haunting images hed seenor been told hed seenhad been seared deep into his brain and separating them from reality would be nearly impossible hamish in the back of his own mind was dredging up memories that were also safer concealed in the shadows and he fought them grimly mowbray was watching him like a beaten dog and rutledge turned to go not trusting his voice unable to offer any comfort mowbrays eyes followed him then the two men were out the door leaving their prisoner to the silence and his conscience rutledge said nothing as the key rasped again in the lock and hildebrand turned to put it back in its cupboard but he could still feel the sense of suffocation of hopelessness and horror and fear theyd left behind them you could pity the poor sodif you hadnt seen what hed done hildebrand was waiting with polite impatience for rutledge to precede him down the passage to his office put a suicide watch on him rutledge said finally i want a constable with him night and day never out of sight for an instant im short of menwere seaching for the others do it if he kills himself before you find those bodies they may never turn up rutledge walked away leaving hildebrand fuming behind him wanting to argue he didnt care hed stayed as long as he could stand it in this dark and grim place i cant work miracles i tell you hildebrand was saying rutledge still struggling against the strong presence in his mind as hamish harshly pointed out that mowbray didnt have such luxury of choicecould never again hope to walk out into the air and sunsilently reminded the bitter voice that mowbray was very likely the murderer of children and had chosen his destruction himself ill hold you personally responsible if that man dies he went on as the inspector caught up to him hildebrand answered through clenched teeth that ones not likely to miss the hangman if i can help it right then youll have your watch rutledge found a room at the swan hotel on the second floor overlooking the main street he set his suitcase down by the tall wardrobe and went to open the windows a gust of hot air seemed to roll in then with the help of the open door behind him the stirring draft began to relieve a little of the afternoons heat he stood there by the windows watching the traffic in the street below the last of the farm carts had gone but between the trees at the upper end of the street and the old market cross at the lower end he could count some half a dozen carriages still waiting two cars were standing just opposite the hotel and another one was driving away the echo of its motor rising from the house fronts as it climbed the hill he felt depressed hamish silent for some time now had nothing to say leaving rutledge with the heaviness of his thoughts and the sense of guilt for doing nothing to help mowbray instead hed made certain that the man lived to be hanged from one suffocation to another mowbray was a tragedy a man who was not by nature a killer who may have killed out of surprise and shock and instant overwhelming fury which probably didnt matter very much to the young mother who had just died at his hands it would very likely be kinder to everyone if mowbray carried out his own sentence of execution but the law forbade suicide and it was the duty of the police to prevent it and let the poor bastard suffer from the knowledge of what hed done until his majestys hangman legally put him out of his misery sighing with the uselessness of it all rutledge turned to unpack there was a tap at the door and the chambermaid came in bearing a tray i thought youd like some tea sir its too late to have it in the parlor but there were still cakes and half a dozen sandwiches in the kitchen she smiled shyly thank you he hesitated and she supplied the name for him as she set the tray on a table and whisked off the napkin that covered dainty egg and cucumber sandwiches and a plate of iced cakes there was also what looked like two fresh pasties apparently tea at the swan was hardy fare peg if you please sir thank you peg she curtsied then turned for the door he stopped her asking do many of the passengers from the noon train stop here at the hotel no sir not often mostly they live around here in the town or one of the villages with no station we have more guests on market day today that was or when theres an inquest sometimes for a funeral if the deceased was well known she grimaced i saw that man sir mr mowbray when he came to ask if his wife and the children were staying here upset he was nearly snapping my head off when i told him mr snellingthats the managerwas on the telephone and couldnt come out to speak to him just then did you see mowbrays wife and the children no sir they never came here constable jeffries showed me the photograph but the only children in that day for luncheon were mr staleys and ive known them since they was born now mrs hindes said she believed she saw mrs mowbray at the station when she was there to pick up her niece from london but miss harriets never comfortable on a train and mrs hindes was that worried about the girl being sick before they reached home she never really paid much heed to the other passengers peg grinned miss harriet is always being sick its her revenge for having to stay two weeks with her auntie rutledge smiled and peg recollected her place if theres nothing else sir she left closing the door softly behind her he ate the pasties and two of the cakes drank his tea while it was hot then wished he hadnt leaving his coat over the back of his chair he opened the door again for whatever air was stirring and finished unpacking his mind on the dead woman singleton magna was not where she lived everyone in such a small town including hildebrand would have known her instantly if this had been her home and she didnt live close by or by this time someone would have recognized her photograph or the children in it or come looking for her the question then was had she and the man with her left the train because theyd seen bert mowbray there in one of the cars staring at them in shocked surprise and in a panic decided to make a run for it or had the family been on its way to a place beyond singleton magna if so how had they planned to travel that distance after leaving the train could they have been completely oblivious of the man watching them because sometimes you felt eyes on you when there was some strong emotion behind the stare had she sensed them as the guilty often did and what had she told the man with her theres my husband the one thinks im dead or had she told lies anything to make him trust her come to that how much did the man himself know enough to make him accept the need for haste and putting distance between themselves and mowbray or was he as much a victim of her scheming as mowbray himself what if somewhere along the road the truth had sunk in and hed decided that running wasnt the answer and instead chosen to confront the man from this womans past ordecided to leave her to face the consequences of her folly alone interesting conjectures but only thatconjectures theyd know when the other bodies were found rutledge spent what was left of the afternoon coordinating a widening search making telephone calls to towns along the railway in both directions asking local police for assistance in locating any passengers on mowbrays train who might have information about the woman and her children he persuaded police in the busy holiday towns along the coast to do the same though they were not sanguine about finding any needles in the haystack of people on their doorstep they had already passed around the circular hildebrand had sent them it hadnt brought any response he called in more searchers from the nearest towns and outlying villages telling constables and sergeants and inspectors that any men they could spare would be greatly appreciated a thinly veiled order couched in the politest terms then he and hildebrand looked at a rough map of singleton magna and its environs already quartered with lines showing where the search had scoured the landscape next rutledge read reports from earlier parties all of them ending with the same last line nothing to report hamish reflecting his tiredness pointed out that it was useless to go back over the same ground again and again but rutledge knew the value of many pairs of eyes what one had missed another might see it was harder to convince hildebrand of that i cant grasp how a man in his state of mind could be so clever he said again tossing his pencil back on the cluttered desk its not likely he knew more about this territory than we do stands to reason and yet were fair flummoxed i cant understand how weve missed them i dont know that its cleverness rutledge said thoughtfully a small child can be buried in a field tucked under a hedge or loose stones by a wall stuffed in the hollow of a tree he might have felt compelled to bury them whether he remembers it or not its the man whose body should have turned up by this time ive climbed up church bell towers hildebrand told him defensively taken pitchforks to haystacks walked the railway tracks for five miles in both directions even looked down wells and run sticks up chimneys very resourceful of you rutledge applauded sensing ruffled feathers what we need now i think is to try to follow in his footsteps it might be helpful to send men back to every person mowbray encountered then use the time they saw him as a map to chart his movements that could give us a better idea of where he might have gone when no one was looking grudgingly hildebrand agreed if those extra men come in ill see to it ive looked into what gaps i discovered but i suppose it wont do any harm to go over those two days again he stared consideringly at rutledge quiet enough and competent he had to give him that one to check every detail which was frustrating knowing how thorough hed been on his own still that wasnt unreasonable it was the sort of thing he himself would expect in rutledges shoes hadnt arrived demanding an office and a sergeant either setting himself up as god almighty wreaking havoc in another mans patch but somehow distant not the sort youd ask to join you for a pint at the end of the day and there was an intensity about him underneath it all hildebrand found himself wondering if the londoner was still recovering from war wounds that thinness and the tired haunted eyes none of which was worrying to the local man in charge it was more a matter of pride that drove him rutledge didnt appear to be a meddler but you could never be sure thered been rumors about what hed done in cornwall simple enough case to begin withand look how thatd been turned inside out well scotland yard would learn soon enough that singleton magna knew what it was about best course of action then was to say yes to everything and quietly do as you thought best and hope to hell london was kept well occupied sorting out jurisdictional squabbles hamish without fuss said watch your back man rutledge nodded but whether in answer to hildebrand or his own thoughts it was hard to tell when a frail thread of cool air ushered in the evening rutledge went down to his motorcar and drove out of singleton magna on the road that led to the farmers field where the body of mrs mowbray had been found the sun slanted low in the west turning trees and steeples and rooftops to a golden brightness that seemed timeless and serene the place was comparatively easy to finda field of grain that ran gently down a hillside toward the road and then continued for some forty feet across it beyond the lower field a pattern of mixed dark green led on toward a clump of trees along a small stream and beyond that he could just see the tall church tower of singleton magna apparently not so far away as the crow went but possibly four miles by the high road to the west of where he pulled over and got out of his motorcar he noticed a y in the road and a weathered signpost its arms pointing toward more villages out of sight over the slight rise as a place to commit murder he thought standing there in the golden light this was as isolated a spot as any and by the same token as isolated as it washow had mowbray and his victim come to meet here or had they come here together from some other place yell not be getting answers from yon puir sod in the gaol hamish reminded him hes a witless man which was a very good point rutledge thought this case so obviously clearcut and so near to being closed was going to sink or survive in the courtroom on the basis of cold hard fact weapon opportunity motive and the how and when and where of the act aye hamish replied broken men conjure up sympathy unless theyre branded cowards rutledge winced and turned his back on the motorcar looking up at the field why here he asked himself because she had gotten away from mowbray as someone had suggested and it was here that hed caught up with her again simple happenstance all right then where had she run from to search for the children he told himself ill have to work out the direction shed be likely to come fromand how mowbray had followed her yet there was nothing in any direction to suggest a sanctuary where a frightened weary family might have taken refuge he tried to picture them the children crying spent and thirsty the mother trying hard to shush them and soothe them at the same time the manher husband her lovercarrying the little girl while she held the boy four milesbut still not far enough they would want to get clear of singleton magna and the pursuing furies as quickly as possible which told him they wouldnt have asked for a ride on a wagon nor would they stop at a farmhouse door to ask for a glass of water or an hour to let the children rest either way would leave traces of their passage it had taken mowbray two days to catch up with her consider a different point of view where had the family intended to leave the train they could have been traveling to the dorset coast or any town in between or beyond to devon even to cornwall all right given that their direction was south or even southwest theyd most likely keep to that however indirectly which meant in theory that theyd have left singleton magna by the same road hed just traveled where then had they spent that last night rutledge slung his coat over one shoulder and walked on to the signpost where the road divided two arms pointed southwest the faded letters read stoke newton and leigh minster from there the road might well carry on to the coast the third arm pointed northwest to charlbury he went back to the field and climbed the shallow bankhis footsteps lost in a morass of many prints nowand walked toward the spot where the tidy rows of grain ended in a flattened fan just before he reached it he saw the darker stains in the dark earth barely visible now but clear enough if someone searched for them here shed died bleeding into the soil and here shed been abandoned he knelt there in the trampled dust and stared at the earth trying to reach out to the mind of the woman who had lain here hamish stirred restlessly but rutledge ignored him a terrified woman coming face to face with a man bent on vengeance knowing she was going to dieknowing her children were already deador soon would be did she beg make promises was there anything she had left that mowbray wanted besides her life or was death an end for her to terror and horrorthe doorway into the silence where her children had gone before her had she hidden them and protected them with her own wood knowing that once she was deadand couldnt be made to telltheyd be safe buying time while they reached some kind of safety was that why hed beaten her face so savagely trying to force the truth from her trying to make her give him what he believed was his his flesh and blood but the ground here was silent and rutledge listening for answers in his own mind seeking something real and deeply felt that could show him the way could hear nothing whatever had brought this woman to the edge of an abyss whatever emotions had roiled the air and left grisly traces on the ground were still her secret in the end he stood up and shook his head unable to reach what had happened here my fault he wondered and hamish said it was what about mowbrays point of view take the living man instead of the dead woman and delve into his feelings hed killed her hereand abandoned her here why why not pull the body into the rows of grain where only the field mice and crows would spot it so soon why leave it close to the road where the farmer coming to look over his crops might stumble across it and raise the alarm because hamish answered him the man was no thinking with cold logic he was distracted and angry and vengeful yes rutledge agreed aloud he wanted her dead he didnt care whether hed be caught or not they found him after all asleep under a tree he looked from this vantage point around the circle of corn and trees and distant church tower the horizons of this place of death but he saw nothing to draw his attention no shed no barn with its roof falling in no farm house the clump of trees then they were far enough off the road rutledge spent a good quarter of an hour searching among the trees and came up emptyhanded no sandwich wrappers no scuffed earth no suitcases suitcases no one had mentioned the familys suitcases had these been left on the train or had they tried to drag their luggage with them down the hot and dusty road it was a point to consider another point to consider he went back to his motorcar hot and dusty himself to drive on down the left southwestern fork in the road it led to two straggling villages houses lining the road water meadows at their backs on either side and farms in the outlying fringes in each one rutledge sought the local constable and questioned him the first one was still enjoying a belated dinner and the other was in his shirtsleeves gossiping over the garden wall with his neighbor but they answered him readily enough rutledge learned that hildebrand in his thoroughness had preceded him here and there appeared to be nothing left for him to discover in either leigh minster or stoke newton no strangers have come through here in the past weekboth constables assured him of that and he believed them they appeared to be steady careful men who knew their patch well nor had an ownerless suitcase turned up in the middle of a field or under some hedge apparently neither village had been pulledwittingly or unwittinglyinto the tragedy at singleton magna back in his motorcar again the cooling wind of twilight swirling about his shoulders rutledge listened to the voice in the rear seat it seemed to breathe on him though he knew very well it was only the soft dorset air i do na think hed have come so far the man was certain his wife was still in singleton magnahe went raving about yon town for two days searching people saw him and he was asleep there when the police came looking for him but whats no been answered is what made him so certain theyd be found there that the townsfolk must have hidden them from him i dont know rutledge said in the end he did find the woman close by he caught up with her there in the cornfields and he killed her there and left her there unless aye unless unless the man with her got rid of her because she was the one mowbray wanted and he and the children got clean away rutledge had been considering that possibility if he killed her here in the open and the children saw him do it how could he persuade them to come away with him after that it was a bloody crime shed have screamed the first time he struck her they would have cried out in alarm pulled at his coat his armstrying to stop himthen fought to stay by her because they wouldnt have understood that she was dead and if she was a liability to him why did he stop at killing her why not rid himself of both the childrenthey werent his after all no that line of investigation is taking us nowhere but its the children thatll tell you the rest of the truth alive or dead i know rutledge said and where shall we find them it was nearly dark when he got back to singleton magna and left his car behind the inn in his absence hildebrand had come to find him and written a message on hotel stationery its thick crested paper incongruously scrawled over in heavy black ink london just replied to your request for more information on mrs mowbray she was from hereford no known connection with dorset that may mean that the man with her lived or worked or had relatives in this county im looking into that now it was one of the telephone calls rutledge had made that afternoon asking a canny sergeant he knew in london to look into mrs mowbray for him gibson always had his ear to the ground if anyone could uncover information on the dead woman it was he a pity there was no way gibson could do the same for the man and rutledge didnt hold out much hope that hildebrand would fare any better with so little to go on it might take weeks to trace himif he belonged in dorset or years if he came from another part of england if he got clear theyd hide him him and the children family friends if he asked hamish said as rutledge took the stairs two at a time very likely rutledge answered aloud before he could stop himself unless they know that mowbray is safely in jail but the children are no his hamish pointed out and the mothers dead if yon man wanted to keep them hed stay out of sight hed have to turn them over to the police if he came forward yes thats an interesting thought isnt it the children again they were beginning to haunt him rutledge spent a restless night his room too warm for comfortable sleeping and his mind too busy the images flitted and dissolved in a kaleidoscope of anguish of mowbray broken and in despair in his cellof the bloody body of his wife lying at the edge of a field in plain sight when the farmer went to see to his cropof children crying for their mother and a man who wasnt their father offering what comfort he couldof a gallows waiting for a prisoner who might not understand why he was being hanged and as always hamish attuned to the tumult in his mind reminded him of his own fallibility a policeman driven by his own pain attempting to get to the bottom of another mans a murderers both of them murderers its love thats at the bottom of this rutledge said aloud in the darkness trying to silence the voice in his head and then swore because the word conjured up memories of jean jean in a fashionable blue gown with ecru lace and the flowers hed given her pinned at her shoulder jean laughing as she swung and missed and the tennis ball went smashing into the backstop the sun on her face as they walked through oxford early on a sunday morning drinking in the quiet and peace but what kind of love it had so many faces so many names jealousy wove a thread around it and envy and fear people died for loveand killed for it and yet in itself it was indefinable it wore whatever passions people brought to it like a mountebank with no reality of its own somewhere in the town outside his window he could hear laughter and music happy laughter without restraint or burdens once jean was married and off to ottawa he told himself he could finally put her out of his mind as he had nearly put her out of his heart olivia marlowe had taught him more about the quality of love than jean ever had what will teach me to forget my fiona hamish said softly do ye never remember her do ye never hear her weeping by yon empty grave while i lie in france with no way to call out to her or offer comfort what peace can ian rutledge find loving any woman when theres hamish macleod on his conscience in the darkness rutledge turned his head away from the insistent voice it was true what woman would be willing to share his life with such demons in his mind in the morning rutledge met hildebrand for breakfast in the swans dining room the bright chintz curtains bellying like sails in the early breeze the tablecloths were blindingly white hildebrand appeared to be suffering from a headache several times he massaged his eyes as if they burned and he growled at the middleaged woman who waited on their table she gave him a withering look as she walked away and said i knew you as a lad with your braces broken and your face dirty dont come the grump with me rutledge suppressed a smile hildebrand ignoring her said i had a hellish conference last night with my chief he wants those children found yesterday wouldnt be soon enough makes the entire county look bad he informs me bloody maniacs running about slaughtering their families he says were to make haste and finish this business or hell know the reason why it might have taken some of the wind out of his sails if youd been here to placate him i went out to the scene of the murder i dont know where they could have hidden themselvesor been hidden near that field i keep coming back to singleton magna and whether someone in the town is keeping silentassuming the children and the man are still alive hildebrand stared at him then pulled one of the flyers out of his pocket and tossed it across to rutledges plate where it landed on the toast he had just spread with marmalade rutledge picked it up wiped the back with his serviette and then said whats this in aid of the fact that that flyer was given to every household in the town and all the outlying farms somebody somebody would have come forward with information stands to reason if not the family a nosy neighbor the old biddy across the road some child wanting to be noticed do i have to spell it out for you no rutledge said reining in his temper he was looking at the flyer at the faces this should have brought results i agree but it hasnt and i keep asking myself why no one has come forward which tells me the other man responded acerbically that theyre dead the man and the children which is where weve been for some days nowlooking for their bodies there cant be all that many hiding places within walking radius of the town and if mowbray caught up with his wife by that field along the high road it narrows our search even more the western side of singleton magna not the east otherwise hed have had to bring heror chase herthrough the town itself and thats not on weve looked there isnt a stone as large as that plate in front of you that we havent lifted not a tree we havent climbed not a stream we havent walked through up to our knees not a wall a plot of disturbed ground a shed an outhouse bridges or any other conceivable place we havent searched at least three times and are searching yet again theyve vanished then rutledge thought like foxfire the nearer you come the farther away it appears to be hamish was saying something but rutledge ignored him i went on to leigh minister and stoke newton youve searched there as well yes on the premise that the train was going south what about the other fork the way to charlbury thats another three miles distant we spoke to the constable there in the name of thoroughness but i wasnt surprised when we drew a blank a long way for a man and a woman to walk encumbered with children and stoke newtons closer than charlbury stands to reason if mrs mowbray was looking for sanctuary shed have chosen stoke newton what if she considered that herselfand chose charlbury instead to throw us off the track hildebrand shrugged its possible but likely no youre hunting for straws man then clear up another puzzle for me why was mowbray so certain hed find her here in singleton magna i spent most of the night turning that over in my mind i dont think he was certain look she wasnt on the train when he saw her she was already on the platform kneeling to speak to the little girl theyd gotten off the train before he saw herand very likely before she saw him stands to reason hed tell himself if they got off here this was where they planned to be so he hunted for her hereand in the end he got it right was that how it had happened it might explain why the suitcases hadnt been found he mentioned them to hildebrand who shook his head ive thought about that too mowbrays not the only poor sod out of work if someone had come across the cases and had need of whatever was inside whats to prevent him from keeping the lot and his mouth shut at the same time rutledge felt depression settling in and hildebrand didnt seem to find the endless circle of supposition any more joyful he rubbed his eyes again and turned the subject to title men who had arrived that morning and where he had sent them to search meanwhile ive got my own men asking questions in town they know what theyre after we should have some answers by late afternoon when theyd finished their coffee rutledge stood up ive one or two matters needing my attention i should be back by three oclock hildebrand felt relief wash over him out of sight was out from under foot londons task was diplomacy where the investigation crossed parish boundaries and sensitive toes might feel trod upon if that kept rutledge occupied most of the day he himself might accomplish a hell of a lot more with a brief nod hildebrand strode out the door like a man with a heavy schedule ahead of him rutledge stared at the flyer again deep in thought the woman whod waited on them looked down and saw it a sorry business she said pityingly i blame the war disrupting a family putting ideas into her head its the little ones i feel most for truth to tell losing their father and a mother no better than she ought to be from all accounts she was a good mother thats as may be but its a sorry business and mark my words its her thats to blame small as they are how much would these children remember about mowbray he asked curious he was in france most of their lives surely theyd come to accept any replacement as their real father the woman looked up at him her face scornful what makes you think this was the first and only man shed taken up with it was a very good question as she piled dishes on her tray she added my eldest daughter lost her children to the influenza too little to live the doctor told her i dont think shes slept a night since they died and heres someone puts her own fancies before her children doesnt sound to me like a good mother she lifted the heavy tray and marched off toward the swinging door that led to the kitchens her pain evident in her straight unyielding back too little to live his war had been broken bodies and the sucking black mud unbearable noiseand unbearable silence artillery barrages machine guns strafing aeroplanes horses and men dying their screams splitting the mind the sound going on and on long after it had stopped a war of attritionmeant to kill to the last man where ones own survival seemed beyond any prayer in england it had been different for the exhausted people at home carrying the burden of deprivation stunned by the long lists of dead and wounded worn down by helpless waiting and uncertainty influenza had come as the silent stealthy scythe of god striking without warning killing with the same certainty as wounds in the flesh gone septic but not confining itself to the trenches it killed young and old without rhyme or reason striking down the healthy sparing the ailing leaving children without mothers and mothers without he stopped halfway to the hall and spun on his heel to look back at the still swinging door to the kitchen too little to live he stared down at the flyer in his hand the pale faces of the children stared back at him why hadnt the children changed since mowbray had described them as hed seen them on the train platform as if theyd not altered from this faded photograph children who should have aged three yearsin size and appearance did that mean he hadnt seen them except in grieving imagination no wonder the flyers hadnt brought any results but the womans dead she was real enough he told himself missing suitcases a woman whod vanished for over twentyfour hours between hastily leaving the train and her murder the ages of the missing children questions that niggled at the edges of his mind with no answers unless the poor devil living with his own madness in that jail cell had killed a woman and children hed never seen before gentle god rutledge took the stairs to his room two at a time as if trying to outrace the horror hed evoked there he picked up his hat stood thoughtfully in the middle of the floor as he debated the best course of action then ran lightly down the steps again and out to his car on the road west he could see small groups of men in the distance searching covering again ground theyd already tramped over three and four times heads bent sticks poking into undergrowth and among the thick boughs of trees they moved steadily and carefully across the terrain assigned to them in the field where the body had been found the grain was alive with them and there was a fuming redfaced man sitting his horse at the edge of the corn the farmer most likely rutledge considered stopping to speak to him and then decided it could wait until the mans temper had subsided this was his best crop of the season trampled through no fault of his own a policeman from london would be no different in his book than one from singleton magna at the signpost rutledge took the northwest road this time toward charlbury he drove slowly scouting for a likely outbuilding that might offer shelter but the two dilapidated sheds he did investigate were empty of anything except pigeons mice and a swarm of insects rising into the stuffy air from the dust beneath his feet tramping back to his car he heard the sound of another automobile coming fast along the lane he stopped to watch it his coat over one shoulder his shirtsleeves rolled up on his forearms wishing hed thought to bring a thermos of tea or water with him his throat felt parched the motorcar slowed as it came nearer and then braked as it drew abreast of him a woman was driving it and he knew the instant he saw her face that she wasnt english there was something about the way her dark hair was swept up into a bun the blue dress she wore with a scarf around the throat style his sister frances would have recognized it instantly she was french are you in trouble she asked her english lightly and fascinatingly accented he found himself suddenly at a loss for words it wasnt beauty not that she wasnt damned attractive but it was more subtle good bones his sister frances could have told him a sensuality that came from within a curve of the lips a lift to the eyebrows the way her clothes set off her coloring the shades of blue in the scarf like stained glass vivid and rich bringing light to the gray eyes that shifted as he watched from clear still water to dark unfathomable pools of speculation he spoke quickly and in french no im a policeman inspector rutledge from london im taking part in the search for the missing mowbray children she smiled a little hearing his french unexpected in a deserted lane in the middle of dorset then she caught what he was saying ah the children it is very sad is it not i hope they will be found alive but one wonders as the time goes by i have no children she stopped then went on wryly it is something one feels i think about children whether one is a parent or not the smile even as brief as it was had been like sunlight over the sea what in gods name had brought such a creature as this to england rutledge glanced at her hands on the wheel and saw a wedding band that explained it then a man yes he moved slightly away from her car she took that as a signal that the conversation was finished although hed meant it in another sense then i shall leave you to your search i wish you success with itand living children at the end of it the motorcar moved off and as he watched her drive on he cursed himself for being a tonguetied fool he hadnt even asked her name or where she lived and what had brought her here to this stretch of road connected with a murder investigation if she knew of any place the police had not thought to search shes a stranger here hersel hamish reminded him shed no be likely to ken what the police have na thought of which was true he couldnt hear her engine in the distance now she was gone rutledge started his car again and got in and a woman like yon is naught but trouble hamish added for good measure leave her out o this business rutledge laughed but he could still see the softness of her skin warm with the sunny day and the dark tendril of hair that swept across her cheek like a caress why was it that french women had a knack for disturbing a man whether they were beautiful or not whatever it was most of them were born with it and he didnt need to understand it to recognize it in a ramshackle barn swaybacked with age and a roof half fallen in he was startled by a small hawk hed disturbed she came sailing down toward him defending her fledglings and swooped near enough for him to hear the soft whish of her wing feathers on the still air and then she was back in the beams again well hidden he could feel her eyes watching him nothing here only prints of the heavy nailed boots of searchers he hadnt expected to find anything the effort had been made in the name of thoroughness a policeman needed patience and hope at the outskirts of charlbury which straggled in saxon style along the road like beads on a string he paused long enough to get his bearings it was no more than a village houses facing each other across the high road and at the far end a stone church there was a long narrow green with its pond and white geese sailing above their reflections like frigates in the sun an inn some halfdozen shops and on a slope behind an outlying farm a round building with a thatched roof gleaming whitely it looked as if it had been stranded there with no connection to charlbury except perhaps fate most of the houses were small but between the common and the church they were larger and better kept he thought it likely that the welltodo farmers lived there the grandest of the lot with a slate roof and a sizable wing on its westerly side was set well back from the street and boasted a fine garden behind a low gated stone wall there was little activity in charlbury as if people were working in their back gardens or on the farms that spread out around the outskirts one shopkeeper was washing his windows and farther along a small boy squatted by a bench teasing a cat with a string it played with the end desultorily as if preferring to doze peacefully in the sun the boy gave up as rutledge watched and turned to run toward the pond as he did he cannoned into a man coming out of the small bakery who bent double from the force of impact and swore feelingly at the child the words carried in the warm air they didnt appear to have much effect the boy was soon throwing sticks at the geese on the pond a woman coming out of another shop a basket over her arm called to him and he came reluctantly to walk beside her his shrill voice bouncing off the water as he wanted to know why the town brat rutledge thought amused then he noticed that the man the boy had run into was still leaning against the bakers wall as if in pain finally the man straightened gingerly and moved on from the blacksmiths shop came a sudden gust of black smoke as the bellows were worked somewhere rutledge could hear cattle lowing his first stop was at the small thatched stone house marked by a sign where the charlbury constable lived but there was no answer to his knock rutledge took out his watch and looked at the time the man must be making rounds then he drove back to the inn and got out leaving the motorcar in the yard beside it the inn was old stone built with a tidy thatched roof that overhung the dormers like a thick rug it was comfortably situated where the street began a gentle curve to the common and there was a small garden in front in the middle of which rose a wooden post covered for half its length by a profusely flowering vine hanging above that incongruously the sign portrayed a distinguished graying man in frock coat and edwardian whiskers one arm raised as if giving a speech the wyatt arms was scrolled in gold above his head wyatt the name was familiar but rutledge couldnt place it immediately two farmers were coming out of the bar and held the door for him nodding in countrymans fashion as he passed inside the room was dark paneled oak and rutledge nearly stumbled over a chair before his eyes adjusted to the stygian atmosphere then he saw another doorway and went down a narrow passage into a room that looked out over a neatly kept garden with several tables set up beneath a striped awning they were presently filled with women listening to a thin elderly speaker reading from a sheet of paper he stopped the ladies find it more to their liking than the parlor on fair days a voice said out of the dimness and a strong man in a white apron came in after him gesturing to the garden thats the womens institute meeting the ladies take their tea out there often on a fine afternoon what can i do for you sir a graceful but heavyset woman with dark hair and an unusual white streak that ran from her temple to the bun at the nape of her neck interrupted the speaker with a question the speaker deferred to her then went on rutledge said turning away from the windows time for a pint i think will you join me the bar and the snug were empty and the landlord said affably dont mind if i do thank you sir rutledge sat at the heavy wooden baras black as the walls and the beams that supported themon a stool worn shiny by generations of trousers sliding across the wood the landlord lighted a lamp to one side of the mirror and it gave a sense of reclamation to the room the brass appointments gleamed like gold passing through the innkeeper asked as he pulled a pint and set it on the bar in front of rutledge im staying at singleton magna rutledge said sidestepping the question yesterday and this morning ive been taking in the countryside any word on the murders over there as if singleton magna were across the channel somewhere in the neighborhood of paris and news was hard to come by sorry business he added echoing the words of the woman at the swan he pulled a second pint and drank deeply appreciatively as if he enjoyed his own wares theyve got the man in custody you probably know that but no signs of the children still theythat family i meannever came as far as charlbury no we dont run to many visitors here not like in the old days not since the war at any rate i see strangers once or twice a month at best what brought visitors before the war some came because of the wyatts old mr wyatt was mp for nearly forty years and that drew the curious he cut quite a dashing figure in his youth and was as popular in london as he was here mr simon was cut from the same cloth mr wyatt served this constituency his life long and we all looked up to him in charlbury aye and so did most of dorset the memory clicked the signand the family that had made a name for itself in parliament for three generations like the churchills and the pitts a long tradition of public service and golden oratory hes dead i think aye in the last year of the war that was he wanted to see his son take his seat and he lived three years longer than anybody thought he might but to no purpose a veil came down over the mans eyes as if the subject was ended rutledge paid it no heed his son died in the war it was no more than an attempt to keep the innkeeper talking but something flared behind the veil no simon wyatt came through it with hardly a scratch but somewhere along the way he lost his taste for politics it was a warning not to ignore the message a second time rutledge changed the subject and once the westminster connection was gone charlbury settled back into tranquility again the innkeeper made a wry face not sos youd notice he said reluctantly he put down his beer and looked out at the garden people are queer you know that simon wyatts grandfather now the one on his mothers side of the family he lost his wife early on nothing seemed to count with him after that he couldnt settle to farming or anything else then one fine day he went off to see the world sent home boxes of whatever struck his fancydead birds and strangelooking statues and other knickknacks he picked up along the way he was set on making a museum though whod come to look at such oddities i ask you not every mans taste rutledge agreed in london that might make a difference no here in charlbury the innkeeper said in the back toward the kitchen a mans voice called mr denton he answered over his shoulder aye im coming man shall i carry down the next keg then put it with the others sam ill sort it out later he smiled ruefully at rutledge anything else sir the dray brought my beer this morning if i dont watch samll be drunk as a lord on whatever he can find thats open old fool but helps hard to find if theres no work on the farms the younger ones are off for london or wherever they can find a job if he wasnt so good with the horses id have been shut of him years ago rutledge drained his glass and thanked denton then made his way out into the sunlight again sitting on a bench outside the door was the man hed seen earlier he was pale his face beaded with sweat are you all right rutledge asked i saw what happened bloody brat his mother cant do anything with him needs a mans firm hand preferably applied to the seat of his pants he cleared his throat and said im all right as right as ill ever be something in the timbre of his voice made rutledge turn to look at him canadian by any chance i lived there for a time alberta damned beautiful part of the country ever been there never had the chance rutledge answered i met a number of canadians in the war the man held out his hand and rutledge took it my names shaw you arent a dorset man rutledge im from london i hate the bloody place too crowded too dirty too old a man cant breathe there no rutledge said knowing what shaw meant do you have family here it was the opening hed waited for to bring up the subject of the mowbrays im dentons nephew hes kept an eye on me since i left hospital the doctors wont let me go back to alberta and ive not made up my mind what to do with myself shaw grimaced he wasnt used to telling strangers his life story it was a bad habit to get into sorry im not usually this garrulous its the fault of that bloody child i dont mind if it helps anything is better than what they give out in hospital for the pain god yes shaw got to his feet and took a deep breath it never lasts long he said although the tension around his eyes hadnt gone away thanks for not making a fuss as rutledge nodded shaw opened the door and went inside as if afraid that staying would lead him into other confessions he didnt want to make rutledge turned toward his parked car and then changed his mind walking back up the street instead he knocked several times at the constables door without an answer a woman busily sweeping her walk shaded her eyes and said if youre needing constable truit hes out know where i might find him business or trouble rutledge laughed i wanted to ask him how to grow fine marrows she grinned not a bit affronted well hes not likely to be back before the days out theres no mrs truit you see and hes got courting on his mind rutledge said with interest makes a habit of not being at home does he makes a habit of being wherever mrs darleys daughter is in my view shes leading him a merry dance before choosing danny marker danny works over to leigh minster and comes to charlbury only at the weeks end a born gossip i wanted to ask truit about the day that man in singleton magna killed his wife id like to know if there were any strangers in charlbury at that time she cocked her head and looked him over you arent from the london papers rutledge said apologetically no she sighed i thought not you must be the london policeman then the one they was expecting over to singleton magna she waited pointedly until he gave her his name there was a guest at the wyatts that came by car but no one on foot no woman with small children if thats what youre asking its a long walk anyway for little uns dye know what i think she didnt give him a chance to answer hed have her opinion wanting it or not theyre buried in a churchyard whats a better grave than a fresh one to hide bodies in anyone dead of late in charlbury he asked amused by the ghoulish relish with which she offered her suggestion no there was disappointment in the admission weve got a maid missing but no ones likely to want to kill her she was uppity and good riddance mrs bagley says how long has she been missing getting on for five six months the constables neighbor admitted reluctantly ive got a sheet with the picture of that family on it constable truit he was handing em out bettys hair was darker nothing like the woman they was looking for besides she werent married nor had any children at least not that we knew of but pretty enough to want more from life than scrubbing another womans floors gone to london more than likely looking for trouble rutledge thanked her and turned to go if youd come in another month youdve seen the museum open she said to his back eager to keep his attention theres to be a party then theyre hoping for grand guests down from london but they wont come not now that mr wyatt is dead whats the point unless its curiosity brings them but whos likely to want to see pagan statues and dead birds i ask you he glanced toward the churchyard farther along the road someone was standing there watching from the shadows of the tall trees you never know she laughed a hoarse croak no not with people you never do and with a final whisk of her broom she walked back inside her door having had the last word and garnered enough information from him to regale her neighbor on the other side constable truit would hear about rutledges visit before he turned the knob of his front door hamish said out of a long silence if yon constable has his mind on courting hell no see all that happens but that woman will be sure of it rutledge walked slowly along the street getting a feeling for charlbury as in most villages people went about their own business and left others to mind theirs dorset had not held a very large place in english affairs over most of the countrys history and seemed content to leave it that way beside the church was the tidy rectory the gardens by its front windows heavy with august bloom and the path to the door was neatly raked he stopped as if admiring the effect yes the figure hed seen in the trees was still there he continued on his way the church was strikingly norman with a truncated tower just roof high that seemed to be wanting the rest of itself as though the builders had stopped working one day and never returned to finish the job the apse was firmly rounded and the walls appeared to be thick for the windows were deeply set they caught the sunlight with darkness rather than light as if they hadnt been intended to shed a glory of color across the nave there was no grace or symmetry here only a statement of power and might he thought the builders might have anticipated using it as a fortress one day for want of a castle nearby peripherally he could observe the man in among the heavy lowbranched trees reasonably tall straightyoung a shadow across his face and something in his cupped hands rutledge froze the man held a bird in his fingers turning to him rutledge called whats the date of the church do you know yes he replied coming toward rutledge and into the light early norman with some later additions it was never worth anyones time to rebuild it in a later style so it hasnt changed much in six hundred years the words sounded as theyd been spoken by roteor the man was so accustomed to the question he neednt give the answer any thought then he held up the bird it was just beginning to struggle in the light clasp flew into one of the church windows and knocked himself silly cat would have had him if i hadnt found him first he opened his fingers very carefully and after a moment the freed bird shook itself and took off toward the nearest tree he grinned at rutledge the very blue eyes were wide and guileless looking into the mans face rutledge saw that the odd blankness was explained by the terrible deep scar that started over the bridge of his nose and ran above one eyebrow around the side of the head the fair hair had grown back stiffly over the healed wound and stuck out at odd angles in the war were you he asked conversationally the man nodded everybody asks that do i look like a soldier the question was serious considered yes rutledge answered after a moment you stand quite straight he smiled sudden pride in the damaged face yes i do dont i rutledge said i must go now thank you for the information on the church my father was rector here all my life the man said as rutledge turned he died of the influenza i know every nook and cranny of the church even some he didnt find rutledge studied the open face his thoughts going suddenly to the missing children but there appeared to be no intentional double meaning in the remark only simply a statement of fact and unassuming selfsatisfaction in this one thing if nowhere else he had exceeded his father the mans eyes followed him as rutledge turned back down the street toward the inn hamish as aware of it as he was muttered uneasily hes no a simpleton he said theres the mind of a child all the same i canna trust it he let the bird go rutledge silently reminded hamish no i dont think hed harm children although he might be persuaded to hide them as he passed the largest house the one with the wing set back beside it he heard a woman calling a mans name from somewhere out of sight and then more clearly the response no dont bother me with that not now the owner of the voice came around the corner of the house carrying one end of a ladder and in his rough clothes looking more like a laborer than the man lugging the other end did but his fair hair and fairer skin flushed with heat and exertion werent a working mans he shifted the ladder with dexterity and said as he lifted it to the gutters no let me go first it will save time and went smoothly up to the roof with the apparent ease of long practice the wyatt home rutledge asked himself it was the only one hed seen so far with room enough to house a museum even a tiny one outside the milliners shop a woman came hurrying through the door to hand a small box to a younger woman pushing a pram the two of them looked up at rutledge as he passed then began speaking again in lowered voices the news of his arrival was already moving quickly along the village grapevine as interesting gossip always did it seemed to fly on the very wind then why in gods name had there been no gossip about the mowbray children even hamish had no answer to give to that he retrieved his car from the inn and was halfway out of charlbury when he saw the constable coming toward him on foot a sturdy youngish man with red hair the stiff collar of his uniform unbuttoned in the heat pulling over to the side of the road rutledge waited for him and the man came up to the motorcar with an arrogance to match his stride something youre wanting sir he asked his eyes sweeping over rutledge in what was close to incivility hamish growled under his breath describing the man and his ancestry in highland terms inspector rutledge from london ive been looking for you truit he replied and the constables eyes narrowed but there was no other change in his manner ive been scouting the ground between here and singleton magna looking for any information thats still to be found its not very much truit answered as far as i can find out the mowbray woman never got this far nor did we see any sign of the accused mr mowbray he wouldnt have come this far either would he a long hot walk not for the likes of small children and hed know that besides we havent had many strangers in charlbury not this summer and i havent found any connection between mowbray and any of our local people i asked at every house to be certain though i knew from the start it wasnt very likely a policeman seldom finds what hes already convinced cant be found rutledge thought it was one of the faults of the profession an ease of making up the mind when the most obvious facts seemed to point in one direction and sometimes in the general run of crimes where the facts pointed turned out to be right but where there was murder there was often a complexity of personalities and secrets that could take an investigation in any directionor ten directions at once if he wasnt prepared to follow the most unlikely possibilities as well as the most likely a policeman ran the risk of committing an injustice the family might have been offered a ride on a dray or a cart in a car as to that if they were taken up by a vehicle it wont have been a local one the constable said pedantically as if explaining matters to a man of limited intelligence which tells me theyd be far beyond charlbury by now what would persuade them to stop here when they could be miles away with a farmer who came from anywhere twixt here and the somerset border even so he didnt have wings how did he reach somerset without passing through charlbury or stoke newton this farmer of yours he couldnt drive his wagon through one of these villages without being seen by someone a number of carts and a wagon came through charlbury truit admitted none of them with any passengers i asked around about that and no one in my town offered a lift to someone coming from singleton magna then why havent we found the other bodies rutledge asked not intending any reflection on the constables efforts his mind instead on what the carts and wagon might have carried and whether three people two of them children might have hidden themselves behind or under the cargo but truit chose to take the remark as a distinct challenge a deep flush spread up the mans face thats a matter youll have to take up with inspector hildebrand sir its not my place to answer for him washing your own hands are you rutledge thought but said only youre right of course and left it at that but as he drove on he and hamish entered into a lengthy discussion of constable truits abilities and how he did his job hamish had taken a strong dislike to the constable and made no bones about it a chain was no better than its weakest link and in the chain of villages that blocked the most likely direction the mowbrays had taken from the railway station at singleton magna the other two constables had been brisk businesslike and courteous men who knew their worth and took pride in exhibiting it rutledge thinking about it decided he was coming back to charlbury something at the back of his mind unformed and more intuitive than rational was aroused even hamish was aware of it though he said only its trouble youre stirring up but youll no be satisfied until youve sorted that one out hes not dependable rutledge pointed out he tells you whatever he thinks will make less work for him hes certain theres no connection in charlbury with the mowbrays and he may be right but what if hes wrong you no can walk away from it hamish agreed until somebodys found the bairns hildebrand was out to lunch when rutledge walked down to the police station and rather than wait in the dark smothering confines of the place he asked if he could speak to mowbray instead the constable on duty mindful of the tightrope he walked between this man from london and inspector hildebrand dithered for two whole seconds thinking it through but rutledge knew his man and with the commanding presence of a former army officer standing in front of him and brooking no nonsense the constable came down on the side of prudence and offered to take rutledge back personally they found another constable in the cell with mowbray a cadaverously thin policeman who looked to be in the last stages of tuberculosis but his voice was strong and deep as he stood up speaking politely to rutledge he doesnt have much to say sir the watcher told him just sits and stares or cries thats the worst just tears rolling down his face and no sound go have yourself a smoke the first constable told him and he left with a swift stride that spoke volumes we can only keep a man here two hours he went on to rutledge in an undertone id have a riot on my hands else not the best of assignments no rutledge turned to mowbray and said in a firm quiet voice mr mowbray its inspector rutledge from london the bowed head came up with a jerk the face tight with fear youve found them then he asked voice a thread of sound areare theydead no but id like to ask youits hard searching for someone youve never seen id like you to describe the children for me as you saw them on the railway platform mowbray shook his head no pleasei cant i cant it would help rutledge told him gently if we knew if they seemed healthylivelyor were quiet shy mowbray clapped his hands over his ears swaying with pain and grief no dont oh god dont he was relentless it had to be done they grow fast children do would you say mary was a good mother that shed cared for them properly were they well filled out or had she neglected them let them grow thin and pale the bowed head came up again eyes suddenly fierce behind the tears shes a good mother always was ill not hear anything against my mary you must have found it easy to recognize her but much harder to be sure of them the little girl must have gone up like a weedthey do sometimes but perseverance got rutledge nowhere with a gasp mowbray threw up his hands as if warding off blows i tell you i couldnt harm themthey were alivei loved themi wanted to hold them for gods sake i loved them rutledge reached out and touched the stooped shoulder avoiding the eyes that looked into hell like hamishs eyes if he ever turned and found them watching him rutledge spun on his heel and went out of the room his breathing disordered his mind in turmoil the constable came after him then stopped you got him to speakits more than ive been able to do not that it did any good are you coming ill have to wait for hindley to return he said if you dont mind no ill find my own way rutledge walked down the passage his breath coming roughly in his throat outside on the steps of the building he ran into hildebrand you look like youve seen your own ghost he said staring at rutledge whats happened ill not go back into that building not yet rutledge told himself and said aloud nothing has happened but i want to speak to you where we cant be overheard shall we walk down to the railway station grumbling about the heat hildebrand followed him as he strode off ive been out in the sun most of the morning he was saying ill be dead of sunstroke before we find those bodies and half my men with me thats what i want to speak to you about i dont think mowbray saw either his wife or his children at the railway station dont be daft man hildebrand said harshly stopping to stare at rutledge of course he did thats what started the poor sods rampage listen to me damn it i think he believed he saw his wifeor someone who strongly resembled her and children of the ages he remembered they reminded him so forcibly of his family that he was thrown into emotional confusion just then the train pulled out which meant he couldnt confront the woman and sort it all out by the time hed made his way back to singleton magna again he was convinced he had to be right that she and the children had somehow survived but when he couldnt find any trace of them here the longer he searched the more certain he was that there must be a conspiracy afoot to conceal them and the angrier and the more determined he became hildebrand watched him with disbelief he was in no mood for folly the suns turned your wits man he knew his wife he came after her he killed her and thats why were searching high and low for those children mowbray may well have killed the woman rutledge agreed holding on to his own temper but every time we ask anyone about the missing woman or the missing children we begin by telling them that were searching for the mowbrays and no one has seen them if we had another name to put to the womanthe childreneven the manwe might hear a different answer the mans name youre saying that if he believed he married her and we knew what name shed taken we could set things straight by saying here were looking for the duchess of marlborough this is her photograph and these are her children and some bored footman might say shes gone to visit her cousin over in lyme regis we dont expect her back for days and we find ourselves telling him that shes not in lyme regis shes dead rutledge took a deep breath if we knew who was missing we might have a place to start yes thats what im saying after a fashion but weve known that all along hildebrand retorted exasperated and youre not having me believe that it wasnt mrs mowbray thats dead i dont believe in coincidence his instincts had been rightthis one was a meddler it isnt coincidence its the mind of a man who sees someone out a train window thinks hes recognized her and by the time hes walked all the way back to singleton magna he believes it and he finds a woman outside of town on foot and vulnerable and he kills her because the only woman hes able to think about by this time is his wife and what pray was the poor woman doing on foot outside of town and where did she come from and what name shall we give her and why hasnt anyone come looking for her answer me that it was hopeless rutledge on the point of bringing up changes in the childrens ages decided it would fall on deaf ears now instead he said i dont have all the answers i dont even have most of them not yet but those search parties arent finding what theyre after and i for one am willing to look in any direction that might clear up this murder weve cleared up the murder hasnt anyone told you whats mowbray doing in my jail watched day and night by my men if we havent if you cant help me do what has to be done here for gods sake dont muddy the waters with notions that make about as much sense asas flying from that rooftop in my experience he began rubbish hildebrand swung away from rutledge then angrily turned back to face him jaw clenched he said this is my investigation youve been sent from london to find the children or their bodies to get me whatever i need from another jurisdiction easier and faster and here im the one setting up the search parties running about in the bloody sunshine while you chase phantoms get about your own work man and leave the rest of this business to me look rutledge said trying a last time if you bring mowbray to court in his present condition the jury will want to see proof that he did what youre claiming he did theyll want means and motive and a weapon theyll want to know those children are dead and at his hand so they can convict a witless man without having it rest heavy on their conscience his defense will run you in circles making your life a misery before its over theyll put him on the stand and have him swearing hes jack the ripper or the czar of russia before theyve finished with him and if were wrongabout any particular have you met mowbrays barrister johnston the mans already in the grave with his son hell not fight any evidence we present hell be happy enough to see his client sent to an asylum instead of the gallows and thats supposing he cares one way or another once we find the other bodies no jury in england will let mowbray off hildebrand strode ten feet and swung around a second time too angry to let it go do what you were sent to do man this isnt cornwall youll not be finding any deep dark secrets in my patch and youll not spoil my case and he was gone arms swinging in a barely suppressed need to hit something anything if it released the tension in his body rutledge watched him oblivious of the stares of passersby as hildebrand crossed the street and disappeared into the swan i could ha told you hamish began i dont want to hear it rutledge turned and walked on up the hill toward the common where the coolness of the trees closed over him mowbray was he guilty of murdering his wife and had he killed his children or was the body waiting to be claimed in the makeshift morgue a strangers with nothing more than coincidence dragging her into another mans madness and the childrenor the man with them did they exist or were they something from the dark reaches of grief conjured up with the pain of jogged memory what was wrong with this murder what was it that lay beneath the surface like a corpse beneath the ice waiting to rise and point an accusing finger when the time came hamish said yon policeman wants his answers tidy like a birthday box done up in ribbons and silver paper never mind whats truly happened youd do well to heed him and not meddle he can make a bad enemy theres a dead woman to be thought of rutledge reminded him and that man in the cell but what could be done for mowbray now even if they found a dozen murderers to take his place the poor devil was broken by his own torment he looked up at rooks calling from the branches arching high over his head i dont think well find the children he added pensively then whereve they got to hamish demanded to safety he answered and for the life of him he couldnt have explained where that notion had come from he took his lunch at the swan eating in solitary splendor in the dining room it was nearly two oclock and the young woman waiting on him was yawning in a corner her eyes drowsy as she filled the sugar bowls and then collected the salts and peppers in their turn she looked enough like peg the chambermaid to be her sister rutledge listened to the clink of the silver tops as she worked with them his own thoughts busy with details he had called in at the railway station and persuaded the master to ask down the line whether suitcases had been unclaimed when the train made its last stop the telegraph key had clicked swiftly and surely and then silence theres a chance they were found by the conductor long before the end of the line the man reminded rutledge id thought of that but the conductor who had put mowbray off the train was an experienced man and according to the file had been questioned by hildebrand himself hed have been the first to see the significance of any uncollected luggage that had come to light then or later the key began to click in response the stationmaster listened and then shook his head no unclaimed luggage he said not that day nor that week either then contact any stops in between all of them the man demanded staring at rutledge all of them he agreed but the second message sent out by the stationmaster brought in the same response no unclaimed luggage they might notve had much baggage with them the man said if twere only a day trip it might help if we knew what we were looking for rutledge shook his head i dont know if anything more comes over the wire im at the swan send word to me there it was a farfetched hope and so hed gone for his belated meal letting the stationmaster do the same my wifes waiting my dinner the man had said following rutledge out of the small cluttered office shes illhumored when im late tell her it was police business rutledge responded and walked on but it was over his meal that answers began to come to him and he went over them again and again to be sure he was right whatever else had happened here in singleton magna there was a dead woman and with that one incontrovertible fact he must start rutledge spent what was left of the day and into the dusk looking for the dead woman in singleton magna everyone saw her as mowbrays wife the one the man burning with anger and injustice had scoured the town to find everyone told rutledge that describing encounters theyd hador someone they knew had hadwith mowbray believing in his anger and his intent to kill the woman on the other hand was dead they could tell him nothing about her it was as if she had no other identity or reality than that of victim even harriet mason the woman who had arrived on the same train for a visit with her aunt remembered nothing i was that sick from the journey i didnt know or care about anything but getting here to aunties she said pointedly looking at rutledge through thin pale lashes mrs hindes stiff with rheumatism and a strong dislike of being a burden on anyone said the only person besides harriet i noticed coming out of the station that day was the woman who was met by mrs wyatt the one in the fetching hat but of course harriet was feeling faint and i really didnt have time to pay particular attention to anyone else though there must have been half a dozen or so passengers arriving she smiled wryly her strong face suddenly mischievous you must excuse us inspector we are the lame and the halt i fear and she watched with quiet satisfaction as harriet bristled early the next morning rutledge left the town to stop at every house near the main road with no success from there he drove on to stoke newton the home of three passengers who had arrived on the noon train the day mrs mowbray had been seen on the platform the farmer his wife and their young daughter had been met by a tenant fetched home in the wagon mrs tanner told him jovially in a parlor dominated by a giant aspidistra to rutledge it seemed to smother his chair with its broad leaves like so many sides of beef you didnt see mrs mowbray on the train or the children with her lord inspector the train was that crowded leaving london holidaymakers mostly families with children any age between six months and ten years full of sauce they were but i dont mind a lively childs a healthy child i say im sure we was lucky to find a seat mrs tanner answered no weve talked it over amongst ourselves if mrs mowbray and her young ones was on that train we took no notice of themno reason to one family among so many in the afternoon he found himself in charlbury again asking denton at the pub for the wyatt house it was as hed thought near the church cant miss it big with that wing they added just before the war that was to be mr wyatts office and mr simons as well when the time came now its being refurbished to house that museum mr simons so set on rutledge opened the gate and stepped into a front garden of pink geraniums and warmly scented lavender with white stock and taller white delphiniums behind them he climbed the two steps to the small porch but a maid answered the door before he could ring the bell she said in some distress if youve come about them shelves thats fallen down mr wyatt is over in the new wing rutledge followed her pointing finger and took the brick path to the second door of the house which led into the newest part someone shouted come in to his knock and he entered a scene of chaos there were boxes strewn about the floor like snowdrifts and glassfronted cases filled with the most exotic collection of statuary and weaponry and musical instruments that hed seen in some time eastern most of them as far as he could tell exotic dancers stood on shelves beside squat gods and animal masks while daggers and swords were displayed in fans their points gleaming in the sunlight tiered parasols in red yellow black and white were fringed in what appeared to be gold bullion and there were what looked like parts of doorways or windows heavy with carved scenes garish puppets elbowed each other some of them three dimensional while others were flat painted on hide below on another shelf were fantastic butterflies pinned in tidy rows like enameled brooches in every color of the rainbow nothing in england was that spectacular hamish was absorbing the scene with presbyterian horror pointing out that these items were pagan and therefore suspect before rutledge could answer him a mans voice called well what are you doing loitering out there come look at this disaster rutledge went through a doorway to find a man on his knees collecting shells that had tumbled from a tall bookcase its shelves haphazard and half out of their moorings youre damned lucky they didnt shatter you swore theyd support he was halfway through the sentence when he saw his visitor and realized it wasnt the carpenter hed sent for who the hell are you it was the fairskinned man hed seen yesterday carrying the front end of a ladder mr wyatt im inspector rutledge from scotland yard ive come to speak to you not now man cant you see whats happened here im expecting baldridge or one of his minions and hes got some explaining to do i told him a dozen times if i told him once that these shelves had to be well anchored against the weight or theyd be over before we knew where we were and i was right he got to his feet tall slender with a face that was both strong and intelligent there were lines at the corners of his blue eyes that spoke of laughterbelied now by the deep grooves bracketing his mouth the marks of strain he surveyed the disaster some of these shells are priceless theyve come from half the islands in the pacific and each one was carefully numbered and kept in a box so as not to separate sets and now look i suppose ill have to bring someone down from london to be sure weve got them in the right order again mr wyatt i only need a minute of your time rutledge broke in i understand that on thirteen august you or your wife collected a guest from the railway station in singleton magna is that true yes yes that was miss tarlton from london shes my new assistant or she will be if i can persuade my wife to let me take her on mrs wyatt is nothing if not stubborn and just because he stopped aware that he was talking about his personal affairs with a stranger and a policeman at that miss tarlton was recommended by someone whose opinion i trust mrs wyatt and i hold different opinions on that subject i hired the young lady and shes to return at the end of the month to take up her position here his mouth set sternly as if he could foresee the battle ahead she returned to london after the interview yes yes ahbaldridge he said looking beyond rutledge come see this mess your workmen have made i ought to make you return every penny i paid you rutledge turned to see a youngish man in a dark suit standing foursquare in the doorway i told you mr wyatt to let the bolts dry before you set anything on the shelves he was saying wet plaster is it and my fault wyatt snorted scornfully i told you to anchor the shelves firmly and just look at your interpretation of firmly rutledge said mr wyatt wyatt said go next door and talk to my wife aurore shell tell you whatever it is you need to know and he was already shaking his finger at baldridge not waiting to see if rutledge was pleased with the suggestion or not rutledge left the two men to it and walked back through the first room wondering if denton wasnt correct in his assessment of the museum planned for charlbury in this out of the way village who would come to see such exotica when he arrived again at the front door the maid answered the bell and said im sorry sir mr wyatt didnt tell me who to expect it was the builder in sherborne hed been on the telephone shouting at most of the morning and someone was promised to come rutledge said no matter id like to speak to mrs wyatt if i may shes in the back garden sir if youll wait in the parlor ill fetch her what name shall i say sir rutledge ill walk out with you it will save time he was tired of the wyatt reluctance to put aside their own business for his she looked up at him doubtfully and then led the way through the house and out a tall pair of french doors that overlooked the gardens he could see someone working in a potting shed at the end of the path and said i can find my way from here thanks the maid stopped and said i think i ought to he looked down at her it will be all right mr wyatt suggested that i talk with his wife and this is as good a place as any that seemed to reassure her and she left him to continue down the path to the shed the woman inside dressed in a gray smock turned as she heard his footsteps crunching on the graveled path and came out into the dappled sunlight they stared at each other in mutual surprise rutledge said mrs wyatt she inclined her head inspectorrutledge is it not for an instant she seemed at a loss my husband is in the other wing i think its you ive come to see her eyes darkened you haventthey havent found the children no im here in a different capacity today asking questions about anyone who got off the train at singleton magna at the same time mrs mowbray and her family did i understand from mr wyatt that you had a guest who also arrived on thirteen august can you tell me about her without thinking hed begun speaking to her in french it had seemed natural midway through the last sentence he realized it and switched to english she replied in the same language yes a miss tarlton from london she came to be interviewed by my husband concerning the position of his assistant she answered freely enough but warily he could hear the nuances in her voice she arrived at the station and was met i went to meet her myself simon was busythe museum keeps him quite busy these days there was he thought a faint overtone of irony in the words how long did she stay with you only two days you drove her back to the station i was supposed to drive her yes but i was delayed at the farmive taken over running it while simon is so occupied with the museum she was already gone when i came back to collect her i expect he saw to it in my place trains dont wait for cows with colic she added wryly no i dont suppose they do he answered reminding himself that she was no different from any other witness he might question and yet hed met her first with no knowledge of her roleif there was anyin his investigation it seemed to give her somehow an edge as if she judged him even as he judged her because they had begun as equals she waited for him to go on there was a stillness about her that struck him as she stood there composed and quiet even her eyes were still absorbing him somehow as if time were not an issue of concern to her or possibly to him either it was a very strong impression and he found it distracting most of the frenchwomen hed met spoke with selfpossession and a natural sense of selfworth vivacity was to them a tool of conversation half flirtatious half a mannerism that reflected their view of life this woman was different it was something deep inside a well of stillness that seemed without end but not he thought a well of serenity hamish said apparently out of context shes no a killer she drew off her gardening gloves and pulled the smock over her head ive missed my tea waiting for simon will you have a coffeeor some winewith me theres a table under the trees there ill just find edith she wrinkled her nose ive not quite learned to like tea but im trying he walked back to the french doors with her the fragrance of lily of the valley came to him suddenly and he realized that it was her perfume it surprised him the sweetness wasnt what hed have thought she might have chosen for herself something headieror at least more provocative and yet today in her plain gray dress with its buttoned belt and square white collar she was anything but provocative quakerish perhaps she called to edith as she walked through the french doors leaving him in the garden hamish unsettled in the back of his mind reminded him he was a policeman on duty and to keep his wits about him it was a timely reminder rutledge walked over to the small table and shook a butterfly off the nearest chair he wondered what it would think of its gaudy brethren on display in a glass case inside this house served them right for drawing attention to themselves aurore wyatt came back and took the chair opposite the one hed moved edith tells me youve already been to the museum what do you think of it unusual he replied dryly after some thought her laughter husky and rich was unexpected how very english of you she said the english are masters of understatement are they not then she added as if it mattered to her its become simons life i hope it is what he wants to do and not what he feels he ought to do in what sense the wyatts have always gone into politics for generations it was expectedbefore the war you understandthat he would stand for parliament as well from childhood he was prepared for nothing else and by nature it suited him handsome able a genuinely charming man who commanded respect he never speaks of it now only of this museum about which he knows so little there was a wryness in her eyes but we are none of us the same after four years of war and he married me which was not very wise in a politician an english wife would have been safer morecomme il faut he said nothing but had a sudden mental picture of aurore wyatt among the male and female voters of a quiet dorset constituency the cat among the pigeons i understand his other grandfather was an explorer of sorts yes in the pacific and indian oceans he left simon his collectionsi think in the hope that he might display them and make his grandfather as famous as darwin or cook simon had said nothing of this to me in france it wasnt until i arrived in england that he seemed to remember anything at all about his grandfathers boxes they were stored in london had been for ages and suddenly he would not hear of anything but this museum she shrugged in that way that only frenchwomen have lifting her shoulders with her head to one side as if denying any understanding of the matter that is why i wonder sometimes if he feels an obligation to satisfy one ancestor if not the other if not westminster then this museum it would be very sad would it not what does simon wyatt himself want in life ah aurore answered ruefully if i knew that i would be a very fortunate woman edith came out with a tray of glasses and a bottle of wine the coffees not done she said apologetically wine will do very well for me aurore said and offered a glass to rutledge before pouring her own he accepted and found the wine very good indeed dry and perfect for a warm afternoon she watched him savor it her eyes observing without judging you were in the war i think how do you know she tilted her head and thought for a moment before answering him you speak french very well and you know a good wine when you taste it but he knew that it wasnt what she might have said if shed been honest the war was neither wine nor language he said more harshly than he intended it was a very hard four years they are finally over somewhere hamish echoed softly over but not yet forgotten she said astutely looking at the mans face and eyes and reading more there than he was comfortable having her see no i understand i also have seen too much pain and death and my husband as well i thoughtthere was a time when i thought he might not survive the war i watched him and i knew he was expecting to die which sometimes means that it will happen like so many of the young men marching off to war he didnt understand that he was mortal he came to the fighting as if it were a game there on the steps at eton and when he discovered it was not like this it was too late there was nothing to be done but fight and wait for death to come and even death failed him sometimes i think the survivors feel guilty for having lived when so many died thinking of hamish rutledge looked away it was too near for comfort she said putting down her glass is there anything that can be done no he wanted to offer her hope and couldnt he had none to give after a moment he realized that hamish was trying to draw his attention to somethingthat her digression had led rutledge away from what had brought him here out of purpose or because he had listened with some sense some knowledge of the suffering she was talking about why do i tell you these things she asked frowning i have not spoken of them to anyone not even the nuns shes no a woman to do anything by chance hamish reminded him he brought the topic of conversation abruptly back to miss tarltons visit im under the impression that mr wyatt offered miss tarlton a position as assistant is that true aurore wyatt looked away even in profile the stillness about her was striking as if her body were attuned to it in blood and bone yet there was a strength too which seemed to mask a great unspeakable pain part of that she had told him aboutbut not all not nearly all he was sure of it if you are asking if i approved no but not because of miss tarlton she seems to be both respectable and capable with a surprising knowledge of asia her family had served in india for generations as i understand it as an assistant she would have been very useful to simon it wasmy opinionthat simon himself should have advertised instead he left the task to someone else im afraid i dont see the problem if shes competent aurore turned to look at him her fingers on the rim of her glass her eyes a darker gray that he remembered my husbands assistant will live here in this house take meals with us share our lives that will not be comfortable when i am strongly aware that this person does not approve of me he was surprised why surely not because youre french she cant know anything else about you in such a short time yes because i am french i married simon wyatt in france during the war there are some who thinkwell never mind it is not your affair you wish to speak of miss tarleton not of me after a moment he said they think you took advantage of mr wyatts loneliness she lifted her glass and drank then set it down you didnt know my husband before he left for france nor did i but im toldvery often im toldthat he was destined to be a famous cabinet membera great prime ministeror god himself for all i know they believehis fathers friends and associatesthat the change in him now is the result of his marriage and so my doing they blame me because it is much easier than understanding why he prefers this ridiculous museum to what he was bred to do as long as wyatt doesnt blame you what difference does it matter what other people think or say how like a man she said in gentle derision you do not live in a womans world you dont know the savagery there it can be worse than the jungle at that moment simon wyatt came storming through the french doors and out into the garden its my fault he says idiot id like very much to nail him to that wall with one of his own damned bolts coming to the table he pulled up the third chair whats that wine good god i hope you offered him gin or a scotch first edith will bring you one if you prefer it she told her husband but i think the inspector was leaving ill see him to the door surprised rutledge finished his wine and set the glass on the table thank you mrs wyatt he stood offering his hand to simon i hope the museum is a success he said simon said moodiness settling in on him like a cloak i dont know that it will be but the important thing is to try its all i can do he shook rutledges hand and then rutledge was following aurore into the house at the front door she said i hope weve answered your questions theres one other he told her reluctantly id like miss tarltons full name and her direction if you have it her first name is margaret and she lives somewhere in chelsea youll have to ask simon for the street and number thank you he replied goodbye mrs wyatt she nodded and watched him walk away the watching bothered him it hadnt been simple curiosity nor the look of a woman intrigued by a new man in her sphere only uneasiness but whether it was uneasiness for herselfor for simon wyatthe couldnt tell margaret tarlton of chelsea london he had a strong feeling that she wasnt the woman he was searching for rutledge placed a call to london as soon as he reached singleton magna the reply came before he went down to his dinner bowles said peremptorily whats this tarlton woman got to do with the mowbrays she was on the same train she got off at singleton magna that day we want to know what she sawif anything see to it youre not stepping on any toes man im care itself satisfied or not bowles became crisp and to the point he said we sent a man around to find miss tarlton her maid says she went down to singleton magna last week and afterward was to go on to sherborne to the country house of a thomas napier one of the political napiers rutledge hes in london but his daughter elizabeth napier is staying in the house presently we havent been able to reach her never mind rutledge said ill drive over there myself he jotted the names in his notebook and closed it any information available on miss tarlton or this miss napier nothing about miss tarlton except that she comes from an angloindian family that settled in london around the turn of the century after her father died mothers dead as well now several aunts and cousins im told they live in gloucestershire there was a pause and then bowles went on you might be interested in one discovery weve made about miss napier she was engaged to be married to simon wyatt who lives in charlbury not far from singleton magna her fathers his godfather im told in fact it was wyatt miss tarlton was going to visit to apply for a position she used to be miss napiers secretary from to last year lived in the napiers london house the voice stopped again then added with relish small world isnt it as bowles hung up rutledge took out his watch and considered time and distance it was still light he could make it to sherborne by a reasonable hour if margaret tarlton was there it would save time to interview her tonight if he telephoned she might put him off or he refused to consider the alternative that he might not find her at the napiers he found he didnt want to go back to the wyatts house if margaret tarlton was in sherborne he had no other business in charlbury finding peg in the kitchen he persuaded her to put up some sandwichesbut the meats left from luncheon sir shed exclaimed and the dinner roast wont be finished for another half hour cant you wait for thatand set out in a westerly direction for the town of sherborne it was famous for its abbey church built of golden stone like soft butter and for the school for boys that had had a reputation for their athletes when hed been at oxford three former sherborne scholars had stood between him and a chance at a blue the napier house was harder to find than hed expected set well back from the main road on an unmarked lane that wended its way first this direction and then that before making up its mind to connect with the gates and the drive up to the house he could see it ahead after hed made the turn it was built of the same lovely stone as the abbey and looked to be nearly as old with oriel windows and pointed arches the porch was a handsome affair of niches statues and a stone balustrade on two sides he thought this might once have been a small manor belonging to the abbey someone had added a wing in the same style probably a hundred years ago he could just see the roof of it on the south front as a gentlemans country house it was still rather small but more than made up for that in its architectural quality thomas napiers forebears had possessed both the taste and good sense not to meddle with the fabric and possibly a thin purse often that determined how many changes were made as the familys fortunes rose a darkhaired maid in stiff black with an apron so starched it gave the impression it would break before it bent opened the door to him and said yes sir as if hed taken a wrong turn and had come to ask his way inspector rutledge from scotland yard he said i understand a miss tarlton is staying here as a guest of miss napiers is she in miss tarlton sir no shes not but ill ask if miss napiers receiving visitors shes just sat down to her dinner her voice was doubtful this wont take long he said there are one or two questions she might be able to answer ill ask sir if youd care to wait she opened the door for him to step into the hall and he was pleased to see that it was as handsome as the porch with an elegantly carved fireplace and a high medieval ceiling the fine portraits on the walls placed to catch the eye were of a succession of men impressively magisterial in bearing who bore a strong family likeness four generations staring down at him in formidable array rutledge smiled studying them he recognized thomas napier himselfpainted at the age of thirty at a guess when he took his seat in parliament a bonny man was hamishs verdict tall distinguished with a short edwardian beard and dark hair brushed back from a high forehead the hair had grayed at the temples now but the firmness of the features hadnt changed at all napier was still a striking man father grandfather and greatgrandfather possessed the same strength there were no women here and no sons of thomass he heard the tap of heels on the stone passageway down which the maid had disappeared and a slender darkhaired woman came through the door to greet him her resemblance to the men on the walls very clearly marked except that in her the same strong distinguished features had been softened by femininity for she was very feminine in appearance and manner inspector rutledge she said with a graciousness she must have been far from feeling for her serviette was still in her left hand and her dinner would be growing cold i understand youre seeking miss tarlton may i ask why her voice had a girlish lightness but she was all of thirty if he was any judge miss tarlton im told took a train on thirteen august from london to singleton magna where she was met and taken to charlbury by mrs simon wyatt that was the same day sadly that a mrs mowbray and her children traveled on the same train as you may know we believe mrs mowbray was killed soon after that were trying to locate anyone who might remember her or her children or the man believed to be traveling with her we very much hope that miss tarlton can give us information we badly need no i had heard nothing of this she said with a ring of surprise and truth in her voice you had better tell me more i think he did starting from the beginning when mowbray had stood in the window of the train looking out at the woman on the platform but he stopped with the finding of the body in the field she listened intently without comment as if he had come to make a report to her father her blue eyes were on his steady and intelligent reflecting her concern he was careful in his choice of words cushioning the purpose of his visit as well as he could but he quickly realized that elizabeth napiers softness covered a very strong mind this mrs mowbray was killedmurdered you mean she asked swiftly moving to the heart of the problem how dreadful and they have caught this man her husband we have her husband in custody its the children were still trying to locate any help miss tarlton might give us will be greatly appreciated she frowned what do you meantrying to locate wearent sure whats become of them elizabeth napier shivered after a moment she said ive worked in london with the poor ive seen men who have lost all hope who have killed their families rather than watch them starve but this is different isnt it he wasnt trying to spare them we have no reason to believe thats the case he answered but miss tarlton might be able to throw some light on the matter margaret isnt here she said reluctantly i was expecting her a week ago but apparently she went back to london instead youve spoken with her on the telephone no she hasnt called or written but she was expecting to take up a new position she may not have had the time let me give you her london address shes not there he said weve spoken with her maid she says miss napier was to come directly here from charlbury but she hasnt elizabeth napier stopped looking at him in alarm the serviette drawn through her fingers like a handkerchief over and over again he couldnt quite read her fear but it was there i dont understand she said finally please he took the folded sheet of paper from his notebook and handed it to her she looked down at the photograph on it her brows puckered as if she had trouble seeing it whats this she asked perplexed by the shift in direction a photograph of mrs mowbray and her children does miss tarlton bear any resemblance at all to the woman you see there hamish mindful of the effort rutledge was making to keep his voice free of any inflections that might lead an answer began to stir to this woman no certainly not then she hesitated staring intently at the face well theyre both tall and fairi suppose thats a similaritybut it isnt strong its more in somethingi dont know something about their form i think the long bones the fine hair thethe delicacy perhaps do you have a photograph of miss tarlton a photograph why shouldno of course theres one in the study when my father had a house party last spring she helped me entertain it was a political weekend and theyre always the worst the wives are bored to tears or scratching each others eyes out in the politest way whenever the men arent around someone had a camera if youll excuse me he could feel the tension in his body now that odd sixth sense had already leapt ahead his thoughts tangled with the possibilities opening before him the warning to let sleeping dogs lie passed through his mind as well then what about the children hamish was saying voice low urgent if it wasnt his wife that mowbray killed there wont be any children but there were children at the railway station you have na forgotten no but if the tarlton woman was visiting the wyatts in charlbury she might have been in the right place at the wrong time mowbray might have believed hed found his missing wife it was the conviction that had brought rutledge to sherborne the need to settle the matter of margaret tarltons whereabouts such thin evidence miss napier returned a silverframed photograph in her hand instead of giving it to rutledge she walked to the door and opened it stepping out into the last of the daylight to compare the photograph and the printed flyer hildebrand had had made up after a moment she shook her head and rutledge came to take the frame from her trying to read her expression he saw only confusion he too stood in the light looking down at several women shown standing by the elegant hearth in the hall as if posed by someone oblivious to the interplay of relationships among them there was a stiffness that betrayed their antagonism even while their expressions portrayed polite enjoyment but second from the left was a young woman with long bones and fair hair who looked at the camera in much the same wayand yet not the same wayas mary sandra mowbray had done in an oddly ephemeral thing hamish saw the truth as quickly as rutledge did rutledge told himself it isnt real this resemblance between the two women you see it only when you look for ittheres nothing to trigger it unless youre consciously expecting to find it or hoping to see it it isnt a likeness is it elizabeth napier asked i cant tell it isnt a likeness he answered finally but theres something very uncanny about the similarity he had unwittingly used the same word hamish was repeating in his mind at a guess id say that if the two women stood side by side you wouldnt notice it theres the voice of course and how each carries herself her expressionher nature theyre not from the same social background theyve lived quite different lives these qualities would strike you first i dont follow you he said carefully looking for flaws himself if you saw either woman walking down bond street some distance ahead you might say to yourself i think thats margaret tarlton if you saw either woman in the slums or along a country road you might pass her by without a glance because you wouldnt expect to encounter miss tarlton there except for their clothing how they were dressed but mowbray expecting to find his wife in singleton magna might not know her wardrobe now in this new life hed already accused her in his own mind of living he wouldnt look for differences hed look for similarities like the color pink if that was a womans favorite color i begin to see but go on her face had lost some of its color this man survived the war to come back to an empty life out of work no home no family to support him nothing safe or familiar he desperately wants this woman to be his wife and by the time he does find her he cant feel anything but anger when she denies everything he tries to make her stop lying to himand in the end kills her there were any number of holes in this piece of speculation he found himself trying not to think about them hamish was asking vehemently how he had overlooked the one salient fact that would negate all his fine theories but rutledge made himself concentrate on elizabeth napiers reaction its still guesswork he said forced to honesty i cant prove any of it she was looking up at his face dawning horror on hers as she assimilated the images in her mind you arentyou arent trying to saythat the dead woman in singleton magna might possibly be margaret tarlton that it explains why she isnt hereor in london no i refuse to believe it yet he could tell that the conviction was growing stronger with every moment she was an intelligent woman still she fought against it elizabeth stood by rutledges side her hand on his arm her eyes scanning the two faces one in an ornate frame the other a grainy reproduction on cheap paper whatever her inner struggle whatever the deeper emotion that lay behind her fear of the truth she couldnt ignore the evidence before her then she spoke with a heaviness that made him ashamed of the necessity of bringing her into this murder there were tears standing in her eyes and her fragility touched him deeply if its trueif that poor woman is margaretthen its all my fault i sent her therei thought i was being quite clever i thought it was incredibly simple and that no one would ever suspect how very stupid of me she fiercely blotted her eyes with her serviette then looked down at it in surprise as if shed forgotten her dinneras if it belonged to a far distant and far different past bracing her shoulders she said it wont do to cry im always the first to say that dont cry ive told those pathetic women in the slums it doesnt solve anything but it relieves the pain somehow doesnt it carefully folding the flyer she handed it back to rutledge along with the photograph in its silver frame youll need that i think and youd better come in she said have you dined no thats good i have need of company just now well eat what we can of dinner then ill change and go with you to singleton magna i want to see this womanor has she been buried no she hasnt been buried but she isnther face was badly beaten i dont know that you could er hope to recognize her her own face went white and he thought for a moment she might faint but she said resolutely dont tell me before ive eaten something come with me rutledge followed her back into the hall and down the passage to a room with an arched ceiling and a table down the middle that would comfortably seat twenty or more at the far end in isolated splendor a place had been set for one she walked to it picked up the small silver bell by her plate and rang it sharply when the maid came to answer her summons she said another place for the inspector please tell cook ill have a fresh bowl of soup as well she waited until the maid had taken the first course back through the heavy door to the kitchens and then indicated the chair on her right rutledge accepted it elizabeth napier took a deep shuddering breath closed her eyes for an instant shutting out what she had soon to face then sipped her wine as if it offered the strength she didnt possess are you quite sure thisthis womanwhoever she may turn out to bewas killed by this man mowbray is that proved beyond a doubt no not beyond any doubt but he publicly threatened his wife and then we found the her theres no one else we have any reason to suspect at any rate hes presently under arrest then she said that relieves my mindand my conscience in what way he asked looking directly at her but she was unfolding her serviette and laying it neatly across her lap he couldnt seeor readher eyes she shook her head he said if theres information you might haveif the woman in singleton magna is margaret tarlton not mary mowbray no she replied vehemently i wont make accusations and turn your policemen loose on an innocent person that would be morally wrong then why did the thought even cross your mind the maid returned with a tray and two plates of a palegreen soup on it the smell of lamb and white beans wafting to rutledge awakening his stomach if not his mind to enthusiasm the sandwiches had been finished some time ago she served her mistress and then the guest before filling his glass with wine with a rustle of those starched skirts she disappeared again into the kitchen imargaret wasnt the kind of woman to have enemies she worked for her living and knew the importance of being pleasant to everyone if i had to stand before god in the next five minutes and answer to him id be hardpressed to think of anyone who would deliberately want to harm her she picked up her spoon and made a pretense of using it but rutledge was good at the same game perhaps not but what if someone saw a way of getting to youthrough margaret i offer this you understand as an hypothesis she lifted her eyes startled and wary to his there was something moving in the blue depths and he suddenly knew what it was jealousy this was your suggestion inspector not mine and it was the last he could get out of her on the subject but he knew whom it was she accused the name hung between them through the rest of the meal like a miasma in the air heavy and fraught with a mixture of strong emotions aurore wyatt for the first time since shed come to greet him in the hall on his arrival rutledge couldnt have sworn with any certainty whether this woman was telling the truthor lying they drove in silence through the night toward singleton magna with rutledge at the wheel and elizabeth napier by his side wrapped in a light woolen cloak against the chill that had come with darkness her small leather case lay in the boot a wind blew out of the west and his headlamps picked up scatterings of leaves and dust as they swirled across the road shadows loomed black and indeterminate along the way like watchers in mourning from time to time hamish kept up a steady commentary on the issues in the case and the probability of rutledges skills coping with them but he ignored the voice in his ear and kept his attention on the wheel and the two shafts of brightness that marked his way once a foxs eyes gleamed in the light and another time they passed a man shuffling drunkenly along the verge who stopped to stare openmouthed at the motorcar as if it had arrived from the moon villages came and went the windows of their houses casting golden squares of brightness across the road elizabeth napier was neither good company nor bad he could feel the intensity of her concentration her mind moving from thought to thought as if her own problems outweighed any sense of courtesy or any need for human companionship before she faced the horror that lay ahead of her he himself hadnt seen the victim in place her body might have told him a great deal the coroner had already done what he could found whatever there was to find the children had been rutledges priority not the dead woman until now then as the first houses of singleton magna came into view elizabeth napier stirred and said what was she wearing this woman he thought for a minute pink a floral print dress she turned to look at him pink are you sure it isnt a color margaret wearsworevery often she likes shades of blue or green will you mind waiting at the police station while i send for inspector hildebrand its best if he makes the necessary arrangements he smiled at her the sooner this is finished the easier it will be for you she turned to him in surprise i thought you were in charge of this murder investigation im here to keep the peace between jurisdictions he said without irony and added my priority has been the search for the children so far ive had other questions on my mind didnt you care about them she asked curious yes of course he said testily but the problem has been where to look hildebrand has done everything humanly possible with no results ive tried to go in different directions ive tried to ask myself if they arent dead why havent we found them did someone else see them at the railway station or are they only part of mowbrays wretched delusions surely not if he was so very angry something set him off precisely thats an avenue ill pursue next and has it been successful she was interested listening this rather different approach to police work ill know when you tell me who the victim isor isnt it took a constable half an hour to locate hildebrand and ask him to come down to the police station once there he stared at elizabeth napier as if she had no business in his office at this hour of the night and he said as much to rutledge his eyes wary and cold couldnt this wait until the morning its been a long day and im tired miss napier is thomas napiers daughter rutledge responded dryly i brought her here from sherborne its late yes but i felt you should speak with her as soon as possible miss napier this is inspector hildebrand hildebrand looked sharply at her speak to her about what get to the point man are you telling me she knows something about those children rutledge said it seems she may be able to identify our victim he explained and watched hildebrands face change as the man listened he didnt answer rutledge directly but was consideration itself as he turned to elizabeth napier even in the dark cloak that hung to her knees she seemed very small and utterly feminine lost in this masculine world of violence and dark emotions where the dusty file cabinets and stacks of papers concealed the secrets and deeds of humanitys least fortunate outside the long windows the shrubs dipped and swayed in the wind like beggars imploring mercy im truly sorry youve been brought into this sordid affair miss napier and for no reason inspector rutledge hadnt seen fit to confide his intentions to meor i might have informed him of a decision taken this same afternoon mrs mowbray was laid to rest shortly before six oclock theres no body to show you the matter is closed his eyes slid to rutledges face triumph in them in our minds there was no question of identityi discussed that issue thoroughly with my superiors and the rector at st pauls church and mrs mowbray had no family other than her children there was no reason to postpone theerdecent interment there was a wild fury rising in rutledges throat choking him he wanted to take hildebrand by the neck and throttle him it had been a deliberate and coldblooded decision on hildebrands part to make sure that his investigation wouldnt be undermined by what hed clearly seen as rutledges interference satisfied to see the sudden stiffness in rutledges face and the anger that surged barely contained just behind it hildebrand smiled tightly i took the liberty as well of consulting your superior in london he was in full agreement bowles of course the bloody man would agree and the one person who might have verified the identity of the dead woman was standing here puzzled by an interaction she couldnt quite follow elizabeth looked from one to the other shes been buried but why i must see her ive come all this way she turned to rutledge youve got to do something inspector hildebrand said miss napier no she told him firmly no i wont be put off will you please tell me where to find a telephone i must speak to my father hell know what i ought to do about this problem her eyes filled with tears and hildebrand who suffered agonies of uncertainty whenever a woman cried never knowing what to do or say to stem the flood and inevitably making things worse whatever he did looked frantically at rutledge this is your doing his eyes accused rutledge still fighting against the anger burning inside him said in a voice he himself hardly recognized how did you bury her in the dress she was wearing when she was killed hildebrand stared at him as if he had lost his wits dress good god no the rectors wife mrs drewes offered to send the undertaker something andand the necessary undergarments whats that to say to anything then ill see her dress elizabeth said looking suddenly very tired and very distressed if you please the tears sparkled on her lashes unshed but still threatening to fall given any excuse i must have an end to this rutledge angry as he was heard hamish admiring such a masterly performance yon lassies as useful as a regiment he said though youd no think it to see the size of her hildebrand was replying doubtfully miss napierare you quite sure thats what you want to do at this late hour its nottheres blood over the front of it she nodded her head wordlessly he took her arm as if afraid she might faint on the spot already promising to ask the doctor to support her through the ordeal over her shoulder hildebrands eyes warned rutledge to stay out of it youll be at hotel then he said for an instant rutledge thought that miss napier was on the point of objecting but she caught some nuance of tension in the air between the two men and said only thank you inspector hildebrand rutledge grimly left him to it still far too angry to trust himself instead he crossed to the swan to wait in the lobby hamish already earnestly pointing out the unwisdom of tackling anyone about what had been done behind rutledges back the mans no one to see beyond whats clear in his mind you must na threaten his tidy view of yon murder and he wont thank you or anyone for making him look a fool if yon lassie from sherborne tells him she has seen the dead womans dress before he will na pay any heed what is it you want rutledge demanded silently dead childrenhidden in a place we may never find or their broken bodies brought in to tighten the noose around mowbrays neck i came to find those children and by god after my own fashion i think i have and its a conclusion to this investigation that i for one will find one hell of a lot easier to live with aye but hildebrands an ambitious man and if you take away from him the one case that might ha brought him a promotion hell no forgive you for it however many children youve spared hell no care except to see whats been done to him and your hand heavy in it which was true even in his anger rutledge recognized it he made himself stop pacing the floor and silently responded it will be worse for him when the napiers and the wyatts begin to ask where margaret tarlton may have gone and the search leads in the end to that new grave aye but thats to comeand whos to say that it will whos to say that margaret tarlton is na in london or any other place that takes her fancy whos to say she did na want this position and went off to think about it hildebrands not likely to blame himsel if trouble does come home to roost hell find a scapegoat mark my words if i back down and hildebrand has his way rutledge said there are still the childrens bodies to find and the black mark will be against me for that failure even though i dont think theyre out there its your reputation in the balance aye your choice of roads but once you walk down it theres nae turning back rutledge said nothing his anger drained away emptiness left behind the selfdoubt still so close to the surfaceof his skills his emotions his witsseemed to gnaw raggedly at his patience its your reputation very soon afterward a distinctly wobbly elizabeth napier reappeared with a solicitous hildebrand on one side and a man who turned out to be the local doctor on the other he was small and thin with little to say dragooned into service at hildebrands insistence as soon as he had turned his patient over to rutledge with a curt nod he was gone without excuse or farewell hildebrand led them into a small private parlor and then went out to find some brandy one lamp was lit and it offered only a funereal lifting of the gloom which seemed to match the mood of the rooms inhabitants rutledge made no effort to turn on another and waited quietly for elizabeth to speak she seemed to be having trouble organizing her breathing i lost my dinner she said after a moment touching her mouth again with a damp handkerchief made a thorough fool of myself i thoughti was sure all my long years of service in the slums had inured me to any horror but all that blood an involuntary shiver ran through her what made it worse was realizing it might have belonged to someone i knew i found myself imagining what her face must have looked likethat was the worst part she stopped taking another deep breath as if she were still fighting nausea i dont see how you can harden yourself to this sort of work she added after a moment lifting wry eyes to meet his it must be wearing on the spirit he said nothing makes it any easier it helps sometimes to remind myself that finding the murderer is my pledge to the victim she said i dont expect ill ever read or hear about a murder having been committed without picturing that dress in my mind he gave her another moment or two and then said can you tell me anything he found he didnt want to ask hildebrand that question she said shakily dr fairfield took out the box with her clothing in it and as soon as i saw it i was sick but i made myself go back i asked them to unfold the dress for me she swallowed hard you told me the color was pink she went on accusingly its more a lavender rose and of course i recognized it straightaway the shoes as well id seen margaret wearing them just last month when we went to the museum realizing that in her distress she had probably said more than she meant to she broke off he wondered if the purpose of a museum visit had been to refresh margaret tarltons knowledge of the east before she traveled down to dorset when he said nothing she went on your inspector hildebrand thinks im out of my mind but hes too worried about vexing my father to say it to my face youre quite sureabout the dress and the shoes her eyes held his i cant lie to you i may be wrong but id be willing to swear until you show me evidence to the contrary that the woman wearing that dress must bemust have been margaret and as far as you know miss tarlton had no connection with the mowbray family if she did i cant imagine where or how she came to meet them hildebrand returned with a small glass of brandy elizabeth sipped it carefully wrinkling her nose in distaste but it brought a little color back to her face if only because of its bite ill see to driving you back to sherborne miss napier he was saying youve had a nasty shock and im sorry i hope youll feel better when youre at home again i ask your pardon for subjecting you to this ordeal it wasnt as i told you before any of my choosing she nodded and somehow the chair seemed to envelop her protectively as she leaned back and closed her eyes after a moment she handed the brandy glass to rutledge and then stood up tentatively as if expecting the room to dip and sway she said to hildebrand inspector rutledge put my case in the boot of his car if you could arrange to have it brought to my room i think its best if i stay in singleton magna tonight its already quite late isnt it the swans manager was delighted to provide a room for elizabeth napier offering to send the bill to her father she waited patiently while the formalities were completed and then allowed herself to be led to the stairs as they reached the graceful sweep of marble steps she touched her temple with her fingertips as though her head ached then she said umidont suppose anyones called simon no of course not you still arent quite ready to believe me are you inspector hildebrand she started up the first flight before he could answer her without looking back she added quietly dear simon hes known margaret nearly as long as i have it would be better for all of us if i were wrong but theres no way to undo whats happened is there if it should turn out that im right hildebrand said nothing trailing her in silence watching her rutledge was reminded of something his godfather had told him once about queen victoria small as she was she moved with majesty the same could be said of elizabeth napier she knew perfectly what power was and how to wield it few men could boast the same profound understanding rutledge wondered if shed inherited her skill from thomas napier or if it was natural as instinctive as the way she held her head as if there were a diadem balanced in her hair it gave her too a semblance of the height she didnt possess i must telephone my father hell want to know whats happened but not tonighti couldnt bear to go into it tonight behind her hildebrand grimly shook his head stubbornness was his shield and in the end it might prove to be enough the swans manager was fumbling through the keys in his hand to find the one he wanted oblivious of the currents of emotion around him in the passage outside her door he offered miss napier everything from a maid to help her unpack to a tray of tea if she felt so inclined she accepted the tea with touching gratitude and was bowed into her room as the door was unlocked for her leaving hildebrand and the manager to see to her comfort rutledge went down to his car hamish had nothing to say by the time hed delivered the small overnight case to her door hildebrand was also preparing to leave and they walked down the stairs in a silence that was ominous rutledge braced himself for the storm that was certain to break as soon as they were out of earshot of the inns staff hamish reminded him that it wouldnt do to lose his own temper a second time rutledge told him shortly to keep out of it the storm was apocalyptic after a cursory glance around the quiet empty lobby hildebrand launched into his grievances in a tight furious voice that carried no farther than the man opposite him among other things he wanted to know why rutledge had seen fit to go to sherborne on his ownand why the bloody hell the napier name had been dragged into this sordid business without hildebrands permission i dont know where you learned of this tarlton woman or why you thought she was in any way involved but i can tell you now miss napier is mistaken my god she was too shocked to know what she was saying he ended and when her father learns whats happened do you know who will be to blame for thisthis exercise in futility my people well be damned lucky if none of us is sacked thomas napier for gods sake he makes or breaks far more important men than either of us any day of the week do you realize it will take an order from the home office to have that body exhumed rutledge demanded harshly as soon as hildebrand had paused for breath and now that theres doubt whose doubt yours and whatever confusion youve sown in that young womans mind i hardly call that a positive identification damn you it might explain rutledge retorted why we havent found the children because there are no children to be found theyre out there somewhere and when i find themmark me i shall find them with or without your helpill see to it that youre ruined whatever you were before the bloody war you arent half that man now and its time you realized it he turned on his heel and left in his wake hamish was asking how was it mowbray found heryon tarlton lass how did she come to be walking on the road to singleton magnathe wyatts would no send her to the station on foot rutledge had considered that himself on the long dark drive from sherborne during the shorter wait in the swans lobby no answers had come to him not yet it had all gone wrong he told himself that if his skills had slipped so far he was better off out of scotland yard that if he had seen what he wanted to see and not the truth just because yon fine miss tarlton is na in london and did na arrive in sherborne as expected does na mean shes dead what if shes gone to gloucestershire to tell her family she was moving to dorset hamish reminded him again and again the words echoed in his head without troubling to telephone miss napier who recommended her for the position in the first place i dont think its very likely rutledge could feel the dull ache behind his eyes the sense of isolation and depression settling in fighting it he walked out into the windy night looked up at the stars pricking brightly through tide darkness damn hildebrand let it go he told himself hell know soon enough if youre right and london will hear soon enough if you turn out to be wrong sufficient unto the day turning he walked a short distance up the street realized it was the way to the churchyard and stopped he had enough ghosts of his own without invoking the murder victims coming back to the inn he looked up in time to see the curtains being drawn in the window of the topfloor room that elizabeth napier had taken she had brought her case with her because she expected to spend the night in singleton magna what rutledge hadnt knownbut she must have considered from the startwas that she might wish to stay longer than just overnight hed overheard her quietly speaking to the inns manager as she wrote her name in the register asking if the room might be available for several days rather than just one night whether she had really been sure that the dress and shoes belonged to the dead woman only elizabeth napier could say with any truth but she was already looking ahead to anything useful that might grow out of her identification inside that fragile shell was a will as strong as steel what elizabeth napier wanted she was well accustomed to having of that he had no doubt and he thought he knew her target aurore wyatts husband hed have been willing to wager his life on that certainty in the early morning before the town had begun to stir rutledge set out again for charlbury his mind occupied with how and what he wanted to say and to whom clouds filled the sky promising rain and the heat had broken he arrived at the wyatt home while the family was still at breakfast the maid left him standing in the parlor and he looked around him at the room the furnishings were beautifully made and well polished handed proudly from generation to generation they were for the most part georgian though two of the tables had skirts to the floor and phalanxes of photographs in frames in the victorian style of never is too much too much there was a large portrait over the fireplace a man dressed in early victorian black looking much like a slim and intelligent prince albert at a guess this was the first wyatt elected to parliament hinted at in the dark background behind him were the soaring pinnacles of westminster as if hed been painted standing on the bridge at midnight the inference was both subtle and powerful aurore herself came out to greet rutledge a questioning look on her face before he could speak to her she asked if hed care to join them for a cup of coffee simon is just finishing his breakfast hell be happy to see you again rutledge had his doubts about that thank you no i wanted to ask youwhat was margaret tarlton wearing the day she left for london aurores face was a polite mask as if another womans apparel was something she seldom gave thought to rutledge would have wagered she could have described everything margaret tarlton had brought with her he could count on one hand the number of women hed met who were oblivious to other womens appearance and clothing she said considering his question i spent most of the morning at the farm as i told you when you were here before i didnt return home in time to drive miss tarlton to singleton magna she was wearing blue at breakfast i remember that it was very nice with her eyes and there was a pleat of white in the skirt to one side like so she demonstrated pleating the soft cream skirt she herself was wearing he could see what she meant but she went up to pack as i was leaving and to change she said it had been terribly warm on the train coming down she thought she might prefer something lighter for the journey i didnt see her after that you might ask edith our maid to pack where was this womans suitcase with her in gloucestershire or buried somewhere in dorset lost suitcaseslost children how did she travel to singleton magna if you had taken the only car i dont know i assumed that simon would make another arrangement for her he had several workmen here and theres the motorcar at the inn belonging to mr denton simon has borrowed it before it wasnt impossible to find someone to take her so short a way how many motorcars are there in charlbury simons of course which i seem to drive more often than he does these days and we have a little carriage we use sometimes that of the innkeeper and the rector had one his widow uses it now no one else no she said then added dryly but the horse is not dead in the countryside you know there are far more carriages and carts and wagons than there are motorcars in a tenmile radius even dr fairfield who comes to the village drives a buggy that very fierce little man from singleton magna with the face that looks as if hes bitten into a very sour lemon if transportation was a problem anyone in charlbury would have been glad to take her if only to please simon why do you ask these things they have nothing to do with the day that margaret arrived she has a very clear memory for detail rutledge thought what margaret tarlton might have seen arriving on the same train as bert mowbray had been his excuse when he had asked for her london direction we dont know where miss tarlton went from singleton magna she hasnt returned to her flat in london and she failed to arrive at the napier country home in sherborne they were expecting her there her gray eyes changed as he watched angeror was it resignationstirred in their depths ah why does that not surprise me did you believe miss tarlton was sent here as a spy in your midst he asked bluntly she had nearly admitted as much before it hadnt mattered then but of course why did elizabeth napier all at once have no further need of her services why after nearly eight years with the napiers was margaret prepared to come here its the nature of women sometimes to look for a change i dont know that elizabeth napier has been an easy mistress or margaret tarlton may prefer work that reminds her of growing up in india but thats exactly the point inspector the nature of women she said margaret is nearly twentynine years old the age when a woman is reminded that if shes to marry it must be soon how many eligible young men would you say there are here in charlbury he caught himself wondering how old elizabeth napier was and as if shed read his mind aurore said elizabeth was to marry simon in but he asked her to wait until the war was over and when he came home from france there was an unexpected impedimenthis french wife she has wasted five years she will be thirty next month the devastating honesty of the french smothering a rueful grin he said the point is we appear to have lost miss tarlton possibly between charlbury and singleton magna its my task to find her im afraid then i cannot help you she went upstairs to pack and i went to the farm to see to the livestock as i have already told you there was nothing else he could say except ive kept you from your breakfast long enough id like to speak to your husband before i go but simon had already finished his meal and gone across to the museum and it was there that rutledge finally caught up with him looking up from the small sandalwood figure in his hands simon said i thought your business was with my wife look at this shiva dancing exquisite isnt it even if i dont have the faintest idea who shiva might be ill leave such erudition to my assistant thats what brought me here actually your assistant i need to ask you who drove miss tarlton back to singleton magna to meet her train i thought aurore had why does it matter he replaced the carving on its shelf and stood back to see if it was dwarfed by the figures on either side he picked up one of its neighbors the fanciful figure of a large bird in flight yes rutledge said beginning to lose his temper put that thing down and pay attention to me man theres a woman lying dead in a paupers grave at singleton magna i want to know if it could be margaret tarlton and if it is i want to find out who put her there in a grave thats nonsense he frowned why should you think its miss tarlton mr wyatt we cant seem to find margaret tarlton she isnt in london and she isnt in sherborne at the napiers she was last reported to be here in your house on the point of leaving for her train nor have we located the mowbray children and thats the crux of our problem it raises questions about the identity of the murdered woman theres just a chancean outside chancethat the body hildebrand found in that field near singleton magna wasnt the mowbray woman after all if thats the case were going to have to start all over again and i intend to start here simon shook his head margaret tarlton took the afternoon train back to london shes most certainly not a murder victim then damn it where is she now and how did she get from charlbury to singleton magna ive told youi was busy in here and it was already arranged for aurore to drive her rutledge swore under his breath he knew that simon wyatt wasnt a stupid man and yet he didnt seem to hear what was said to him or register the gist of it are you telling me that your wife is a liar he suddenly had simon wyatts full attention clearly focused aurore never tells lies he said curtly if she says she didnt drive margaret to the station she didnt then who did thats what ive come to discover the museums outer door opened and a woman walked in calling simons name rutledge who could see the outer door from where he stood recognized her at once shed been in the garden behind the inn at the womens institute meeting that white streak in her hair was distinctive hallo simon she stopped oh do forgive me i didnt know you had a visitor i was sure this young man was calling on aurore ill come back later shall i nothing important inspector rutledge mrs joanna daulton shes the cement that holds charlbury together her late husband andrew was our rector he hasnt been replaced yet and mrs daulton has taken on his work as well as her own for nearly two years now i dont know what wed do without her he smiled at her with more affection and awareness than hed ever demonstrated when speaking of his wife mrs daulton didnt pretend to modesty she said only well someone has to do it while the bishops make up their tedious little minds how do you do inspector mrs prescott who lives next door to constable trait has already met you i think ive been looking forward to that pleasure as well she held out her hand and he took it in his a woman accustomed to social responsibilities and the burden of church duties that fell to her lot as the rectors wife she was clearly comfortable in any situation thank you it must have been your son that i saw the other day by the church he told me his father had been rector here something moved in her face a sadness that was beyond even her ability to deny indeed henry was severely wounded in the last year of the war but hes making wonderful progress were all quite pleased was it a polite social response the im quite well thank you that can mean anything from blatant good health to one foot in the grave because if rutledge was any judge henry daultons brain was permanently damaged but then he was no judge of how far daulton had come im glad to hear it he responded with equal politeness then added did you see miss tarlton during her stay in charlbury in particular on the last day of her visit no im afraid i didntto speak to i mean as i was coming away from the hamptons she was at the gate in front of this house standing there as if waiting for someone later henry told me shed rung the bell at the rectory searching for me to ask if i might drive her in to catch her train but before he could fetch me from the garden she called out that mrs wyatt had come after all and she would go with her what was she wearing when you saw her at the gate here ohi remember thinking how wonderfully cool she looked on such a warm day a floral pattern quite pretty mauve or pink or lavender im not exactly sure it was the overall effect i noticed and the hat hat he remembered that mrs hindes had mentioned a fetching hat yes a straw with an upswept brim on the left side many women cant wear hats like thatim one of them auroremrs wyattcould of course and certainly miss tarlton does them justice its the height im sure she herself was wearing a very conservative hat in a medium shade of blue it had an air of efficiency about it rather than style she was a very efficient woman rutledge thought in a courtroom she would make an unflappable witness her words well ordered and to the point but if that indeed was margaret tarlton murdered in a field where was her hat suitcases hats children id like to ask your son if she was wearing her hat when she came to your door may i ask why all this interest in miss tarltons apparel she looked from simon to rutledge is anything wrong besides being efficient she was clearly no fool just a matter of routine were interested in everyone who arrived in singleton magna on the train last week ah yes that poor man who killed his family i sometimes think the war has driven all of us into madness rutledge turned to simon wyatt you still havent answered my last question simon took a moment to remember no because i dont know how to answer it i told you i thought aurore was going to take care of it youd better speak with edith i suppose the maid ill see if i can find her for you mrs daulton im sorry no no come to see me when you have time simon theres no hurry rutledge held the door for mrs daulton and walked with her as far as the gate whats this all about she asked him you were questioning simon as if hed done something wrong ive known him since he was a child i wont see him treated like a miscreant without knowing why its just a matter of checking information mrs daulton joanna daulton stopped and looked up at him seeing more than he expected she might young man im not simpleminded and i wont be spoken to as if i were if theres anything that connects margaret tarlton to this wretched mowbray affair i suggest you ask her about it simon still has a great deal of work to do before this museum is set to open its all he thinks about and if you want my advice its best to let him get on with it the war nearly destroyed him and ive never been so grateful as i am to that ridiculous grandfather of his for putting the notion of a museum in his head its brought simon back from the edge of despair never mind whether its a roaring success or not it has stood between simon and selfdestruction i wont let you upset that balance do you hear me we cant find margaret tarlton weve looked in london where she lives and in sherborne where she was expected next but never arrived joanna daulton stared at him and for the first time since she had walked into the museum he watched her grapple with something that was outside her usual experience as community leader she seemed uncertain how to take him you cant find her in the sense that you dont know just where she may have goneor in the sense that shes missing thats our dilemma actually we arent sure well auroremrs wyattdrove her to the station i should think thats clear enough which means to me that miss tarlton left dorset on the train i should think london is a better place to start searching than singleton magna i was always under the impression that the police knew their business rutledge said nothing hamish hearing the exchange said she reminds me of fionas aunt elspeth macdonald no man in his right mind crossed her she opened the gate do heed me inspector walk carefully where simons concerned dont upset him if theres no need for it rutledge watched her walk firmly up the street had she purposelyor inadvertentlysacrificed aurore wyatt to distract him from simon on the whole hed guess that it was on purpose mrs daultons first duty was to the boy shed watched grow up not to his foreignborn wife on the other hand he told himself she might feel that aurore was far better able to protect herself than simon was edith was nervously waiting for him in the parlor standing stiffly by the hearth as if the portrait at her back gave her moral support im not here to badger you he told her gently its just a matter of what miss tarlton was wearing when she left here last week on her way to london do you remember surprised at the simplicity of the question edith smiled oh yes sir it was a pretty dress quite summery to my way of thinking rose and lavender with a slim skirt and a belt of the same cloth and a straw hat that had ribbons of the same colors around the crown but that wasnt half as fine as what she was wearing when she arrived she stopped her blue eyes alarmed she had overstepped her bounds rutledge said yes id like to know about that as well it was this silvery gray silk and it shimmered like cool water when she moved and she had the most wonderful hat to match the silk ruched down the brim and a low crown the only touch of color was this thin crimson ribbon tied in a bow and set to one side id never seen anything quite soso stylish had margaret tarlton come prepared to outshine the french bride what luggage did she have with her the one piece sir who drove her to the station in singleton magna mrs wyatt was set to do it but she was late and miss tarlton was afraid shed miss her train so she asked if there was anyone else who might take her if mrs wyatt didnt come in time but she must have because i said id run down to the wyatt arms to ask mr denton for the loan of his car and his nephew mr shaw for miss tarlton but he said his nephew was over to stoke newton with it and when i came back miss tarlton had gone you think mrs wyatt carried her into singleton magna then i dont know sir edith told him honestly but mrs wyatt isnt one to forget what shes promised to do as rutledge was leaving aurore came around the corner of the house a basket of deadheaded flowers over her arm she saw him and said inspector he turned to wait for her shielding her eyes against the cloudy brightness of the morning she looked up at him i wish you to tell me whats happening all these questions about margaret it makes me uneasy there was a trowel in her gloved hands and a smudge of damp earth on one cheek he found himself staring at it i dont know myself why im asking them he said surprising himself every time i think im a step closer to the truth the concepts of whats truth and whats wishful thinking seem to merge and theres only a muddle where there had appeared to be answers because if margaret tarlton was wearing gray silk on the morning she arrived how could bert mowbray have searched everywhere for a woman wearing pink aurore reached out and touched his arm you will know what to do she said however difficult it is you have courage you see its there in the lines of your face suffering has taught you that he found himself wanting desperately to tell her about hamishand jean the words seemed to hover on the edge of his tongue ready to spill over wanting understandingabsolutionand afterward peace stunned by his unexpected and overwhelming reaction to her sympathy he stood there at a loss hamish was warning him over and over to leave now while you still have some measure of selfcontrol he thought for one dazed instant that the warm hand on his arm was lifting to touch his face and he knew helplessly that it would be his undoing but she stepped back that deep sense of stillness wrapping her again in her own untouchability without saying goodbye he turned and walked through the gate he didnt remember turning the crank or starting the motorcar he didnt remember driving out of charlbury it wasnt until he reached the crossroads that some measure of selfcommand overcame the turmoil in his mind aurore wyatt was a suspect in a murder investigation and she had been conscious of the effect shed had on him rutledge sat in his car at the crossroads trying to shut out hamishs voice loneliness leads a man into folly he was pointing out its loneliness at the bottom of it and she saw that man shes no above using it the notice of jeans engagements left ye vulnerable to such wiles it was naturalshes a damned attractive woman aye and shes got a husband besides which shes french rutledge shook his head as if being french explained a woman like aurore and yet somehow it did she knew more about men than was good for them she saw deeper inside them but her power was very different from elizabeth napiers hed have to remember that he sighed and let in the clutch he tried to shift the subject in his mind as well to distract hamish from coming too close to the truth and to distract himself from the feel of aurores hand resting so lightly on his arm what was he going to do about this problem before him was the dead woman margaret tarlton or mary sandra mowbray aye hamish reminded him its a proper puzzle and if you canna get to the bottom of it no one else will stilldid it truly matter if bert mowbray had been the one who killed her what her name actually was murder was murder the identity of the victim was secondary it didnt change anything death was quite final and a man would be hanged as surely for murdering a nameless tramp as he would be for killing a peer of the realm the only difference was in the public attention the trial would receive and yet rutledge knew that to him it mattered a victim had no one in the law to speak for him or her the police were bent on finding the guilty party the courts were set up to determine guilt and if guilt was proved to offer sanctioned retribution for the crime committed prison or the gallows society was then satisfied by the restoration of order civilized order where personal revenge and vendettas were foregone in the name of law was that any consolation to the victim did it make up for the missed years of living when he himself had stood in the trenches facing imminent death and seeing it reach out for him in a multitude of disguises the concept of dying gloriously for king and country had taken on a different image a certainty of life ending in a shock of pain and sheer terror with nothing left of the man he was or might be only a bloody ruin to be tumbled into a hasty grave if he was foundif not lying where hed fallen obscenely rotting on the battlefield where even the crows dare not come for him and in those months when hed wanted to die to bring the suffering to an end he had thought longingly of what might have been if there had been no war yes he knew better than most what the dead have lost and where was margaret tarlton if she wasnt lying in that grave it always came back to the children find themor notand he would have his answer but you couldnt wish children dead to solve a mystery rutledge said aloud weve come full circle aye hamish said in resignation as he strode into the swan the young woman behind the desk called inspector inspector rutledge he turned and she went on a superintendent bowles in london has been trying to reach you the message was please contact him as soon as possible he left his number for you she held out a sheet of paper he hesitated not sure he was ready to speak to london the young woman said helpfully youll find the telephone in the cloakroom just there it took ten minutes to put the call through and fifteen more for someone to locate bowles in the end when bowles finally called him back rutledge had prepared himself for a catechism instead bowles said loudly as if compensating for the distance between scotland yard and dorset is that you rutledge id like to know why thomas napier descended on me this morning concerned about his daughter what in gods name have you done to the woman i brought her from sherborne to singleton magna last night hildebrand showed miss napier the clothing the victim was wearing when she was found according to miss napier the apparel belonged to margaret tarlton good god havent you found her i thought she was in sherborne she never arrived there ive located witnesses who place her in charlbury on the point of leaving to catch her train i was just about to ask the stationmaster if he remembered her neither simon wyatt nor his wife seems to know who drove her to singleton magna there was an audible sigh at the other end of the line first the napiers and now the wyatts i told you not to tread on any toes i havent so far he could foresee the possibility of it whats the mowbray woman doing in miss tarltons clothing anyway its quite possible the dead woman is miss tarlton well get to the bottom of it man i dont see what the problem is and hildebrands complaining that youre never around when he needs you and im told the children still havent been found that was your responsibility there may be no expectation of finding them alive nowbut find them we shall do you hear me whats taking so damned long the victim has been buried with your permission im told if we dont locate miss tarlton we have a dilemma there was silence at the other end of the line are you saying you want that corpse exhumed it may be necessary no ill send someone to gloucestershire on the off chance the tarlton womans gone there if she has wed look a fool wouldnt we there isnt a man in the picture is there someone in london she may not want the napiers to know about ill have worthington ask her family about that while hes in gloucestershire if shes not with them i dont think london is at the bottom of this business you arent paid to think youre there to find answers and for gods sake placate that napier woman before her father comes down on the lot of us dont annoy the wyatts either do you hear me there was a distinct sound of the receiver at the other end being slammed into its cradle rutledge felt like doing much the same he found peg the chambermaid and asked her to take a message to miss napiers room miss napier left not ten minutes ago sir someone brought a motorcar over from sherborne and shes being driven to charlbury he swore silently as peg curtsied and went on her way aye you should ha seen it coming hamish said commiserating but yon frenchwoman addled your wits youve no been thinking straight all the morning and see where its got you a tonguelashing by auld bowels and that headstrong lassie slipping off to charlbury the instant your backs turned intent on meddling in this business making mischief isnt at the bottom of it elizabeth napier still wants simon wyatt the question is to what lengths is she willing to go if she thinks theres even an outside chance of getting him ive a feeling hamish warned that youd best be on your way to charlbury to find out but rutledge first went to the station to ask the master about margaret tarlton describing her and the clothing shed worn the man shook his head i dont remember a woman fitting that description taking the london train there were three men from singleton magna going up that day and two women who bought tickets to kingston lacey i know them both by name that was the passenger tally according to my records she may have taken the train south rather than to london i doubt it not that many people do from here id recall that id recall her as well rutledge thanked him then walked back to the inn for his car he might well need that exhumation order if worthington came up emptyhanded marcus johnston mowbrays lawyer was coming down the street toward him as rutledge drove out of the swans yard just as he was about to make the turn for charlbury johnston hailed him any news ive been trying to find hildebrand to ask but hes out in the field again which tells me not to be sanguine he came up to the car and put a hand on the lowered window no how is your client johnston took a deep breath as if bracing himself to think about mowbray poorly he forgets to eat cant close his eyes more than five minutes which says hes not sleeping distracted by whatever wretched scenes hes seeing over and over in his head when i try to discuss his defense with him he looks at me as if im not there damned odd feeling i can tell you according to one of the constables you persuaded him to speak im surprised i was asking him about his children he wanted to stop me and the only way he could do that was to cry out i should have been there with four or five people crowded into that wretched cell hed have been suffocated i wasnt after a confession i only wanted to know how much the children had grown since that photograph was taken the flyer hasnt helped i thought perhaps we could do something more johnston shook his head im beginning to believe hes hidden them too well its unlikely to my way of thinking for a stranger in this town to find any place the local people dont know about and yet he let it go i went to the services for mrs mowbray i felt someone ought to be there besides the police and the undertaker i dont like funerals this one was worst than most the rector didnt know what to say about the poor womanwhether shed lived a blameless life or was no better than a whore which left him platitudes most of them more apt for a sermon than a burial no one wanted to mention the circumstances that had brought her there murder i mean i hadnt thought to bring flowers and the ground looked appallingly bare and lonely when theyd filled in the earth i suppose i ought to see to a simple markermowbray certainly doesnt have the resources for it i dont think he truly undertands that shes dead and you were satisfied in your own mind that you knew the victims identity that it was mary sandra mowbray yes of course johnston said surprised in a town this size if anyone goes missing theres gossipand everyone hears about it i daresay hildebrand could have told you the instant he set eyes on her that the victim didnt belong here a man like that knows the possibilties and can discount most of them on the spot i should think even though her face was so badly beaten hes a good policeman thorough dogged and mowbray made no secret of his intentions the first order of business naturally would have been to bring him in and lock him up even i find it hard to deny the mans guilt i can only hope to show mitigating circumstances and even thats a damned narrow tightrope he rubbed the bridge of his nose anyway if the woman had been someone else it would surely have come to light by this time what if a reliable witness informed you that the dress the victim was wearing belonged to another woman not to mrs mowbray johnston smiled the tiredness in his face reflected in his eyes as mowbrays barrister id be delighted to hear it as a realist id ask myself why anyone would choose to lie about it he took out his watch and opened it good god look at the time ive another client waiting i must go he walked away and rutledge looked after him his face thoughtful the day was gray humid farmers were out in their fields a sense of urgency about them as they worked as if they could smell the rain coming charlbury looking drab in the dull light seemed unchanged and yet there was something electric in the air as rutledge drove down the street he wasnt sure if that was his imagination or real there was another motorcar in the inns side yard this morning a stocky man in a dark uniform desultorily polishing the bonnet instead of stopping there rutledge went directly to constable traits house getting out to knock at the door that sense of pending catastrophe seemed to hold him in its grip as he waited for an answer it wasnt his imagination it was something in the mood of the place for the most part the streets were empty and the gardens too doors were shut he wondered how many pairs of eyes watched him from behind starched curtains he could feel their stares intent and waiting they know hamish warned him theyve already been told the second summons brought not the constable but his neighbor mrs prescott he had seen the twitch of white lace curtains as she had looked him over before deciding what to do curiosity he thought had won over prudence hes not to home she said standing in her door and leaning out to speak to him you wont find him here where is he rutledge asked by god if the man had gone courting again his turn to lead a search party she moved down onto the front step and said earnestly is it true then is that miss tarlton missing and given up for dead id not like to think of two deaths so close to home in so short a time where did you hear about miss tarlton rutledge asked though he knew full well miss napier she came to find the constable herself and she was that upset to learn hed already gone out but it cant waitits been a week thats enough time wasted she said i could see her hands trembling and her face was white she looked about to cry i brought her inside for a cup of tea for she didnt want mr wyatt to see her that way took a quarter of an hour to settle her down poor soul two masters at work he thought mrs prescott intent on pulling the truth out of an apparently distraught woman while miss napier was carefully sowing the seeds she wanted to bear fruit did she tell you what was wrong why she needed constable truit oh yes mrs prescott said casting a glance up and down the quiet street she said her secretary that was visiting the wyatts had disappeared she wanted to know if i could tell her anything that might help but i couldnt mrs prescott said with simple honesty i never saw miss tarlton leave miss napier she asked me to make inquiries in charlbury among my friends to see if they had any word and thats what i did she paused her eyes worried all charlbury knew who she wasthe tarlton woman shed come to apply for that position at the wyatt museum they was in need of an assistant for mr simon a pretty young woman such lovely hair i saw her when i carried a jar of my plum preserves along to mrs wyatt why should anyone want to harm her it wasnt a question he could answer yet she added philosophically well it gives busy tongues something new to wag about weve nearly talked to death mr simons choice of wife and still nobody knows quite what to make of her he was furiously angry with elizabeth napier for giving the story her own peculiar twist no association with mowbray or his wifeno link with the body found outside of singleton magna it was as if the two crimesif there had indeed been a second murderhad been unconnected as if there were still miss tarltons dead body to find well hidden in someones bushes or back garden small wonder the village had withdrawn behind closed doors another search this time turning charlbury upside down delving into secrets that no one wanted to see exposed because there were always secretswhether they had had any impact on the crime in question or not and hamish had been right elizabeth napier had adroitly outmaneuvered him by coming here and starting her own rumors by worrying her father and sending him directly to bowles to complain of the police hamish interjected helplessness is a weapon thats hard to fight and rutledge had no taste for playing the bully all right then hed see if he could undo some of the damage he said to mrs prescott we dont know that anyone had a reason for wishing to harm miss tarlton but miss napier is understandably concerned that her secretary cant be found and shes taken it upon herself to initiate a search mrs prescott sniffed what youre telling me then is just what she said you would it looks bad for the police when theres two mysterious goingson in one week first that poor woman in singleton magna is killed with her children and now miss tarlton cant be found miss napier says that that inspector hildebrand has all but told her shes making mountains out of molehills but she wont give up not her and i know miss napier from before the war when she came to dorset regular shes not one to run about like a chicken with its head off if shes alarmed theres something to be alarmed about rutledge said theres no sign of foul play for all we know miss tarlton may well be visiting her family in gloucestershire shes not mrs prescott said with conviction miss napier she called them last night and they havent seen miss tarlton since she was down in july for her cousins birthday retreat while theres a way open hamish warned him shell no believe you whatever you have to say rutledge for once took his advice after thanking mrs prescott he drove back to the inn to leave the motorcar there the chauffeur of the other car looked up quickly as rutledge came to a halt as if expecting to see someone else thomas napier perhaps he nodded politely once he realized that rutledge was no one he knew and went back to his task of brushing out the interior it looked spotless is that miss napiers motorcar rutledge asked getting out it was a simple way to open a conversation and the car was hed noticed very like the wyatts her fathers yes sir the man replied warily he was sturdy in his midtwenties and there were burns across his face and the backs of his hands rutledge had seen such wounds before on airmen sent down in flames where will i find her my instructions were to wait for miss napier here thats all i know rutledge turned to look up the road toward the wyatt house i dont know what there is about this town the driver said unexpectedly coming to stand behind him itsunfriendly i wouldnt want to live here whats your name rutledge asked over his shoulder benson sir i understand miss napier came here often in the past did you drive her no that must have been taylor hes retired now i was hired some six months back to replace him knew margaret tarlton did you he caught himself using the past tense but let it go he turned if benson noticed the slip he gave no sign instead he studied the man before him whos asking rutledge told him benson nodded you must have been the policeman who came for miss napier last night yes i know miss tarltonive driven her around most of london on occasional business for mr napier or his daughter always tries to be punctual and says shes sorry if she keeps me waiting she was expected in sherborne on the evening train miss napier wanted the car most of that day and said shed go along to the station herself to fetch miss tarlton but she wasnt on the train what did miss napier have to say to that she said something must have detained miss tarlton and shed want me to go back on the next day but miss tarlton wasnt on that train either which day was it that miss napier met the train and where did she go beforehand do you know over a week ago sir thirteen august it was sir i dont know where she went beforehand its often to sherborne when im not asked to drive her but thats not to say it was sherborne miss napier just told me id have the day and the evening free hamish stirred with sharpened interest it was on august in the late afternoon that the murdered womans body had been found outside singleton magna rutledge said does thomas napier ask you toerkeep an eye on his daughter hes a prominent man and she seems to do some sort of charity work in the london slums he must feel some concern about that no sir hes never seemed to have a particular concern in that direction its miss tarlton hes always wanting to know about rutledge walked up the road to the wyatt house hamish still mulling over bensons last remark demanded why did you no ask him what he meant because elizabeth napier might question him if she saw us there talking together id rather bring up her father to her not the chauffeur bowles might have been on to more than he realized when he asked about a london connection he saw mrs daulton and her son henry coming toward him mrs daulton paused to speak to him as he touched his hat and said in her usual nononsense way you find the cat firmly ensconced among the pigeons inspector was she using the term metaphorically or was she being careful not to say in plain terms what henry might hear and repeat he nodded to henry who responded in kind youre a policeman he said as if glad to have this straight i thought you liked old churches as a matter of fact i do rutledge answered truthfully hed always had an interest in architecture thanks to his godfather david trevor probably knew more about any given british building than the men who had originally put it up stone and brick and wood were profession passion and pastime to him mrs daulton was saying miss napier seems to believe somethings happened to miss tarlton shes quite worried in fact she came to see me before she went to speak to simon to collect herself before they met i expect i thought there might have been more to your questions than you told us earlier i dont know myself what my interest is in miss tarlton he replied at first it was as a witness that was true enough now she could be involved in one way or another youre right young women of her class dont vanish into thin air but i refuse to believe that theres a murderer loose who might slaughter all of us in our bedsthree parishioners have already come to see me this morning with such a story apparently they had it from mrs prescott i dont think charlbury is in grave danger he agreed then you feel that that poor man in singleton magnas jail may have killed margaret tarltonthat he may have mistaken her for his wife its possible he replied she was an intelligent woman one who was plain and uncompromising in her view of life then its time i set matters straight as my late husband would say the sooner you scotch a snake the better she suddenly smiled transforming her face giving it an attractiveness and youthfulness that surprised him i do not of course refer to miss napier as the snake the smile faded as she looked down the empty street behind him still you can see for yourself what suspicion and fear can do in a small place like this everyone is staying indoors henry said the last time it was the influenza like a plague frightened everybody id read about the plague at school he frowned then said i think i remember miss napier from before the war of course you do mrs daulton said calmly you and simon miss napier and marian were friends to rutledge she added marian was my daughter she died in childhood she died of lockjaw henry put in it wasnt very pleasant in the brief silence that followed rutledge seized his opportunity he said to henry keeping his voice on a conversational level do you remember miss tarlton coming to the rectory last week i expect she was looking for someone to take her to singleton magna henry nodded she wanted to know if i could drive her or failing that my mother she said she didnt want to go in dentons car with shaw interesting how was she dressed do you recall he smiled i dont know much about womens clothes inspector it was summery like flowers i do remember her straw hat though i didnt much like it her hair was pretty enough without it his eyes were clear untroubled and after that she went away i think she was quite angry do you know why she said something about a train she was afraid she might miss it mrs daulton was gazing at her son with rapt attention hanging on his words as if he were delivering the profoundest of answers making her enormously proud of him rutledge found himself thinking this mans tragedy isnt his he doesnt know what hes lost its his mothers his wounds are the death knell to any ambitions for him and she cant accept it shell push her son as long as she can shes another civilian casualty like marcus johnston she turned back to him inspector if you should want to speak with me at any time leave a message at the rectory i always check the little basket by the door with a nod she walked on henry followed hamish said shes a strong woman i think it did na come naturally to her its there in her eyes long years of pain did you take note of it yes i saw it but rutledges eyes were on the wyatt house he could just pick out the shape of someone in an upstairs room looking out he would have sworn it was aurore when rutledge stepped through the garden gate he could hear voices from the museum simons deeper tones and then as counterpoint elizabeth napiers lighter responses he turned that way but glanced up at the window on the first floor yes aurore was standing there looking out her face still her body like a statue in its unyielding stance and yet behind the stillness was not rigidity nor was it tranquility there was only an air of waiting he knocked at the door of the museum although it was open to the muggy air surely not rutledge told himself very good for the hide puppets or the small fragile wings of butterflies come in simon called impatiently rutledge stepped inside and found wyatt with his guest in the second room elizabeth was holding a lovely sandalwood carving in her hand this one of a god with an elephants head human foot lifted as in a dance one arm raised ganesh she was saying i remember margaret mentioned him as one of her favorite hindu figures and much nicer i must say than that ugly one with all the arms shiva i think the destroyer yes that matches doesnt it you find yourself picturing death when you look into his face rutledge simon acknowledged over her head have you any news no rutledge answered ive come to see what news miss napier has to tell me he turned to her waiting with polite interest she blushed the rich color rising into her cheeks and giving her eyes a brightness youre absolutely right i should have waited for you to come back to the swan but after id called gloucestershire i thoughti felt i had to tell simon before that awful man hildebrand took it into his head to come here with no regard for anyones feelings there was honest contrition in her face as she swung around to him im not accustomed to the way the police work if ive done anything wrong i sincerely beg your pardon inspector simon said youve not done anything wrong elizabeth dont let them harass you with their nonsense he added to rutledge i cant understand why you didnt tell me your suspicions earlier all that rubbish about what margaret was wearing look you dont think that maniac mowbray got to her somehow how could he she wasnt walkingshe was as far as i can determine driven from charlbury directly to the station at singleton magna if she had come across mowbray on the road and hed attempted to stop the motorcar she should have been safe enough whoever was driving the car would most certainly have gone straight to hildebrand afterward even if miss tarlton left on the train and no such person has come forward simon said it was aurore who drove her i dont know why she wont come out and admit to it i asked her myself as soon as elizabeth told me what she thought might have happened rutledge felt a wave of disgust he knew how simon with his oddly abrupt unfeeling manner toward his wife must have confronted her making her feel she had been directly accused why have you been lying about this id think it would be better to come straight out with the trutheveryone knows it was you who drove margaret perhaps she didnt take miss tarlton to the station after all rutledge replied in her defense before he could stop himself his task was to determine guilt not innocence but he refused to watch possible innocence trampled there was a brief silence i suppose someone else might have driven her simon agreed reluctantly there are other motorcars in charlbury but aurore promised me shed see to it and it isnt like aurore to lie i dont understand this any of it yet he had told rutledge earlier that aurore never lied i think its too early to go on witch hunts elizabeth put in her voice appealing for reassurance margarets missing itit doesnt actually mean shesdead i dont know where she might have gone do you perhaps your father might know her whereabouts rutledge countered not allowing himself to fall into the neat trap shed setexpecting him to bring up the dress shed identified the night before there was darker color in elizabeth napiers face this time then it drained away as quickly as it had come i asked him myself this morning he thought she was with me he was understandably upset that shed been missing a week and no one had realized it he likes margaret i think everyone does shes one of the most dependable people i know thats why her position was so important then why did she choose to apply for the position here rutledge asked just because some of the things in this room remind her of india id say at a guess that many of them come from other places in the east java burma perhaps ceylon or even siam its much the same culture simon impatiently pointed out buddhism hinduism the same roots margaret told me that herself what are you doing to find her do you have men out looking has anyone spoken to the stationmaster in singleton magna i went to see him this morning rutledge answered and men are searching the same ground two and three times looking for the mowbray children if shes out there one of the teams will find her somehow i dont think they will his glance moved on to elizabeth let her tell the rest of that story if she felt so inclinedthat the body had already been properly buried now if youll excuse me id like to find mrs wyatt is she at home this morning yes yes just go around to the house simon told him and i want a report rutledge whats being done how youre handling this situation i still have connections in london ill use them if i have to there wont be any need for that rutledge said the police are quite good at what they do its a question of time thats all miss napier he turned and left irritated by the implied threat aurore must have seen him coming back toward the house from the museum because she was there at the main door as he came up to knock it isnt a very fine morning inspector and so i will not wish you one is there any news im afraid not id like very much to talk to you he said but not in the house or the garden will you walk with me as far as the church perhaps she smiled wryly while all those faces are pressed against their windows wondering if you will arrest me on the way back yes i know what is being said i can feel it charlbury is both titillated and scandalized by this affair what is that novel one of your famous authors has written about the french revolution where the old women sit by the guillotine and knit as the heads of aristocrats fall into baskets except here it is not knitting i think it is the face that is just behind the lace of the curtain each breath stirring it with anticipation i saw you standing behind a curtain as i came up the walk he said she smiled so i was allow me to find my sweater inspector she was back in only a moment as if shed had it close to hand they walked out of the house and turned through the gate toward the churchyard i apologize for such stupid bitterness she told him as if there had been no interruption to their conversation it is not like me but elizabeth napier is a woman one cannot defend herself against she uses innuendo like a sword but then i must remember that i have robbed her of the man she wanted to marry it is the most unforgivable thing one woman can do to another i think shes worried about margaret tarlton is she aurore turned her head and looked at his profile i am glad to hear it i thought she was worried for simon he smiled down at her touche a little of both with elizabeth napier as i am fast learning there are no absolutes she laughed a deep brief chuckle you are an extraordinary man she said are you married no it was uncompromising she read more into it than he intended no she repeated softly it explains much nowyou wished to speak to me she pulled her sweater a little more closely about her as if as a shield everyone seems to believealthough so far ive not found one of them who actually saw youthat it was you who drove margaret to the station and therefore in their view youre the person who should know whether she got there safely or not i spoke to the stationmaster he claims she didnt take either train from singleton magna on the day she left charlbury but i have told you i was with a heifer that was sick whatever simon may say we cant afford to lose livestocksimon is pouring every penny he possesses into this museum there was not a great deal of money to start with his inheritance from his father was quite small and it is this farm that will pay for our food bur car our clothes not his grandfathers treasures she matched him stride for stride comfortably walking beside him and he was a tall man they had nearly reached the churchyard she said stopping him with her hand outstretched as if wanting to touch him then deciding against it do you think i am lying to you inspector he had never felt his soul stripped so bare by the eyes of another person it was as if she searched into depths he himself had never plumbed i dont know but i shall make it my business to find out he studied her face in his turn then asked did you drive margaret to singleton magna quarrel with her and put her out along the way where mowbray then came across her walking no one would blame you for that you couldnt have known this might explain to us how mowbray got to her and bring an end to all these questions she bit her lip i would be morally responsible but you are playing fair with both of us are you not to ask very well i will make a pact with you her eyes smiled suddenly with the humor of it a pact with the devil if you like i cant make promises this one is not a promise it is a pact there is a difference even i know that difference in english she searched his face again and then said quietly if you come to the conclusion after your investigations that i have lied about where i was when margaret tarlton left charlbury if you believe that there is any possibility of my guilt in any harm that may have come to her then you will face me and say such things directly you will not speak first to simonnor to elizabeth napier nor to that policeman in singleton magna do you agree are you telling me no i am not telling you i have killed margaret tarlton of course not but suspicion is a very ugly thing inspector and it destroys both the innocent and the guilty sometimes there is no way afterward to make right the damage that has been done if i am to be accused of any crime i prefer to have it said to my face not whispered behind my back can you understand this it is not so cruel youre trying to protect someone is that it simon her mouth turned down wryly i am protecting myself i think i dont know but yes simon toothis museum must open in one month it is not the best publicity do you think to have it said that the owners wife is a murderess people will come out of morbid curiosity and i could not bear that i do not think our marriage could survive that and so i look for a solution of sorts i dont know he said trying to make sense of her words what you are asking of me she shrugged that very gallic gesture that could mean so many things call it intuition if you like or a sense i cannot explain but i shall tell you this where elizabeth napier is concerned there is no question of right or wrong in this matter she is looking for simple justice that is for herself not for margaret and justice is sometimes blind soi make my pact with you and try to spare my husband pain if i can holding out her hand as a man might do she waited for rutledge to take it but deep in his mind hamish was already coming to another conclusion shes afraid he said softly because there is something she knows and canna tell hildebrand would no stand for this nonsense was it that rutledge wondered or the fact that she was sure she could reach himand so was using him to protect herself by putting on him the onus of betraying her using him as elizabeth napier was using simon wyatt aye a woman does na think the way a man does hamish told him but rutledge had made up his mind he took the hand she held out and shook it briefly agreed he said and watched the play of expressions across her face surprise a certain wariness relief at the last a flare of fear as if she realized suddenly and far too late that perhaps she had misjudged him rutledge walked back to the gate with aurore wyatt without speaking she had slipped into a silence all her own as if she had forgotten the man beside her her face was withdrawn her eyes shuttered behind the long lashes they could hear elizabeth napiers voice and simons not the words so much as the comfortable rise and fall of a conversation between two people who had much in common long years of understanding respectlove aurore said tilting her head to listen i knew when margaret tarlton came here to apply for the position of assistant that one way or another she would bring that woman back into our lives i was right only i didnt see the way of it just that it would happen he married you thats what matters as jean would never marry him it was finished but then as hamish was busy reminding him rutledge himself had been the last to let go in that relationship why should elizabeth napier be any different if the war years had changed him so much taking jean from him they had also cost elizabeth napier simon wyatt simon too had changed yes he married me but i ask myself sometimes was it the war was he sorry for me and what had happened to me was it loneliness or a mans need for a woman or was it truly love i thought i knew then now i am not as certain as i once was she put her hand on the gate ready to open it and go inside please find that woman find her soon for simons sake and she left him standing there watching her graceful stride as she went up the walk ignoring the voices that seemed to ignore her so completely there was one other stop rutledge wished to make in charlbury the inn it was the pulse of village life oftentimes the place where gossip and conjecture made their first rounds the question was would denton tell him what was being said or as the outsider would he be shut out of knowledge any villager might be given for the asking nodding to benson who was still polishing the boot as if he had nothing better to fill his time rutledge stepped into the wyatt arms he saw that dentons nephew shaw was sitting at a table alone an empty pint glass in front of him idly tracing one finger through the rings left by other pints he looked up recognized rutledge and said why in gods name couldnt you have told me that margaret tarlton was missing damn it i had to hear it from that prescott bitch the words were slurred but behind them was deep anger i didnt know when i was here yesterday that she was missing then youre a damned poor policeman god its been over a week how did you come to know her rutledge pulled out the empty chair across from him and looked around there was no one else in the shadows of the small room but he could hear voices from the bar down the passage not from charlbury if thats what youre asking then where london thats right he answered grudgingly as if the alcohol in him wanted to talk and the reticence of the man tried to hold on to silence i was on a troop train on my way to the coast she was one of those women offering hot tea and sandwiches as we came through i didnt even know her name just that she had the loveliest face id ever seen he frowned i took it to egypt with me i thought if i die at least ive seen hertouched her hand and if i live ill find her call it a promise to myself a bargain with fate rutledge looked away how well he knew what bargains might be made with fate to keep a man alive one day longer one battle longer or come between a man and wanting to die hamish reminded him two years later i was back in london sooner than id expected shipped like a sausage strapped to a stretcher out of my head most of the time a fever no one least of all the doctors could decide what it was or how best to treat it they sent me home to die but i was one of the lucky ones it burned itself out the first day they let me stand on my feet all i could think of was getting back to that railway station finding her somehow a fools dream that she must have spoken to a hundred men on each train its not very likely shed remember one of them in particular no youve got it wrong there was a benefit performance at one of the theaters and i didnt want to go but a friend wouldnt take no for an answerand there she was sitting in one of the boxes across from me i couldnt tell you if my life was on the line what the program was about there was a woman singing italian arias or something i thought shed never finish at the interval i managed to speak to margaret it took some doing to separate her from her party but i wasnt about to lose her a second time there was an echo of triumph in his voice and a lift to his shoulders as if the memory were still alive in his mind rutledge waited silence was sometimes more effective than a question id talked to her that day about canadahow it was out there i dont know whyit seemed to catch her imagination and i was afraid shed move on to the next window if i stopped i told her about the place where a group of us were planting apple orchards on the slopes facing south and how wed built the long irrigation lines wooden troughs but they worked how the high peaks were heavy with snow even into may whatever came into my head to keep that look on her face the first thing she said to me at the theater was hallo youre the man who lives with grizzly bears and elk he stopped frowned at his empty glass ive lost count he said ive muddled the rings too cant depend on em anymore looking up he said you arent drinking why not im on duty rutledge reminded him what happened after the theater i escorted her everywhere shed let me riding one day tennis another dinnerany excuse to be with her i was falling in love with her what i didnt know couldnt judge was whether she cared for me or if i was just an available man when she needed a presentable escort someone with both legs and two arms who could dance with her the doctors raised hell they said the pace i was setting was getting in the way of my recovery i didnt care the longer i was in england the happier i was denton came in i heard voices he said looking from shaws strained face to rutledges thought it might be custom no its all right uncle jack denton nodded and left after a moment shaw said id have married her but she wasnt interested in living in a wilderness no matter how beautiful or exotic it might be shed grown up in india i dont want to be exiled again she said not if i can help it he managed somehow to capture the light tones of a womans voice and a subtle hint of selfishness as if margaret tarlton didnt mind how she might have hurt him it was the first real glimpse rutledge had had of the missing woman i asked her begged herto tell me if there was another man and she shook her head and kissed me and said i was being silly but there was i could see his eyes following her i could see the look on his face when he came into a room and she was there god he was a mirror of what i was feeling and i was stupid enough to confront her with it the day before i was to sail she wouldnt see me afterward wouldnt answer my calls or my letters it wasthat was the last time when i was sent home again half my guts cut away i knew it was finished how could i go back to herhow could i even tell her i was alive hamish had stirred already sure of the answer more sure than rutledge was who was the other man shaw grimaced as if the tension of the last ten minutes had brought back the pain in his body his arms were lightly clasped around his middle to hold it in he seemed completely sober now eyes dark circled and heavy with memory a man with only a past and no future thomas napier if he hadnt had a daughter a year older than she was i think hed have married her himself he wanted her badly enough it was there raw and hot sometimes when id bring her home and we were laughing clinging to each other as we made our way up the steps more tipsy with excitement than wine but how could he know when i saw her getting out of the wyatts motorcar last week i thought for one horrible instant shed come looking for me out of misplaced pity or duty but mrs prescott soon put an end to that rash hope she mentioned to denton that it was the museum that had brought margaret something about coming here as simons assistant besides there was no way she could have known i was here very few people do did you speak to her before she left charlbury god no when i can barely stand straight even now without all the fires of hell lit in my belly ive got some pride left damn it she wouldnt have me before what could i say that might have changed her mind now she wasnt married to napier for one thing no shaw looked at the dark ceiling where the beams wore a collection of polished horse buttons studying them as if they were more important than anything he was thinking or feeling a bitter concentration theres the other side of it as wellshe was considering moving here leaving the napier household for another position shaw laughed a rough hollow sound shed have to wouldnt she if she was planning to marry him margaret has been elizabeths secretary for years not napiers social equal that but if she were here under simons wing shed be safe enough from gossip people wouldnt be so fast to jump to ugly conclusions thats the sort of thing margaret would think of she must have known very well how to handle him it was elizabeth who stood in the way his mind occupied on his way out of charlbury rutledge almost missed the woman standing by the road clearly hoping to catch his eye she was wearing a faded housedress the blues nearly gray now and her hair was pinned back stringendy as if it were being punished for trying to curl in the dampness was she one of the women hed passed on the street he couldnt be sure shed have dressed differendy going to market rutledge pulled over and said were you looking for me aye youre the policeman from london they say inspector rutledge yes behind her in the doorway he could see three small children peering out with large sober eyes whatever it was their mother wanted theyd been told to stay out of the way and make no noise or the policeman would get them it was a threat used often enough in some quarters of london to keep children quiet beave now or ill fetch the copper on yer the woman nodded then hesitated as if reluctant to give her name but they were just outside her house with paint peeling around the windows and a look of shabbiness about the roof where it needed rethatching he could find her again easily she said hazel dixon i heard tell you was looking for information about that woman guest at the wyatts how she left charlbury on the fifteenth hamish stirred and rutledge tried to keep his own expression bland thats right let her tell it in her own way or she might change her mind suddenly there was a hot intensity in the pale blue eyes watching him it was her mrs wyatt i saw the car going on toward noon it was two days after that miss tarlton came here i heard the motor and looked out my window and i saw it passing in the direction of the crossroads and singleton magna could you see the driver he asked she would have been on the far side of the car as he was now well it was her wasnt it shes the one drives the car mr wyatt he dont care to drive himself hes used to having people at his beck and call ive seen her with a scarf blowing out like some banner announcing her and the men too turning to look wanting in their eyes its indecent lustful most of em including my bill know what shes like they was in france and those women had no men of their own i know what went on my bill didnt learn to she stopped this time with a rising flush she hadnt meant to say such things shed allowed herself to be led on by his way of listening there were shadows moving a little behind the children and rutledge realized that other womenat least two he thought possibly threewere in the dimly lit front room moral support for her confession but not intended to hear whatever it was that bill hador had notbeen taught by any frenchwomen hed encountered abroad it was a common enough anxiety of wives in wartime that men far from home fighting a war against loneliness and fear as well as the enemy might have found comfort of a sort in the local women and picked up disease or new tastes the music halls were filled with jokes and songs about the french it was her she repeated fiercely id swear to it was there anyone in the motorcar with her mrs dixon bit her lip i saw something rosywith lavender in it must have been that miss tarlton well it stands to reason who else would have been in that car with mrs wyatt but he thought she might be lying now had she seen margaret tarlton at the wyatt gate and known what she was wearing or was she so determined to indict aurore wyatt that she was piecing together bits of information garnered from the other women listening and invisible inside her house what kind of hat was miss tarlton wearing mrs dixon stared at him then she said too quickly the way that mrs wyatt drives her husbands motorcar youd be a fool to wear a hat itd be blown off your head before you was out of charlbury and it was true as hamish was busy pointing out that aurore herself hadnt been wearing a hat the first time rutledge had seen her but he couldnt recall if there had been one in the seat beside her they say that that miss tarltons missing what do they thinks become of her mrs dixon asked unable to stop herself curiosity was driving her now that man in singleton magna hes already killed his wife we want to locate miss tarlton because she arrived on the same train with mowbray she might have seen him or his family they say he killed his children she shuddered caught up in her own fears glancing over her shoulder uneasily ive kept mine close i can tell you since i heard of that i dont believe you have anything to fear from him now hes in custody she turned to go i saw that miss tarlton the day she came i was along to my sisters house if id stolen another womans husband like some i know id not want such a pretty face at my breakfast table tempting fate all over again thats what it is and mr simon already regretting his choice regretting what do you mean it was sharper than hed intended but hazel dixon wouldnt be drawn into that topic ive said enough i saw the car and mrs wyatt in it and that other woman if thats any good to you im glad rutledge thought as he let off the brake that elizabeth napiers presence in charlbury was bearing its bitter fruit in a village already rife with speculation about simons wife rumor had spread from house to house and hazel dixon encouraged and supported by her friends was now casting the second stone at aurore wyatt she wouldnt have spoken out if the village had maintained its wall of silence an undivided front elizabeth napier breaking the seal by openly showing her anxiety over margaret tarltons disappearance and allowing the bloody events of the mowbray murder to find their wayeven if topsyturvyinto the story had already shadowed simons mind with doubt and as if by osmosis the hazel dixons of charlbury had picked up the strong scent of distrust and were emboldened to strike out he was never sure how such things actually worked in a village but work they did aurore had been absolutely right seeing her in his company even for so brief a time had fed the hungry maws of gossip hamish from his accustomed place deep in rutledges mind asked are you sae certain then its gossip and no the truth constable truit still hadnt returned from the search party hed been summoned to join tired of waiting for him rutledge left charlbury and halfway back to singleton magna made up his mind it began to rain long before he reached london and the streets were shining with wet the trees drooping heavily when he found the house in chelsea that he was looking for it was small with a narrow porch silk drapes crossing the windows and on the steps pots of geraniums in a shade that complemented the brick even in the dull light it possessed a decided charm at the same time it wasnt a house that a young woman on her own could afford unless there was money in the family to draw on the maid who answered the door was small and dark with welsh ancestry in her round face but her voice was pure london rutledge told her who he was she led him into a small parlor attractively decorated with rosewood furnishings a french carpet and preraphaelite prints on the walls he recognized several of them either margaret tarlton liked the romantic aura they represented or she knew its value as a setting and yet oddly he hadnt imagined her as a romantic was thomas napier sometimes men of power and prestige had buried in them a streak of the quixotic when it came to their preferences in women the maid offered him a chair and stood before him in her stiff black dress hands cupped in front of her feet together like a child anticipating a reprimand worry drew her dark brows together and her face was strained tired he asked her name it was dorcas williams she had been employed as a second parlor maid by the napiers before coming here to work for miss tarlton i dont know what i can say sir scotland yard has come twice and still theres no word from my mistressive told them all i can think of theres no news she asked diffidently mr napier has been here this morning asking not yet the fact is im more interested in miss tarlton herself sometimes in searching for someone whos gone missing it helps to know more about the person we have a better feeling for where to look yes sir she regarded him expectantly as if prepared to cooperate in any way but behind her eagerness the shadow of fear still lurked lets begin rutledge said as if it had just occurred to him with her work for miss napier did she like what she diddid she get along well with her employers she liked her work well enough the girl answered willingly she was good at it at organizing seeing to flowers and caterers and invitations being printedfinding the right musicians writing thankyou notes sometimes shed say youll never guess dorcas whos coming to the luncheon on thursday she smiled oftentimes id get it right too there was nothing she disliked about her work the smiled faded ive heard her say she didnt want to spend a lifetime planning parties in the houses of other people did she get on well with elizabeth napier yes sir mostly i thinki think there was some disagreement over her changing jobs but i didnt understand the rights of that miss tarlton she didnt want it to be dorset and miss napier she said it was just the thing why was she against going to dorset do you know no sir her face creased with the effort to remember i dont think she ever spoke of that to me this house does it belong to miss tarlton or to her cousins oh its miss tarltons right enough sir it was two years ago she moved here and i was engaged along with the cook and an outside man two years ago rutledge repeated to himself about the time shaw was leaving england who pays your wages miss tarlton sir of course sir does she have a private income apart from her salary from the napiers as to that i dont know sir she said once her people never did well out of india unlike some her cousins in gloucestershire are comfortable enough i suppose but they dont run to servants just a daily woman who cleans and prepares the dinner he was no closer to seeing margaret tarlton as a woman in her own right yet he couldnt put his finger on what was missing it was hamish who did id no like to think he said that she lived in this house and dressed so fine but had no friends to impress wi it all did she have friends rutledge asked women men she didnt have so many women friends but there were admirers dorcas answered slowly mostly young men officers home on sick leave one or two i thought she fancied more than the others there was a young lord too took her to the theater a time or two but hes not looking for a wife shed say his mothers a widow and shell choose for him one that suits her still i thought she was fond of him or of his money and position hamish asked rutledge said what about the young canadian officer dorcas grinned he called at the napiers often i liked him fine she said always a word to make me laugh promising to find me an eskimo when he went home fancy that i understand miss tarlton wouldnt see him again before he went back to his regiment he tried to reach her and she refused to accept his calls surprised dorcas said how did you come to know that i thought for a timebut shed have no part of canada not much better than india shed tell me and not the kind of life i intend to live she hasnt heard from shawor seen himsince the war ended she said hed gone home but he hadnt i heard mr napier not a month past tell her he was living in dorset is that why youre off to wyatts museum he wanted to know because young shaws there they was having their tea i was passing the cups and she nearly spilled hers so i thought it likely shed not known whether captain shaw was alive or dead dont be ridiculous she told mr napier but the way she said iti couldnt tell somehow but i thought she might have been wondering if she might just see him nowor if she got the position at the museum what was napiers reaction he was fiddling with the serviette on his knee but he was frowning i could see that i couldnt help but feel he didnt want her to go to dorset anyway and this was just the final straw to his way of thinking was mr napier fond of miss tarlton he was very kind to her she said so often enough but kindness isnt the answer shed say i dont want kindness i want a house and a place in society and children of my own and to hold my head up looking people in the eye instead of being treated like a servant that was last may when she had a bad throat and was in bed for nearly a week it was the newspaper started it and ive never seen her in such an ill temper i said i cant think mr napier and his daughter have ever treated you in such a fashion and her answer was no but all their acquaintance do i thought it would be the best possible way to move into better circles working for elizabeth and it was the gravest mistake ive ever made so when miss tarlton had finished with it i looked through the newspaper to see what it was that upset her she hesitated there was a photograph of mr napier and a lady at a garden party and speculation that mr napier might be thinking of remarrying id heard her say she disliked the lady intensely madame condescension she calls her i dont believe shed care to work for miss napier if mrs clairmont became the second mrs napier afterward rutledge walked through the house still searching for the nature of the missing woman in the bedroom were a number of photographs of the napiers at parties or on horseback of according to dorcas the cousins in gloucestershire wearing country clothes and shy smiles of a small child in long skirts seated on a rocking horse or playing with a ball the cousins hovering protectively in the background in the closets hung an array of clothes all of excellent cut and beautiful fabrics but without designer labels rutledge had the feeling touching a silk sleeve here and a linen shoulder there that they had all been sewn by the same seamstress miss tarlton had had the taste to recognize the best but not the money to buy it it was even possible that she had made most of the clothes herself the tailoring and needlework showed considerable skill there was nothing in the house from india except for a small elephant trunk uplifted carved in sandalwood and a photograph of a man woman and two children seated in a tropical garden she hadnt taken pride in her roots she had shoved them out of sight margaret tarlton had created a new self for london society clever sophisticated elegantand reaching for heights she couldnt climb alone rutledge thanked dorcas and promised to send her word as soon as he could tell her what had become of her mistress as the door shut behind him he found himself wondering if ambitionor accidenthad brought margaret tarlton to her death rutledge stopped briefly at his sisters house before leaving london you look tired frances said scanning his face on the threshold working too hard thats what it is give up that wretched flat of yours and come back here where you can be looked after properly here was the london house frances had lived in since their mothers death it had been left to brother and sister jointly tall gracious handsomely furnished situated in a quiet square of similar houses it made a proper setting for frances whose dark unusual beauty was complemented by a clever brain and a formidable knowledge of people that she kept carefully hidden he smiled and have you fussing over me morning and night no i thank you he followed her into the comfortable blueandcream drawing room fiddle i never fuss and you know it well what brings you here in the rain my company or fathers whisky she crossed to an olivewood cabinet his whisky i came as well for information he took his accustomed chair feeling the tiredness shed already taken note of she made a face at him as she poured his neat but listened to what he was saying without interruption she had always been a good listener it was a trait their father had cultivated in her a woman who pays close attention flatters a man my dear and thats the first step in ruling him even as he spoke rutledge found himself thinking that frances had taken stillness and turned it into an asset whereas in aurore it was more than likely a shield against pain or a waiting but for what matilda clairmont is the widow of james heddiston clairmont she told him when hed finished steepling her slender fingers as she dredged her memory he was something to do with the exchequer well before the war thoroughly nice man shes the most terrible woman you can imagine sugary sweet to everyone just the most helpful and ingratiating way with her ive ever come across if shes likely to be hanged for murder i can name you fifty women in town who would rejoice and send the most expensive wreaths they can lay hands on to the funeral afterward he grinned whats wrong with being sweet and helpful frances shook her head darling you arent another woman or youd know females like matilda are deadly the kind who can drip venom with such graciousness youd never scotch the rumors shes set about mimicking her normally very attractive contralto became light and very innocent my dear ive been told the most dreadful thing about someone and i cant bear to believe it could be true if you swear not to repeat a word ill confide in youi havent been able to sleep a wink since i learned that she returned to her natural voice and by the time shes finished reputations are in ruins is there any likelihood that thomas napier might consider marrying mrs clairmont im told there was some hint of it in the newspapers in the spring her eyebrows rose in interested speculation now thats a rumor that matilda herself probably started i havent heard it from a reliable source and if you want my honest opinion id say hes very likely got a mistress tucked away he doesnt strike me as a man on the loose one can always tell you know could his mistress be his daughters secretary she considered that she might be but she isnt i only know margaret tarlton to speak to but shes not one to waste herself in a boudoir shes ambitious ian theres not a breath of scandal about her which is the surest proof who bought the house in chelsea she lives in thats an interesting question isnt it the money im told came from a trust fund her father had set up but somehow i doubt it he was a very junior civil servant in delhi and her mother was a saddler from norfolk no money there either whoever her sponsor is hes been very careful could it be napier he asked a second time she tilted her head to one side considering the lamplight caught her dark blue eyes and they sparkled like sapphires ian are you sure about this no its supposition based on bits of conjecture not solid fact thomas napier is a very fine man highly regarded in london and of course with a political following that makes a false step dangerous for youand for him why this sudden interest in the napiers and margaret i think shes dead murdered very likely but whether by the man we have in custody in dorset or by someone else im not sure but thats horrible in dorset you say i dont understand its still only a theory mind you but it has to be carefully investigated she came down to charlbury to apply for the position of assistant to simon wyatt and apparently no one has seen her since then thats all we have to go on now wyatts opening a museum of artifacts his grandfather brought home from the east yes ive heard about that hes husband to the fascinating auroreeveryone is dying to meet her the woman he chucked a promising political career for have you seen her is she as intriguing as everyone expects shesvery attractive an intelligent woman he broke off uneasily the last thing he wanted was frances on the wrong scent hardly the sensational sort if thats the only reason for attending the museums opening i expect most people will be sadly disappointed will they come just for that do you think but frances was busy pursuing another thought that chelsea house richard wyatt simons father was absolutely mortified when he discovered simon was marriedit was social suicide a complete disregard for the proprieties i remember the uproar at the time and how quickly it ended but the timing isnt right is it she tapped her fingers lightly on the arm of her chair musing still do you suppose napier went to wyatt saying margaret has found a house she wantsit will only be for a year or two elizabeth will marry simon and ill be free to speak then the house will be sold lend her the money to keep elizabeth from suspecting anything and ill see its repaid in good time thenwhen the news came about aurorewyatt called in his favor and napier spread the story that elizabeth had broken the engagement first of course that salvaged her pride but it also seemed to salvage simons reputation elizabeth is well thought of in london people felt hed treated her very shabbily she saw her brothers expression and stopped what is it you feel all of that is completely farfetched no but none of it makes any sense if it came out that either mans name was associated with the chelsea property it would ruin margaret tarlton too i dont see napier taking such a risk he was playing devils advocate well there are several ways around that buying a house for someone leaves traces i grant you on the other hand if that someone buys it for herself whos to say where the actual pounds came from enemies could subject napiers finances to the closest scutiny and find nothingtheyd never think of looking into wyatts bank balance would they and heres another small bit of the puzzle rumor said that simon wyatts inheritance wasnt as grand as hed expected bad investments during the war or so the story goes ive heard that simon had to sell the wyatts london house to pay for that museum of his well that wouldnt be surprising if napier wasnt able to keep to his own plans and marry margaretafter all elizabeth is still unwed so the house couldnt be sold it might also explain why margaret got fed up and decided to change jobs its an interesting possibility still even if youre right that napier borrowed the money from wyatt i cant see any direct connection from that to margaret tarltons murder how would it benefit anyone he stood up the whisky failing to penetrate the gloom he felt settling around him for that matter so far i havent found a sound reason for anyone to want to kill her except mistaken identity no but you will she smiled as she held out her hand for his empty glass if there is one as she walked with him to the door rutledge said if you had to dispose of a suitcase that might connect you with a murder where would you hide it a suitcase id put it in the one place everyone expects to find luggagea hotel or a railway station would you a hall porter or a stationmaster would come across it in the long run and try to locate the owner well thenthe one place no one ever goes it was a thought that followed him all the way back to dorset it was late when rutledge pulled into the yard of the swan in singleton magna and he was tired the rain had kept up most of the afternoon and into the evening a steady gray curtain that soaked everything he stepped out of the car into a puddle invisible in the shadowed yard and swore his hat tilted against the rain dripped unpleasantly down his coat as he turned toward the front of the inn and into the rising wind he could feel his shirt beginning to stick to his skin across his shoulders at the inn door he paused to shake his hat then squelched across the damp rug put down to stop the influx of water into the lobby proper there was a message waiting for him he opened it and read weve looked where we said we would and had no luck it was signed bowles in a dainty penmanship that belonged to the smiling woman behind the desk she nodded as he glanced up he said youd know what was meant yes thank you margaret tarlton wasnt visiting her cousins in gloucestershire elizabeth napier had been right as he reached the stairs wondering if it was too late to order a pot of tea and something to eat the front doors opened again and elizabeth napier herself swept in with a black umbrella cascading rain like a young waterfall the hem of her skirt was darkly wet as well and her black shoes left tracks on the floor crossing his benson took the umbrella from her as soon as she reached the relative dryness indoors and then disappeared the sound of the car moving off into the night came to rutledge she saw him on the stairs and said my god its worse than londonthe roads turn to muddy ruts and everywhere you put your foot theres a puddle i looked for you earlier hoping you might dine with me she regarded him for a moment and added inspector hildebrand told me he thought youd gone to the wyatt arms instead no i had business elsewhere coming up to him she said you look tired have you eaten at all taking his silence for no she turned to the woman at the desk is your cook still here id like a private parlor if you please and something hot to eat soup will do with tea without waiting for an answer she said to rutledge ill take my death of cold even in august if i dont change these wet clothes ill only need five minutes she swept past him in an aura of damp wool that matched his own but it was almost fifteen before she came down the stairs again and considered him approvingly he had changed his shirt and his shoes and wore a sweater in place of his coat with his hair still damp and unruly she thought he looked much younger than he seemed before there was soup and fresh bread set out in one of the smaller rooms with tea on a table by a fire someone had hastily laid it took a little of the chill and an air of mustiness from the room giving it a cozy almost intimate feeling rutledge curious wondered what her reasons were for creating this comfortable setting whatever they might be he preferred her company to his own thoughts in the silent room upstairs elizabeth served him and then herself although from the way she ate he thought it was out of politeness instead of hunger he felt suddenly ravenous the soup was mutton with barley carrots potatoes and what tasted like turnips the aroma alone was sustaining he wondered if elizabeth had commandeered the staffs first course she waited until hed finished half his soup before launching into her real purpose for waylaying him my father says if you need more men hell ask the yard to send them wouldnt bowles be delighted with that request he thought but said only thank you but no theyd only be underfoot if the searches that hildebrands conducting havent brought us any answers by this time additional menand strangers at thatarent going to he helped himself to a second bowl of soup and cut more bread there was butter in a covered dish as well as he discovered she said they arent going to find the children i know that you know that but hildebrand insists he has to find them i spoke with the rector here in singleton magna this afternoon mr drewes i felt i ought to do something about a headstone my father wanted to remove the body to london hes taking margarets death very hard i can tell you ten yearsyou grow fond of someone in ten years it isnt surprising i was very close to her myself he said nothing letting her carry on in her own fashion mr drewes was rather confused i must say hed been informed of course that the dead woman was mrs mowbray and i dont think he was too happy at the thought of changing the church records i told him to blame inspector hildebrand for being overhasty she tilted her head and smiled wryly he thinks im utterly charming so i must have put it less bluntly than that of course he never said as much to my face i overheard him talking to that woman at the desk after hed very gallantly walked me back to the swan holding his umbrella over me and getting himself thoroughly wet his wife will have had something to say about that he found himself wondering if mrs drewes would even hear the story elizabeth napier had a seductive way of sitting her back straight her shoulders slightly at an angle her hair brushed back from her face was gleaming in the firelight and he could smell the faint scent of heliotrope my father says if you find yourself in any difficulty with the local people you have only to tell him he made it clear to your superintendant this afternoon that he expects you to handle this business about margaret he felt a surge of irritation at her meddlingor was it napiers i dont believe that will be necessary he said but thank you he added knowing it was what she wanted him to say to satisfy her own sense of selfimportance or her fathers silent need to be involved in the matter what do you think of aurore wyatt she went on she was making conversation as an experienced hostess might at a dinner party interspersing the salient points as if they were commonplace remarks now she was down to what interested her most she rose to refill his tea cup indicating she was giving him an opportunity to respond out of politeness if nothing else i dont think about her he said my task is to locate the rest of the mowbray familyif they existor find out what part in this business margaret tarlton played which reminds me id like to know something about hernot as your secretary but as a woman might see her which is as adroit a way of changing the subject as any ive seen since my mothers uncle used to make excuses for his forgetfulness she said lightly turning aside his refusal i think aurore has turned your head as easily as she has simons and my fathers he likes her you know he says if the french army had been made up of soldiers half as brave as aurore wed have won the war three years ago rutledge said they lost their best men early on and the rest lost heart and we paid in british blood for their inadequate weapons and their inadequate generals not that we didnt have a few incompetent generals of our own frankly i wasnt prepared to like aurore but i do shes got a quality of stillness that i admireive never been able to stop my mind or my tongue from working as they pleased i can quite understand why simon fell in love with her and out of love with me war does strange things to people he said falling back on the old cliche and wondering if he could shift the conversation one last time to margaret it certainly changed simon she said a wistfulness in her voice i was frightened by what i saw in him today a fragility it wasnt there before he was a man who had never known personal defeat never had any doubts always had his eye well set on the mark it was what i truly loved in him you know his certainty not quite arrogance just an assurance that he knew his way and was confidently following it it was a guarantee of safety that assurance i felt safe in his care toying with her teaspoon she stopped then added i asked aurore if shed noticed itafter all she hadnt known simon before the war she might not have been aware of any change in him but she said hes terribly afraid elizabeth paused thoughtfully i cant accept that ive never known simon to be afraid of anything or any one but rutledge knew what aurore meant it wasnt a question of lacking courage surviving had frightened simon he hadnt expected to live he couldnt comprehend how hed deserved to live and there was a feeling deep down inside that god would remember him one day and rectify the error simon isnt afraid of anyone or anything thats not what his wife was trying to tell you hes alive and so many other good men are dead theres a sense of guilt in that it breeds fear of a different kind she stared at him were you in the war do you feel that way oh god he thought as hamish echoed the question in the depths of his soul guilt wasit was the agony of spirit that made every day bleak the fear that you might not live up to the cost of your survivalthat you might not somehow justify the whim of fate that let death miss you and take so many around you the driveand the brakeon all that you did and thought and felt when the armistice came and you were alive to see it the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month there was a biblical ring to that straight out of the old testament the sort of resounding phrase that thundered from the pulpit and terrified small boys even when they didnt know what in gods name was being said she saw his unwitting reaction and said quickly no dont answer that id no right to ask it of you then tell me instead about margaret tarlton she sighed margaret grew up in india it made heri dont know quite howseem much older than i was as if all the things shed seen and done and learned gave her a different sort of maturity from mine and heaven knows id grown up quickly myself in a household where political intrigue was mothers milk did she come from a family with status money no although from what i know of her father he had aspirations and he used to tell her as a child that england was her hope if the family could just return to england theyd be fine if they could find the money for passage theyd be fine i dont know what golden rainbows he saw for her or why but he made her hungry for a way of life she wasnt going to have unless she married well in the end both her parents died of malaria and she came without either of them there was a younger sister too who died near suez of a fever several men brought back to the ship after going ashore margaret arrived in england alone with no one to call family but distant cousins shed never met she finished her education at the same school i was sent to there was a family in gloucester who provided a scholarship theyd been missionaries or some such and often did such things in the hope that it might make the recipient think of taking up the same burden well they reckoned wrong with margaret she thought the heathen were quite happy with their own ways and would profit very little from being persuaded to try ours buddhism she told me made life a long series of chances to try to do better and see oneself more clearly she didnt care for hinduism as muchshe said it was as classconscious as the church of england in my opinion these beliefshinduism and buddhismput far too much emphasis on the fate of the individual rather than on the good of mankind as a whole it sustained a sort ofi dont knowselfishness i saw that from time to time in margaret too as if shed been infected by it it seems shed have made a perfect assistant for simon with her deep knowledge of the east but elizabeth napier evaded that question very neatly im no judge it wasnt a subject she usually cared to speak of most people had no idea shed lived anywhere but england she spoke of india to captain shaw elizabeths face went very still captain shaw heard it first from me she said he couldnt understand why margaret wasnt in love with him she wouldnt tell him and i felt he was owed an answer i asked him not to bring it up with her but i think he did anyway i dont know that margaret had a capacity for love if she did it was buried under such layers of wanting that shed nearly smothered it whatever drove my secretary it was so fierce she was blind to anything else i hope her death came quickly she would have hated dying before shed gotten what she was after it was the ultimate failure you see the next morning before hed had time to order his breakfast or think about the day rutledge came face to face with hildebrand you ought to come see mowbray he said hes got something on his conscience and damned if i can find out what it is ive sent for johnston in the event its a confession he might speak to you or his lawyer rutledge left with hildebrand crossing the street in time to see johnston just passing though the stations door inside it was damp and musty from the rain and this morning although the clouds were moving northeast the sun hadnt shown its face they moved down the passage to the cell where mowbray was kept and rutledge could feel hamish growing tense uneasy the heavy key turned in the lock the door swung back and the misery inside was almost palpable the smell of unwashed flesh and hopelessness was enough to make johnston stop in his tracks my god havent you allowed him even the decency of soap and water weve brought him soap and water hildebrand said curtly we cant dip him into it my constables are already complaining its not fit in here for beast or man thats why youre here to get to the bottom of this mowbray sat where rutledge had last seen him head in hands shoulders slumped the picture of dejection and despair his hair seemed to have grown longer wilder than the graystreaked tendayold beard and his clothes looked worn shabby and grimy johnston stepped forward and said mr mowbray its marcus johnston i represent you do you remember me but there was no response although johnston gently tried pleading cajoling and coaxing for a good ten minutes to break through the mans apathy finally he gave up and moved back out into the passage breathing as if hed felt short of air hildebrand turned to rutledge see what you can do man ill take any help i can get rutledge could feel his own heart pounding and hamish was a live presence in his mind but he forced himself with every shred of will he possessed to step into the cell the constable on duty was a large heavy man who seemed to fill the corner he stood in like some ancient pillar rooted there in the dimness his face was tense his eyes on mowbray like a lifeline hildebrand crowded in after rutledge and johnston seeming to feel his responsibility like a dead weight that couldnt be shoved aside pushed in after it was rutledges worse nightmare and he was on the brink of panic when he finally made his voice work mowbray good god man what would mary think of you filthy and unshaven he asked more harshly than hed intended its a matter of pride marys dead mowbray mumbled at last as if finally jarred into the present she cant see me now she cant hear you what makes you so certain the dead are deaf and blind they say i killed her is it true he looked up his own personal hell raging in the redrimmed eyes rutledge wondered how much the man could understand or if this apparent conversation with mowbray was merely something the sane men in the room believed in catching johnstons eye rutledge answered i dont know a womans body has been found youd been searching for your wife youd made public threats against her whether you remember them or not the woman seemed to match the photograph of your wife we found in your wallet what else should we believe i remember seeing her by the train i remember it but if she died in london how could that be how could she end up in this place i dont even know where i am it was as if hed forgotten that a man was supposed to have been with the woman he looked vaguely around him as though his eyes werent focusing on the cell walls that they saw things visible only to him like hamish what was she wearing when you saw her i saw her the wind blew her hair like i remembered and she had that smile when she looked at the children that smile how was she dressed rutledge persisted was she dressed in blue green she wore pink for me she always did when she wanted to make me happy i took a photograph of her once in pink i have it here he fumbled for his wallet and not finding it gave up and the children how were they dressed but mowbray couldnt face thinking about his children and rutledge nearly lost him again to the depths of apathy there was a woman along the road walking by herself he went on quickly johnston made an abrupt movement trying to stop rutledge hildebrand opened his mouth to speak and was ignored she had on a pink dress this woman pink with lavender and rose but it wasnt your wife it was someone else did you see her did you speak to her but mowbrays head was back in the cradle of his hands he was weeping silently god damn it hildebrand exploded youll muddle the waters worse than they are i didnt agree to this line of questioning johnston began at the same instant hildebrand send the man in the corner there to bring that dress to us i want to show it to mowbray no thats out of order i wont ive got to consider the ramifications if he should identify itwe dont know johnston was blustering i cant follow your reasoning i want the dress rutledge said send the man for it its on your head hildebrand retorted do you hear me but in the end he relented and the heavyset constable relief visible on his face diffidently strode past them and was gone they stood in angry volatile silence while he was away mowbrays weeping had stopped and he seemed to be asleep where he sat his breathing very irregular and harsh as if dreams haunted him then suddenly he started into full wakefulness crying out in anguish throwing out his hands as if to ward off what had come out of the depths of his mind as yell be doing one day hamish reminded rutledge chilling his blood mowbray turned and begged where are my children have you seen my children oh god i dont know where to look for them anymore the constable returned at that instant breaking the spell that had held the witnesses in stunned thrall he carried a carefully wrapped bundle in his hands and looked first to hildebrand before passing it on to rutledge rutledge opened it concentrating on the string and the knot on the folds that led inward until he held a garment within the white sheets of tissue paper dark against their paleness after a moment without arranging the dress or the paper he went to kneel on the cold hard floor in front of mowbray will you look at this he asked gently making no attempt to touch the man who was staring blindly into nothingness again it was some while before he coaxed mowbray into glancing down at the dress he held out like an offering to some vacant god mowbray frowned as if he couldnt make out what it was much less recognize it but rutledge was very patient he could feel his feet and knees beginning to ache from the awkward position but he kept himself steady and quiet offering no distraction after a time mowbray reached out a workhardened finger and touched the fabric of the dress as if testing to see if it was real lightly not with interest so much as his inability to decide what it was then he saw that it had a shoulder a sleevea collarand knew i thought the bombs killed her i wasnt there when it happened i was in france captain banner was telling me i had to go to london that something had happened i think they took me by car to the port it was raining and dark and i couldnt feel anythingnot even in the service in the chapel the dark bloodstains were visible now black and stiff a long soaked patch and the splatters like black dots on the cloth with no attempt to place them becomingly no sense of artistry only marks of the intensity of the attack they wouldnt open the casket and let me see her they said i shouldnt was this what she was wearing then is oh god it must be her blood he recoiled thrusting his hands deep into his pockets as if to keep them away from the horror i wanted to hold her again and they wouldnt let me they didnt tell me there was so much blood stop this johnston cried in nearly as much horror as mowbray its inhumanly cruel itsyouve got to stop he came forward pulling at rutledges shoulders forcing him backward hildebrand swearing was trying to tell the constable to get back into that room damn it their voices echoed in the cramped space loud and frightened rutledge threw off johnstons grip kept his balance by a miracle of muscle and tendon and protected the dress from the floor mowbray looking in amazement from one to the other as if startled into brief sanity said quite clearly thats not the pink she liked who gave that to her was it him was it the man with her he fingered it again puzzled its the wrong color i tell you i knew when i saw her it was the wrong color for an instant rutledge thought mowbray was going to lunge at his throat and choke him but it was the dress the hands were reaching for groping clutching then holding it up peering at it in the dimness trying to see and turning toward the door toward hildebrand whod arrested him its not hers its a trick shes smaller than this i know my own wifes clothes why did the hun want to kill her she was never any harm to anybody never an unkind word ill make him pay see if i dont ill kill every one of the bastards i can put hand to ill grind him into the mudpound until theres no face left and keep on pounding until you cant tell brains from earth i swear it to god i do hildebrand managed to get the dress out of his grip without ripping it and johnston tried to push him back to the cot while rutledge stood there and watched the spate of words hed released they hadnt cleared mowbray of murder he may not have killed his wife the dead woman might well be margaret tarlton but hed just described in passionate intense detail the way the dead woman had died it took time to settle him down again but when the adrenaline finally subsided and he had some small grip again on his surroundings he sank back into the same posture theyd found him in rocking himself with the pain and the uncertainty as if he had no recollection of the dress the men around him or tensions so taut that hamish was warning rutledge to go go but he stayed walked back down the passage with hildebrand and johnston berating him in vicious terms spilling out their own shock and horror in a tirade that left them both breathless and stumbling over each others words without noticing it rutledge stopped at the door to the front room and turned it may have been unorthodox he said coldly it was most certainly necessary theres a possibility he saw margaret tarlton aliveand killed her thinking she was his wife you sacrifice the man for the woman or even more likely came across her dead body which may explain why he was so quick to believe the charges against him because margaret tarltons not in london not in gloucestershire and not in sherborne you tell me where she isand why we cant find her theres a death certificate for mrs mowbray but its miss tarlton whos missing cant you understand what im telling you youre not going to turn my case into a circus ill have you recalled first how can i build any reasonable defense after what we just heard thats beside the point rutledge said im not interested in solving your problems im interested in whats at the bottom of this murder im interested in saving that poor devil if hes innocent and convicting him if hes guilty i want to find answers to the riddle of whos lying in that grave in your churchyardand why shes there i believe im on the right track if you wont help me prove im right then for gods sake show me where im wrong johnston said you forced my client to all but convict himself out of his own mouth before witnesses i dont see how thats supposed to save him did you listen at all to what he was saying that the dress in hildebrands hands isnt mrs mowbrays color or size but elizabeth napier swears its margaret tarltons color and size if we were wrong about his victim cant you see that we may also be wrong about his part in her death are you claiming that its my investigation thats at fault by god rutledge could feel frustration battling his need for air and space he said no were all in this muddle together hildebrand only if were wrong at the end of it it will be mowbray who pays for any blunders weve made not you or i and what do we do about those wretched children then answer me thatpretend they never existed and hope to hell were right the door behind rutledge opened suddenly bringing in a sweep of air because the outer door was also standing wide a breathless sergeant redfaced and muddy said over rutledges shoulder inspector hildebrand sir weve found a body sir i thinkyoud best come and see it rutledge drove hildebrand sat in the seat beside him while sergeant wilkins occupied the space that hamish considered his own that made rutledge edgy if he turned around would hamish be there in the shadows beside the sergeant or had the sergeant unwittingly exorcized his fellow passenger hildebrand sensed his uneasiness and attacked rather throws your theory into a cocked hat doesnt it i wont know until we get there hildebrand laughed yes thats it slip off the hook youve done bloody little else since you got here then remembering the presence of his sergeant he added to the man tell me again slowly this time the sergeant repeated the story he had spilled out in hildebrands office the words tumbling over each other in frantic haste his voice was calmer now as he ordered his thoughts and remembered details wed broadened the search like youd said and it was that young chap fenton who saw the earth seemed different in the one place sunken like as if something had been buried and the soil had settled in around it well he began to dig a bit thinking it might be somebodys old dog or the like and instead he comes up with a muddy edge of cloth appeared to be part of a blanket at first then we could see the corner with a bit of lining a coat we thought you could see the color a dark blue then the white of bone we stopped there and i came for you straightaway not wanting to disturb anything before youd seen it like it was yes well done youre sure its a coat not a blanket youd wrap a dog in an old blanket its not made the same as a blanket and theres no fur sir youd find fur too if it was an animal that lasts yes yes hildebrand answered testily no sense of sizechild fully grown adult he was not a man who enjoyed suspense he wanted his answers now questions later sometimes in policework there were no answers at all hed been afraid this mowbray investigation was heading in such a direction but if theyd found either the children or that damned tarlton woman all to the good he felt his spirits suddenly rising if it was the tarlton woman itd get rutledge off his back by god and leave the mowbray business out of it altogether no sir as i said we didnt want to disturb the ground more than needful a silence fell and rutledge found himself thinking this is too far for mowbray to have come hed have had to pass through two villagessomeone would have seen himand bone meant the body had been in the ground for some time in the trenches you learned how long it took a man to rot he was still tired from the session with mowbray feeling the intensity of emotion the rawness of the mans fearshis own reaction to them i hope to god the body has nothing to do with mowbray he told himself or with charlbury hamish added softly startling him by the time theyd reached the makeshift grave a small crowd had collected standing just out of sight of the remains they were mostly from leigh minster according to the sergeant the news hadnt traveled to stoke newton or charlbury yet rutledge pulled off the road braked the car and hildebrand was out almost before it had stopped moving wanting to be the first on the scene the sergeant followed rutledge let them go it was their jurisdiction after all the scrub ground had been pastureland at one time allowed to go wild and overgrown now with weeds that reached to his knees a few of them shrubby and tenacious dragging at the fabric of his trousers like bony fingers from where he was walking he could see a distant rooftop a barn he thought very likely the last outpost of leigh minster that was to his right and on the left was a field already cut ahead a slight rise he turned to look behind and saw that there was a burnedout chimney marking the ivygrown foundations of a house across the road a blackened stump with rooks perched on the broken edges calling raucously if youd looked for a place to bury a body this was ideal for the purpose invisible unless someone came along the road which brought to mind the next question who had known such a place was here certainly not mowbray a stranger in dorset rutledge walked through the knot of voyeurs who whispered behind their hands trying to decide what was behind the sudden influx of policemen and what was attracting their attention just out of sight behind the weeds the general opinion appeared to be the discovery of the missing children he heard mowbrays name several times as he passed ahead around the depression in the earth stood six or seven men he recognized the constable from leigh minster and nodded to him hildebrand and the sergeant were on their knees studying the cloth that emerged like a small sail from the rough hole that had been dug by the sergeant and his men blue and wool if he rutledge was any judge but cheap wool thin rather than thick it wasnt until he reached the others that he saw what appeared to be a knob dirty white with bits of flesh still attached like a halfchewed bone and the clinging mud from recent rain it was human not animal that was the first question hildebrand asked looking up human then yes i think it is hildebrand nodded all right lads lets see a bit more shall we he straightened and moved aside while the sergeant handed the shovel to a thickset constable with sleeves already rolled above his elbows he set to carefully as if hed done this sort of thing before scraping wielding the shovel as a broom more often than the work it was designed to do the man made slow progress hildebrand tightfaced impatience in every line watched but he didnt hurry the constable and after several glances at hildebrand the sergeant made no comment either the clang of the shovel the grunting of the constable and the distant rooks broke the stillness and then the rest of the bone came into view a shred of stocking clung to the flesh and at the end an ankle in a black heeled shoe a woman the grave was not deep at a guess no more than a foot of soil covered her body she appeared to have been wrapped in the coat rather than wearing it it had been far too hot for a wool coat the day the woman in the farmers cornfield had died this wasnt margaret tarlton or mrs mowbray and it wasnt the missing children hildebrand sighed another damned question it took an hour or more to uncover the remains to the point where the men watching and waiting could look at her and form any opinion of age class or time in the ground the constable from leigh minster squatted to peer into the makeshift grave studying the body after a time he said dont recognize her weve no one missing id know if there was who is she then can anyone say he got to his feet looked around at the men on either side it was difficult to judge what she had once looked like the face was badly decomposed with signs that it had been damaged before death the dark hair was tangled and mixed with clots of damp earth hildebrand turned to the constable from stoke newton anything no sir there was a woman went missing some while back a maid but i wouldnt he looked more closely and then shook his head i dont think this ones been in the ground long enough its hard to say but id guess from the coat and shoes shes not a servant girl on her day off dressed more like a woman gone to market stillearly days yet listening rutledge thought i was right an able man that one aloud he said the face it hasnt been beaten the way the mowbray woman was hildebrand said hard to say he squatted on his heels as the constable had done theres injury here nose damaged and that right cheekbone but the teeth arent broken nor the forehead we cant be sure a beatings what killed her could be theres a stab wound in the body or a bullet doctor will tell us that he got to his feet all right lads send that crowd away and lets get her back to singleton magna he paused and looked at rutledge anything you want to add rutledge shook his head then its my business dorset business not part of what brought you here it was a warning stand clear time enough to challenge that rutledge told himself when and if there was a need to do it not now not in front of hildebrands subordinates so far ive seen nothing to show me that this involves the yard he answered neutrally because he hadnt still the words were carefully chosen not signifying capitulation while reserving the right at any point to change his mind hildebrand chose to regard them as a promise not as a provisional agreement more to the point a promise before witnesses he was pleased to be magnanimous and added your suggestion that we search a wider area brought her to light im grateful look youd better drive back to singleton magna ill stay here until weve got her sorted out and then ill send these men on about their search could be an hour or so before we bring her in rutledge politely dismissed left but hamish was already considering the connection between this body and the last one as rutledge put up the crank and got into the drivers seat hamish said its no to do with charlbury no the same manner of death and this woman was put in the ground not left in a field for anyone to find yes thats what interests me whoever killed her must have known that she wouldnt be missed it was safe to hide her body no searchand there wasnt one was thereand no notice taken of her absence from wherever she came from but in the case of the body outside singleton magna im beginning to think she wasnt hidden because there was a scapegoat availablemowbrayand because margaret tarlton would be missed by a number of people one of them with the power to raise heaven and earth looking for her he drove sedately through stoke newton where small knots of villagers stood on the street gossiping as if the news had finally reached them and speculation was rife once on the high road again he added but i cant believe that was the reason our bodys face was battered i think there was passion behind it not an attempt to hide her identity it served that purpose of coursebut it wasnt the intention aye which means youre one body short and yon hildebrand is one body long better him than you rutledge shook his head id have been happier if that corpse had solved the puzzle of ours if it meant those children were safe and that the killer whoever he or she was had nothing to do with that poor bedeviled soul in the cell he couldnt seem to get mowbray out of his mind you did na need yon second dead lassie to prove that you know and i know where the answers are and i do na think shell change whats happened in charlbury youve got a murderer to find there and the sooner the better unless like hildebrand yere satisfied to put it on mowbrays head he couldnt even hamish knew that it was impossible by the time rutledge arrived at charlburybreakfastless and in a moody frame of mindthe news had flown before him in the form of a man in the pub of the wyatt arms who had enjoyed regaling anyone who would listen with all the gruesome details from the sound of them rutledge knew the man had not seen the body another killing he was telling a fresh recruit to his gathering audience just like the one in singleton magna that man theyve got in jail theremight not be the first time hes gone looking for his missing wife left a trail of bodies over half of england if you want to know what i think sees a woman out on her own walking along a road like or waiting for someone to come fetch her and the first thing pops in his head is theres my wife by god and before bobs your uncle hes killed her rutledge taking a late breakfast in the corner by the window tried to shut out the voice looking out into the back garden he realized there was a woman sitting there at one of the empty tables under the trees where the womens institute had met she was turned away from the windows a glass of something in front of her the soft green of her dress made her oddly invisible in the leafy shadows it was aurore wyatt he took his tea cup and went out to the garden she looked up as he said may i join you he indicated the vacant chair at an angle to hers the wind was softly stirring the leaves giving a sense of tranquility to the garden compared to the uproar of voices in the bar her eyes looked tired as if sleep were something she knew very little about is it business ive heard them talking in there theres been another body found im told no not business i missed my breakfast now ive been served bones with my toast i came out here to escape then please id be happy to have company more cheerful than my own thoughts she waited until he sat down how did you miss your breakfast tell me lies please something humorous and a little silly rutledge grinned all at once feeling better there was a giraffe loose in the kitchen of the swan in singleton magna the police are still investigating what are you drinking ill fetch another she smiled the light coming back into her eyes lemonade its very good yes id enjoy another glass he brought it to her along with a fresh pot of tea for himself and sat down again aurore thanked him and said tell me more about the giraffe she pronounced it jirraffe im afraid i couldnt stay long enough to find out its history sorry she turned to study his face watching the light and shadow of the leaves playing across it then tell me about yourself but nothing that is sad which put jean and hamish and the war and his last two cases off limits he gave the question some thought my father followed the law and my mother was a very gifted pianist i grew up in a house full of music and law books the fanciful and the practical and your parents did they expect you to follow in their footsteps law or music or were they pleased you chose to become a policeman i think my father would have been happy to see me in the law but it wasnt my calling in the end i think he realized it you are quite practical i have seen that and fanciful she tilted her head and he felt the intensity of her scrutiny this time you are very sensitive to what people are thinking it is a gift and a curse to be able to put yourself in the minds of others is that how you come to find your murderers the light mood had vanished sometimes he said and hamish stirred knowing what lay behind his answer she said elizabeth came again this morning she told us she needed work to keep her from worrying too much about margaret and so she is helping simon in the museum today i couldnt stand it any longer this was the only place i could think of where it might be quiet and then there was the affair of the bones to spoil my escape they dont have anything to do with you he said gently or with margaret tarlton i am very glad to hear it she told him but she didnt sound glad the sun was warmer now and brighter he could feel it on his back it probably would turn out to be a fine day after all she wont stay once this is finished once we know what has happened to margaret there wont be an excuse to keep her here but will it be finished aurore asked i dont think so i used to believeas a child you understandthat it was very sad when someone died suddenly that is without knowledge that it was going to happen until it was there facing one i used to think that for such people it was a severe shock they were not prepared to die and so they became ghosts intent on coming back to the world to finish whatever it was they had left undone im beginning to believe that margaret is such a onethe stuff of ghosts rutledge said quietly shes dead mrs wyatt all thats left is to find out who killed her and if possible why aurore sighed yes i know but i prefer not to think about any of it only with elizabeth napier invading my house and my life i am not allowed to forget she drained the last of her lemonade and set the glass aside i must go to the farm cows do not care about ghosts or dead bodies they are practical creatures they know when it is time to be milked and time to be let out to pasture and time to be brought in at the end of the day the man who took care of them while simon was away at war is too old now to carry the burden of so much work i persuade him when i can to sit in the sun and advise me she hadnt said anything before about someone else at the farm who might have seen her there nursing a heifer with colic rutledge asked id like to speak to him he might have seen you on the day margaret left aurore smiled i dont think so he was suffering from a rheum a coldand avoided me when he could i think it was actually too much ale and a sour stomach in france we say it is the liver rebelling at his age any rebellion is a revolution he didnt know you were at the farm surely if one of the livestock was ill from the barn he doesnt see where i leave my car sometimes i go and come without meeting him at all if he is out in one of the fields but he might have heard the motorcar well perhaps it is kind of you to look for someone who can tell you positively where i wasand was not it isnt kindness its necessity he said more harshly than hed meant i have witnesses who saw your motorcar in charlbury that morning and who would swear to that and to the presence of margaret tarlton in it with you she shrugged i cannot invent witnesses for myself despite the shrug she wasnt indifferent to her predicament there was an intensity beneath her stillness that he could feel a very real fear the tranquility here under the trees had vanished like smoke on the wind after a few minutes she excused herself and was gone he sat where he was remembering what frances had said about the wyatt finances and wondering if there was enough money in their coffers to pay for a firstclass barrister to defend aurore or would simon abandon her to preserve his precious museum was that what kept elizabeth napier in charlbury meddling rutledge went to find constable trait and finally ran him to earth just outside of charlbury where he was supervising a group of men poking through the heavy undergrowth along a small stream trait i wish to speak to you rutledge called tramping through a field for the second time that morning the man looked up then walked toward rutledge something happened sir he added it as an afterthought rutledges face warning him that this was not the time for overt insubordination rutledge drew him farther from the curious glances turned their way then he said you may have heard there was a body found near leigh minster this morning one of the seach teams came across it aye i heard nothing to do with us he jerked his head toward the men desultorily digging behind him half an ear attuned to trait and rutledge i understand there was a woman who worked for mrs darley who has been missing for some time and that she was known in charlbury as well betty cooper yes sir although she didnt work here she was known here but from what i hear cant be her shed have been in the ground longer youre sure oh yes of course its the doctor has to decide but from what id been told it isnt likely and she was found over leigh minster waynot very likely to be ours is she long way to carry a body and where she was found isnt a spot strangers would be likely to know was there stands to reason there was an echo of hildebrands voice in the last words always keep an open mind constable aye that i do sir rutledge nodded and walked off unsatisfied but hildebrand was right the second body was none of his business and he was just as glad to leave it he went instead to the wyatt house walking into the museum unannounced elizabeth napier turned from the shells she was arranging a smock over her deepblue dress and a small feather duster on the floor beside her hello inspector she said in surprise what brings you here id like to speak to mr wyatt is he in the museum or at home through that door and to your right she answered speculation in her eyes has therehas there been any word of margaret you arent asking simon to break something gently nothing im afraid he kept walking making his way through the clutter of empty boxes that someone had begun to flatten and set in a pile preparatory to putting them away he went through the far door found a short passage and a small cluttered room serving as an office at the end on the right simon was busy with a ledger and what appeared to be a pile of bills every surface in the room seemed to be occupied by some halffinished task waiting to be remembered he sighed as rutledge came in as if the interruption had spoiled his train of thought seeing who it was he leaned back in his chair and began to rub the back of his neck as if it ached what is it any news no i wanted to speak to you privately rutledge closed the door behind him and pulled out a chair that had been shoved into one corner after removing the stack of books it held to the floor he sat down look cant this wait simon asked ive got to finish this lot and its going to take most of the day im not good at this sort of thing and aurore knows it i cant think why she isnt here lending a hand thank god elizabeth can make some sense of those displays i need every bit of help i can find no it cant wait rutledge said uncompromisingly take your mind out of that ledger and listen to me simon reluctantly pushed it to one side though whether hed shut the figures out of his mind was another matter very well whats the problem ive got a corpse on my hands i think it must be the woman you were expecting to hire as an assistant and i have witnesses who tell me that your wife drove margaret tarlton back to the railway station if theyre speaking the truth it means that aurore wyatt was probably the last person to see her alive he frowned i dont see what the problem is aurore isnt a murderess simon wyatt had also said his wife wasnt a liar rutledge found himself wondering if simon was shallowor under the stress of his work wasnt able to absorb anything that wasnt connected directly to his museum what do you know about your wifeher background her family good god what do they have to do with it her parents rutledge said patiently ignoring hamishs irritated remarks about the constable and now this man theyre both deadmother died some years before the war he said in some exasperation father killed when the germans came throughshot trying to stop the looting of his house and farm aurore herself barely escapedshe reached a nunnery just over the belgian border and was taken in she was ill for weeks exhaustion and a fever then she tried to make her way south hoping to stay with a cousin in provence i found her ill again and terrified in a group of refugees that had come into our sector during the night and got shot at for their pains mercifully nobody was killed but it was a near thing scared the very devil out of my men i can tell you word had already been passed that there was movement along the german lines and then out of the dark i wouldnt put it past the hun to think this was a great joke rutledge understood you shot at anything that came at you out of the dark without password or provenance what did you do with them sent them to the rear told somebody to take a look at them that was that it wasnt until later that i saw aurore again and hardly recognized her shed been so thin half starved and half out of her mind when she reached us she had some medical skills and the doctors must have put her to work it was a very superficial account without emotion without any sign that the woman he was speaking about was his wife tell me about your political career rutledge asked trying to find the measure of the man im told it was very promising and simon changed there was suddenly a haggardness in his face a tenseness in the shoulders hunched over the desk why abrupt rough as if rutledge had turned over a stone and found something unspeakable beneath clearly it wasnt a topic he cared to pursue it isnt pertinent to murder is it margaret tarlton was your houseguest for two days you spoke to her worked with her that makes you a suspect as far as im concerned for a time rutledge was sure the man wasnt going to answer at all finally simon said did you know my father and i sat down and planned my war churchill has gotten a good deal of mileage out of his prisoner of the boers grand escape across a river people whove been out to south africa tell me his river was hardly more than a swale but thats neither here nor there good opportunity for a politically minded young mangoing to war i was supposed to write letters home that my father could circulate among his friends and colleagues take photographs keep a journal something i could publish privately as soon as the war was finished wed even given it a name that book journey into oblivion and do you know it turned out to be very apt that title i went into oblivion and i didnt come back the pain in the eyes of the man across the desk from rutledge told him much it was the same unbearable pain hed read in mowbrays something so deep so infinitely dark that it would destroy rutledge had seen that look in his own face bearded and strained thin and half mad in a mirror in hospital a stranger hed thought bewildered has come back in my place simon stared at rutledge not seeing him not seeing the reflection of emotion that was there naked and unguarded if hed had the wit to look he was too busy trying to hold himself together trying to force the devils back inside the small crowded box where theyd been locked slamming his fist on the desk simon said damn you damn you his eyes closed and there was a white grimness about his mouth as if he felt sick and was fighting hard against the tide of nausea that threatened to overwhelm an iron control the silence in the room was so deep that rutledge could hear a clock striking somewhere in the house a slow deep tolling of the hour and then without warning the door opened and elizabeth napier said dear god she went protectively to simon her hands on his shoulders the fingers kneading with her anger leave him alone do you hear me she cried lashing out at rutledge i wont have it as ifhe thought his own iron will struggling desperately to reassert control hamish pounding in his mind like hammer on anvilas if small as she was she could stand in the way of the majesty of the law we were discussing the war he began in his own defense the wars over she told him its finished it killed it maimed and it destroyedand yet none of you will let it go you carry it around with you like sackcloth and ashes you live with it in your very bones by day and your dreams by night and treat it like some holy grail you brought back with you well it isnt its a legacy of despair and hate and grievous hurt and i wont let it touch me anymore do you hear me i wont let it rutledge looked at simon his eyes were still closed his breathing ragged and harsh but simon said its all right elizabeth he didnt knowhe didnt mean to stir it up im sorry but you did elizabeths eyes accused rutledge and it was just as terrible for you as it was for simon wasnt it go away she said aloud go away before you both find yourselves on the other side of your nightmares and rutledge got to his feet knowing he had to leave that simon was past questioning and his own frail peace was shattered as well simon im back it was aurore who had come in blocking his escape she looked at her husband at elizabeth fiercely protecting him her hands dug into the white fabric of his shirt his eyes closed their bodies touching her side against his arm his head resting on her wrist an intimacy between them that spoke of comfort offered and comfort accepted on a level beyond friendship she turned to rutledge his face grim and his eyes haunted staring at her as if he too saw her as an outsider without a word she whirled and went out again with such a deep grief in her movements that rutledge could feel her pain and his own inability to assuage it she was gone and he still stood where he was rooted until elizabeths voice reached him go to her she said urgently make her understand ill see to simon no its better if you go rutledge said she wont trust me but he found himself walking the three paces between himself and the door and heard elizabeth saying she needs comfort and she wont take it from a woman shes too strong to let me see her cry and he thought that was true he found aurore up by the churchyard deep into the dark shadowed clearing under the trees her hand lifted to one drooping branch her head against her upper arm not wanting to startle her he said quietly is there anything i can do she said huskily go away no he moved closer still some six yards from her but near enough that his voice wouldnt carry to anyone else i brought back the war thats all it was simon had built a very high wall but not high enough it waselizabeth came to see what was wrong she must have heard usand she thought id badgered him blame me for what happened aurore turned to face him there were streaks of tears on her face he felt a surge of selfdisgust as if he himself had been the one to make her cry you brought back the war yes i think that was true but it was elizabeth who used it for her own ends he wont turn to me for comfort anymore did you know he shuts me out as if he doesnt want me to see what he believes is weakness in him he thinksif this museum is a success ill admire him look at him with love and pride for what hes accomplished he thinkshe thinks that it will wipe out the past i saw him break you see a man can forgive a woman anything but that if id slept with half the british army he could forgive me if i had betrayed his soldiers and got them killed hed find a way to forgive me but not this he understood her better than she realized he found himself wondering if perhaps jean had been clever enough to know that he might come to hate her in the end if shed married him after seeing him in hospital broken and in despair then he knew it wasnt an excuse he could make for herjean had been half embarrassed half horrified by what she couldnt understand shed been so tightly wrapped in her own dread she hadnt seen the urgent need to reach out and comfort him he said there were men who came home damaged physically most of them emotionally a good many of them aurore replied with a heaviness that spoke of long sleepless nights waiting for a man to show he cared i dont think most of the english soldiers who went to france were prepared for what this war was going to do to them battles yes they expected battles great glorious charges like waterloo where theres no time to think or feel just the intensity of trying to survive instead they sat in filthy trenches how do they explain this at home simons father wrote over and over where are the letters you promised why are they not coming through is it a problem with the censors and the photographs where are they is the camera working do you have film for gods sake why are you letting this opportunity slip through your fingers where is the next churchill and simon couldnt tell him what was wrong that he was faced with mortality and what hed been born and bred to do no longer seemed to matter i think he realized for the first time that he hadnt chosen his political future it had been thrust at him but in its place what did he want what else was he fit for how do you decide such things on a battlefield he was the walking dead waiting for death to remember he was still there and come for him there was no future and yet he desperately wanted one for an instant she put her hands to her eyes as if pressing them might stop the aching in her head or the aching in her heart she took a deep shuddering breath to steady herself do you even know what im saying i gave him hope i gave him something to hold in his heart until death came my body and my love brought him a little peace before the end onlyhe lived and he wasnt prepared for that or for a marriage that might last after all or for his father dead and thomas napier furious with him for jilting elizabeth who was desperately trying to be brave and noble about it he came home to changeand an accounting and i was the living symbol of how far hed fallen from grace in the eyes of those whose good opinion was important to him she turned to look up at the church tower truncated and heavy like a wasted promise when she went on there was no selfpity in her words it was very difficult for both of us but divorce is hard to come by you know it leaves a stigma and i am catholic there is nothing for me afterward i believed id be happier trying to make my marriage work than standing at the quayside and waving goodbye admitting that id failed simon and myself as well i was braced to fight but i cant fight them all i dont know how it would be much better for me to be hanged guilty or not sparing simon the embarrassment of publicly acknowledging that his marriage was a mistake she stopped her body suddenly rigid no i didnt mean that he would never harm me he still cares but she had just given rutledge a motive for her husband to kill he said carefully after a time i told you before that i didnt believe elizabeth would stay after this is finished theres nothing to keep her here except blatant selfinterest and somehow i dont see her confessing to that if i am convicted of murder she will have simon without the messy aftermath of divorce and if i am not she will have shown him that she still cares it is something from the past you see something he had thought hed given up i dont know he could see the tears glistening in her lashes hed be a fool to choose elizabeth napier over you she gave him a watery smile and said for the second time that day you are very kind but you know and i know that this murder has brought to the fore more than just one womans death it is something i must face i dont know how i shall do that i dont know where it will end but i shall find the strength i need he stood there helpless unable to touch her unable to offer any comfort that didnt sound like kindness mrs wyattaurore she shook her head no you must not say anything tell me again about the giraffe in the kitchen of the swan forget youre a policeman and i am a suspect and tell me instead how the giraffe came to wander so very far from home she gasped as she realized that what shed said was a reflection of her own dilemma hamish was vigorously protesting that aurore was trying to distract him rutledge ignored him he said it wasnt so very far from home or lost only misplaced for a little while i shouldnt worry for its sake animals have no complexity in their lives do they she agreed how very fortunate they are she walked away leaving him there in the trees her back straight her head held high not toward the house but to the church she was telling him that she wanted privacy and a little time alone but he thought perhaps she hadnt stopped crying when rutledge came back for his car which was parked by the inn he saw mrs prescott constable traits neighbor with a market basket over her arm and a sense of mission in her stride she saw him and crossed the street hastily to waylay him whats to do with mrs wyatt she seemed that upset when she came hurrying out of her gate walked right past me without so much as a howdoyoudo mrs prescott and you on her heels like the wrath of god shes well enough rutledge answered there was something about a giraffe i think worrying her mystified for a moment mrs prescott then gave him a lopsided smile which is another way of saying i ought to mind my own business well you wouldnt be the first to tell me that but gossips like making a quilt sorting where the patches belong and where they dont weighing size and color and shape that takes skill of a kind i like to gossip anybody in charlbury will tell you that whats charlbury saying about this body found outside leigh minster i could tell you how many teeth she had in her head and whether her stockings was cotton or silk can you put a name to the teeth not yet shes too long in the ground they say to be miss tarlton and too fresh to be that betty cooper another stranger dyou think were getting fair swamped with strange corpses im told its none of your business anyhow except that it keeps inspector hildebrand busy on two fronts and out of your way she paused then said tentatively if you dont mind my asking do you think a man or a womans behind miss tarltons killing i dont know i dont think anyone does at this point what killed her then we dont have a murder weapon if thats whats worrying you ill give you a free word of advice mrs prescott said a man now hed pick up any tool and feel comfortable with that a woman will be more likely to reach for something familiar something shes used to if i was angry enough to kill id pick up that iron doorstop of mine the one shaped like an owl she could see the change in his face the thought awakening in his mind curiosity was lively in her eyes she started to speak then thought better of it he thanked her and was already hurrying toward his motorcar it was stupid of him he told himself a rank beginner would have thought about it a long time ago but then a rank beginner might not have been dazzled by aurore wyatts unusual attraction he hadnt gone out to the wyatt farm where aurore claimed shed spent the morning margaret tarlton was scheduled to leave where the car had been driven that same morning instead of being available at the house to take a guest to the station the farm he could hear francess voice where would i hide a suitcase where no one ever goes in the back of his mind hamish was saying ive tried to tell you the road that ran west through the village climbed a low knoll on its outskirts twisted down again and within a hundred feet passed a pair of stone gates that stood at the head of a narrow lane an ornate w was engraved on a worn tablet on one of the posts the farm itself was nearly invisible behind a stand of trees he turned in through the gates swearing as his wheels bumped heavily along ancient ruts made by carts and drays the lane was arrow straight leading through a double row of trees shaded and quiet except for a blackbird singing somewhere in the thick branches it ended in a muddy yard where a small stone house was backed by a great barn a long open shed for farm equipment and a number of smaller shabby outbuildings the property was not run down as hed expected but the signs of neglect were there to be seen in the old thatch on the house that should have been renewed five years ago the shingles missing from the barns high roof and the pointing badly needed in some of the courses of stone the weathered wood of the sheds the rank grass that grew up in corners and under rusting bits of gear scattered about the barns yard behind the house chickens could be heard clucking and squabbling and a horse neighed from the dim cool recesses of the barn the hay rick not fresh and new was half gone the new hay left in the sun to dry the house seemed emptysometimes rutledge thought you could tell by the feel of it he walked to the door and peered in the nearest window the room he could see was clean and tidy but the furniture was castoffs from the past the carpet threadbare and there were no curtains at any of the windows he could just see a staircase that rose to the next floor from the entrance hall when he tried the door the knob turned under his hand but he didnt go inside he moved on to the barn stepping inside the great open door dust motes floated in heavy air smelling of manure and hay and moldering leather an old side saddle was propped over a wooden bench in the far dimness a pair of horses turned their heads to stare with interest at him a cat stretched out along the top of a shelf yawned and stared at him as well through narrow yellow eyes doves cooed desultorily from the rafters of the loft and where was the caretaker out in the fields or in one of the scattered outbuildings he went back to his motorcar and blew the horn once then twice in the silence that followed he thought he heard the lowing of cows softened by distance he blew the horn again after a time a man in ragged coveralls peered out of one of the smaller sheds he was tall wiry his white hair cut short his face weatherlined it was hard to judge his age fifty older rutledge thought as he came warily toward rutledge his stiff gait said closer to seventy lost are ye well thats the difference between one of them newfangled motorcars and a horse a horse has sense when you dont he smelled strongly of ale and a mixture of manure and dried earth rutledge said easily my name is rutledge im helping the local police look into the disappearance of a young woman who was found murdered a few miles from here youre not a local man the farmer said shading his eyes from the sun to stare at rutledges face his fingernails were crusted with dirt from working in the vegetable gardens and his chin was poorly shaved as if he couldnt see to use his razor no im from scotland yard ha london is it he spat that truit needs all the help you can give whoring son of a bitch cant keep his eyes or his hands to himself or hold his liquor there was disdain and disgust in the loud voice constable my left hind foot he considered rutledge for a moment i thought theyd caught the man whod done the killing we dont know if we have or not mr he left the sentence unfinished after a moment the caretaker said jimson ted jimson he was still watching rutledge closely how long have you worked here worked here nigh all my life whats that to do with a murder rutledge said idly as if it was more a matter of curiosity than anything else i understand that mrs wyatt was here on fifteen august from around eleven oclock until well into the afternoon working with a sick animal jimson thought for a time the fifteenth you say aye as i recollect she was that colicky heifer had to be fed from a bottle and cosseted damn near lost it and wed paid high enough for the bull stayed till nigh on four id guess getting it back on its legs ill say one thing french or not she has a way with cattle he gave the impression that he was of two minds about his mistress and where were you loitering in my bed waiting for the servants to bring me my breakfast where the hell do you think i might be working thats what besides the milking there was rotting boards in the loft that had to be shored up and potatoes to be dug and the fence in the chicken yard had rusted some of the little uns was running loose yet aurore had said he had had a cold or a hangover could you see mrs wyatt from where you worked you dont keep a heifer in the loft nor with the chickens could she see you i doubt she could but she wouldnt miss the hammering in the loft whats this in aid of then you think i had something to do with this killing rutledge felt a sense of tension in the man as if he had told the truth but skirted the edges of lying how far would he go for auroreor for simon wyatt we need to be sure where everyone was that afternoon often people arent aware that they are witnesses was mrs wyatt driving that day or did she walk here aye driving i saw her when she came up the lane in the wyatt car she waved to me when she got out but it didnt appear to me she wanted to talk did the car leave during the time you thought she was here not that i could say but i didnt set and watch it either and so mrs wyatt stayed with the sick heifer missing her luncheon how should i know when id finished with the chickens and wanted my own meal i didnt look for her to ask permission you didnt offer her lunch lord no what i cook aint fit for a ladys taste he said horrified bacon and cheese it was with onionsl a countrymans meal but the french took the same simple ingredients added eggs and herbs producing an omelet it was all rutledge thought in what you were used to you are sure neither mrs wyatt nor the car went away from the time she arrived to the time she left from eleven lets say until four the watery gray eyes flickered i didnt see her leave jimson answered but shed come in to wash up her boots was out by the kitchen door you mean she didnt leave between eleven and four or you didnt see her go home at four he couldnt seem to get a straight answer from jimson i didnt see her go at four when i came back from mending a fence down by the water closer to five it was the car was gone i know because i went around the house to fetch the milk cans from the road and the lane was empty rutledge turned and looked back the way he had come the trees were old heavy with late summer leaves the shadows under them dark and cool once this had been a thriving farm children had been born and patriarchs had died in the house behind him smoke had risen from the chimneys washing had hung on the lines the smell of fresh bread and baked pies had wafted from open windows dogs had run in the yard and flowers had bloomed in the weedgrown beds until the first wyatt discovered the power and authority of westminster and the family had bettered itself do you live in the farmhouse he asked jimson the man didnt answer rutledge turned around and repeated the question his mind still probing the past if simon wyatt hadnt gone to war aurore his wife would never have come to england and this place was it very like the home shed left was this farm her sanctuary however run down it was because it reminded her of her parents and peace and a life very different from the one she lived in charlbury jimson said testily ive a room at the back that and the kitchen its all i wantor need does anyone else use the other rooms aye weve got the king in one and the queen in tother are ye daft its a large house for one man the wyatts always had a tenant and his family living here i come over daily from charlbury then mr oliphant he went to new zealand in and that was the end to that the other dairymen went off to fight the hun mrs wyatt says theres no money to hire em back now nor to fix the barn roof i moved to the house after my wife died just to keep an eye on the place mrs wyatt she keeps some things in one of the upstairs rooms towels and coveralls rutledge had run out of questions and yet he had a strong feeling that because hed been partly distracted he had overlooked something what jimson watched him waiting the man wasnt lying rutledge was fairly certain of that jimson was telling the truth as he saw it but police work had taught rutledge that a witness could reply to questions exactly even honestlyand still manage to avoid the whole truth and suddenly the answer was there in the mans very watchfulness jimson hadnt heard the sound of rutledges engineand he wouldnt have heard the wyatt car leaveor return speak to him directly while he stared at your face and he could follow a conversation well enough to give reasonable answers it took concentration and to some extent a painfully learned ability to read lips this most certainly explained the tension in him the man wasnt lying he was going deaf he had told rutledge what his eyes had seen but there was no way for him to know what sounds he might or might not have missed anyone could have comeor gonefrom here and at any time jimson could only say with any certainty when aurore had come as an alibi for aurore wyatt he was useless yet she must have known so why had she left her own safety to hang on such a fragile thread rutledge asked if he might look through the house or the barn but jimson shook his head not without permission he said staunchly i dont have authority to let you go poking about in mr wyatts property he might not like it policeman or no the last thing rutledge wanted to do was ask aurore for permission neither hildebrand nor bowles would authorize a search warrant both of them would be far more likely to read him a lecture on the exact nature of his responsibility in this inquiry if the suitcase was herethe hateven the murder weaponthey would have to remain here until he had enough evidence to show cause to search and yet as he stood in the drive he had a feeling that this farm had played a role in margaret tarltons death how or why he wasnt sure alibior evidence foror against aurore wyatt instinct light as the breeze that ruffled the leaves of the trees and toyed with the grass at his feet made him say to jimson no matter it was purely curiosity not police business this was quite a prosperous dairy in its day aye it was jimson said sadness in his voice as he looked around him the best dairy in the county to my way of thinking now weve not got thirty cows in milk and i see to all of them with mrs wyatts help i was that proud to work here man and boy thats the trouble with living too long in my time ive seen more change than i liked mrs wyatt now she says change is good but i dont know ill be dead and in the ground before this place turns around theres no money and no hope here if i was her id go back to france tomorrow and leave it to rot instead of watching it fall slowly to pieces she has a husband she cant leave simon wyatts not the man his father was i never saw such a difference in all my life as when he came home from the war whats he want that museum for dead heathenish things he shook his head mrs daulton now she says it might be better for him than standing for parliament choices are a good thing she says there werent no choices when i was a lad you did what your pa did you counted yourself lucky to find a good woman to marry and you raised your children to be decent godfearing englishmen and the dead didnt wander about in the night talking to fence posts and trees looking for their soul startled rutledge said who wanders about in the night the first name that came to mind was henry daulton he wasnt sure why except that henry must find his mothers steadfast belief in his full recovery overwhelming at times ghosts jimson said direly gesturing around him and turned to walk back to the barn rutledge called to him and then swore remembering that the caretaker was deaf but no amount of persuasion could pry another word out of the old man the police spent all day trying to find a connection between the corpse that had been discovered in the field near leigh minster and any of the communities ringing the locationleigh minster itself stoke newton singleton magna or charlbury but just as the constables had reported there were no missing women and no newly hired domestics who had failed to appear at the time set for them to begin work no cousins daughters wives sistersinlaw or other female relatives unaccounted for she was clearly a stranger then except that there were seldom any sound reasons for killing strangers hildebrand marked her down as an unsolved murder and went back to looking for the mowbray children he drove the teams of searchers with a determination that was both praiseworthy and singleminded dr fairfield a small man of few words established the time of death at approximately three to four months earlier she couldnt have been in the ground longer he told rutledge later stripping off his white coat and hanging it on a hook behind the door of the bare room where he kept the dead and her clothing supports the timing this is august i daresay she died in late april early may cool enough weather to have her coat with her cause of death id say she was choked but not killed by strangulation it was the beating about the head that finished the job i found a fracture just above the temple small but sufficient i dont think she was sexually molested theres no indication of it from what i can see now and her clothing is oddly tidy as if whoever buried her had laid her out carefully on the coat was it the same person do you think who killed the mowbray woman or margaret tarlton as she may be the doctor frowned rubbing his chin thats harder to say this ones skin is gone you dont see the damage as readily but yes it might have been the same killer might mind you im not an authority on murder still both women appear to have been attacked by someone who clearly intended to kill them but in the end didnt know how to finish the job quickly or properly when its anger that runs amok to the point of destructive force theres generally more damageto the head the throat the shoulders then the blows land randomly you see driven by rage and intended to inflict as much hurtand therefore as much satisfactionas possible here the blows were confined to the head mainly the face as if to conceal identity as well as to kill he looked up at the taller man before him does that seem odd to you what im saying not to a policeman no the doctor sighed of course murder is seldom premeditated is it that is with planning and preparation and the fact is the human being isnt easy to murder without the proper tools a knife a firearm a garrote even a hammer will do whoever killed these two womenwhether it was the same person or two different peopleit was emotion that drove him or her in the beginning and then necessity took over he had to silence the victim you see and he had a quite nasty job there if i were you having to search for the right person id find someone whohe paused seeking the right wordswho was determined to go on however gruesome the task until the womans pulse stopped that can run either directiona secret to be kept or merely the realization that a live victim can point a finger at his attacker rutledge responded thinking about it hmmm secrets take many forms dont they from the sins of the flesh to the sins of the soul the doctor smiled but without humor or lightness this one is terrible enough that the killer was willing to suffer horror himselfherselfin order to keep it safe until youve battered someone to death inspector you cant conceive of how much blood and flesh and bone are spattered about only a madman can relish that or someone so deranged by emotion that the flecks are not even registered until its over or someone grimly carrying on to the bitter end he turned out the light in the hall and led the way to the side door of his surgery does what ive told you help at all yes rutledge said tiredly unfortunately i think it does well im glad to hear it the doctor said taking up his own coat and putting it on im late at a dinner party and my wife wont be happy about that hildebrand didnt find my information useful hes a good man inspector but he makes up his mind to suit the facts if i took the same approach in medicine id have filled the churchyard with my mistakes rutledge walked back to the swan thinking about what the doctor had said hamish in the back of his mind was reminding him that blindness could be worse than deafness rutledge ignored him as long as he could and then said it isnt blindness human nature enters into it i cant see aurore wyatt beating anyone to death you said as much yourself once women hamish said will kill to protect their bairnsand their man margaret tarlton was simon wyatts past returned to haunt him she did na want that and the woman wasnt going away she was staying jealousy no i dont see aurore wyatt being jealous of margaret or anyone else yet she was afraid of elizabeth napier whos spoken of jealousy hamish demanded rutledge stopped watching a carriage coming up the hill toward the inn the streets were deserted it was just the dinner hour he stood still and could hear laughter coming from the house on his left and peoples voices the carriage rattled past and disappeared among the trees at the top of the hill a cat stepped out of the inns yard ears twitching catching the distant sound of a dogs raucous bark something fluttered overheada bat he thought but deeper was another thought why had simon wyatt turned away from his future in parliament what was the real reason a foreign wife might not be an assetbut with the proper backing even that might be overcome if elizabeth napiers father had turned against wyatt for rejecting his daughter and putting in her place a french nobody he wasby all accountsan astute enough politician to know that you didnt have to like the men you backed you only needed to be sure of their support in the future the wyatt name had been magic in this part of dorset for more than one generation a safe seat for this constituency simon and aurore blamed his decision on the war but what if there was something more than war wearinessor a devotion to his other grandfatherthat made a very able and personable man choose seclusion over a brilliant career a small museum without the resources to grow hidden away in the dorset countryside where visitors were few where the exhibits would surely have a very narrow appeal however interesting they were in their own right it didnt quite add up its no what i was saying hamish began but rutledge cut him short his eyes moved across to the police station where mowbray still sat in his gloomy cell watched day and night its a beginning isnt it he responded thats all that matters the station door opened and hildebrand came out then paused as he saw rutledge looking toward him an instants hesitation and he walked on as if the man on the other side of the street didnt exist youve spoiled his investigation hamish pointed out he will na thank you for it mowbray might rutledge said nobody else seems to care about him after eating his dinner without being aware of what was on his plate or his fork rutledge went out to his car and turned it toward charlbury it was late in the evening to be calling on police business but often the unexpected worked more successfully than the routine the road was dark nearly empty except for a dog that trotted into the undergrowth as the cars headlamps flicked over the crest of the rise but charlbury was brighter and the wyatt house looked as if it was expecting the king there were lamps lit in most of the rooms and in the museum wing he left his car up by the church and walked back making his way to the wing on foot he thought curious so much light and no sounds of voices of people shouting or talking or laughing the museum was empty the masks leered at him in the brightness mouths agape or dark slashes eyes black with speculation or alarm and the weapons doubled with their own shadows gave the rooms an air of tension he walked through the three main areas into the small empty office and then into the room across from it hardly more than a large broom closet he had never been there before it held a bed with only a blanket military in its folds a chair and a wooden table of indeterminate age rescued from the attics or a jumble sale a cupboard held a pair of shoes and some underwear a clean shirt and a folded freshly pressed pair of trousers rutledge stood there in silence not needing hamishs comments to tell him that this was where simon wyatt spent most of his nights a gasp from the doorway made him spin around aurore was there grasping the frame with fingers that were white for a moment i thought she stopped were you looking for simon her voice had steadied sounded nearly normal couldnt you have come to the door and knocked as everyone else does that i was simon he asked finishing her first unguarded reaction i didnt come to the door because i saw the lights here and thought he was in this wing i preferred not to disturb the household calling so late simon is out she said but her eyes were showing the strain of worry and he said whats wrong his words crossing hers she let the door frame go then shrugged that french expression of i wash my hands he doesnt sleep well at night he hasnt since the war he rests here sometimes when he doesnt want to disturb me moving about the house in the dark or if hes very tired sometimes in the afternoon thats why the bed is here it doesnt signify it was an apology for her husband perhaps for the state of her marriage and an attempt to distract him but the tension in her was palpable he read her eyes not her words whats wrong he repeated you misunderstand there is nothing to worry you she looked away he stood there watching her in the end she turned her face back to him and said it isnt a police matter simon has gone somewhere i was worried when he didnt come to dinner i waited and finally i went to find him but he isnt in the house or in the grounds ive looked elizabeth napier took it upon herself to walk up to the church and to the wyatt arms he wont be there but it gave her something to do and took her out of my way the thought if not the words hovered between them how long has he been gone did he take the car or one of the carriages since teatime i think the motorcar is still here and the carriage then he must be in the villageat the arms or at the rectory perhaps after a moment she said itthis isnt the first time he has gone without telling me but not this long before thats the only reason i worry she stared at him her eyes begging but saying nothing refusing to betray her husband the dead didnt wander about in the night talking to fence posts and trees looking for their soul jimsons words echoed darkly in his mind can i help mrs wyatt hamish was telling him that it was not his affair it was not police business but rutledge had an intense feeling that it might be men like simon wyatt didnt walk out their door at teatime and disappear you can help by returning to singleton magna and calling again in the morning everything will be well in the morning i promise you will it let me help you find him discreetly people are used to a policeman prowling about god knows weve searched for days in every conceivable place for those children where shall i begin he hasnt she stopped then after a moment said before this he was always in the house or the gardens yet her voice seemed hollow even to her own ears always again he read her eyes ignoring her words but you arent sure of that are you if he often slept here in this bed or worked long hours in this wing how could you be sure where he wentor whenor for how long during the day or in the night aurore bit her lip the housewith elizabeth napier here moving between the house and the museum he must feeli dont know caught but he was proposing to hire an assistant she would have been in the house and the museum day after day she said angrily i dont know explain it however you will do you want to come with me aurore shook her head no ill stay in the event she let the sentence run into silence again in the event he returns of his own accord and needs me he walked past her near enough to smell the fragrance of her hair and perfume lily of the valley but she didnt turn she didnt say anything more at first he quartered charlbury down toward the inn up toward the church he saw elizabeth napier speaking to someone by the church door and thought it might be joanna daulton nothing he went on to the motorcar and began to drive toward the farm thinking that it was a logical place for wyatt to escape to if he wanted peace from the two women who drew him first this way and then that jimson had seen him in the night it has happened before rutledge didnt need hamish to tell him he had already gotten there on his own for some reason the old man must have thought the ghosts of the wyatts were walking their farmland again unable to rest in peace peering out a window in the night seeing the shadowy figure crossing the moonlit yard he wouldnt have questioned it he would have accepted its right to be there the farmhouse was dark save for a single lighta lampin a back room that must mark jimsons bedchamber the barn too was empty save for the animals that belonged there no one challenged rutledge as he moved about and the only sounds were those that belonged to the night not to restless spirits turning the other way back toward charlbury he drove through the town and slowed peering beyond his lights into the fields trying to pin any tall manlike shadow against the sky hed been good at that in the war as hamish reminded him spotting scouts or the first wave of a silent attack coming across nomansland swift vision sometimes made the difference in surprise he was close to where hed seen the dog earlier when he realized that a tree in the middle distance had what appeared to be a double trunk rutledge pulled off the road and left the car crossing the fields with swift long strides the figure didnt move it wasnt leaning against a tree it was simply standing beside it as if in conversation with it talking to trees hes mad no better than you are hamish was saying tensely rutledge ignored the voice as he slowed his pace and moved silently nearer the figure didnt look up or show any sign of awareness it simply stood a black line against the horizon as if put there by a sculptors hand rutledge was now within five yards he said wyatt nothing no response at all he came within reach he could have put out a hand and touched the still straight shoulder it was uncanny the silence went on unbroken except for the sound of their breathing unnerving hed spent too many nights on the front listening to the sound of breathing as men waited but what was this one waiting for wyatt he spoke gently firmly trying not to startle the other man nothing except hamish growling a warning undecided he stood there observing peering into the darkness at the expressionless face the rigidity of the body simon wyatt was oblivious to his surroundings wherever he was in spirit he neither heard nor saw anything after a time rutledge touched the mans arm lightly undemandingly no more than one man would touch another in the way of acknowledgment comfort simon stirred rutledge said quietly without fuss its inspector rutledge from singleton magna can i give you a lift to charlbury ive got my car over there the sentences were short the tone of voice neutral simon turned to look at him but even in the starlight rutledge was sure the blank eyes were not actually seeing him wherever simon was it was a very long distance from here then he said unexpectedly the strain intense in his voice as if his throat were tight with fear or some inner conflict major they arent firing tonight rutledge felt a jolt of shock but kept his voice level no its over for tonight its time to go back simon said only yes and when rutledge turned tentatively to walk back the way hed come simon silently fell into step behind him when they reached the car simon spoke again this time in a perfectly natural if rather tired voice nice of you to give me a lift back rutledge as though hed gone walking after his dinner and nothing else had happened my pleasure rutledge answered and turned the crank they were halfway to charlbury when simon added i wonder what time it is when rutledge told him he said surprised that late i must have walked farther than i realized aurore will be worried walk often in the evening do you rutledge said as if making conversation and not caring whether the question was answered or not no theres so much to do readying the museum no time for country pleasures as it is im behind schedule the invitations have already gone out i cant change the date now elizabeth and aurore between them are already handling the arrangements for the catering it was as if simon wyatt had no memory of where hed beenor why aurore watching for them from the windows of the museum came out to greet them on the front walk her manner was interesting she neither touched her husband nor asked him as a worried frightened wife might do what hed been thinking of where hed been only her eyes mirrored her distress she said you must be tired i am rather i think ill turn in if you dont mind he nodded to rutledge she shot a warning glance at rutledge and said yes do that then stood silently beside the man from london as her husband walked toward the house and went inside alone rutledge could hear her unsteady breathing where did you find him she asked in a low voice youve been gone for nearly an hour i went to the farm but i dont think hed been there there were no lights in the house except in the room the caretaker uses and the barn was empty as well i decided i should go in the other direction out the singleton magna road i found him in a field beyond the town standing there like a pillar of salt he neither saw nor heard me coming and he didnt know who i was until we started back to charlbury he stopped not wanting to tell her about their brief exchange in the field and simon hadnt been talking to a treehe had simply been standing as far as rutledge could see in its shelter she nodded thats how it happens he seems completely lost to his surroundings it isnt wine it isnt a drug by this time surely id know if it was those things rutledge said only no he hadnt been drinking and his eyes were blank but the pupils were normal as far as i could tell he wasnt sleepwalking either he paused then added mrs wyatt that man is under intense stress do you see that have you spoken to a physician she smiled wryly what can i say to a man of medicine how could i persuade simon to believe he needed to see such a one if i say he suddenly loses awareness of where he is and what is happening around him they will say oh he is in excellent health i assure you perhaps with so much on his mind he is forgetful she broke off as elizabeth napier came out of the house walking toward them with swift intent strides hes home hes perfectly fine aurore whatever was all this alarm about oh good evening inspector did she summon you as well in her distress how silly all for naught aurore said nothing as if elizabeths words had put a seal on what she had just been telling him rutledge said i was driving down the charlbury road and happened to see mr wyatt there i gave him a lift ah his father often took walks after his dinner he said it cleared his head wonderfully its not surprising simon feels the same way just now with the opening so near it was meant to be reassuring but managed to point out at the same time that aurore wasnt a part of the wyatt legend couldnt be expected to know such things wouldnt rememberas elizabeth didwhat ran in the family well its late i must go to the inn and to bed myself did inspector hildebrand tell you im staying in charlbury for the next week will you see me safely to my door inspector with pleasure he turned to aurore id like to speak to you but she shook her head as miss napier says it is late and i am tired whatever you wish to tell me or to ask me please tomorrow will be soon enough upstairs a light went out seeing it rutledge wondered if simon wyatt was sleeping in his own bedor making his way down to that cramped room in the back of the museum elizabeth napier took his arm and said good night to aurore then let rutledge lead her to the gate closing it after them aurore stood where she was on the front walk light from the house windows framed her hair like an aureole but shadowed her face he wondered what she was thinking and found himself distracted by elizabeth napiers comments i shouldnt have said what i did its just that ive known simon for so long i feel exasperated sometimes when aurore fails to understand him and thats my own failure really not hers id worry about my husband too in her place the strain of this museum opening is telling on both of them he wondered suddenly if she was rattling on because she knew more than she wanted him to see then he decided it was merely a matter of covering her tracks they walked down the quiet street nodding to several men passing by but to all intents and purposes they were quite alone do you think so yes theres a distance between them you can feel it i thinkim afraid she feels that this museum may come between them but it wont elizabeth said positively taking his arm as they crossed the dark street no hes doing this because he felt he owed something to the maternal side of his family its an obligation he strongly believes in i think the war made him realize that once its done once hes finished organizing it someone else will be given the daybyday responsibility of running this museum and i see simon returning to the world he was bred to london and politics rutledge offered wondering if margaret tarlton had been sent here to take over the museum once its purpose had been served allowing simon wyatt his freedom and keeping margaret out of london and thomas napiers eye of course i dont believe aurore appreciates how strongly the tradition is in this family to serve to lead to set an example for others i know simon far better than she does i should do ive known him most of his life have you told auroremrs wyattwhat you believe his future may hold good heavens no thats for simon to do when the time comes what do you think happened tonight they had nearly reached the wyatt arms nothing a lovers quarrel most likely and simon went out to walk it off and it upset aurore when he didnt come back she must be a very possessive woman well politics will soon teach her that that isnt wise it wasnt a misunderstanding with youover his futurethat wyatt wanted to think about away from the house elizabeth napier pulled her hand from his arm and turned to stare up at him whatever gave you that idea dont tell me aurore feltor was it something simon said as you brought him home this has nothing to do with aurore wyatt he said opening the inn door and holding it for her from the bar he could hear voices dentons rising to answer someone and then laughter the chink of glasses and the smell of beer and smoke and sausages nor with anything wyatt said to me im asking you for your observations of his mood since you know him so well she cocked her head to one side her eyes on the sign swinging blackly against the stars above them do you really want to hear what i believe or does aurore have you so completely under her spell that you cant view any of this objectively she doesnt he began irritated but elizabeth cut him short dont be silly she said for a second time aurore wyatt is a very attractiveand very lonelywoman men find that an irresistible combination it isnt surprising all right i think she wants to keep him here bucolic and safe she may even have been the one who first put the museum idea into his head i dont know and i dont actually care the fact remains you dont understand what pressures she brings to bear in that household you take her at face value this lovely foreign exotic woman you dont sit across from her at the breakfast table nor do you have to live with her every day simon does ask yourself what shes truly like and you may have some glimmer of what simons life is like dont misunderstand me im not speaking as the jilted woman here im telling you what my observations aretodaynow if i wanted to compete with aurore wyatt for her husband id hardly be likely to drive him to wander about the countryside in the dark to escape me would i there are a thousand more subtle ways of destroying his marriage and bringing him back to me the question is then do i really need to scheme for him if his own wife has already estranged herself from him good night inspector and with that she turned walked into the inn and without looking back went up the stairs with that regal manner that had so impressed everyone at the swan in singleton magna as his eyes followed her rutledge became aware of movement at the corner table under the stairs a very sober shaw was looking at him with a grin on his face yes i heard all that women are bitches he said softly however well bred they may be and however blue their bloodlines are come in and have a drink with me before my uncle calls time you look as if you could use one rutledge took up his invitation and sat down the rings on the table had either been wiped awayor they hadnt accumulated this night shaw was nursing one pint that appeared to have gone flat long since he called to his uncle who brought another pint for rutledge the lovely aurore isnt simon wyatts problem shaw was saying it probably isnt the lovely miss napier either whats bothering him is a guilty conscience interested rutledge said guilt over what putting this museum before his fathers expectations of him the war what he learned about himself out there in france because you do you soon know if youre a coward or not most of us are only we find ways to hide it at least from other people it was something all of them had faced the question of bravery of courageand these two were not the same of mortality of what life was and what death meant he himself had brought hamish home losing for an instant the thread of the conversation rutledge said youre saying that he failed himself no im saying he didnt like the man he turned out to be i dont suppose his father expected the war to last and i dont suppose simon did either well none of us did quick in and quick out was the idea only it wasnt that way and in the end those of us who survived knew what kind of men we were some of us even learned to live with it however little we liked what we saw but simon told all his life that he was jesus christ son of god fell far below his own estimation and never recovered thats a very sober assessment rutledge answered he had nearly used the word cruel and changed it at the very last i am sober the pain isnt so bad tonight i saw wyatt leave his house without particular emphasis rutledge said did you indeed when tonight damn you i said good evening as we passed in the street he never answered he walked past me as if he hadnt seen me and i could have touched him i was that close gave me the willies i can tell you his face was empty as if his body was moving of its own volition sleepwalking god no his eyes were open he didnt stumble or weave he moved like a man with a destination only he was deaf and dumb your imagination rutledge said he may just have been preoccupied it wasnt shell shock either shaw said ignoring him i recognize that when i see it we had four or five men in our unit who were shambling wrecks before we got them out of the front lines pathetic shaking barely human rutledge felt the sudden unstoppable jolt run through him jerking the glass in his hand until it spilled he swore and looked down at his cuff to conceal his face and hamishs swift response barely human so it has to be something else shaw went on oblivious buried in his own feelings something inside the man that he himself doesnt see until it manifests itself in sudden blackouts which tells me its some sort of deeply buried guilt and he cant face it what other reason is there it might be more recent than the war it might be miss tarltons death shaw laughed without any hint of humor are you trying to say that he lapses into these states and commits murder or the other way around commits murder and then lapses out of guilt you must really be at a loss to find answers for all these bodies youve turned up rutledge studied him youve been thinking about this havent you ever since you met wyatt in the street or even before that oh yes shaw said bitterly thats all i have left to me an interest in my fellow human beings we all walk with shadows youve got your own havent you its there in your face and your eyes i wonder what they are and if they came out of the war or from your work his eyes scanned rutledge forcing himself to ignore the challenge rutledge waited after draining his glass in one long swallow shaw said i wish i could have gotten drunk tonight after a time he picked up ate thread of the conversation again i watch them all daulton because he spoke to her just before she left charlbury wyatt her host and therefore responsible for her aurore who should have gotten her to that train safely and didnt and lets not forget elizabeth napier so busily using margarets death to throw herself at simon again or her famous father who is conspicuous by his absence if margaret hadnt meant anything to him hed have come storming into hildebrands office long before this making political mileage out of his righteous anger no theyre all on my list and im just waiting for a single mistake that might tell me which one is guilty youve left mowbray out of your accounting no i havent hes my last resort if im wrong about the others have you reached any conclusions yet no shaw said wincing as he moved too suddenly in his chair except that margarets death doesnt seem to have left even the briefest mark on anybodys life except mine and possibly thomas napiers who knows he sighed heavily shaking his head i dont know whether i loved her or hated her in the end i might have killed her myself if shed hurt me again someone else did and now i want to find himor her for vengeance it doesnt work out the way you think it might doesnt it shaw said wryly if i discovered her killer tonight i dont know what id do about it turn him over to you or batter the life out of him myself it doesnt matter im dead anyway stillit frightens me not knowing how ill feel when i loved her so much thats why im sober rutledge im suddenly afraid to drink it was the next morning when rutledge finally ran simon wyatt to earth in the museum shut the doors to the room he was working in and said curtly sit down ive got too much to do rutledge cut him short the museum can wait the opening can wait i want to talk to you something in rutledges voice broke through his wall of isolation simon reached for a chair that was filled with boxes shoved them off the seat pulled it to him and sat down all right five minutes theres a very good chance that the murder of margaret tarlton can be laid at your wifes door aurore dont be stupid man shes no more guilty of murder than i am if this is what you want to say to me ive got more important things to attend to rutledge reached out and pressed simon back into his chair youll listen to me until ive finished damn it and ill decide when that is he had spent a long sleepless night going over many things in his mind but there was no one except hamish he could have said them to the plan was as i understand it for mrs wyatt to drive margaret tarlton to the train station at singleton magna she tells me that she didnt that she was at the farm working with a sick heifer all right that means that margaret tarlton is still in this house looking for a way to the station mrs daulton sees her at your front gate waitingwearing the clothes she had changed into the dress in fact she was wearing when the body was found elizabeth napier has told me that shes quite sure the dress belonged to margaret im sure edith could identify it as well or mrs daulton i havent heard about this simon began incensed why hasnt anyone told me because youve got your head buried in this museum and dont hear whats being said to you rutledge told him in exasperation to go on your maid edith concerned that miss tarlton might miss her train hurries down to the inn to ask denton if his nephew shaw can drive miss tarlton but while shes gone miss tarlton for reasons of her own walks down to the rectory and asks henry daulton if he or his mother can take her to singleton magna he leaves miss tarlton on the steps while he goes to the garden to speak to his mother but as he turns away she says theres mrs wyatt and leaves angry that shes already running late a woman who lives on the other side of the inn tells me that she saw the car leaving town soon afterward that your wife was driving and that she believes margaret tarlton was a passenger simon started to speak but rutledge cut him short whether her evidence is reliable or not doesnt matter this places your wife in the car with margaret tarlton heading toward singleton magna in time to make the train miss tarltons on her way to sherborne where shes to spend several days with miss napier there was a look of surprise on simons face but he said nothing according to the stationmaster she isnt one of the passengers on the train going north and certainly not on the train going south she doesnt arrive in sherborne on fifteen august nor on the following day because miss napier and her chauffeur benson have gone to meet her miss napier herself on the fifteenth and benson on the sixteenth meanwhile in london her maid dorcas williams hasnt seen or heard from her nor have her cousins in gloucestershire miss tarlton it appears has vanished from the face of the earth but we do have a body in singleton magna who is wearing what appear to be her garments it would seem then that miss tarlton died on the road outside singleton magna sometime in the afternoon and if your wife took her out of charlbury in your motorcar then your wife was most likely the last person to see miss tarlton alive do you follow me simon wyatt frowning said yes of course i do i just dont accept your reasoning my wife is not a murderess shed never met margaret tarlton before the thirteenth when she went to collect her at the station and i cant imagine any possible reason why aurore would want to kill a comparative stranger miss tarlton was very likely going to accept your offer of a position here and whats that got to do with murder no your theory is full of holes man aurore may have taken margaret as far as singleton magna but it doesnt tell me what margaret tarlton did once she got there if aurore set her down in the town someone else could have as easily met her there have you thought of that have you made any effort to find out he hadnt as hamish was busily pointing out shaw elizabeth napier thomas napier who else does miss tarlton know anyone in singleton magnaor for that matter in charlbury god no shes been here once or twice with the napiers but shes not the kind of woman who likes the country very much london is her metier shes at home in parlors and salons and theaters all the same she was willing to work here to leave london simon made a deprecating gesture she came to help me make a success of the opening and then i hoped to attract a student of the east to come in and see to preservation of specimens the proper cases some sort of cataloging all the trimmings of a proper museum i dont have the money for that not at the moment but the quality of exhibits is quite high ive already shown some of the better examples to dr anderson in oxford simon grinned i expect he hoped i might contribute them to his own private collection my grandfather was a skilled draftsman and has drawn birds in new guinea and sulawesi that created quite a fuss when anderson showed them to specialists many of them hadnt been described before as he spoke his eyes flashed with more life and enthusiasm than rutledge had ever seen him show and you told her this was shortterm employment margaret herself said she wouldnt staysix months a year at best she spoke of other plans after that i thought it might be marriage the way she tilted her head when she said it with a sort of pride any idea who the man might have been no but then ive been away for four years someone she met in the war at a guess i dont see margaret tarlton winding up a spinster someone she met in the war not thomas napier simon stared at rutledge elizabeths father good god what put that idea into your head i thought i was the only one who knew about that someone had helped miss tarlton purchase a small house in chelsea i thought it might have been her employer a cold look turned simons face hard no it wasnt thomas napier it was my father she bought it through a trust fund he set up for her surprised in his turn rutledge said why thats an expensive gift he didnt see fit to tell me and they werent lovers if thats the conclusion youre jumping to he said it was a business arrangement that hed done it because hed known her father poppycock tarlton never came here and my father was never in india id wager thomas napiers behind it are you saying napier was in love with miss tarlton if hed wanted her to have a house of her own why didnt he buy it for her it was the first independent corroboration of that hed had politics mainly and because he wouldnt want elizabeth to know shed be angry and hurt if hed conducted an affair under his own roof i expect thats why he hasnt come down to singleton magna and given hildebrand hell for dragging his feet in this business hes being discreet for his sake and for elizabeths and for margarets if it turns out all of you are wrong if there had been another man in her life what would napier have done for a man of his clever controlled nature he was besotted with margaret tarlton if youre asking me if he would have killed her no but id hate like hell to be in the shoes of the other man and your father wasnt in love with heror receiving favors from her if it was blackmail it wasnt sexual he may have owed napier a political favor or some debt my father left a letter explaining about the house i worked out the rest of it myself mainly because my godfather had been so cooperative when i asked him to speak to elizabeth for me id expected him to turn on me what happens to the house now if margaret tarlton is dead simons fair brows twitched together im not sure it was some sort of trust arranged through lawyers i was told theres a clause protecting my fathers claim to the house based on the fact hed had some connection with margarets family if she married or died without children the trust reverted to him your father is dead does this mean the house comes to you now simon answered slowly i expect it does but its early days yet to cross that bridge no one knows for certain if youre telling me the truth whether margaret is deador has simply disappeared for reasons of her own if theres one thing ive learned about women inspector its that they have a logic all their own she might well turn up alive and surprise all of us before turning to go rutledge asked will you go back to politics if the museum is a success and youve satisfied your duty to your grandfather why does that matter so much to everyone sudden anger sent a flush into simons face and he looked directly at rutledge what was your excuse for leaving scotland yard to fight in france or are you the only one whos allowed to dig into another mans soul rutledge owed wyatt honesty for honesty he said slowly i believed it was a sense of duty of responsibility to king and country not patriotism you understand it wasnt the parades and speeches and flag waving i remember thinking i have an obligation here if these men can walk away from their families and their careers and serve so must i and jean had said only you know you look very handsome in uniform as if he were dressed for a masquerade dear god why did you go back to the yard afterward because it was what i did best duty again im no longer sure i know what that means even the women in my family were politically astute and politically ambitious it never occurred to any of them that i might not be cut out of the same bolt of cloth it never occurred to me i went away to war to be a hero i came home a failure in the eyes of most people no medals no appetite for politics no fashionable marriage is that why you have taken the trouble to build this museum rutledge gestured to the shelves around them the mysteries of another world another culture so foreign in this english house in an english county and with a french wife but that was something he couldnt say aloud it was as if simon hadnt heard him i wasnt a bad soldier i fought hard i served as well as any man i dont know why i survived i dont see how any of us did it was a bloody lottery i win you lose rutledge felt the coldness of memory the times hed been terrified that he might dieand the long months when he was terrified that he wouldnt it wasnt a pretty war simon finished and i discovered that i was no churchill in the shambles of the trenches i couldnt make a pretense of being dashing and flamboyant it would have been obscene rutledge feeling a flatness that pervaded his spirit and gave him a sense of loss walked slowly back to the inn where hed left his car had he finally reached the bedrock of simon wyatt in those last words he thought perhaps he had i discovered that i was no churchill was that the torment that sent him out into the night alone reliving something that was past nae mair than you do hamish said with savage honesty all right then why did he himself persist in this business of policing why had he ever taken it up after the war because it was all you are fit for hamish reminded him it was after all what he had told wyatt then why do i sometimes get it so bloody wrong he started the car and climbed in shutting the door and letting in the clutch with half his attention on his thoughts all at once he realized that shaw was coming out of the inn and hailing him bent almost double with the effort it took to hurry and shout at the same time rutledge stopped the car so suddenly he killed the engine a sense of cold foreboding swept through him shaw reached the passenger side and said breathlessly bloody hell rutledge didnt you hear me im sorry rutledge began but shaw shook his head youre needed in singleton magna straightaway as soon as you can get there hildebrand had someone telephone to the wyatt house but youd already left aurore passed the message on to my uncle rutledge thought theyve found the children but all he said was very well im on my way his mind was in turmoil he swore silently as he cranked the car again and with a wave to the stillflushed man in front of the inn drove down the road at speed startling a horse being taken to the smithy for shoeing it reared and shook its head wildeyed while the farmer holding the reins shouted at rutledge to mind what he was about driving hard and fast he kept his mind on the road not allowing his thoughts to break through his concentration he reached singleton magna left the car in the yard behind the swan and with his heart thundering against his ribs walked back toward the police station if theyd found the children it meant hed been wrong from the start there was a small knot of people standing outside the innhe hadnt seen them as he came up the street but he noticed them now it confirmed his fears a ripple of excitement swept them as he passed by but no one called to him or tried to approach crossing the busy road between two young girls on horseback and a dray carrying milk cans he ran lightly up to the door of the station and opened it there was nothing else he could do inside the air was thick with ominous tension constable jeffries saw him over the heads of the men jamming the small room and spoke weve found the children he said grimly inspector hildebrand is waiting for you in his office rutledge felt the coldness settle into his very bones hed seen dead children before somehow he wasnt prepared to see these he nodded to the constable and went down the dark passage to hildebrands door knocking before turning the knob to enter you sent for rutledge began on the threshold and stopped as if hed been shot in the small room hildebrand stiff with strain stood behind his desk he glared at rutledge you took your time getting here he said never mind it seems that ive done your job for you the other chair in the room across the desk from hildebrand was occupied by a man holding a small boy on his knees one arm protectively around the little girl some two years older who was leaning anxiously against the side of the chair both children stared at rutledge eyes round and frightened the boy began to suck his thumb the man looking up was dark haired of medium height and weight his pleasant face wearing a distinctly uncertain expression rutledge with hamish hammering at the back of his mind took a deep breath like a drowning man coming up out of the sea into lifegiving air the mowbray children he asked into the lengthening silence hildebrand rocking on his toes anger apparent in every line of his body held rutledges glance as it swung back to his grim face no but close enough at least it seems that way youre the expert from scotland yard thats why you were sent here you make the decision anger of his own surged through rutledge but he turned to the man in the chair holding out his hand my names rutledge he said inspector rutledge robert andrews the man said taking it awkwardly over the boys head and these are albert mowbrays children he paused tricia and bertie he smiled at them first the girl and then the boy the children stared back at him unmoved by familiar names andrews looked quickly at hildebrand well no theyre mine actually this is rosie and young robert the little girl shyly smiled as her father spoke her name her head pressed against his shoulder they were pretty children both of them and of the ages bert mowbrays son and daughter had been on the day they died in london then how are you connected with thiserinvestigation hasnt he told you andrews asked looking again at hildebrand i thoughtwell never mind what i thought he cleared his throat i was on the train that passed through singleton magna on thirteen august my wife was expecting our third child in two weeks and id promised to take rosie and her brother to susans mothershe has a house down along the coastclose to the time and i did rosie was tired and wishing the long trip over werent you love he touched her hair briefly with his free hand and she tried to leave the train only she fell on the platform and scraped her knee that was when the woman came over and bound a handkerchief around the cut telling her what a brave little girl she was he looked at rutledge not sure how to go on why didnt you come forward sooner rutledge asked weve had sheets printed police asking questions going from house to house he tried to keep the anger and the shock out of his voice for the childrens sake and his own it was in the papers repeatedly both a photograph and a request for help well i went straight back to london didnt i and a damnedand a good thing i did because susan suddenly went into labor that same night and everything else went out the window didnt it it wasnt until i went back to fetch the children that my motherinlaw told me about theerwhat happened to the woman and said i was lucky it wasnt my wife and my two that was missing she said shed had nightmares for days about the poor little dears mind you id have never gone to the police if she hadnt talked on and on about the horror of it all which set me to thinking he shook his head she has a morbid taste for tragedies that woman does what happened the police saw fit to arrest me on the spot thats what happened and if the rector in the church whod married us and christened these two hadnt come forward id probably still be there he frowned indignantly still unsettled by the injustice of it all that was last night im sorry rutledge said soothingly they were trying to do their job i fail to see how arresting an innocent man is part of any policemans job andrews replied with the first show of spirit do you remember what the woman was wearing the one who helped the children god no i dont know anything about womens clothes he began was it pink or perhaps yellow rutledge waited all this time hildebrand had been standing at his back across the desk silent and watchful and hopingbelievingthat rutledge might still fail andrews shrugged i tell you i dont know rutledge turned to the little girl squatting on his heels before her can you remember the woman who helped you at the train when you fell he asked gently smiling at her was she pretty as pretty as your mother rosie looked down playing with the sash of her own dress yes she said so softly it was just a whisper tell me she was pretty rosie repeated over her head rutledge asked do you still have the handkerchief andrews silently mouthed no i liked her hat rosie said into the exchange i want one do you what color was it he waited patient silent after a moment she pointed to a carafe of water on the desk a crystal jug with an upturned glass for its lid a band of silver at the neck caught the reflected light of the courtyard shining and clear like that she said and smiled shyly like light on water silvery the wyatt maid edith had said rutledge slowly straightened and turned to hildebrand the inspector said abruptly if youd excuse us for a moment mr andrews without waiting for an answer he went around the desk and looked at rutledge the two men went out into the dark cramped passage carefully closing the door behind them and moving away out of earshot at the far end of the passage the other door that locked mowbray away was deep in shadow rutledge found himself thinking about the man inside he didnt kill them he said more to himself than to hildebrand we dont know that hildebrand said that child just identified the color of the hat miss tarlton was wearing if it was miss tarlton at the station if it was miss tarlton that mowbray saw and came looking for it means his wife must surely have died in with the two children and it was only his imagination he stopped knowingwho betterhow imagination tricked the mind how what you believed was shadowed and shaped by what you had done mowbray hadnt been in london to save his wife or his children hed been away in france hed come home to bury them hed missed them every day since to the point that in a desperate time of his life he had seen what he wanted most in the world to see a return to what had been we dont know that hildebrand repeated stubbornly a child that age in a courtroom it would be a farce the questioning could tangle her into knots are you willing to put that family through such a nightmare what are you going to do instead will you continue this search widen it go on looking until theres nowhere else to try i fail to see that its any of your business if we have found those children you may return to london and leave the rest to the local police then allow me one final test let mowbray see them have you run stark mad no listen to me as their voices clashed the constable on duty at the desk opened the door at the head of the passage and stared down it he quickly shut it again at a gesture from hildebrand what i want to do is this an hour later it was arranged not without complaints from robert andrews and from hildebrand and from marcus johnston mowbrays attorney a call put in to bowles in london by an irate hildebrand caught the man in a fierce mood not a receptive one even when the receiver was turned over to rutledge bowless voice rang down the line in deafening vowels ive had thomas napier calling in from his office to see what progress weve made toward finding miss tarlton he said shortly i dont like to have politicians breathing down my neck its your fault rutledge for dragging the napiers into the issue in the first place if the dead woman is miss tarlton mr napier will do more than breathe down our necks rutledge said hell be camping in your office from all reports he was as fond of her as he was of his own daughter fonder very likely then find out once and for all if these children are mowbrays or not do you hear me put hildebrand on again ill set him straight and so it was arranged when they went to fetch mowbray sunk in the darkness of his terrors he came shuffling and blinking into the light in hildebrands room his face gaunt unshaven his hair lank and dull he said nothing as johnston his own face stiff greeted his client a silence fell mowbray seemed not to know or care who they were what they wanted he had been brought here he suffered that with the same awful patience he gave to everything he did now from eating his food to lying on his cot through the night nothing touched him in the courtyard outside hildebrands windows a ball came bouncing across the debris of leaves and dust johnston was talking when the first child appeared it was the same age as robert andrews and nearly the same coloring a little boy chasing exuberantly after the red ball mowbray started up crying nodont torment me rutledge said quietly is that your bertie mr mowbray no god no i killed my bertie you told me so yourself another small boy came running into the yard fiercely demanding his turn with the ball and the first turned away with it leading to a screaming match between the two a third boy appeared a little older now closer to the age the mowbray boy would have reached if hed lived watching mowbray carefully rutledge said you must look at them mr mowbray you must help us know if one of these boys is your son mowbray his eyes wet with frantic tears turned toward johnston for help johnston shaking said inspector in warning the fourth child came reluctantly into the courtyard mowbray suddenly started half rising from his chair johnston reached out to stop him and rutledge reminded him softly remember there is no way he can reach them before johnston or hildebrand could move mowbray had come across the room to the window sinking to his knees before it his face contorted with tears bertie he cried his hands raking the glass bertie is it you lad robert andrews the younger turned toward the man at the window looking at him in alarm then he turned back to the ball players and scooped up the ball they had dropped in their struggle racing away up the walk toward the street shouting mine mine he vanished mowbray cried nonocome back bertie and at the same time he caught sight of rosie being led by the hand into the courtyard by a slightly older child on such short notice theyd had difficulty finding girls of the right age he stared at her drinking in the sight of her a strange look of wonder on his face rosie her hand confidingly in that of the other girl looked straight at the window and then away again that same shy smile lit her face tricia love mowbray asked his body trembling as if he had a fever they said id killed you and left you in the dark for the foxes he broke down then his eyes turning to rutledge for one brief moment in their depths something shining it was the brief terrible spark of hope johnston was openly moved his face wet with tears hildebrand swore under his breath the same words over and over and over again rutledge ignoring the savagery of hamishs anger looked at mowbray and told himself that it had had to be donefor margarets sakefor mowbrays sake above all else he went to the prisoner and touched his shoulder they are the children you saw he said gently the children at the train station is that what youre telling me the little boy who picked up the ball and that smaller girl are you quite sure yes yes theyre my children theyre alive his shoulders moved with the sobs racking his lungs his words tumbling out incoherently he pressed his face against the glass as the two girls turned and went back the way theyd come eyes straining for a last glimpse of them he repeated the words more clearly this time as if finding them easier to believe with each breath no rutledge said no im afraid they arent bertie and patricia their name is andrews think mowbray your bertie would be four now nearly five like the older boy you saw and the little girl patricia would be seven by now these two childrenthe ones who remind you so much of your own twoare younger the ages bertie and patricia were when they died in london their mother mowbray asked huskily suddenly remembering is she out there too raw need gleamed like fire in his eyes no his voice was very low with infinite compassion in its timbre the mother of these two children who remind you so much of your own is in london recovering from the birth of her third child shes auburn haired anderplump he pulled from his pocket the photograph that robert andrews had let him borrow do you see that after a moment the words seemed to register mowbray looked at it frowning with the effort the woman captured by the camera had dark hair far darker than that in the photograph mowbray himself had carried and she weighed at least two stone more thats not mary he said in surprise she doesnt look anything like mary his eyes swiveled to johnston and hildebrand wheres mary he demanded accusingly as if she might still be conjured up with the children hildebrand opened his mouth but rutledge got there before him look at this photograph he said passing the one hed borrowed from elizabeth napier do you see your wife among these women mr mowbray look carefully at all of them and tell me he studied it distraught and weeping shes not there he said hope dying again shes not there he looked up at rutledge and said with such pathos that it brought silence to the three watchers did i kill my mary then rutledge stood there looking down at the frightened ravaged face against the judgment of the policeman hed trained to become he said quietly no you didnt kill her the german bombs did a long time ago she cant suffer anymore and she cant come back to you neither can the children but he made no mention of margaret tarlton after the angry doctor had taken mowbray back to his cell and given him a sedative to swallow johnston walked out of the police station saying only i dont know what youve accomplished i just dont know what to believe the constable was busily sorting out the children by the front door thanking the parents from whom hed borrowed them and watching andrews crossing to the hotel with a very sleepy little boy on his shoulder and a little girl dragging her feet in the dust head down and yawning what happened the constable asked hildebrand and then quickly went back into the station minding his own business with industry hildebrand said johnston is right whatve you accomplished if those are the children weve been searching forand for the sake of argument ill accept it for nowtheres still the dead woman if she happens to be this miss tarlton mowbray killed her mistaking her for his wife thats the long and short of it stands to reason weve still got one victim and weve got her killer have we he didnt recognize margaret tarlton did he how did he meet her and where is her suitcase where is her hat were back to the same quandary weve faced all along if mowbray killed that woman and then went to sleep under a tree ripe picking for the police when the body was found why did he bother to clean the blood off himself get rid of the weapon and hide her suitcase to what end why not leave them there beside her who knows what goes on in the mind of a madman even the mad have their own logic no dont come the londoner with me rutledge madness means theres no logic left in the mind i submit then that whoever killed margaret tarlton took away the suitcase the hat she was wearing and the weapon oh yes walking down the road with them in his hand was he no hethe killerwas taking margaret tarlton by car to the station in singleton magna and it was into the car that he shoved the hat and the weapon and the missing suitcase until he could dispose of them later oh yes hildebrand repeated but came through his front door spattered with blood and said dont mind this lot ill just have a quick bath before tea yes its the blood thats the problem rutledge admitted we dont know where either mowbray or anyone else might have washed off the blood but there was only one place and hed already felt the words burning in the back of his mind like redhot brands at the farmhouse aurore wyatt could easily have walked inside after tending a sick heifer and bathed her face and hands and thrown away a stained shirtwaist or burned it in the kitchen fire except for the deaf old man who worked there who would have seen or paid any heed to what she did by the time she got back to her own house shed have been clean rutledge standing there in the lateafternoon sunlight while a saw droned on and on somewhere in the distance suddenly knew how judas had felt a traitora betrayer of someone who trusted him or who trusted in her spell over him when it was finished when hildebrand had walked back into his office and the waiting knot of peoplestarved of newshad wandered away rutledge drew a long shuddering breath and went back to the swan he felt dazed with weariness the emotional trial in hildebrands office still searing his conscience what choice had he been given at what price had mowbray won some respite from his own horrors or had they only been scored more deeply into the mans tormented mind and was he a killer at all but only the victim as much as the dead woman in the paupers grave by the church hamish who disapproved of much that rutledge did holding him to the high standards of a man who was calvinist in heart and soul said when yere done feeling sorry for yoursel theres the ither woman with nae name and nae face what aboot her then what about her rutledge said mowbray couldnt have killed her he couldnt have made a practice of riding trains and murdering any woman with a passing resemblance to his dead wife and she was darkhaired not fair he suddenly lost patience with hamish what has she to do with margaret tarlton for gods sake aye thats the question but look if she has a part in this matter she deserves justice even if theres nae mp calling for answers tired to the bone rutledge said if weve cleared mowbray of killing his children and if weve shown that the dead woman is very likely margaret tarltonif miss napier has told the truth about recognizing that dressthen were back to the people who knew her best the napiers shaw the wyatts aye find that hat forebye and youll ha the answer you said that about the children rutledge said wearily and it wasnt enough he had reached his room but without any memory of walking into the inn or up the stairs or down the passage closing the door behind him he took off his coat and threw himself face down across the bed two minutes later hamishs complaints notwithstanding rutledge was deeply asleep where not even dreams could reach him the dark head on the pillow stirred once as the church bell struck the hour one arm moving to crook protectively around it and the other hand uncurling from the tight fist of tension you dont rutledge told himself over a late dinner lose your objectivity if you want to be a good policeman you learn to shut out the pain of others you learn to ask the questions that can break up a marriage set brother against brother or turn father against son willynilly to get at the truth but what was truth it had as many sides as there were people involved and was as changeable as human nature take margaret tarlton for one if you believed the stories told she was elizabeth napiers friend and confidante thomas napiers lover daniel shaws heartbreak and a reminder of simon wyatts glorious past when he was still destined for greatness a reminder to aurore wyatt that her husband was vulnerable to the blandishments of the napiers most murderers know their victims it could be one of those closest to heror it could be someone who had followed her from london it could be that by purest chance mowbray had come upon her and killed her just as theyd believed all along or take the workingclass woman who had died and been buried in a fallow field on the surface of it shed nothing to do with mowbray and very likely little to do with margaret tarlton was she then a red herring or was she the first victim of the same killer and how did you find the name and direction of a workingclass woman who hadnt been reported missing and who apparently had no connection with anyone in charlbury she could have come from londonportsmouthliverpool she could have come from the moon but he thought there might be one person who could tell him the next morning while hildebrand was busy interviewing elizabeth napiertiptoeing on eggshells as one of the constables put itrutledge drove back to charlbury in every village the one person who could be counted on to know every facet of the lives and failures of each parishioner was most often the rectors wife whereas in a town of any size it was usually the constable who could provide the smallest details about anyone on his patch rutledge called on mrs daulton henry answered the door and said shes in the back and rather too mucky i think to come inside im not much of a gardener myself he added and as if in explanation i always pull up the wrong things ill find her thank you mr daulton she was in her garden a shabby smock over her shirtwaist and skirt a kerchief around her head and what appeared to be her husbands old boots on her feet from the look of the boots shed been wading in mud at some point she was currently pruning the canes of a climbing rose that had grown too exuberantly that year her hair was pulled from its tidy bun by the thorns and there were scratches on her face she seemed to be thoroughly happy inspector she said when she looked up to find him striding down the path from the side of the house how thoughtful of you to come to me as you see we are our own gardeners here at the rectory straightening her back as if it hurt she added mind you i recollect the day when there were two gardeners and a lad to keep these grounds not that i stayed out of them even then she took off her gloves and extended her hand what can i do to help you rutledge smiled as he took her hand and said i need your knowledge of people and of one person in particular she looked at him straightly i will not help you put simon wyatt in prison for a crime hes innocent of i shant ask it of you rutledge promised no my interest is in a maid who vanished some time ago the body in the field she nodded i doubt its betty cooper but then you never know do you she set the gloves beside the trowel and the pruning shears in the barrow at her side come along then we can sit over there over there was a small rustic bench in the shade of a great ancient apple tree its branches bowed down with green fruit before them the beds and borders of the rectory garden spread out like a fan toward the house it was a pretty scene peaceful and quiet rutledge followed her and sat down beside her she sighed as if tearing her thoughts from the rosebush and bringing them to bear on what he wanted to hear i cant tell you much about the girl but enough perhaps for your purposes betty came to dorset during the war from a poor family near plymouth many girls went into war work of some sort omnibus conductors and the like mrs darley ran a large dairy farm and needed help betty was sent to her because the girl had some experience with animals and the work was to her liking or so i was told at any rate she pulled her weight until the end of the war and afterward asked mrs darley to give her some training as a parlor maid as i heard it betty didnt want to be a clerk in an office or a shopgirl she wanted to be the person who opened doors to guests and served tea thats a rather silly view maids do more than that but betty had aspirations you see and they included learning how to dress and how to speak properly and she was quite pretty it was only a matter of time before the lure of better prospects took her away mrs darley she ended dryly entertains less than stellar company shes a farmers wife not a society hostess rutledge was suddenly reminded of the farmers wife and daughter hed interviewed only days before who had been on the same train as mowbray no housemaid to a farm wife wouldnt appeal to an ambitious young woman out to make her fortune i suggested to simon that he take her on when he came back from france and brought aurore to charlbury he interviewed betty but there wasnt any money for a second girl and edith had been with simons father shes the cooks niece you see and wanted to stay on that refusal was the turning point for betty yes it was not a month later she was gone in the night slipping away with her belongings and not leaving so much as a note mrs darley would gladly have given her a reference was there a man in the picture he asked no mrs daulton said considering the possibility i think not betty had ambitions she might flirt with every man she met including our own constable truit but it was harmless she was hoping to do better than a farmers son at any rate as far as anyone knows thats the last news of betty cooper she smiled wryly i consider betty one of my failures you and i know very well what happens to most of the hopeful young women who go to london without references or prospects its a dreary end to ambitions isnt it theres no possibility of finding her there are too many like her in london if thats where she went theres no family in plymouth that im aware of no reason to go back there she smoothed the dirt from one palm the war gave girls so many new opportunities still i dont know that its a good thing to offer a glimpse of a new way of thinking and then snatch it back the minute the men come marching home from war what will they do these girls with a taste for independence betty had no other training to hear mrs darley tell it she was a cross between mata hari and the whore of babylon but no she had no skills she was pretty enough for dorset but i doubt shed attract all that much notice in london still who can say she might have settled somewhere and found happiness by now describe her if you would please mrs daulton considered for a moment very dark hair very white skinwhich made a striking combination as you can imagine i dont recall what color her eyes were blue at a guess slim but only of medium height i had a feeling she might run to plumpness in middle age the description came very close to the body theyd found but betty had left dorset months before the physical evidence pointed to a time of death she never came back youre quite sure of that she smiled if betty had come home like a beaten dog mrs darley would have shouted it to the world as vindication for dire predictions he said slowly i shall have to ask mrs darley to look at the body the smile vanished no i know how she feels about betty shed like to think the girl got her just deserts it wouldnt be an objective identification shes not vindictive but she was badly hurt by what she perceives as the girls callousness well it was a personal rejection of a sort wasnt it mrs darley offered betty the best she had and it wasnt good enough for the girl at least that was the way mrs darley felt her friends must see it someone has to tell us if the dead woman is betty cooper or not she took a deep breath and stood up ill do it just give me a moment to change into something cleaner you must think about it carefully he warned her it wont be a verypleasantexperience for you either she was bea no she said sharply cutting across his words dont tell me i can stand it better if i dont know how she suffered she turned to look at him are you reaching for straws inspector i have heardvarious accounts i assure you and none of them kindabout what was done yesterday im very glad those children were found alive but i think the methods used to be certain were rather cruel it would have been far more cruel to have hanged an innocent man she said it is no excuse all the same they arrived at the doctors surgery half an hour later rutledge had telephoned the police in singleton magna asking hildebrand to make the necessary arrangements there was a message waiting for him at the surgery im pursuing my own line of inquiry handle this yourself dr fairfield was distinctly cool but did as he was asked henry daulton had insisted that he come as well my mother will need me afterward he said simply i saw dead people in the war she wont like it all the same they made him wait outside in the spare scrubbed room mrs daulton was shown the articles of clothing first she looked at them then shook her head she was very white her lips drawn tightly together after a moment she said with some constraint in her voice no i dont recollect betty wearing anything like this while she worked for the darleys but then i wouldnt know her personal wardrobe or what she may have bought later im sorry thats not much help is it the musty smell of earth and death filled the air as the clothes were refolded and put away would you like a cup of tea the doctor asked solicitously before we go on my wife will be glad to have you step across to the house mrs daulton her eyes strayed to the white screen in one comer of the room id rather she cleared her throat with an effort id rather finish as quickly as possible she said if you dont mind as he led her forward and withdrew the screen she looked at rutledge with anxious eyes i tell myself this is no worse than comforting the dying or helping to lay out the dead the body had been made as presentable as possible which wasnt saying much even the sheet covering it seemed stark and horribly suggestive when it was drawn back joanna daulton gasped and seemed for an instant to cringe into herself then she recovered from what inner wells of strength rutledge couldnt tell but he felt only admiration she looked down at the battered face tatters of rotting flesh and yellowed bone the broken nose her eyes were wide observing careful then she shut her eyes reached out a hand and turned away rutledge took the trembling fingers and held them in his they were icy cold ithat might be betty she said shakily theresa resemblanceof a kind stillcould i have some air please rutledge transferred his grip to her arm and led her out into the main surgery while the doctor quietly drew the sheet back over the dead womans face mrs daulton took the chair rutledge drew away from the desk for her and sat down with a suddenness that told him she was close to fainting he thrust a waiting glass of cold water into her hand and said bracingly as he would have done to a raw recruit shaking with reaction after his first battle that was well done you were very brave and its over now no i wasnt mrs daulton said quietly after she had drank the water and rested for a moment i shall see that face in my nightmares for a very long time to come the sad thing is i appear to have been no help at all to you im sorry and to his astonishment she buried her face in her hands and began to cry rutledge delivered a subdued mrs daulton and her son to the rectory in charlbury and then after two other stops went back to singleton magna for his lunch he was sick of death and bodies and questions but there was no respite halfway through his meal there was a telephone call from london he expected it to be bowles complaining and demanding instead it was sergeant gibson inspector rutledge sir ive been doing some digging in gloucestershire looking for that tarlton woman no luck im afraid but ive come across a small bit of information that you might want to hear the cousins who live there are middleaged id say closer to forty than thirty theyve got a little boy of three or thereabouts proud as punch of him they are but one old gossip down the street tells me mrs tarltonthats the cousincouldnt have children it was the sorrow of her life and this is a miracle baby rutledge felt a ripple of excitement have you spoken to mrs tarltons physician aye i did that and he saidmind you he didnt like it one bitthat mrs tarlton had seen fit to go to yorkshire to have the lad he hadnt even known she was pregnant returned with her baby looking like the cat that ate the cream very pleased with herself indeed he didnt have the direction of the doctor whod delivered the boy didnt know if you ask me so i took it upon myself to look up the boys birth certificate very interesting reading that sarah ralston tarlton mother father listed as frederick c tarlton which is as it should be if the boys truly theirs i went next to the attending physician in york and he says mrs tarlton stayed in a rented house with her sisterinlaw an older woman her husband came several times to visit he waited rutledge said any description of him vague fits freddy right enough the doctor said they were there only a few months until mrs tarlton and of course the baby were fit to travel they were emigrating to canada he thought but ill be willing to wager that it was all a farce and our miss tarlton had a baby which she handed over to the cousins she wouldnt be the first young woman in london to slip up with some soldier but was it some soldier or was the child thomas napiers if the arrangements had been so carefully made from the start that link would be buried deepest napier had enemies they would like nothing better than to catch even the faintest whiff of scandal well done sergeant youre vastly underrated has anyone told you that i owe you a drink when i get back to london as to that sir rumor here says youve taken root in dorset there was a deep chuckle at the end of the line as gibson hung up interesting information or no hamish was saying whats it got tae do wi this business everythingor nothing rutledge said replacing the receiver it could give elizabeth napier a damned fine motive for murder or yon daniel shaw if he was to learn what happened or even thomas napier if he was tired of moral blackmail none of which accounted for the second body rutledge found himself restless unable to settle to any one thought or direction every time hed made any progress in this investigation he seemed to slip back into a morass of questions without answers he walked as far as the church yard then turned down a shaded lane that led past the back gardens of half a dozen houses before winding its way to the main road again the source of his restlessness was easy to identify the problem of betty cooper hed stopped at the darley farm on the way back to singleton magna to question mrs darley she had been bitter as joanna daulton had foretold i did my best by that girl i gave her a home i taught her to be a good maid and i would have helped her find a place when she was ready instead she walked away in the night without a thankyou or a goodbye whatever trouble she got into afterward is none of my concern she was a woman with thinning white hair and a harassed expression worn by years of hard work im sorry if shes got herself killed i wouldnt have wished that on her but a green girl goes to a place like london and shes likely to find trouble isnt she would she have been likely to come back to you for help if shed needed it hed asked if shed found herself in trouble the room was full of sunlight but there was a darkness in mrs darleys face shed have been sent away with a flea in her ear if she had i have no patience with these modern girls who dont know their place or their duty was there anyone she was close to in the neighborhood a man or a woman a maid at someone elses home women didnt much care for her she put on airs above herself she was as for men theyd come around as men will but she wouldnt give them the time of day either saving herself for better things she was well thats all right in its way but she had notions she shouldnt of when henry daulton came back from the war she said if he hadnt been wounded so bad shed have had a fancy for him then she met simon wyatt and she was all for finding herself a gentleman mr wyatt had interviewed her only as a favor to mrs daulton but she couldnt see that could she took it personal just because hed seen her himself rather than leaving her to his french wife she told you this rutledge asked surprised lord save us no i overheard her talking to one of the cowmen he was teasing her like and she said a gentleman didnt have dirt under his nails nor smell of sweat nor drink himself into a stupor of a saturday night and knew how to treat a lady much taken with mr wyatt she was she said hed gone and got himself a french wife but it wouldnt last he was home now and not in france thats when i came around the corner from looking at the cream pans and told her id not have talk like that under my roof my late husband didnt stand for that kind of sauciness and neither do i it wasnt more than ten days later if that long before she was gone and i havent seen her nor wanted to since i dont wish her harm no but some learn the hard way dont they rutledge also tracked down constable truit who hadaccording to joanna daultontried to court the dead woman he shook his head when rutledge began his questions inspector hildebrand asked me to have a look at the body when it was first brought in i couldnt see any likeness to betty miss cooper sleek as a cat she was sunning itself in the window not like this one thin cheap clothes and shoes not bettys style his confidence was solid convincing rutledge wondered if truit saw what he wanted to see or if this was a considered opinion all the same the answer contradicted mrs daultons tentative identification a dead end and yet if the dead woman was betty cooper shed come back to dorset someone had killed her when she did to silence her just as someone had killed margaret tarlton when she came back to charlbury for the first time since thats wild supposition hamish said but was it what did these two women have in common orto put it another way what threat had these two women posed that cost them their lives the common thread if there was one seemed to be simon wyatt and a savage beating that was the cause of death in both cases but it was as tenuous as gossamer that thread one tug to see where it might lead would snap it if elizabeth napier had killed her secretary because margaret had borne an illegitimate child to thomas napier it made no sense for her to have killed a serving girl months before if daniel shaw had killed margaret out of jealousy he had no motive to kill anyone else if the connection was simon wyatt then he rutledge was back to aurore or simon himsel hamish pointed out for yon bonny house and the money it will bring in thanking truit he found himself thinking with cold clarity that there was one way that simon wyatt might win on two fronts retrieve the money he needed so badly from margarets chelsea house and rid himself of his french wife leave her to hang for murder coming out of truits house he was waylaid by mrs prescott i dont see why you havent moved into the arms she told him youre in charlbury more often than the doctor or the priest by accident he said smiling she looked up at him pshaw its a pretty face bringing you back he could feel a flush rising margaret tarltons face wasnt pretty when her killer had finished thats what brings me back here did you have something to tell me mrs prescott nodded my brother now hes a good listener says his voice dried up the day after his wedding and hasnt been heard since but hes a great one for the gossip over a pint at the arms youd think he knew more about wood than any man alive wood his mind was only partly on what she was saying hes a carpenter like the lord only not liable to wind up on some of his own handiwork makes chests and bed frames over to stoke newton and hes the one told me about the body theyd found by leigh minster and youre here to tell me the identity of it no its not anyone i know not that miss tarlton if this ones already rotting nor yet anyone around charlbury that i can think of but it makes you wonder dont it if a womans safe these days out on the roads when i was a girl you could walk to lyme regis if youd cared to and not a thing to fear any part of the way i ask you again do you believe that man mowbrays to blame what do you think she tilted her head to look up at him against the sun i dont see this part of dorset is a likely place for murderers to congregate by the half dozen waiting their chances theyd be more like to die of boredom he said keeping his face grave are you saying the killer is a local manor woman i have a thought or two im working on she told him an undercurrent of seriousness changing her voice mind im not saying its the most likely way things happened only that i suppose it could have surprised he thought she was telling the truth rather than trying to tweak his interest id be careful who i told he warned her if its not mowbray safely locked away your thought or two might well make a killer very uncomfortable mrs prescott gave him a straight look im no fool she told him bluntly youre scotland yard and safe enough constable truit she added glancing over her shoulder at his house w a fool i hear the talk around this part of dorset only it doesnt go in one ear and out the other like that quilt i was telling you aboutbits and pieces bits and piecesthey add up have you got enough to baste together a whole story if you do id like to hear it she shook her head not yet no early days yet i just wanted you to know that i was working at it she smiled crookedly ive a fond spot for simon wyatt and i detest that hazel dixon id just as soon see her nose put out of joint shes one to cause trouble out of spite pure spite he said again id refrain from meddling if i were you i wont meddle she told him ill just listen thats all rutledge realized that his unguided steps had led him to the small surgery of dr fairfield the doctor was in and prepared to give him five minutes the coolness was still there but fairfield knew his duty and did it precisely theres only one question it wont take more than five minutes its about the body found here in singleton magnamrs mowbray or miss tarlton id like to know if that woman had borne children that was one of the first questions hildebrand asked me and yes she had at the time my answer provided additional evidence that she must be the mowbray woman whether it applies as well to margaret tarlton i cant say it may be that miss tarlton also had a child out of wedlock fairfield said im afraid medical science cant tell us whether the mother was wearing a wedding band or none at the time of birth and the body at leigh minster id say she hadnt it is harder to be sure given her time in the ground thats two questions he pulled out his watch and glanced at it rutledge took the hint as it was intended and left he found himself wishing he could interview thomas napier to test the theory of his involvement with margaret but rutledge knew what bowles would have to say to that request and napier himself might well refusehe had made a point of staying in the background except for what might be judged as reasonable concern for a young woman in his employ and still under his protection even his visits to bowless office could be construed as a man acting in the place of a father bowles would most certainly interpret it that way it made his own life simpler and easier the next best choice was thomas napiers daughter it was time to ask elizabeth napier a few blunt questions she was in the museum a pinafore over a pretty summer dress in blues and greens busily dusting the new shelves that had replaced the fallen ones rutledge greeted her and asked her to come for a walk with him out of the house and away from other ears somewhere he could hear the maid edith beating a carpet and aurores voice speaking to simon surprised elizabeth removed her pinafore and said i dont see the need for such secrecy ive nothing to hide but if you insistvery well they walked down toward the common and the pond a dog slept peacefully by the waters edge and ducks swam smoothly in small flotillas conducting loud conversations as they went rooks called in the trees and he could hear the blacksmiths hammer there was a bustle in charlburys streets the shops doing a brisk business but here it was quiet enough except for hamish muttering in the back of his mind you promised bowles youd no tread on toes he was reminding rutledge with vigor do you want to end your career on a political blunder someone had set a bench under a tree some ten feet from the pond and rutledge led elizabeth to it she inspected it then sat down leaving space for him to join her a light wind lifted the curls at the sides of her face giving her a vulnerable almost childlike quality as she turned expectantly toward him i want to ask you about margaret tarlton i find it helps if i understand the background of the victim not just where she came from but how she must have felt about those around her how she lived her life how she arrived at a time and place where someone believed she had to die it often brings me closer to finding the murderer i thought the police in singleton magna were satisfied that mowbray had killed her inspector hildebrand is not a man who changes his mind lightly mowbray is a strong possibility we cant overlook him the problem is so many pieces of this puzzle dont fit together properly and that tells me that ive yet to fill the empty spaces between them it seemed to me that youd rather not have the wyatt household hear what im about to ask you he was choosing his words carefully aware that she might leave when he finally got to the point ive nothing to hide from simon no but your father might ive heardfrom a number of sourcesthat your father was more than fond of margaret he was very likely in love with her she turned to face him her eyes bright her face shocked who on earth has told you such lies are they lies he asked gently apparently watching the ducks my father is very fond of margaret youve known that from the start as for love i dont believe hes paid more than polite attention to any woman since my mothers death sometimes a daughter is the last to know a fathers feelings no you dont quite see what im telling you my mother was very important to him and ive done what i could to fill her place but superficially i sit at the head of his table i entertain his guests i attend public functions with him and i spend hours with very dull women who must be handled with the greatest care because either their husbands opinions or their money carries weight my father is a man who keeps his emotions tightly locked inside he hasnt spoken my mothers name since the day he buried her im well aware that men have physical needs but for all i know my father buried those with my mother too for all you know he repeated no inflecton in his voice since her death ive never seen him show affection even to me in public he doesnt touch people if he can avoid it he doesnt care to be touched whatever natural human contacts there are he accepts but doesnt encourage to margaret he was kind considerate and protective as he was of me he told me once that she had no family to speak of and he felt responsible for her as long as she resided under our roof he saw to it when she was required to spend time on his affairs that she was properly escorted home afterward i daresay any man of breeding would have done the same she stopped in the silence that followed he thought about what she had said if she was lying she was practiced at it he considered mentioning the child and decided against it it was a tenuous charge and right or wrong could hurt a goodly number of innocent people but if sergeant gibsons information was correct thomas napier now had a son to put in his daughters place very well you believe that your father has no more than a natural fondness for margaret lets turn the coin over was she fond of him of course she was hes a man who engenders loyalty and thats not a daughters blind assessment you can ask anyone who knows him well miss napier margaret lived with you for five or six years no if margaret was in love with my father she successfully kept it from me and very likely from him as well she was ambitious i grant you but she also understood that scandal of any kind was political fodder margaret was very like my father you know not a woman who wore her heart on her sleeve the pair of them would make very dull lovers and yet shaw had said he saw passion hot and raw in napiers eyes why had miss tarlton chosen to leave your employ ive been given several reasons for her decision but id very much like to hear the truth elizabeth shrugged she wanted a change the museum reminded her of india possibly or she was tired of london she carefully concealed her indian background miss napier i dont believe she would elect to come here to charlbury and open that door again nor was dorset likely to foster an ambitious young womans prospects i think you persuaded her to come to give yourself an excuse to call on simon wyatt from time to time im sure thats why you felt some sense of guilt when you were told margaret was dead i wouldnt but you would youve come now yourself and youre staying a foot in the door still your motives arent important what matters is why margaret agreed to your scheme was she happy for an excuse to break her ties with you to leave london and to put some distance between herself and your father or if she wanted to marry him she must have realized that he wouldnt ask her as long as she was a nobody your secretary vulnerable to cruelties from women who took pleasure in reminding her of her place even moving to another house hadnt changed that she was as she put it herself still a servant he smiled to take some of the sting from his words she wouldnt be the first woman to feel that leaving him might make up a mans mind for him he was already jealous he knew that captain shaw was living here he must have told her he was afraid shed rekindle that old romance that shaw might persuade her that a ring on her finger was better than the shadowy life of a mistress nonsense elizabeths face was flushed with anger youve twisted the truth to fit your own muddled evidence she was never my fathers mistress rutledge turned to her i dont intend to embarrass you or your father miss napier i simply want the truth so that i can sort out the rest of this tangle and find miss tarltons killer and i think i have found the truth finally elizabeth got up her skirts brushing against him as she turned to go id like very much to know who gave you this information you said a number of sources was that true or simply a euphemism yes it was true ive heard it from enough sources that i have no choice but to believe it she frowned mentally running down a list of possible names he could see her mind at work then she smiled well it doesnt matter my father is safe isnt he either way if margaret is dead and it wasnt i was it who drove margaret to the station that last morning good day inspector he watched her walk on toward the inn her stride graceful her bearing giving her that aura of royal dignity that made up for inches but he thought his eyes on her straight back that she was upset as if hed touched a rawness in her that bled inside rutledge considered the possibility that whatever the stationmaster might have said margaret tarlton reached singleton magna and elizabeth napier met her there offering to drive her on to sherborne and killed her along the road to put an end to any connection between margaret and thomas napier but that brought him around again to the question of who drove margaret to singleton magna he was beginning to believe he knew if it hadnt been aurore in the wyatt motorcar it might have been simon in spite of mrs dixons certainty that aurore was driving it was the vehicle and not the occupants shed seen he was persuaded of that by his own instincts and the womans vehemence but why would simon kill margaret tarlton or anyone else why would aurore be terrified that he might have it was on the way back to his car that he halted by the smithy and stood thinking intently for several minutes as he watched the activity around him people going about their own business moved past him with curiosity in their eyes nodding but not pausing to speak to him he was the bringer of misfortune in a sense they wouldnt ignore him completely but there was no warmth in their faces as they went on the sooner he left the sooner life in charlbury could return to normal as in a way it already had in spite of police activity in the neighborhood in spite of the discovery of another body some distance away no one had been murdered in charlbury itself and no one had been arrested in the village the initial shock had begun to wear off and with it some of the tension that explained the activity on the street he found that very interesting if aurore was guilty then the village had not lost one of its own the stranger could be taken away grief would disrupt simon wyatts life for a time but the familiar face of elizabeth napier was assurance perhaps that he wouldnt grieve for long all would be as it had been hamish wary noticed her first rutledge became aware that someone was speaking his name and turned to see a woman standing beside him casting a look over her shoulder as if afraid that she might be seen with him she was a plump woman attractive in a way but with the small mouth and narrow eyes of a spiteful nature her dark hair was pinned up with an effort at style and she was wearing a very becoming summer dress he thought if she smiled she might even be pretty yes what can i do for you he asked giving her his full attention my name is marian forsby i only wanted to tell you that i havent seen anything that might help you with your inquiries but i thought perhaps she paused casting another look around her he said this is a very public place mrs forsby may i offer you a cup of tea at the wyatt arms he smiled some of the forbidding harshness of his thoughts vanishing with it gratefully she accepted and in a very few minutes they were ensconced under the trees where he had talked with aurore a pot of tea in front of them mrs forsby poured it delicately and served him with a practiced air of gentility but her workroughened hands told him otherwise would the women of charlbury have been any kinder to margaret tarlton than they had been to aurore or perhaps margaret had expected to be here for a very short time there was no one else in the back garden yet mrs forsby still had an air of looking over her shoulder even without turning her head as if every nerve ending were attuned to movement around them i am married to harold forsby who owns the ironmongers shop we have a house just up the way from there she said busying herself with her cup so that she didnt have to meet his eyes ive been concerned for some timeyou see im often occupied with the childrentheyre four and eight very active they are which has made for some difficulties between myself and my husband her cheeks flushed but she went on resolutely into his interested silence he wasnt sure where this was leading but a policeman quickly learned that patience was a valuable tool i dont quite know how to say this inspector but hazel dixon mentioned that you were interested in mrs wyatts activities i thought it best to speak to you myself since i was in a position to tell you some things others might not have thought it necessary to pass on mrs wyatt iswell to put it bluntly she is a woman who attracts the eye of a man and she knows it very french she is and that does seem to add to her appeal that slight accent and the way she dresses well i can only imagine what her relationship is with her husband but a woman who is promiscuous often has a veryerjealous nature she doesnt like competition im sure thats why she persuaded him to give up standing for parliament and take on this silly museum of his such a waste wouldnt you say weve had wyatts representing us for ever so many years hes so suitable for the task promiscuous he asked moving directly to the key word oh yes i cant imagine that any decently behaved woman would attract so much attention to herself if she was notwell of that nature she cant be ignorant of the looks cast her way a married woman neither invites nor encourages such bold notice its neither proper nor genteel and with mr wyatt so busy with this museum of his he hasnt taken steps to put a stop to it her mouth tightened until the lips were a thin short line the third stone was being cast at aurore what has this to do with my investigation mrs forsby he tried to keep the anger out of his voice picking up his cup and burning himself with the scalding tea he realized that there was no sugar no cream in his setting it down he remedied that courteously waiting for mrs forsby to answer if i were a woman like that she said after a moment and another very pretty woman came into my household i shouldnt like it i suppose its a natural jealousy in someone who prefers to be the center of attention at home as well as in the neighborhood the talk was theyd find a male assistant for mr wyatt someone from one of the colleges mrs wyatt would have preferred that im quite sure another besotted male in the house it might have kept her from straying farther afield at least for a time but it didnt turn out that way did it are you telling me that aurore wyatt has taken lovers in charlbury she put down her own cup and said i dont know about lovers inspector i cant speak for mrs wyatt i thinkat the momentthat its probably her deep need for male attention but you know where that leads in the long run ive seen the way harold looks when she comes into the shop and ive seen denton at the arms and bill dixon and even constable truit hanging on every word she utters their faces wreathed in silly smiles their eyes avid and god alone knows whats going through their minds it may not be true adultery yet but its only a matter of time shell tire of their admiration and want more no i dont think mrs wyatt would have liked to see competition under her roof and im sure if you dont act soon something will very likely happen to miss napier as well im not suggesting that it will but one must do ones duty before something terrible happens and not in hindsight well there you have it it was a tangle of jealousy and envy with no reason behind it but a womans need to retaliate to strike out at the interloper are you saying that i should arrest mrs wyatt for murder on what evidence and the murder of whom she lifted an impatient hand miss tarlton of course mrs dixon swears she saw mrs wyatt in the car driving miss tarlton to singleton magna im sure shes not the only one to notice the car if the truth be told and ive just explained to you why i believe mrs wyatt could have done such a terrible thing i dont speak up lightly inspector i came to you after considerable thought and prayer but if a person breaks one of the commandments it isnt such a great step from breaking others is it but youve no proof that mrs wyatt has betrayed her husband she smiled tightly then drank her tea what proof do you need if that woman they found just the other day is betty cooper then you ought to consider that mr wyatt was thinking of taking her on as a second maid edith is rather plain but betty had a way with her mrs wyatt wouldnt have liked her about the house flaunting herself it was not long afterward that betty disappeared no one remarked it at the time but its very likely she met the same fate the woman found at stoke minster has been dead for only three months or so betty cooper left dorset long before that did she she left mrs darley right enough she may even have gone to london for a time but in the end she came back didnt she and wanted that job mr wyatt had promised her if she came to the wyatt door on ediths day off and mrs wyatt answered what do you think could have happened it was an interesting theory let me get this straight he said if mrs wyatt has as you say an eye for the men in charlbury why should she object if her husband took a fancy to margaret tarlton or betty cooper i should think that would provide mrs wyatt with more opportunity to indulge in her own affairs but i just told you mrs forsby said she wants to hoard them all mr wyatt my harold any man with eyes in his head to see hereven you ive watched her with her hand on your arm smiling up at you like miss innocence herself even a london inspector from scotland yard is fair game for that one she finished her tea her face pink with a sense of righteous triumph mrs wyatt got her hands on mr wyatt in the war even when he was engaged to miss napier its not right its not proper and if she had no respect for a man already promised to someone else then she wont let marriage vows stop her it was hamish who put the thought into his head that aurore wyatt had escaped a warravaged country by marrying simon did you or anyone else see betty cooper after she disappeared six months ago did anyone see her come back to charlbury hearsay wont do we need hard evidence the body wasnt found in this village after all it could be unrelated to margaret tarltons death it may not have anything to do with aurore wyatt she touched her lips with the serviette in her lap and folded it neatly before laying it beside her empty cup nobody said she was a fool and shed have to be to leave bodies lying about on her own doorstep what i ask myself is who else had any call to harm betty cooper or this miss tarlton can you tell me that no i didnt think so and wheres it ail to stop i ask you rutledge walked with her to the door of the wyatt arms denton nodded to him as he passed but daniel shaw was nowhere to be seen mrs forsby was still talking about how difficult it had been to come forward as if she wanted his reassurance that shed done the right thing but the air of triumph was still there he thanked her and watched her walk back the way shed come with a neck stiff with righteousness beneath her summery hat but hamish was pointing out with some force that aurore had tried her charms on him and it had worked you canna fault a woman like yon for wanting her own back on the foreigner who takes her husbands eye when she has a husband of her own he was angry all the same defensive for aurores sake surely wyatt had some inkling of the feelings that were rampant in charlbury or was the man so blinded by his own pain that he couldnt see what was happening youre no her champion hamish reminded him youre a lonely man whos lost the one woman he thought cared for him you see the loneliness in her and it turns your head but its no the sameyour jean walked away and is marrying anither man in your place yon woman already has a husband im not in love with her no hamish said thoughtfully id no say you were but she can pull the strings and you dance like a puppet at the end of them because shes hurting as much as you are and like calls to like its no love but it can light fires all the same in a man rutledge swore and told hamish he was a fool but he knew that aurore cast spells except over her husband whatever hed felt for his wife in france when hed married her it was quite different now and for all he rutledge knew of it aurore herself had changed as much as simon had that was the centerpiece of their marriagechangeand it might not have been all on one side if aurores marriage was empty she might well be frightened of other women catching simons eye if simon neglected her she might well be driven to having an affair to point out to him that others wanted very badly what he chose to cast off which might explain why the husbands of charlbury were besotted and the wives were prepared to see aurore wyatt hang if it took her away from there rutledge was halfway to his car when he saw hildebrand coming out of the wyatt house the singleton magna inspector saw him as well and signaled rutledge to wait when he reached the car there was a nasty gleam in hildebrands eyes for a moment he studied rutledge and then said well you can pack your bags tonight and leave for london in the morning ive got the tarlton murder solved without the help of the yard i might add youve been precious little help from the start come to that solved that means an arrest then of course it does keep my ear to the ground thats what i do truit tells me what he doesnt tell youwell no reason why he should is there you were here to find the children and theyve been found havent they he was gloating his face gleaming with it his manner offensive but just short of insulting he paused to let rutledge respond thats good news he answered hildebrand still waited and when rutledge had nothing more to add went on with malicious pleasure im having a search warrant brought well find the murder weapon and that suitcase you were so fond of throwing in my face and when we do ill have my murderer ever seen a woman hang delicate necks over swiftly rutledge felt cold not sure whether hildebrand was telling him the truth or trying to rouse him to anger stop beating about the bush hildebrand he held up a square hand the back of it toward rutledge and began to tick off the points bending down each finger as he went witnesses saw mrs wyatt driving the victim to singleton magna even though she denies it mrs wyatt wasnt happy about the tarlton woman coming here jealousy im told mrs wyatt could wash up after the murder at that farm of the wyatts and nobody was the wiser handyman didnt see her leave and didnt hear her return thats where she tucked the murder weapon and probably the suitcase as well out of sight into the hay or under one of the sheds whod notice a worn spanner or an old hammer in that yard full of rusting junk why did you change your mind rutledge forced himself to ask i thought you were convinced that mowbray had killed margaret tarlton mistaking her for his wife i was fairly sure of that given the evidence but we found something else interesting today i sent one of my men to gloucestershire where the tarlton womans relatives live they were that upset to hear she was dead not just missing they asked my sergeant if shed left a will and he was smart enough to go to london to find out lawyer wouldnt let him see it but miss tarlton had left everything to her young godson the cousins child we got that much out of the old fool and her house to simon wyatt theres the motive right there miss napier mayve thought she was engaged to wyatt but she wasnt the only string to his bow must have put both their noses out of joint when he came home with that french wife and must have put his wifes nose out of joint when she discovered his mistress was coming to live with them i dont think rutledge began through the clamor hamish was raising in his head you arent paid to think hildebrand said unconsciously quoting old bowels youre paid to find murderers stay out of my way until this is finished im warning you he strode off marching purposefully toward the car waiting for him at truits house watching him go rutledge swore hildebrand had hardly passed from view on his way back to singleton magna when the napier car came down the same road making for the inn rutledge assumed it was benson going to fetch elizabeth napier then realized that there was a man seated beside him the car pulled up in front of the inn and rutledge saw benson pointing in his direction bensons passenger nodded and got down walking toward rutledge the distinguished face the trim beard the broad shoulders told him at once that this was thomas napier napier said as soon as he was within hearing inspector rutledge thats right rutledge had been in his car on the point of leaving but killed the engine and got down to take the hand napier held out to him thomas napier from london is there any place where we can speak privately he asked looking around that bench over there by the pond i think he went on unconsciously choosing the place where rutledge had questioned his daughter the ducks had gone leaving the surface of the pond like a mirror reflecting the sky they walked in silence in that direction and rutledge let the older man choose his own time his own words but curiosity was rampant and the tension in the other man had stirred hamish into questing life i dont trust that fool hildebrand napier began miss tarltons solicitor called me today he said that one of hildebrands people had come to ask about margarets will theres a clause in it that could cause a good deal of trouble for a good many innocent people margarets memory as well ive spoken to superintendant bowles and im not overly impressed by him either they had reached the bench and napier sat down scanning rutledge from head to foot you look like the sensible sort in the war were you yes rutledge answered obeying napiers gesture and taking the other end of the bench i was the words were more curt than hed meant hmm then i daresay youll understand when i tell you that simon wyatt is a man living on the edge as it were hes my godson i care deeply about him the war came damned close to breaking his spirit and he hasnt been able to recover the balance of his mind ive not encouraged him to stand for office ive felt that he was probably better off working on this museum of his finding his feet again in his own good time dorset is quiet a healing place as i know myself the tone of voice was fatherly concerned it was as if the rupture caused by simons marriage to aurora had never occurred i understand but i dont see that this is important enough to bring you from london to tell me simon may not know some of the terms of margarets will they may need explanation but they have nothing to do with this murder and they have nothing to do with margarets affairs simons father was kind enough to arrange a loan for her when she needed it and that was that he wasnt involved with her in any way he simply felt that she deserved a measure of independence and helped provide it you never knew margaret but she was a very able young woman very charming very attract his voice broke and for several seconds he fought for control she was all that a man might want in his daughter he ended lamely i would have done the same for her if shed asked me but she no doubt felt it was improper since she lived in my house it was the sort of arrangement that could have political repercussions and she was astute politically unsafe for youbut safe enough for simons father napier turned to look at him dont be purposely obtuse no rutledge answered all right then you dont want wyatt to know why the house is left to him but thats out of my hands hildebrand is going for a search warrant for wyatts farm he apparently believes aurore wyatt killed miss tarlton because she was under the impression that miss tarlton and wyatt had had an affair that simon wyatt bought the chelsea house and that simon wyatt might well be the father of the child miss tarlton bore she could hardly want his mistress moving in with them it was a mixture of fact and fiction but rutledge was interested to see how well this balloon flew and what reaction it provoked he might have only this one opportunity to confront napier the expression on napiers face was a mixture of shock and horror how do you know all this about the child and why should aurore wyatt know of it it wasnt simons he was away at war was it his fathers god no whatever you think about margaret tarlton i assure you she then who was its father daniel shaw you im not interested in miss tarltons child im only interested in what bearing it might have on her murder the child is deadit was born dead it has no bearing on anything there was an undercurrent of wild grief behind the defensive words a wrenching pain mr napier if hildebrand learns of it it could send a woman to the gallows it gives her a clear motive dont you see that to kill a suspected rival no ive met aurore wyatt several times she isnt my concern she can take care of herself shes clever and resourceful and strong simon is very vulnerable whatever this fool hildebrand is trying to do hes wrong i think margaret was the unwitting victim of that poor sod theyve got in the jail at singleton magna theres no more nor less to it than that what i want from you is the assurance that my daughterand simon wyattwont be dragged through the newspapers on the whim of an incompetent policeman mr napier i dont believe bert mowbray killed miss tarlton i think that her murder was no accident it was a deliberate attack on her personally and i suspect that there has been another murder of a young woman some months ago how theyre related i cant say at the moment do you believe simon is guilty of either of them no why should i but one of them might be set at the door of his wife possibly both as to that i cant tell you then find the answers damn you i came to warn you that i dont want my daughters name dragged into this im taking her back to sherborne at once and i dont want to read about simon in the papers either nor about that house in chelsea nor about any child that might or might not have been born rutledge said margaret tarltons murderer has covered his tracks quite cleverly still theres an answer somewhere ferreting it out may open the wyatts to speculation and some scandal ill avoid that if i can ive always tried to shield the innocent but in the end there may be nothing either of us can do to protect them the other woman who may have died by the same hand im not concerned with another woman i want you to stop this fool hildebrand from walking in heavy boots through the life of a man who is very easily destroyed personally professionally do you hear me if any of this touches simon wyatt ill hold you personally responsible ill see to it that you suffer the consequences i want this business cleared up without damaging simon or margaret i want margarets killer hanged and i dont want any foulness from this affair touching my daughter in any way you would do well to believe me inspector i am a man who never makes idle threats napier got to his feet and stood looking down at rutledge whatever he read in the other mans face he changed his tactics abruptly theres that fellow shaw he said roughly he was in love with her in the war and hes still in love with her for all i know if mowbray didnt kill her then shaw probably did find out and make an end to it rutledge felt himself welling with anger as napier walked away napier had protected his own he hadnt cared about anyone else he had willingly sacrificed mowbray he had callously abandoned aurore to the mercy of the police even daniel shaw was expendable politicians made difficult decisions napier was used to sacrificing one good for another but this was ruthlessness walking away from the pond rutledge toyed for a moment with the possibility that napier had killed margaret himself out of jealousy or anger at her refusal to carry on with an affair that she may have considered in the end was taking her nowhere but napier was too well known in dorseteven whispers of his involvement would ruin him this was possibly what drove him harder than his concern for simon wyatt if hed wanted margaret dead surely hed have killed her anywhere but here by the same token to be fair napier had been unable to show his grief his love his loss in public he had had to stand aside and let strangers bury margaret turning whatever it was he felt inward to fester and rankle he may have made his threats out of love for her rather than any fear for simon they were still threats and rutledge took them very seriously its no in your hands hamish reminded him whatever napier has said but either way yere sacrificed as well not if i can help it rutledge said as he turned the crank and brought the car to sputtering life he got in and drove to the wyatt farm his mind full of hamish if you no can finish this business youll be back in yon hospital crouched in a dark corner of your soul its got to be finished look you and not for the womans sake for your own jimson was working in the yard mending the wheel on a barrow his gnarled hands deftly shifting the shaft to bring the worn place within reach he didnt look up until rutledges shadow fell across his shoulder and onto the dirtstained wood of the long handles lord you know how to startle a man jimson said straightening up and dropping the shaft now look what youve done he went on in an aggrieved voice his face twisting to see rutledge against the brightness of the sun i need your help rutledge said i cant go to your master or your mistress the police from singleton magna are coming soon with a search warrant but i want to go through the house and the barn now before they get here will you walk with me whatre you looking for then whats the police after a suitcase belonging to a dead woman a pretty hat a murder weapon pshaw theres no pretty hat here nor suitcases i dont know about if its a murder weapon you want take your pick he gestured to the array of tools lying in the dust at his feet any one of those will kill a man hammer a spanner a pair of clamps all of themhe was rightpotential weapons but rutledge shook his head no not these then what jimson demanded that stone a length of wood i dont know all right well forget the weapon for the time being the suitcase well search first for that what does it look like then mrs wyatt she has suitcases in the attic i dont know i tell you if i did i wouldnt be here look this is useless jimson i need to walk through that house i need to see for myself whats in the barn hildebrand and truit will be here in the morning truit is it jimson demanded incensed well see about that all right then the front doors open and i can see it from here touch anything that dont need touching and ill know it rutledge thanked him and walked around to the door it was unlocked as it had been before thinking about that rutledge opened it wider and stepped into the hall where the stairs rose to the first floor to his left and right were a pair of rooms opening into the broad hallway he gave them a cursory glance certain that they would hold no secrets the floors creaked as he moved about but jimson wouldnt hear that the old mans bedroom was in the back to one side of the kitchen and appeared to have been a maids room at one time for there were roses on the wallpaper and the iron bed had a floral design at its head the lamp was serviceable as were the chair the stool and a table the washstand was oak and had seen better times the mirror cloudy with age a jug of water stood on a second table by the bed and there was a pipe rack next to it with a tin of tobacco beside it from the look of the pipes none of them had been smoked for years but the aroma of turkish tobacco lingered and stirred when rutledge moved one or two upstairs were several bedrooms and a pair of bathrooms one of the rooms had a rocking chair beside a marbletopped washstand with fresh towels on the racks on either side a pitcher of water in the bowl clothes hung in the closet mostly coveralls and worn mens shirts that must have been simons at one time but carried aurores scent now a pair of straw hats stood on the closet shelf one of them with a hole in the brim the other with a sweatstained band the room had an intimate feel to it as if shed just left the candlestick on the bedside table was burned down to half he wondered if sometimes shed spent the night here the bedsheets were soft with age but freshly washed the other rooms bore the signs of neglect a fine sheen of dust on the furniture a cobweb hanging down above a bedpost but clean enough for all that no one had been in these rooms he thought for months the attic was filled with bits and pieces of old furniture leather luggage green with age chairs without seats broken lamps a childs crib and a nursing rocker he looked into corners behind the headboards of beds beyond the empty trunks into the empty cases and there was nothing to be seen in the end he gave up and went to the barn quartering it while a cat followed him about rubbing against his trouser legs when he stopped to look at a box of gear or a stack of tiles or old boots crammed into a bin but the barn yielded nothing and he stood there in the loft looking at the thick piles of hay wondering if it was worth his while to dig through the lot hamish tired and irritable said youll no solve the riddle here and it was true but he made the effort to look into the outbuildings and into overturned carts startling a hen with a clutch of eggs under one she squawked sharply at him dashing off with wings flapping when he came back to where jimson was finishing his work on the barrow the old man said well you wanted to do it didnt you and for what you havent found what you was looking for no he turned to look at the sky the sun was sinking toward the west casting long shadows and golden stripes across the lawn and the fields behind the barn it would be dark quite soon seven or eight heavily uddered cows were staring at him from the gate near the milking shed and he could hear the lowing of others making their slow way home jimson wheeled the barrow toward the barn rutledge called his thanks but remembered that the man couldnt hear his voice couldnt hear a car or footsteps in the house at night he found himself wondering if aurore might have entertained lovers there feeling depressed he got back into the car and drove to charlbury at least hamish offered you did na find anything i was one man hildebrand will bring half a dozen more henry daulton was standing by the churchyard his eyes on the rooks wheeling above the truncated tower settling uneasily for the night he waved as rutledge passed then mrs prescott was hailing him and he stopped the car i hear that theres to be an arrest tomorrow that inspector hildebrand is coming to do it himself i thought you were in charge the man from london no its his investigation i came to coordinate the search for the children thats finished he felt tired his eyes gritty from the dusty barn and the staleness of the farms attics but what about mr simon whats to happen to him i dont know nothing he isnt the person hildebrand is after why would anyone want to kill betty cooper she demanded much less a friend of the wyatts it makes no sense thats what you ought to be saying to the police in singleton magna why would the wyatts want to harm her if you want to save mrs wyatt from the gallows and her husband from a death of grief thats the question you ought to be asking rutledge shook his head ive asked that question and found no answer if you have any im willing to hear them besides no one can be sure that the other body is betty coopers the timing isnt there mrs prescott whatever you want to believe betty left six months ago not three she was vehement her face ablaze with purpose i told you once if you want to hide the recent dead do it in a fresh grave betty cooper wanted to work in a gentlemans house mr simon couldnt hire her he already had edith i cant see that hed have sent her away emptyhanded not mr simon hed have done what he could for the girl for mrs daultons sake have you even asked him what they talked about those two rutledge stared at her and she grinned selfconsciously no he said slowly i dont think anyone has well id not let it linger on the tongue too long or that inspector hildebrand will be back tomorrow with his warrants he saluted her and backed up the car until he was in front of the wyatt gate he met elizabeth at the front door her face anguished she caught his arm and dragged him into the parlor shutting the door for gods sake whats happening no one will tell me aurore is in her room i think shes crying simon has shut himself up in the museum and wont let me in and my father was here in charlbury i saw him speaking to you but he wouldnt come to the house he just sent benson with a note telling me to leave straightaway that madman hildebrands to blame isnt he it all went wrong when he came for gods sake whats it all about i dont know hildebrand has finally convinced himself that mowbray didnt kill margaret tarltonwe were all fairly certain of that it isnt news but if mowbray didnt kill her then it has to be someone from charlbury you see and it was aurore wyatt who was set to take margaret tarlton to meet the train aurore she said the name unconsciously as if tasting it on her tongue youre saying that it was aurore but why i dont know there are several theories making the rounds it seems shes become the popular candidate now that mowbrays out of the running but simon will feel responsible it was simon who wanted margaret to come here as his assistant no rutledge answered bluntly it was your scheming that brought her here to interview for the position of assistant but what about that man shaw she demanded frantically he was wild with margaret for not seeing him he taunts me every time i go into the wyatt arms i cant imagine aurore battering anyone to death but shaw could do it hes been a soldier he knows how to kill knowing how to kill doesnt make you a murderer he told her but he had killed his share of men in the war was that so very different he could feel hamish asking that same question in the depths of his mind simon was also a serving officer if daniel shaw is suspect because of his war record we mustnt forget simon wyatt stop it do you hear me simon hasnt killed anyone id believe aurore did it before id believe simon could have ive never understood her i cant think why he ever married her cant you do anything cant you find out what it is hildebrand wants there was a pounding at the door that cut short his response elizabeth said something under her breath and went to answer it from where he was standing he could see the heavy door swing open at the same instant a slurred angry voice cried i want to know damn you i want to know who killed her it was shaw standing there his face white his body tense with pain youre drunk disgusting go away elizabeth said curtly preparing to close the door in his face behind him the night was black clouds having moved in with the sunset and now obscuring the stars somewhere in the garden a toad sang its mating call and a moth swept through the bright square of light cast across the lawns shaw struck the door with his arm forcing it open again and stepped inside rutledge moving swiftly from the parlor was there to meet him at elizabeths back he said go home shaw i told you id give you a name once it was certain but it isnt certain hildebrand has jumped the gun truits in the arms bragging theyre prepared to make an arrest damn you he stared over elizabeths head at rutledges face pain in his eyes that wasnt all from the pain in his body im not drunk i want the truth wait by my car and ill tell you what i know rutledge said if you dont go ill have you arrested for disorderly conduct shaw bit his lip against the pain and said ill wait here on the step i dont think i could walk that far he stepped backward nearly lost his balance and sat heavily on the step crouched protectively over his wound elizabeth said you are drunk rutledge caught her arm and pulled her from the door as he shut it she turned on him saying the wolves are gathering listen to me this can matter more than your wolves does the name betty cooper mean anything to you something stirred in her eyes curiosity calculation he couldnt be sure in the dim light that reached the hall from the parlor she was a serving girl if thats the one you mean simon suggested we might consider finding her a place in london wed lost two of the younger maids to other positions he must have known and so he sent her to you from here well we expected her to come to us on a trial basis but she never arrived i dont see what this has to do with anything there isnt time when was that nearly six months ago just after simon came back from france and opened the house here in charlbury thats not important i tell you yes it is he answered her if betty cooper didnt arrive at your door where did she go and why hadnt she taken up simons proposal that she work for the napiers it was a position beyond the dreams of a country girl who wanted to make her way in london nor did it explain why the body was only three months dead mrs prescott was wrong his questions led him nowhere how should i know girls go to london every day i cant be responsible for the fate of any of them but what if betty had gone to london after all avoided the napiers for whatever reasons spent three months there in the city found it not to her liking and come back to dorset that was possiblebut was it likely that in coming back shed meet her death here before anyone had seen her unless her return threatened someone but that wouldnt take into account the fate of margaret tarlton the two women had nothing in common there was a connection somewhere there had to be or else they were all wrong mowbray had killed margaret and betty cooper was a separate crime altogether there was only the doctors suggestion that the murders were similar he was aware of elizabeth expostulating telling him she wanted him to help simon to do something before hildebrand made a grave mistake he put his hands on her shoulders to silence her and said look ive got to go but ill be back before hildebrand comes tomorrow is that fair enough fair she began but he was already out the door speaking to shaw giving him the same promise shaw getting stiffly to his feet stared balefully at elizabeth and turned to move awkwardly down the walk to the gate over his shoulder he said to rutledge i cant fight you now but if you dont come to the inn by midnight im taking matters into my own hands do you hear me i hear you rutledge said and then can you make it on your own damn you i dont want your pity i want answers rutledge watched him go and waited until elizabeth unsatisfied finally closed the front door upstairs at one of the windows overlooking the walk he could sense aurores eyes on him he walked to the museum wing and knocked on the door when no one answered in the end rutledge opened it and walked inside he looked carefully through all the rooms but it was to no purpose simon wyatt was in none of them though the door from that wing into the main house was locked rutledge stood in the middle of the front room of the museum mocked by the shadowed masks on the wall and the dancing shades of small gods with their strange faces and contorted bodies hamish too was mocking him reminding him that hildebrand was ahead of him that hed been dragging his feet that the arrest made tomorrow was one he couldshouldhave made before this only he hadnt been able to bring himself to it youre faltering youre no the man you think you are he couldnt think he couldnt bring all the pieces together like the gods on the shelves he was twisting and turninggoing nowhere but what was the connectiondamn it where was it what had he missed he walked out of the museum and closed the door behind him and where was simon wyatt he went out of the gate and stood looking around him making sure that shaw wasnt loitering in the shadows waiting for another chance to confront the wyatts which was why he saw the movement among the trees by the church he walked that way taking his time certain that it was simon blacked out again by whatever stress it was that drove him to wander in the night his wifes guilt was that what had taken simon back to the war where death was imminent and wiped out pain memory thought he reached the trees where the shadows were deeper where only the pale reflection of clothing showed that someone waited rutledge hesitated unwilling to startle simon unwilling to give away his own presence if it was someone else he walked on softly battle trained but the voice that came to him out of the darkness was not simons nor was it shaws aurore said i hoped you would come i couldnt say this in the house not with elizabeth there i couldnt do that to simon i wont shame him again he could see her now the lightcolored sweater shed thrown over her dark dress was a luminous mantle about her shoulders her face was even paler a white oval with dark hollows for eyes as he came nearer he could sketch in the details of eyebrows lips the curve of her hair the line of her cheekbone he could smell her scent faint and warm like her breathing where is your husband do you know hes in the museum he has locked me out hes taking it very hard the things hildebrand has said to him he thinks he will see me arrested tomorrow yes i know but hildebrand hasnt told anyone else the story is everywhere constable truit has seen to that i sent edith to stay with mrs darley i didnt want her to be dragged into our scandal he was on the point of telling her that simon was missing again but before he could speak she had moved closer to him her hands outstretched and for an instant he thought she was going to touch him take his hands in hers or rest her fingers on his forearms instead something hard uneven brushed against the cloth of his coat instinctively he reached out to take it and his fingers closed over smooth woven straw confused he ran his left hand over it and realized with cold shock what it was a hat a womans straw hat he could see it more clearly now the shape and texture the upswept brim ribbons from the crown tangled around his fingers as he turned the hat first this way and then that this is proof that i killed margaret it is the hat she was wearing when she left charlbury i have kept it in case of need the rest of her belongings i burned at the farm with feathers from a plucked hen wed eaten fow our dinner edith will tell you that it is the same hat that margaret was wearing when she left and no doubt margarets maid will confirm that it is hers she was silent for a time and he found himself unable to trust his voice to question her you may arrest me as you promised and take me at once to london i dont want to see my husband shamed by hildebrand walking in with all the people in charlbury goggling then taking me away with fanfare i dont know that this is margarets hat he began and reached into his pocket for the small lighter that hed carried in the war with one smooth action he slipped the cap and the flint the small flame seemed to flare like a blaze of orange light between them he could see her eyes large with surprise the pupils dilated and then sharpening he tore his glance from her face and examined the hat it was just as edith had described it if it wasnt margaret tarltons hat it was too damned near it for comfort he could feel the ache in his throat as he examined it i have a small case there under the trees i am ready to leave she said her voice steady but her eyes were wells of uncertainty he capped the lighter again and slipped it into his pocket hamish clamoring in his ears over the deafening sound he said aurore no dont say anything more we must go before elizabeth or simon comes out to find me please it was our bargain you cant tell me you dont remember you of all people aurore why did you kill margaret tarlton i shall tell you on our way to london pleaser i cant do this i dont believe you whatever you are confessing to it isnt murder he turned the hat again in his hands striving to ignore hamish striving to sound patient untroubled the policeman doing his duty but not to protect the innocent only to find the guilty you promised she said again her voice husky with hurt he said listen to me i want to know where you found this hat and why you think it was simon who killed margaret she gasped and this time her fingers did grip his arm in the darkness it was i who killed margaret i hit her and hit her and hit her until my shoulder was tired and i couldnt lift the rock any more i drove back to the farm and bathed the blood away and i left my things in the room there along with her thingsi knew jimson would never open my door it was safe no one comes there her words and her grip were tight convincing and he could feel her desperation the need to make him believe rutledge said closing his mind to hamish and to her pain all right i believe you but tell me why did you have to kill betty cooper what had that poor girl done to make you batter her into unconsciousness and then death she moved convulsively her hand on his arm showing him as clearly as if she stood in full daylight what emotions were passing through her body ah yes i thought we might come to that as well betty was very pretty she said but that wasnt the reason simon was sending her to london to elizabeth i thoughti thought she would be used by elizabeth to drive a wedge as margaret would have been later an excuse to call simon and say about betty i should like to know what you think about her wagesher behaviorher future it was such a small excuse but it was an excuse when he said nothing she went on in a low trembling voice i am not the woman you think i am ian rutledge i cannot be endowed with virtues i never possessed im french i think differently i feel differently i am a murderess and i have lied to you from the start he couldnt see her face he couldnt watch her eyes and the telltale hand had been withdrawn but he knew beyond doubt that he had to accept her confession now he had no choice but to arrest her for two murders and let the courts decide for him whether she was guilty or not the hat in his hand was proof enough and if the suitcase had been burned it didnt matter confession evidence what did you do with the murder weapon it was a smooth stone from the car i kept it there to put under a tire on a hill i saw a lorry in france roll down a hill into a crowded wagon full of refugees it killed so many of them i carry the stone to prevent such a thing from happening again it is still in the car if you look you will find it below the rear seat i daresay it still has margaret tarltons blood on it he stood there listening hearing the ring of truth hearing too the deep grief behind it hearing the ragged breathing aurore knew too many of the details she had brought him the hat she had given him the murder weapon she had given him whatto many womenwould seem a reasonable motive for two deaths and yetand yet his instinct told him she was a consummate liar not a murdereress he knew now who she was shieldingthough not yet why what was it she knew that drove her to this confession what had given simon away in her eyes the hat perhaps lying forgotten in the back of the car coming out of the barn that afternoon to find the car was not there where shed left it simons insistence that she had taken margaret to the train when he knew she had not how long had it taken her to put the facts together a bit at a time or one terrible blow she hadnt expected yet rutledge found himself thinking that simon had been too obsessed with his museum to plot so clever a murder so clever a way of convicting his wife or had that been another lie diabolical and cruel there was another possibilitythat someone else had seen to it that the finger of guilt pointed at aurore and simon was unwittingly suffering the same agonies of doubt and fear as she was had the first attempt to be rid of aurorekilling betty coopermisfired when the girls body was not discovered and margaret tarlton the next sacrifice had nearly backfired too when mowbray took the blame for her death until elizabeth napier came to charlbury and set hildebrand straight but could any of that be proved rutledge said very well im arresting you aurore wyatt for the death by murder of margaret tarlton and betty cooper it was after all what she wanted and it would forestall hildebrand he could feel the tension drain out of her a smothered sob of relief im so very glad its over she said quietly you dont know how hard it has been to live a lie but he didhe lived one every day he told himself as he took her arm and started for the car his lie was that he was a competent policeman an experienced and capable officer of scotland yard hamish was reminding him of it with vitriolic pleasure they had gotten no farther than the edge of the trees when a cry cut short rang through the night aurore stopped still listening her head turned toward the church i think it came from there she said anxiously wait here rutledge ordered already moving no im coming with you she was at his heels as he ran toward the front of the church there were lights coming on in the nearer houses and a light moving down the path from the rectory but when they reached the church porch all they found was elizabeth napier in a crumpled heap by the steps her head buried in her arms in the blackness of the night she seemed terribly small and vulnerable aurore went quickly to her touched her shoulder said help is here what has happened elizabeth looked up the whites of her eyes like halfmoons in her pale face she said roughly her voice breaking on the words i was attacked the lantern bobbing up the walk from the rectory reached them and joanna daulton said with brisk calm whats wrong can i help her lamplight fell on elizabeth on the dark hair spilling down in waves over her shoulders and the torn collar of her dress there were red marks like bruises on her throat elizabeth put up her hand against the invasion of the light and said oh god i was so frightened rutledge said who was it did you see elizabeth shook her head a little noone minute he was there startling me his hands on me and when i screamed he reached for my throat and i could feel his breath on my face she shuddered her body beginning to shake with reaction aurore after the slightest hesitation knelt to put her arms around elizabeth cradling her head against her breast its all right youre safe now dont think about it she was saying over and over in a low soothing voice that seemed to touch all of them rutledge said ill have a look around no elizabeth cried no dont leave me mrs daulton and mrs wyatt will stay with you i must go after him now there may still be time to no please take me back ii dont want to be alone she pleaded he thought it was more than that and remembered suddenly that simon hadnt been in the museum that very likely simon hadnt been in the house he left the thought there and helped elizabeth to her feet as he did he realized that neither he nor aurore had margarets hat he swore under his breath an attackor a diversion if it was a diversion it had been successful rutledge gave elizabeth his arm and they moved silently down the church walk and across the road as they reached the wyatt gates mrs daulton said something about reassuring the neighbors and he saw her go on to intercept the men hurrying in their direction aurore opened the house door for them rutledge deposited elizabeth on a sofa in the parlor getting his first real look at her her pale face was drawn with fear and shock but her mind was working clearly she said huskily as she made an awkward attempt to bind up her hair again i dont want to wake simon please dont bother him with this it will only add to his distress aurores eyes met rutledges over elizabeths head she said only no we wont disturb simon its best rutledge using the excuse of fetching water went down the hall and began a swift methodical search of the house the connecting door to the museum was still latched and he walked next into the garden but it was dark given over to the sounds of the night instinct told himinstinct honed by night marches and night attacksthat the gardens were empty even hamish felt nothing there wherever simon was it wasnt in the house or on the grounds had he been walking again had he been at the church had he seen the hat in aurores hands there among the trees or was elizabeth trying to play her own games there was always the chance that daniel shaw had attacked her wanting answers he hadnt gotten at the wyatt door earlier at least rutledge told himself this couldnt be laid at aurores door shed been with him but something about the first glimpse hed had of elizabeth in the light of mrs daultons lamp had set off alarm bells in one odd inexplicable fleeting instant she had reminded him of betty cooper lying in her tidy grave and yet it was something people had said he thought not what hed seen he could hear the echo of it but not the words not yet he turned and went back into the house filling a glass with water and carrying it to the parlor simon wyatts grandfather was staring down at them from his frame above the hearth as if the difficult silence between the two women met with his disapproval elizabeth had succeeded in putting up her hair and was lying with her head against the back of the sofa her eyes closed aurore sitting stiffly in a chair her face still looked up as he came in he shook his head but made no other explanation for the time it had taken to fill one glass with water he thought she must have guessed that simon was nowhere to be found he gave the glass to elizabeth who drank it slowly with her eyes closed the red bruised marks on her throat were very clear now they looked very real as well studying them he couldnt see how she could have made them herself she said returning the glass to him thank you she coughed and swallowed again as if her throat were painful i have never been so terrified i thoughtfor an instant i thought i was going to die it was a man rutledge asked oh yes he was tall strong it was horrible the distaste in her face was real as well i thought i was going to die she said again unable to stop herself from thinking it it was shaw it must have been the man is mad he ought to be put in jail i wont go back to the wyatt arms tonight i wont ill look for him rutledge said and added to aurore please lock the door when i leave youll be safe enough youll come back she asked yes he knew why she was asking come back to arrest her thats all i need to know she went with him to the door and as he stepped out onto the walk she said pleasesimon aurore i must find the hat thats why im going she seemed startled remembered it and said yes of course as she shut the door firmly the townspeople had gone back to their beds reassured by mrs daulton he could see her lantern bobbing up to the rectory again it occurred to him that she was a very courageous woman but then she was no longer young or pretty as margaret tarlton and betty cooper were said to have been as elizabeth napier was perhaps that was why she had felt safe or perhaps it was in her nature to take risks for the sake of others some women did he had seen them nursing the worst influenza cases working with septic wounds braving weather that would have given a strong man pause as he walked toward the church his mind was busy what was it mrs prescott had said about margaret tarlton and truit had told him about betty cooper she had such lovely hair mrs prescotts voice came back to him admiring envious and truit had said sleek as a cat sunning itself in a window or words to that effect they werent merely pretty women they were both quite sure of their attractions not flaunting them just sure of them tantalizing tempting but that still left shaw out of the equation hed been in love with margaret at least hed claimed he was if it had started with betty cooperand rutledge was now almost certain it hadthen love had a great deal to do with the murders but there wasnt time to go into that now with hamish alive in his mind rutledge was already scanning the shadows looking for wyatt looking for shaw the hat was nowhere to be found although he searched carefully the small case that aurore had left leaning against the trunk of a tree was still there he walked up to the church on guard wary but there was nothing there the stand of trees the graveyard beyond the shadows by the heavy walls were empty of life he went around the church itself twice moving cautiously slowly taking care to be sure then he tried the door on the porch it opened under his hand swinging with a deep groan across the stone paving in an island of darkness there were candles ahead burning on the stone altar casting strange flickering shadows across the aisles the norman pillars the high arched roof there was a golden warmth to the light and the man sitting in one of the chairs in the nave turned to look at him his own face golden in its reflection it was henry daulton ive looked everywhere theres no sign of anyone i stepped in here instead of going back to the house its quiet here i thought simon might come back i dont like to hear a woman scream it tears at my nerves yes its very quiet rutledge answered his voice echoing and his footsteps rebounding from the stone paving as he walked down the aisle toward henry did you see what happened i was out looking for simon wyatt he was walking again shaw told me hed seen him and then lost him a few minutes later elizabeth asked me to help her find him she was worried about him i told her it was all right that hed come home on his own but she insisted you knew he walked i dont sleep well sometimes once or twice ive seen him go out on the lawn and stand like a statue for a quarter of an hour or more another time i met him coming down the shortcut from the farmit ends over by the churchyard my mothers concerned about him she says hes on the edge of collapse but he isnt hes worried about money and aurore and the museum he doesnt see how its going to work out and thats what makes him black out to stop thinking which was an oddly penetrating observation about tonight rutledge reminded him he was in the church earlier standing there in front of the altar lighting candles praying i thought at first then he took one of them and started in the direction of the crypt i dont think he was walking then what would interest him in the crypt he remembered something henry had confided to him when he first came to charlbury there are hiding places in the church arent there does simon know about them i dont know he probably does i didnt stay very long but later he came out with a suitcase id seen it before someone had left it under that stone altar down in the crypt the old altar from the saxon church nobody ever uses it but theres an altar cloth on it my mother ironed it every week when my father was alive and kept fresh flowers on it my father always said it was useless work but she took pride in it its keeping to tradition shed say id hide under its skirts whenever i didnt want to be found i think i told simon about that but i cant be sure i dont always remember things now henry he knew the suitcase was thereor looked and found it there well he came out carrying it and dont ask me where he went with it i cant tell you because i dont know but i dont think he wanted to be seen and almost in the next instant elizabeth napier was coming up the church walk again and you were there under the trees talking quietly to mrs wyatt i thought it best to go home then if simon had collected the suitcase where would he have taken it rutledge thought he knew the farmand the police were going to search there in the morning damning evidence against aurore if it was found there he said to henry ive got work to do still will you be at the rectory or here he hadnt finished with henry but there wasnt time to ask him any more now it could wait simon couldnt here probably when i cant sleep i come here to think my father had always hoped id be rector just as simons father had expected him to stand for parliament but the war put paid to such hopes didnt it i suppose thats why i cant sleep guilt that im not the man i might have been it was a poignant remark but henry seemed to accept his circumstances stoically whether his mother did or not as if he knew and shielded her as best he could from the truth her insistence that he was making steady observable improvement must have hurt him many times the scar was very deep it had healed but not the brain behind it rutledge nodded and left his footsteps echoing again in the stillness from the nave henry called if simon is wandering dont startle him let him finish whatever it is he wants to do first will you be careful about that yes ill remember but he didnt believe simon was anything but very much himself well aware of what he was doing he went out to his car started the motor and drove with haste to the farm it was dark dark as the night he left the car by the gate and walked swiftly up the murky blackness that was the rutted lane swearing as he missed his footing several times in the deeper patches a man could break an ankle here with ease he thought and who would know jimson wouldnt hear any calls for help when he reached the house he walked carefully around it staying in the shadows as much as possible but he couldnt see any lights he couldnt pick out any sign of simon wyatts presence inside the house or out hamish was alert in his mind wary watchful rutledge moved on into the barn and saw at once that the horses had been taken out even the barn cat wasnt anywhere to be seen he strode swiftly silently down the empty dusty passage to the back doors and discovered that the cows usually penned for the night behind the barn had been loosed in the fields he could just see them ghostly white patches against the darkness of the pasture as he came back he realized that the door of the chicken coop stood open and that the chickens had scattered roosting on the tops of overturned wagons or the roofs of sheds he had nearly reached the front of the barn his mind occupied with myriad possibilitieshamish was already warning him about the most likely of them and then among the loose piles of hay in the loft a yellow ball of fire bright as the sun began to blossom into roaring life with frightening intensity simon had set the barn alight rutledge ran his steps muffled by the packed earth echoed by the paving stones his eyes sweeping the stalls the tack room the loft searching every corner even as time ran out he began to cough from the heavy swirling smoke and then he felt the heat on his back as the flames took hold behind him he found himself stumbling for the nearest door and then turned around as something caught his eye at the foot of one of the great oak beams that supported the loft and the roof it was in the shadow of the beam nearly invisible black against black but the fire was dancing on the silver catches that locked the suitcase it had been left where the fire would burn the hottest around that beam consuming it fullymelting even the metal in the end whatever hildebrand might suspect tomorrow there would be no proof and suspicion would still fall heavily on aurore had simon intended to save his wifeor damn her although hamish was calling to him to leave it rutledge dashed back into the smoke palling and black and reached down to grip the handle his other arm raised to shield his eyes was the hat here too he groped for it along the floor and in an instant lost his bearing he was blinded disoriented unable to tell in the thickening air which way he had come from there was a curtain closing in on him choking and smothering cutting him off suffocating him in a claustrophobic cloak sucking at his will hamish was a roar in his mind louder than the roar of the fire hammering at him to go simon rutledge shouted realizing all at once that a fire could destroy a man as well as a barn and a suitcase and felt the rawness in his throat simon but there was no answer and time was down to seconds before he himself was trapped he could hear hamish screaming at him now sparks were setting every wisp of straw to burning he ran again this time blindly his face seared by flames as he passed within their sphere and then he was through them blundering first into a wall feeling the draft of air that was feeding the blaze and stumbling finally out the door still coughing hard he ran on to pound heavily on the back door of the farmhouse once the blaze was at its height there would be no saving the house either he came through the door shouting for jimson checking the dark empty groundfloor rooms already reflecting the dawnlike brightness from the barn and ran up the stairs searching there as well the old glass of the windows on the back of the house mirrored the flames against the wall in shimmering images lighting his way in the front it was stygian darkness still and he quartered each room carefully making absolutely sure but jimson was not here nor was simon wherever they were they werent in danger of burning to death he came out into the night again his lungs burning from the smoke it was rolling now billows of it as it fed on old wood dust and hay the grass by one of the sheds was already flickering with fiery dewdrops he searched the sheds and found them empty bales of hay waiting in them for the match to come the air was thick heavy he could hear horses in the distance neighing shrilly in alarm hamish was telling him to go to hurry the sound of the flames was greedy now soaring into the night on a pillar of black smoke and sparks rutledge hesitated yet he knew he could do nothing for the barn there was nothing one manor an army of menmight do as the flames fed hungrily on the hay and then jumped to the dry old wood of stalls and pillars and walls he stood staring at it in despair knowing what its destruction would mean to aurore finally retrieving the suitcase from the porch where hed left it he turned and hurried back down the drive to his car wherever simon was he had to find him he had the strongest feeling that it was already too late but he had to try to live with himself he had to try but there was no sign of wyatt on the road and rutledge thought as he coughed raggedly i couldnt have missed him coming herethe fire wasnt that far along when i arrived he must have taken a shortcut from here to charlburyhe must have come out somewhere near the church where no one would see him hes ahead of me driving very fast now his headlamps probing the darkness he made the trip to charlbury in a matter of minutes the wyatt house was alight not with fire but with lamps he braked hard skidding to a halt and was out of the car almost as soon as the engine stopped aurore was in the front garden her face wild with fear simon isnt in the house she said i cant find him ive looked everywhere oh godcan you see those flames we must do somethingjimson jimsons safe simon was at the farmhe set the barn to burn aurore it will be gone in a short time but he wasnt there nor was jimson and the cattle the horses are safe theres nothing that can be done but the fire bell by the common was ringing loudly and men stuffing nightshirts into trousers were gathering by the inn and piling into carts wagons whatever they could find throwing buckets among the packed bodies rutledge caught sight of jimson among them yelling fiercely he burnedbut why aurore ignored the chaos her mind only on simon rutledge said the suitcase he wanted to destroy it and anything else that might have been left there any evidence that could still be found it was the only thing he could think of doing before hildebrand came tomorrow aurore you must tell me now where did you find that straw hat the suitcasemargarets she was very still i dont understand it was hidden in the church aurore henry knew about the hiding place there and simon simon went to fetch it tonight you hadnt destroyed it had you if you lied about that you lied about the hat elizabeth napier had come to the door i heard voicesis that you simon she peered out into the garden seeing only the tall man beside aurore no its rutledge i smell smoke she exclaimed as she stepped out the door her voice was still rough she turned in the direction that men and wagons were moving up the road and saw the distant flames leaping into the night sky my god its the farm there nothing we can do i dont know where simon is elizabeth did he know of hiding places in the church behind the old altar for one under the altar cloth the one that henry used as a boy who else did we were never allowed to play thereive never heard of a hiding place has simon already gone to try to save the farm buildings we ought to be there helping him be quick aurore we need the car she started down the walk theres a suitcase in the back of my car will you look at it and tell me if you recognize it the hurrying men had disappeared but there were clots of women near the wyatt arms some staring toward the fire some of them packing another wagon with picks shovels buckets a barrel of ale aurore began to move but he gripped her arm holding it firmly elizabeth said im not interested in suitcases why isnt benson here when i need him will you take me aurore or not please do as i ask there was an inflection in his voice that stopped the flow of words as if theyd been cut off she stared at him surprised by his intensity then she moved through the gate and turned to look at rutledge again with an expression that was hard to readanger he thought because her primary concern was still simon but it was his as well she went on to the car after a moment she called in surprise i know that case thats margarets where on earth did you find it i thought the killer had taken it youre absolutely sure of that it belonged to her of course i am my father gave her this case for her birthday two years ago its part of a set she turned and said with sudden understanding it means you know who killed her doesnt it i think miss napier that youd better go back into the house and telephone inspector hildebrand in singleton magna tell him please that hes wanted here that theres an emergency meanwhile aurore you must help me find simon elizabeth stepped away from the car and looked at him with fierce passion whats happened why wont you tell me aurore make him tell me aurore opened her mouth to say something just as the silence was shattered by the sound of a gunshot coming from the direction of the museum oh god she was already running fleet as a wraith her skirts lifted her body tense with fear and terror elizabeth screamed one long hearttearing sound a name and was after her in a flash of skirts and flying heels but rutledge swifter was there ahead of them at the door of the museum opening it rushing into the empty room and then the next and the next until hed reached the small office that simon had used at the door he came to such an abrupt halt that aurore cannoned into him and elizabeth was a poor third pressing at their backs calling simons name dont come any closer he said putting out an arm to stop aurore no i must go to him ive had training i canoh god let me go elizabeth pushing her way past both of them reached the threshold and for an instant rutledge thought she was about to faint she swayed on her feet grasped the doors edge and began to whimper with soft short breaths aurore broke away and went into the room rutledge knew what it held he had seen in that one brief anguished glance he had seen it all in the lamplight simon wyatt seated at the desk a sheet of paper on the top in front of him a pen beside it and his blood blown across it by the impact of the bullet to his temple the pistol on the floor beside his chair was german a war souvenir the germans rutledge thought helplessly had got him after all and hamish aware of the grief and the pain and the horror of what had happened said look well see yoursel if its no the germans waiting it will be me rutledge stood there for an instant frozen seeing in his minds eye his own shattered face lying on one arm outflung across the bare wood rutledge made himself walk into the room and look at the sheet of paper under simons arm although he had guessed what was written on it it was addressed to hildebrand it said only you were wrong i blacked out and killed them both she didnt know it is better this way and the signature read with a flourish simon wyatt rutledge softly swore the waste of a mans life shocking him aurore was kneeling beside her husband her arm across his shoulder saying hes still warm there must be a pulse if i can stop the bleeding elizabeth was clinging to the door frame sobbing heavily her eyes unable to look away rutledge bent to aurore touched her shining hair briefly gently then forced her to let simon go lifting her to her feet turning her to face him hes dead aurore hes dead theres nothing you can do she buried her face against him then and he thought she was going to cry like elizabeth but she was only searching for strength her body at the point of breaking her mind already broken she said i was so afraid i was so afraid that one dayand now ill never need to be afraid again she let him lead her out of the room but seemed unaware of the chair he seated her on or the handkerchief he thrust into her hands elizabeth refused to go clinging to the door her eyes unable to leave the crumpled shoulders the untidy fair hair the great black stain of blood rutledge finally got her to move back into the museum and that was when she straightened seeming to tower in her anger and loosed the storm of it at aurore its your fault you killed him you took him away from all he knew and all he wanted and made him into what you believed he ought to be and in the end it killed him he neednt have died but for you and your damned selfish blindness i hope youre satisfied i hope his spirit haunts you every day of life and breath left to you and that you never never know what happiness is ever again rutledge went to her and shook her hard until she broke into tears again and sank in the chair he quickly shoved toward her burying her head in her hands she began to moan simons name over and over like a litany aurore white and strained still hadnt cried she looked up at rutledge her eyes filled with ineffable pain and said only he didnt do it you thought he had he thought you had he killed himself because he couldnt face losing you he couldnt face the scandal he couldnt face another change in his life he was trying to protect you hildebrand came to him today i dont know how simon knew of the suitcase whether he put it thereor found it there if its any comfort to you he broke off as the door opened and joanna daulton came through the outer rooms toward them her hair still pinned up the white streak like a blazon but she was wearing a robe over her nightdress she looked from aurore to elizabeth saying something about the fire and then seemed to shrink into herself as she took in what their faces told her as they lifted to hers simon she asked rutledge gentle god where he nodded toward the back room then said dont go she walked past him without a word and into the small office staying only for a moment he thought he heard her saying words of prayer from the service for the dead then she turned her face chalk white and said what can i do will you call hildebrand for me ask him to come directly and then if you would you might find some help for miss napier and mrs wyatt i think both have been through enough for one night they need tea warmthcomfort ill see to it she said but some of her usual efficient crispness was gone i loved him she added simply i watched him grow from childhood i thought if i had another son thats what id want him to be someone like simon she shook her head as if to clear it i hope hes at resti hope hes at peace her voice broke and she went out the door leaving him with the two women while she made the necessary arrangements aurore said this has changed nothing in our bargain i will not have this put at simons door do you hear me it was as if she hadnt taken in what hed been saying earlier aurore no he will not be remembered as a murderer if there is a paper saying so in that room please for the love of god destroy it dont let it destroy him i cant destroy evidence then i will she got to her feet and was nearly to the door of the smaller room before he caught her his hands on her arms aurore listen to me it isnt over yet give me time if you destroy that letter you will probably hang and he died to prevent that can you understand me he died because he couldnt endure any more pressure from anyone he made a swift and measured decision come with me back to the house i must lock this wing until hildebrand arrives he took elizabeths arm supporting her while auroreaurore the widowwalked unaided by his side one foot placed precisely in front of the other as if she were half alive it was always the elizabeths of this world he thought in a distant corner of his mind around whom people gathered in a crisis offering sympathy and comfort and human warmth they seemed so vulnerable and helpless and yet the elizabeths were often tougher than all the rest more deeply centered on how the crisis deprived them than moved by unbearable grief how did you comfort aurore when you knew that even touching her was anathema that beneath the incredible strength lay stark despair he locked the museum door with the key he found there and escorted both women across the front gardens the side of his face was beginning to hurt where the flames had seared it by the time they reached the house elizabeth was near to collapse that spoke volumes to rutledgehe understood clearly what she had doneand how it would affect the remainder of her life and so did she simons death lay at her door as much as at hildebrands if she hadnt meddledif she hadnt tried to bring him back to her somehowanyhowagain and again when elizabeth had been settled on the sofa in the quiet parlor a pillow under her head and the light shielded with a shawl he turned toward the door aurore said where are you going i want to know i want to go with you im not going to london only as far as the church i want to see this hiding place aurore tell me the truth you found the hat didnt you where she shook her head stubbornly adhering to the story shed given him and she stubbornly followed rutledge to the church as if afraid hed leave her breaking their bargain or afraid that left alone she couldnt hide from grief any longer inside the candles still burned and the odor of incense was very strong it took him some time to find the stairs to the crypt hidden in a corner of a side aisle as simon had done before he took a candle to light his way down the narrow crumbling steps and into the cool stone chamber that had once been a small church its heavy pillars squat its arches broad and ugly rather than graceful sturdy strong enough to support the building that had been put up over it windowless and bare almost spiritually bleak the crypt now served to house the dead wyatts for the most part but there were others as well he could see eight or ten tombs spaced unevenly around two walls leaving the center of the stonepaved floor empty along the other walls were stored a broken pew bits of stone from rebuilding boxes of hymnals shovels and picks for digging graves containers for flowers lengths of canvas bucketsall the oddments of death and burial you could see he thought that nothing could be hidden among or behind them neither he nor aurore had spoken at one end of the crypt was a stone altar with no grace a monolithic slab with a vine pattern running around it set upon three square heavy stones an altar cloth thin from damp and age draped the stones covering them to the floor in the center of the top was a squat stone cross powerful in its roughness a bronze vase empty stood to one side as if waiting for flowers and under the altar cloth as it hung like a tent was a narrow threesided rectangle the back open he went there and knelt on one knee to look more closely at it it yawned empty the dark space was large enough for a suitcase like margaret tarltons or for a small boy gleefully escaping from adult supervision but who had put the suitcase in there he thought he had part of the answer now he felt heavy with sadness aurore was just behind him staying close in the pale light of her own candle her breath uneven as if the place disturbed her he thought she might be sorry she had come now but she stooped to look at the small space too and then gasped as another voice spoke it seemed to rise from the ground under their feet although that was a trick of the echo it was henry on the stairs saying my mother told me about simon im sorry shes very upset she feels responsible he didnt have a candle yes she would rutledge thought the final tragedy in her life rutledge straightened up and came across the uneven floor toward henry was this your hiding place was this the place from which simon wyatt took the suitcase tonight henry said id rather not tell you let the dead lie in peace it will help simon he isnt guilty neither is aurore henry frowned a move that emphasized the deep scar but it will harm someone else wont it it will hurt me that very much depends on why it was put here as well as by whom henry came down the last of the steps and moved across the crypt the candle flames dancing with his passage it would have been safer over here he said coming to a stop in front of one of the tombs there the suitcase the low rectangular stone vault was small plain the top was engraved with a name date and a few lines of scripture but no figures at the sides supported it and no designs ran like filigree either across the top or down the corners it seemed to squat on the floor out of place among its more ornate brethren as if unfinished the end stone here isnt sealed the tombs actually empty did you know it belonged to the wife of another simon wyatt some three hundred years ago the next wife didnt want her to lie here in charlbury and had the body sent to essex its one of the family skeletons in a manner of speaking he stooped by the tomb and pushed one side of the stone that marked the foot it scraped across the floor but moved with fair ease you wouldnt have needed much of a space to slip a suitcase in there but most people cant tell its free i knew even my father didnt rutledge said quietly you couldnt have moved that as boys it was too heavy would it be too heavy for a woman he was thinking of aurore probably not if she knew about it the old sexton showed it to me when i was six or seven he had a ghoulish nature he said id wind up here if i misbehaved in church rather a cruel thing to tell a child wasnt it yes it was to one side of rutledge aurore stood with that stillness of hers that he so admired henry frowned thinking i must have told simon about these hiding places thats how he could find the suitcase when he came looking tonight i asked him what he was searching for and he said it was a suitcase no one else wanted he said aurore had put it here but she hadnt aurore turning to rutledge opened her mouth to speak and stopped no i dont believe she had put it here either rutledge said his voice attuned to henrys mood who did do you know henry shook his head it was in the attic for a time whose attic simons no of course not it came from my mothers how did she come to have it it didnt belong to her did you give it to her she brought it home one day i asked her where it came from and she said it was better if i didnt worry about it there was another one too but she put that one on a train from kingston lacey to norfolk i expect she wanted to put this one on a train too but hadnt had time where do you hide a suitcase where there are other suitcases aurore was staring at henry she said how did simon know that the suitcase was here i dont believe he did hed searched the farmhouse and the barn after the inspector here had gone this afternoon then he came here to search the church i dont think he was very pleased to find it no rutledge said i shouldnt have thought he was at all pleased it proved something he didnt want to believe i thinkhenry its time we found your mother why mrs wyatt needs her henry said i like mrs wyatt she doesnt know it but ive watched her often i like pretty hair hers is very pretty rutledge standing very still said softly aurore will you trust me let your hair down slowly give me the candle after an instants hesitation she handed it to him and slowly began to unpin her hair collecting the pins in her teeth the knot at the back of her neck loosened and unwound as she took the pins in her left hand her hair spilled in long gleaming waves falling over her shoulders nearly to her waist she looked at rutledge frowning but unafraid her hair was not prettyit was beautiful henry mesmerized sucked in his breath and walked toward her his eyes shining in the light his hand moved reaching then drew back you wont scream if i touch it he said to aurore and to rutledge he said i like to touch it but it always makes them scream and i hate that part no rutledge said firmly you cant touch it tonight henry stopped where he was uncertain rutledge passed one of his candles to aurore her face white and stark now and stepped into henrys path mrs wyatt would you mind fetching mrs daulton for me you should find her at your house with elizabeth ask her to come here but dont come back with her do you understand ian she began moving toward the stairs theres no need im here joanna daulton said coming down the crypt steps dressed now composed she stood there blocking the only exit from the lowceilinged cold stone undercroft of the old church another candle in her hand and rutledge felt himself succumbing to the numbing fear of being shut in cut off from the outside air hamish was urgently telling him to pay heed in mrs daultons left hand half hidden by her skirts and the shadows was the straw hat that had belonged to margaret tarlton aurore was moving closer to rutledge one hand fumbling at her hair gathering it together but joanna daulton said you neednt be afraid my dear henry never hurts anyone he just has a fascination about seeing a womans hair flowing down her back i dont think he even understands why this compulsion is there the physical implications nor does he understand that respectable women dont care for such attentions he only wants to touch and to him thats hotwrong like a child wanting to touch something very pretty he sometimes cant stop himself the last words seemed to be wrenched from her he tries to choke them when they scream rutledge said yes it frightens him he tries to shut them up if they stood still hed stop at once but thats as far as it ever goes he never does any harm he tried tonight to choke elizabeth napier yes she turned tiredly toward aurore i wouldnt have had simon die for anything in the world she said her voice heavy with sorrow i mean that aurore i never intended for any such thing to happen i shall have to take henry in for questioning rutledge said will he understand what im doing and why of course he will joanna said sharply hes not a fool but it wont be necessary he didnt kill those women i did he looked at her infinite pity in his eyes to protect her son how many have there been it started in london id taken rooms near the hospital while henry was there recovering and theyd let him out of hospital in my care with a nurse to come three days a week he tried once to unpin her hair and she screamed and he choked her she was very angry she threatened to tell the doctors to have henry put away i gave her a great deal of money and bought her passage on a ship leaving for new zealand and that was that afterward i watched him very carefully but when betty came to the house to tell me that simon was giving her an introduction to the napiers henry was alone with her in the parlor i was finishing the washing up i didnt know i thought he was out i didnt know until i heard her scream i offered her what money i had and told her shed be better off going to london with a small fortune in her pocket than settling for being a maid to the napiers and she went but the money didnt last she came back demanding more joanna daulton shuddered i couldnt give her any more i didnt have any more to give but she was a greedy little bitch she threatened to have henry put away and in the end i had no choice but to kill her it was horrible i hated myself i hated her i hated having to connive and lie and live with such a thing on my conscience i told myself in future i shall never let him out of my sight again ill watch even more closely it wont happen again i could see he was showing great improvement but he wasnt was he rutledge asked gently he has never fully recovered he never will no the word seemed stark and anguished matching her eyes and i shant be there to care for him he will have to go back to hospital now whether i want him to or not the next woman he was alone with was margaret tarlton looking for someone to drive her to the train she sighed i hate to say this about the dead but margaret tarlton was worse than betty i knew from something richard wyatt told me once when he and margaret had a stormy affair in that she had a way of getting whatever she wanted i think shed have married richard if hed had enough money to satisfy her and now she had the power of the napiers behind her she was hard and very angry very unforgiving i didnt have any money to offer her she said she didnt care what happened to henry she said it was what he deserved joanna daulton turned to aurore i told her you arent a mother or youd understand but she said it doesnt matter he belongs behind bars he isnt stable we argued again outside singleton magna i was driving your car aurore there wasnt enough petrol in mine id walked over to the farm and borrowed it and all the way to the train margaret tarlton was insisting on going to the authorities in singleton magna i couldnt persuade i couldnt bribeshe made me stop the car and put her out thats when god help me i took that stone you keep in the back of your car and i killed her and that poor man mowbray took the blame because to save him id have had to destroy my own son her voice twisted in anguish aurore said dontfor gods sake dont mrs daulton said im glad its over i thought when i heard elizabeth scream tonight it will go on and on and on until one day i cant bear it anymore but i love him you see i really wanted him to be whole again i told myself that simon was recoveringhenry could recover too i told myself a hundred lies i told myself that i could make henry well myself if i had time enough and peace enough it was all so terrible but i couldnt harm elizabeth ive known her almost all her life it was hard enough with people i barely knew with elizabeth she shook her head i couldnt kill her aurore i couldnt do it but i killed simon didnt i inadvertently id have liked to kill myself but i havent that kind of courage i suppose women generally dont she smiled across the room at her son henry darling i dont think youve understood a word of what ive been saying and just as well come along let me put you to bed and then i must go with the inspector for a while it will be all right youll see you liked hospital didnt you her voice trailed off as she held out her hand dropping margaret tarltons hat on the steps henry came to take her cold fingers in his and rutledge watched letting it happen henry looked across at rutledge and there was a strained smile on his face he understood far more than his mother wanted to believe mrs daulton turned and led her son up the steps aurore said quickly to rutledge i dont think she should go alone its all right she wont harm him she wont harm herself ill take you home and then go to the rectory by the time henry is settled hildebrand will be here you believed her she followed him across the crypt her candle flame shaking because her hand was shaking badly yes ive been half certain since that damned hat went missing tonight they had all made a connection between henry and the dead women and dismissed it shaw had more anger in him than henry had ever shown but shaw had had no reason to kill betty cooper while simon or aurore might have or elizabeth napier at the stairs as he bent to retrieve the hat rutledge said i saw henry once with a small bird in his hands it was oddly childlike he may have tried to stop these women from screaming and frightened them badly himself as well but he wouldnt have beaten them on and on until they were dead as his mother had had to do to silence them hes not mad its just that much of his mind is gone whatever abilities and skills he once had hes lost them he took her arm to help her up the steep crumbling steps her scent was strong in the cool air a sign of her distress he said will you tell me now where you found this hat i took the shortcut to the farm the day after margaret left it was in the bushes there joanna must have dropped it but i thought simon had and someone had started the car while i was in the barni heard it leave and come back i was sure simon had taken margaret to singleton magna her breath seemed to catch in her throat he was desperate for money i thoughti had so little faith left in him i had seen his fathers letter about the house in chelsea and he had insisted on hiring margaret there was no comfort he could offer she said as they reached the aisle and he blew out their candles if only simon had waited for the morning there was infinite sorrow in her voice i know rutledge said quietly but the stone took his words and gave them a haunting echo he was a good man aurore he just lost his way a lot of us did in the war and we werent all wearing visible wounds that was the worst part of it no one could look at us and say see what the war has done i loved him so much she said tears coming at last i thought he didnt love me after a moment he said what will you do she said into the echo of his words i shall open the museum if i can and make it work and after that i shall go far away from here we have all died in a waymyself and simon henry and his mother mowbray those poor women i cant bear to think about it they had reached the door of the church he handed her the key to the museum she turned to him and said i shall go from here alone do you understand yes whoever she is this woman you have loved she is not worth your grief do you know that find a love of your own and dont lose it as i did and she was gone hurrying down the path toward her house where he could hear cars arriving and voices raised in alarm in the bright sky behind him the barn and the house still burned out of control flames leaping high garishly into the night he felt very tired and very much alone hamish said youre a better policeman than you think you are am i id have saved him if i could aye but hed no have thanked you he died for her it gave his death a meaning it was what he was after and it was far better than dying a coward rutledge walked out of the shadows of the trees he could see aurore standing in the doorway of the museum unlocking it he braced himself and called to hildebrand stopping that surge of people toward the house long enough for aurore to remove the note from simons dead hand there was no reason to cause pain where it wasnt needful she paused as the museum door swung open and looked blindly back toward the church but rutledge was already standing among the policemen from singleton magna handing the hat to hildebrand swiftly and clearly telling the staring faces what had happened as he finished a number of them went on to the museum the others led by hildebrand went toward the rectory shaw by the gate stood waiting until theyd gone he looked at rutledge and said is it true what you just told that lot or a pack of lies about mrs daulton its true shaw rubbed his face drawn and exhausted i wanted someone i could kill i wanted it to be napier or simon or even henry i cant touch that poor woman even for margarets sake hanging will be a blessing for her it will be an end but not a blessing rutledge turned the crank got into his car and said can i give you a lift as far as the inn shaw shook his head i need to walk awhile rutledge drew away and in the night watched his two headlamps plow gaudy furrows down the dark road he felt empty drained but mowbray was still in his cell the man deserved compassion and help rutledge would see to it hamish said you could na let mowbray hang for murder he never touched a soul shell fare well enough you must na fret it wasnt clear whether he was speaking of aurore or joanna daulton rutledge said no but he knew he would remember aurores face and her stillness and the french way she had of shrugging whenever he thought of jean they were inextricably linked because he and simon were linked he could still see the pistol beside the chair he could smell the powder and the blood there but for the grace of god go i but hamish said into the roar of the engine and the sound of the wind whispering through the open car not now not yet
