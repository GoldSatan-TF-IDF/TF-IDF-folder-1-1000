ian rankin death is not the end one is loss redeemed by memory or does memory merely swell the sense of loss becoming the enemy the language of loss is the language of memory remembrance memorial memento people leave our lives all the time some we met only briefly others wed known since birth they leave us memories which become skewed through time and little more the silent dance continued couples writhed and shuffled threw back their heads or ran hands through their hair eyes darting around the dance floor seeking out future partners maybe or past loves to make jealous the tv monitor gave a greasy look to everything no sound just pictures the tape cutting from dance floor to main bar to second bar to toilet hallway then entrance foyer exterior front and exterior back exterior back was a puddled alley full of rubbish bins and a merc belonging to the clubs owner rebus had heard about the alley a punter had been knifed there the previous summer mr merc had complained about the bloody smear on his passengerside window the victim had lived the club was called gaitanos nobody knew why the owner just said it sounded american and a bit jazzy the larger part of the clientele had decided on the nickname guisers and that was what you heard in the pubs on a friday and saturday night going down guisers later the young men would be dressed smartcasual the women scented from heaven and all stations south they left the pubs around ten or half past thats when it would be starting to get lively at guisers rebus was seated in a small uncomfortable chair which itself sat in a stuffy dimly lit room the other chair was filled by an audiovisual technician armed with two remotes his occasional belches of which he seemed blissfully ignorant bespoke a recent snack of spring onion crisps and irnbru im really only interested in the main bar foyer and out front rebus said i could edit them down to another tape but wed lose definition the recordings duff enough as it is the technician scratched inside the sagging armpit of his black tshirt rebus leant forward a little pointing at the screen coming up now they waited the view jumped from back alley to dance floor any second another cut main bar punters queuing three deep the technician didnt need to be told and froze the picture it wasnt so much black and white as sepia the colour of dead photographs interior light the audiovisual wizard had explained he was adjusting the tracking now and moving the action along one frame at a time rebus moved in on the screen bending so one knee rested on the floor his finger was touching a face he took out the assortment of photos from his pocket and held them against the screen its him he said i was pretty sure before you cant go in a bit closer for now this is as good as it gets i can work on it later stick it on the computer the problem is the source material to wit one shitty security video rebus sat back on his chair all right he said lets run forward at halfspeed the camera stayed with the main bar for another fifteen seconds then switched to the second bar and all points on the compass when it returned to the main bar the crush of drinkers seemed not to have moved unbidden the technician froze the tape again hes not there rebus said again he approached the screen touched it with his finger he should be there next to the sex goddess the technician belched again yes spun silver hair almost like a cloud of candyfloss dark eyes and lips while those around her were intent either on catching the eyes of the bar staff or on the dance floor she was looking off to one side there were no shoulders to her dress lets check the foyer rebus said twenty seconds there showed a steady stream entering the club but no one leaving exterior front showed a queue awaiting admittance by the brace of bouncers and a few passersby in the toilet maybe the technician suggested but rebus had studied the tape a dozen times already and though he watched just once more he knew he wouldnt see the young man again not at the bar not on the dance floor and not back around the table where his mates were waiting with increasing disbelief and impatience for him to get his round in the young mans name was damon mee and according to the timer running at the bottom righthand corner of the screen he had vanished from the world sometime between and pm on friday april where is this place anyway i dont recognize it kirkcaldy rebus said the technician looked at him how come it ended up here good question rebus thought but not one he was about to answer go back to that bar shot he said take it nice and slow again the technician aimed his righthand remote yes sir mr demille he said april meant still not quite spring in edinburgh a few sunny days to be sure buds getting twitchy wondering if winter had been paid the ransom but there was snow still hanging in a sky the colour of chicken bones office talk how rangers were going to retain the championship why hearts and hibs would never win it was it finally time for the two local sides to become friends form one team which might might stand half a chance as someone said their rivalry was part and parcel of the citys makeup hard to imagine rangers and celtic thinking of marriage in the same way or even of a quick poke on the back stairs after years of following football only on pub televisions and in the back of the daily tabloid rebus was starting to go to matches again dc siobhan clarke was to blame coaxing him to a hibs game one dreary afternoon the men on the green sward werent half as interesting as the spectators who proved by turns sharpwitted vulgar perceptive and incorrigible siobhan had taken him to her usual spot those in the vicinity seemed to know her pretty well it was a goodhumoured afternoon even if rebus couldnt have said who scored the eventual three goals but hibs had won the finalwhistle hug from siobhan was proof of that it was interesting to rebus that for all the barriers around the ground this was a place where shields were dropped after a while it felt like one of the safest places hed ever been he recalled fixtures his father had taken him to in the fifties and early sixties cowdenbeath home games and a crowd numbered in the hundreds getting there necessitated a change of buses rebus and his younger brother fighting over who could hold the roll of tickets their mother was dead by then and their father was trying to carry on much as before like they might not notice she was missing those saturday trips to the football were supposed to fill a gap you saw a lot of fathers and sons on the terraces but not many mothers and that in itself was reminder enough there was a boy of rebuss age who stood near them rebus had walked over to him one day and blurted out the truth i dont have a mum at home the boy had stared at him saying nothing ever since football had reminded him of those days and of his mother he stood on the terraces alone these days and followed the game mostly movements which could be graceful as ballet or as jagged as free association but sometimes found that hed drifted elsewhere to a place not at all unpleasant and all the time surrounded by a community of bodies and wills ill tell you how to beat rangers he said now addressing the whole office how siobhan clarke offered clone stevie scoular half a dozen times there were murmurs of agreement and then the farmer put his head around the door john my office the farmer chief superintendent watson to his face was pouring a mug of coffee from his machine when rebus knocked at the open door sit down john rebus sat the farmer motioned with an empty mug but he turned down the offer and waited for his boss to get to his chair and the point both my birthdays coming up the farmer said this was a new one on rebus who kept quiet id like a present not just a card this year then what i want john is topper hamilton rebus let that sink in i thought topper was mr clean these days not in my books the farmer cupped his hands around his coffee mug he got a fright last time and granted hes been keeping a low profile but we both know the best villains have got little or no profile at all so whats he been up to i heard a story hes the sleeping partner in a couple of clubs and casinos i also hear he bought a taxi firm from big ger cafferty when big ger went into barlinnie rebus was thinking back three years to their big push against topper hamilton theyd set up surveillance used a bit of pressure here and there got a few people to talk in the end it hadnt so much amounted to a hill of beans as to a fart in an empty can the procurator fiscal had decided not to proceed to trial but then god or fate call it what you like had provided a spin to the story not a plague of boils or anything for topper hamilton but a nasty little cancer which had given him more grief than the whole of the lothian and borders police hed been in and out of hospital endured chemo and the whole works and had emerged a more slender figure in every sense the farmer whod once settled an office argument by reeling off the books in both old and new testaments wasnt yet content that god and life had done their worst to topper or that retribution had been meted out in some mysterious divine way he wanted topper in court even if they had to wheel him there on a trolley it was a personal thing last time i looked rebus said now it wasnt illegal to invest in a casino it is if your name hasnt come up during the vetting procedure think topper could get a gaming licence fair point but i still dont see something else i heard youve got a snitch works as a croupier so same casino topper has a finger in rebus saw it all and started shaking his head i made him a promise hell tell me about punters but nothing on the management and youd rather keep that promise than give me a birthday present a relationship like that its eggshells the farmers eyes narrowed you think ours isnt talk to him john get him to do some ferreting i could lose a good snitch plenty more bigmouths out there the farmer watched rebus get to his feet i was looking for you earlier you were in the video room a missing person suspicious rebus shrugged could be he went up to the bar for a round of drinks never came back weve all done that in our time his parents are worried how old is he twentythree the farmer thought about it then whats the problem two the problem was the past a week before hed received a phone call from a ghost inspector john rebus please speaking oh hello there you probably wont remember me a short laugh that used to be a bit of a joke at school rebus immune to every kind of phone call had this pegged a crank whys that he asked wondering which punchline he was walking into because its my name mee the caller spelt it for him brian mee inside rebuss head a fuzzy photograph took sudden shape a mouth full of prominent teeth freckled nose and cheeks a kitchenstool haircut barney mee he said more laughter on the line aye they used to call me barney im not sure i ever knew why rebus could have told him after barney rubble in the flintstones he could have added because you were a dense wee bastard but instead he asked how this ghost from his past was doing no bad no bad the laugh again rebus recognized it now as a sign of nerves so what can i do for you brian well me and janis we thought well it was my mums idea actually she knew your dad both my mum and dad knew him only my dad passed away like they all used to drink at the goth are you still in bowhill never quite escaped ach its all right really i work in glenrothes though lucky to have a job these days eh mind youve done well for yourself johnny do you still get called that i prefer john i remember you hated it when anyone called you jock another wheezing laugh the photo was even sharper now bordered with a white edge the way photos always were in the past a decent footballer a bit of a terrier the hair reddishbrown dragging his satchel along the ground until the stitching rubbed away always with some huge hard sweet in his mouth crunching down on it his nose running and one incident hed lifted some nude mags from under his dads side of the bed and brought them to the toilets next to the miners institute there to be pored over like textbooks afterwards half a dozen twelveyearold boys had looked at each other minds fizzing with questions so what can i do for you brian like i say it was my mums idea only she remembered you were in the police in edinburgh saw your name in the paper a while back and she thought you could maybe help with what our son i mean mine and janiss hes called damon whats he done rebus thought something minor and way outside his territory anyway hes vanished run away more like in a puff of smoke he was in this club with his pals see and he went have you tried calling the police rebus caught himself i mean fife constabulary oh aye mee sounded dismissive they asked a few questions like sniffed around a bit then said there was nothing they could do damons twentythree they say hes got a right to bugger off if he wants theyve got a point people run away all the time brian girl trouble maybe he was engaged maybe he got scared helens a lovely girl never a raised voice between them did he leave a note nothing i went through this with the police he didnt take any clothes or anything he didnt have any reason to go so you think somethings happened to him i know what those buggers are thinking they say we should give him another week or so to come back or at least get in touch but i know theyll only start doing something about it when the body turns up again rebus could have confirmed that this was only sensible again he knew mee wouldnt want to hear it the thing is brian he said i work in edinburgh fife s not my patch i mean i can make a couple of phone calls but its hard to know what else to do the voice was close to despair well if you could just do something like anything wed be very grateful it would put our minds at rest a pause my mum always speaks well of your dad hes remembered in this town and buried there too rebus thought he picked up a pen give me your phone number brian and almost an afterthought better give me the address too that evening he drove north out of edinburgh paid his toll at the forth bridge and crossed into fife it wasnt as if he never went there he had a brother in kirkcaldy but though they spoke on the phone every month or so there were seldom visits he couldnt think of any other family he still had in fife the place liked to call itself the kingdom and there were those who would agree that it was another country a place with its own linguistic and cultural currency for such a small place it seemed almost endlessly complex had seemed that way to rebus even when he was growing up to outsiders the place meant coastal scenery and st andrews or a stretch of motorway between edinburgh and dundee but the westcentral fife of rebuss childhood had been very different ruled by coal mines and linoleum dockyards and chemical plants an industrial landscape shaped by basic needs and producing people who were wary and inwardlooking with the blackest humour youd ever find theyd built new roads since rebuss last visit and knocked down a few more landmarks but the place didnt feel so very different from thirtyodd years before it wasnt such a great span of time after all except in human terms maybe not even then entering cardenden bowhill had disappeared from road signs in the s even if locals still knew it as a village distinct from its neighbour rebus slowed to see if the memories would turn out sweet or sour then he caught sight of a chinese takeaway and thought both of course brian and janis mees house was easy enough to find they were standing by the gate waiting for him rebus had been born in a prefab but brought up in a house just like the one he now parked in front of brian mee practically opened the car door for him and was trying to shake his hand while rebus was still emerging from his seat let the man catch his breath janis mee snapped she was still standing by the gate arms folded how have you been johnny and rebus realized that brian mee had married janis playfair the only girl in his long and troublestrewn life whod ever managed to knock him unconscious the narrow lowceilinged living room was full to bursting not just rebus and janis and brian but brians mother and mr and mrs playfair introductions had to be made and rebus guided to the seat by the fire the room was overheated a pot of tea was produced and on the table by rebuss armchair sat enough slices of cake to feed a football crowd hes a brainy one janiss mother said handing rebus a framed photo of damon mee plenty of certificates from school works hard saving up to get married the dates set for next august the photo showed a smiling imp not long out of school have you got anything more recent janis handed him a packet of snapshots from last summer rebus went through them slowly it saved having to look at the faces around him he felt like a doctor expected to produce an immediate diagnosis and remedy the photos showed a man in his early twenties still retaining the impish smile but recognizably older not careworn exactly but with something behind the eyes some disenchantment with adulthood a few of the photos showed damons parents we all went together brian explained janiss mum and dad my mum helen and her parents beaches a big white hotel poolside games where is it lanzarote jams said handing him his tea in a few of the pictures she was wearing a bikini good body for her age or any age come to that he tried not to linger can i keep a couple of the closeups he asked janis looked at him of damon she nodded and he put the other photos back in their packet were really grateful someone said janiss mum brians rebus couldnt tell does helen live locally practically round the corner id like to talk to her ill give her a bell brian mee said leaping to his feet damon had been drinking in some club guisers janis said handing round cigarettes its in kirkcaldy on the prom she shook her head looking just the same as she had that night of the school dance shaking her head telling him so far and no further in the town it used to be a department store its really called gaitanos mr playfair said rebus remembered him too he was an old man now where does damon work careful to stick to the present tense brian mee came back into the room same place i do i managed to get him a job in packaging hes been learning the ropes itll be management soon workingclass nepotism jobs handed down from father to son rebus was surprised it still existed helenll be here in a minute brian added are you not eating any cake inspector said mrs playfair helen cousins hadnt been able to add much to rebuss picture of damon and hadnt been there the night hed vanished but shed introduced him to someone who had andy peters andy had been part of the group at gaitanos thered been four of them theyd been in the same year at school and still met up once or twice a week sometimes to watch raith rovers if the weather was decent and the mood took them other times for an evening session in a pub or club it was only their third or fourth visit to guisers rebus thought of paying the club a visit but knew he should talk to the local cops first and decided that it could all wait until morning he knew he was jumping through hoops he didnt expect to find anything the locals had missed at best he could reassure the family that everything possible had been done next morning he made a few phone calls from his office trying to find someone who could be bothered to answer some casual questions from an edinburgh colleague he had one ally detective sergeant hendry at dunfermline cid but only reached him at the third attempt he asked hendry for a favour then put the phone down and got back to his own work but it was hard to concentrate he kept thinking about bowhill and about janis mee nee playfair which led him eventually guiltily to thoughts of damon younger runaways tended to take the same route by bus or train or hitching and to london newcastle edinburgh or glasgow there were organizations who would keep an eye open for runaways and even if they wouldnt always reveal their whereabouts to the anxious families at least they could confirm that someone was alive and unharmed but a twentythreeyearold someone a bit cannier and with money to hand could be anywhere no destination was too distant he owned a passport and it hadnt turned up rebus knew too that damon had a current account at the local bank complete with cashcard and an interestbearing account with a building society in kirkcaldy the bank might be worth trying rebus picked up the telephone again the manager at first insisted that hed need something in writing but relented when rebus promised to fax him later rebus held while the manager went off to check and had doodled half a village complete with stream parkland and school by the time the man came back the most recent withdrawal was from a cash machine in kirkcaldy one hundred pounds on the twentysecond what time ive no way of knowing no other withdrawals since then no how uptodate is that information very of course a cheque especially if postdated would take longer to show up could you keep tabs on that account let me know if anyone starts using it again i could but id need it in writing and i might also need head office approval well see what you can do mr brayne its bain the bank manager said coldly putting down the phone ds hendry didnt get back to him until late afternoon gaitanos hendry said i dont know the place personally locals call it guisers its a pretty choice establishment two stabbings last year one inside the club itself the other in the back alley where the owner parks his merc local residents are always girning about the noise when the place lets out whats the owners name charles mackenzie nicknamed charmer he seems to be clean a couple of uniforms talked to him about damon mee but there was nothing to tell know how many missing persons there are every year theyre not exactly a whitehot priority god knows there are times ive felt like doing a runner myself havent we all did the woolly suits talk to anyone else at the club such as bar staff punters no someone did take a look at the security video for the night damon was there but they didnt see anything wheres the video now back with its rightful owner am i going to be stepping on toes if i ask to see it i think i can cover you i know you said this was personal john but why the interest im not sure i can explain there were words community history memory but rebus didnt think theyd be enough they mustnt be working you hard enough over there just the twentyfour hours every day three matty paine could tell a few stories hed worked his way round the world as a croupier cruise liners hed worked on and in nevada hed spent a couple of years in london dealing out cards and spinning the wheel for some of the wealthiest in the land faces youd recognize from the tv and the papers moguls royalty stars matty had seen them all but his best story the one people sometimes disbelieved was about the time hed been recruited to work in a casino in beirut this was at the height of the civil war bomb sites and rubble smoke and charred buildings refugees and regular bursts of smallarms fire and amazingly in the midst of it all or to be fair on the edge of it all a casino not exactly legal run from a hotel basement with torchlight when the generator failed and not much in the way of refreshments but with no shortage of punters cash bets dollars only and a management team of three who prowled the place like dobermanns since there was no surveillance and no other way to check that the games were being played honestly one of them had stood next to matty for a full forty minutes one session making him sweat despite the airconditioning hed reminded matty of the gaffers casinos employed to check on apprentices he knew the gaffers were there to protect him as much as the punters there were professional gamblers out there whod psych out a trainee watch them for hours whole nights and weeks looking for the flaw that would give them an edge over the house like when you were starting out you didnt always vary the force with which you span the wheel or sent the ball rolling and if they could suss it theyd get a pretty good idea which quadrant the ball was going to stop in good croupiers were immune to this a really good croupier one of a very select very highly thought of group could master the wheel and get the ball to land pretty well where they wanted of course this might be against the interests of the house too and in the end thats why the checkers were out there patrolling the tables they were looking out for the house in the end it all came down to the house and when things had got a wee bit too hot in london matty had come home meaning edinburgh though really he was from gullane perhaps the only boy ever to be raised there and not show the slightest interest in golf his father had played his mother too come to that maybe she still did he didnt keep in touch there had been an awkward moment at the casino when a neighbour from gullane days an old business friend of his fathers had turned up a bit the worse for wear and in tow with three other middleaged punters the neighbour had glanced towards matty from time to time but had eventually shaken his head unable to place the face does he know you one of the allseeing gaffers had asked quietly seeking out some scam against the house matty had shaken his head a neighbour from when i was growing up that was all just a ghost from the past he supposed his mother was still alive he could probably find out by opening the phone book but he wasnt that interested place your bets please ladies and gentlemen different houses had different styles you either did your spiel in english or french house rules changed too mattys strengths were roulette and blackjack but really he was happy in charge of any sort of game most houses liked that he was flexible it meant there was less chance of him trying some scam it was the onenote wonders who tried small stupid diddles his latest employers seemed fairly laid back they ran a clean casino which boasted only the very occasional high roller most of the punters were business people well enough heeled but canny with it you got husbands and wives coming in proof of a relaxed atmosphere there were younger punters too a lot of those were asians mainly chinese the money they changed according to the cashier had a funny feel and smell to it thats because they keep it in their underwear the day boss had told her the asians whatever they were sometimes worked in local restaurants you could smell the kitchen on their crumpled jackets and shirts fierce gamblers no game was ever played quickly enough for their liking theyd slap their chips down like they were in a playground betting game and they talked a lot almost never in english the gaffers didnt like that never could tell what they might be scheming but their money was good they seldom caused trouble and they lost a percentage same as everyone else daft bastards the night manager said know what they do with a big win go bung it on the geegees wheres the sense in that where indeed no point giving your money to a bookmaker when the casino would happily take it instead it wasnt really on for croupiers to be friends with the clients but sometimes it happened and it couldnt very well not happen with matty and stevie scoular since theyd been in the same year at school not that theyd known one another well stevie had been the football genius also more than fair at the hundred and two hundred metres swimming and basketball matty on the other hand had skived off games whenever possible forgetting to bring his kit or getting his mum to write him notes he was good at a couple of subjects maths and woodwork but never sat beside stevie in class they even lived at opposite ends of the town at playtime and lunchtime matty ran a card game threecard brag mostly sometimes pontoon playing for dinner money pocket money sweets and comics a few of the cards were nicked at the corners but the other players didnt seem to notice and matty got a reputation as lucky hed take bets on horse races too sometimes passing the bets onto an older boy who wouldnt be turned away by the local bookmaker often though matty would simply pocket the money and if someones horse happened to win hed say he couldnt get the bets on in time and hand back the stake he couldnt tell you exactly when it was that stevie had started spending less breaktime dribbling past half a dozen despairing pairs of legs and more hanging around the edges of the card school thing about threecard brag it doesnt take long to pick it up and even a moron can have a stab at playing soon enough stevie was losing his dinner money with the rest of them and mattys pockets were about bursting with loose change eventually stevie had seemed to see sense drifted away from the game and back to keepieup and dribbling but hed been hooked no doubt about it maybe only for a few weeks but a lot of those lunchtimes had been spent cadging sweets and apple cores the better to stave off hunger even then matty had thought hed be seeing stevie again it had just taken the best part of a decade that was all when stevie scoular walked into the casino people looked his way it was the done thing he was a sharp dresser young usually accompanied by women who looked like models when stevie had first walked into the morvena mattys heart had sunk they hadnt seen one another since school and here stevie was local boy made good a hero picture in the papers and plenty of money in the bank here was a schoolboy dream made flesh and what was matty he had stories he could tell but that was about it so hed been hoping stevie wouldnt grace his table or if he did that he wouldnt recognize him but stevie had seen him seemed to know him straight off and come bouncing up matty hello there stevieit was flattering really stevie hadn become bigheaded or anything he took the whole thing the way his life had gone as a bit of a joke really hed made matty promise to meet him for a drink when his shift was over all through their conversation matty had been aware of gaffers hovering and when stevie wandered off to another table one of them muttered in mattys ear and another croupier took over from him he hadnt been in the plush back office that often just for the initial interview and to discuss a couple of big losses on his table the casinos owner mr mandelson was watching a football match on sky sports he was wellbuilt midforties his face pockmarked from childhood acne his hair was black slicked back from the forehead long at the collar he always seemed to know what he was about hows the table tonight he asked look mr mandelson i know were not supposed to be too friendly with the punters but stevie and me were at school together havent clapped eyes on one another since not till tonight easy matty easy mandelson motioned for him to sit down something to drink a smile no alcohol on shift mind ehh a coke maybe help yourself there was a fridge in the far corner stocked with white wine champagne and soft drinks a couple of the female croupiers said mandelson had tried it on with them plying them with booze but he didnt seem upset by a refusal they still had their jobs there were seven female croupiers all told and only two had spoken to matty about it it made him wonder about the other five he took a coke and sat down again so you and stevie scoular eh i havent seen him in here before i think he only recently found out about the place hes been in a few times dropped some hefty bets mandelson was staring at him you and stevie eh look if youre worried just take me off whatever table hes playing nothing like that matty mandelsons face broke into a grin its nice to have a friend eh nice to meet up again after all these years dont you worry about anything stevies the king of edinburgh as long as he keeps scoring goals were all his subjects he paused nice to know someone who knows the king almost makes me feel like royalty myself on you go now matty matty got up leaving the coke unopened and dont you go upsetting that young man we dont want to put him off his game do we four it had taken a couple of days to get the tape from gaitanos at first they thought theyd wiped it and then theyd sent the wrong days recording but at last rebus had the right tape and had watched it at home half a dozen times before deciding he could use someone who knew what he was doing and a video machine that would freezeframe without the screen looking like a technical problem now hed seen all there was to see hed watched a young man cease to exist of course hendry was right a lot of people disappeared every year sometimes they turned up again dead or alive and sometimes they didnt what did it have to do with rebus beyond the promise to a family that hed make sure the fife police hadnt missed something maybe the pull wasnt damon mee but bowhill itself and maybe even then the bowhill of his past rather than the town as it stood today he was working the damon mee case in his free time which since he was on day shift at st leonard s meant the evenings hed checked again with the bank no money had been withdrawn from any machines since the twentysecond and with damons building society no money had been withdrawn from that account either even this wasnt unknown in the case of a runaway sometimes they wanted to shed their whole history which meant ditching their identity and everything that went with it rebus had passed a description of matty to hostels and dropin centres in edinburgh and faxed the same description to similar centres in glasgow newcastle aberdeen and london hed also faxed details to the national missing persons bureau in london he checked with a colleague who knew about mispers that hed done about all he could not far off it she confirmed its like looking for a needle in a haystack without knowing which field to start with how big a problem is it she puffed out her cheeks last figures i saw were for the whole of britain i think there are around a year those are the reported mispers you can add a few thousand for the ones nobody notices theres a nice distinction actually if nobody knows youre missing are you really missing afterwards rebus telephoned jams mee and told her she might think about running up some flyers and putting them up in positions of prominence in nearby towns maybe even handing them out to saturday shoppers or evening drinkers in kirkcaldy a photo of damon a brief physical description and what he was wearing the night he left she said shed already thought of doing so but that it made his disappearance seem so final then she broke down and cried and john rebus thirtyodd miles away asked if she wanted him to drop by ill be all right she said sure well rebus reasoned that he was going to go to fife anyway he had to drop the tape back to gaitanos and wanted to see the club when it was lively hed take the photos of damon with him and show them around hed ask about the candyfloss blonde the technician who had worked with the videotape had transferred a still to his computer and managed to boost the quality rebus had some hard copies in his pocket maybe other people whod been queuing at the bar would remember something maybe his first stop however was the cemetery he didnt have any flowers to put on his parents grave but he crouched beside it fingers touching the grass the inscription was simple just names and dates really and underneath not dead but at rest in the arms of the lord he wasnt sure whose idea that had been not his certainly the headstones carved lettering was inlaid with gold but it had already faded from his mothers name he touched the surface of the marble expecting it to be cold but finding a residual warmth there a blackbird nearby was trying to worry food from the ground rebus wished it luck by the time he reached janiss brian was home from work rebus told them what hed done so far after which brian nodded apologized and said he had a burns club meeting the two men shook hands when the door closed janis and rebus exchanged a look and then a smile i see that bruise finally faded she said rebus rubbed his right cheek it was a hell of a punch tunny how strong you can get when youre angry sorry she laughed bit late to apologize it was just it was everything she said summer holidays coming up all of us leaving school you going off to join the army the last school dance before all of that thats what it was she paused do you know what happened to mitch she watched rebus shake his head last i heard she said he was living somewhere down south the two of you used to be so close yes she laughed again johnny it was a long time ago dont look so solemn she paused ive sometimes wondered ach not for years but just now and then i used to wonder what would have happened if you hadnt punched me she nodded if wed stayed together well you cant turn the clock back eh would the world be any better if we could she stared at the window not really seeing it damon would still be here she said quietly a tear escaped her eye and she fussed for a handkerchief in her pocket rebus got up and made towards her then the front door opened and he retreated my mum janis smiled she usually pops in around this time its like a railway station around here hard to find any privacy then mrs playfair walked into the living room hello inspector thought that was your car is there any news im afraid not rebus said janis got to her feet and hugged her mother the crying starting afresh there there pet mrs playfair said quietly there there rebus walked past the two of them without saying a word it was still early when he reached gaitanos he had a word with one of the bouncers who was keeping warm in the lobby until things started getting busy and the man lumbered off to fetch charles mackenzie aka charmer it seemed strange to rebus here he was standing in the very foyer hed stared at for so long on the video monitor the camera was high up in one corner with nothing to show whether it was working rebus gave it a wave anyway if he disappeared tonight it could be his farewell to the world inspector rebus theyd spoken on the phone the man who came forward to shake rebuss hand stood about five feet four and was as thin as a cocktail glass rebus placed him in his midfifties he wore a powderblue suit and an opennecked white shirt with suntan and gold jewellery beneath his hair was silver and thinning but as wellcut as the suit come through to the office rebus followed mackenzie down a carpeted corridor to a glossblack door with a sign on it saying private there was no door handle mackenzie unlocked the door and motioned for rebus to go in after you sir rebus said you never knew what could be waiting behind a locked door what greeted rebus this time was an office which seemed to double as a broomcupboard mops and a vacuum cleaner rested against one wall a bank of screens spread across three filing cabinets showed what was happening inside and outside the club unlike the video rebus had watched these screens each showed a certain location are these recording rebus asked mackenzie shook his head weve got a roaming monitor and thats the only recording we get but this way if we spot trouble anywhere we can watch it unfold like that knifing in the alley messed up my mercedes so i heard is that when you called the police when your car stopped being a bystander mackenzie laughed and wagged a finger but didnt answer rebus couldnt see where hed earned his nickname the guy had all the charm of sandpaper i brought back your video rebus placed it on the desk all right to record over it now i suppose so rebus handed over the computerenhanced photograph the missing person is slightly right of centre second row is that his doll do you know her wish i did you havent seen her before she doesnt look the sort id forget rebus took back the picture mind if i show this around the place is practically empty i thought i might stick around mackenzie frowned and studied the backs of his hands well you know its not that i dont want to help or anything but well its hardly conducive to a party atmosphere is it thats our slogan the best party of your life every night and i dont think a police officer mooching around asking questions is going to add to the ambience i quite understand mr mackenzie i was being thoughtless mackenzie lifted his hands palms towards rebus no problem the hands were saying and youre quite right rebus continued in fact id be a lot quicker if i had some assistance say a dozen uniforms that way i wouldnt be mooching around for nearly so long in fact lets make it a couple of dozen well be in and out quick as a virgins first poke mind if i use your phone whoah wait a minute look all i was saying was look how much do you want sorry sir mackenzie reached into a desk drawer lifted out a brick of twenties pulled about five notes free will this do it rebus sat back am i to understand youre trying to offer me a cash incentive to leave the premises whatever just slope off eh rebus stood up to me mr mackenzie thats an open invitation to stay so he stayed the looks he got from staff made him feel like a football fan trapped on the oppositions turf the way they all shook their heads as soon as he held up the photo he knew word had gone around he had a little more luck with the punters a couple of lads had seen the woman before last week was it one asked the other maybe the week before not long ago anyway the other agreed cracker isnt she has she been in since havent seen her just that one night didnt quite get the nerve up to ask for a dance was she with anyone no idea they didnt recognize damon mee though they said they never paid much attention to blokes were not that way inclined sweetie the place was still only half full but the bass was loud enough to make rebus feel queasy he managed to order an orange juice at the bar and just sat there looking at the photo the woman interested him the way her head was angled the way her mouth was open she could have been saying something to damon a minute later he was gone had she said shed meet him somewhere had something happened at that meeting hed shown the photo to damons mates from that night they remembered seeing her but swore damon hadnt introduced himself she seemed sort of cold one of them had said you know like she wanted to be left alone rebus had studied the video again watched her progress towards the bar showing no apparent interest in damons leaving but then shed turned and started pushing her way back through the throng no drink to show for her long wait at midnight exactly shed left the nightclub the final shot was of her turning left along the pavement watched by a few people who were waiting to get in and now charles mackenzie wanted to give rebus money at three quid for an orange juice maybe he should have taken it if the place had been heaving maybe he wouldnt have noticed them he was finishing his second drink and trying not to feel like a leper in a childrens ward when he recognized one of the doormen there was another man with him tall and fat and pale his idea of clubbing was probably the connection of baseball bat to skull the bouncer was pointing rebus out to him here we go rebus thought theyve brought in the professionals the fat man said something to the bouncer and they both retreated to the foyer leaving rebus with an empty glass and only one good reason to order another drink get it over with he thought sliding from his bar stool and walking around the dance floor there was always the fire exit but it led on to the alley and if they were waiting for him there the only witness would be mackenzies mercedes he wanted things kept as public as possible the street outside would be busy no shortage of onlookers and possible good samaritans or at the very least someone to call for an ambulance he paused in the foyer and saw that the bouncer was back at his post on the front door no sign of the fat man then he glanced along the corridor towards mackenzies office and saw the fat man planted outside the door he had his arms folded in front of him and wasnt going anywhere rebus walked outside the air had seldom tasted so good he tried to calm himself with a few deep breaths there was a car parked at the kerbside a goldcoloured rollsroyce with nobody in the drivers seat rebus wasnt the only one admiring the car but he was probably alone in memorizing its number plate he moved his own car to where he could see the roller then sat tight half an hour later the fat man emerged looking to left and right he walked to the car unlocked it and held open the back door only now did another figure emerge from the club rebus caught a swishing fulllength black coat sleek hair and chiselled face the man slipped into the car and the fat man closed the door and squeezed in behind the steering wheel like them or not you had to admire rollers they carried tonnage five back in edinburgh he parked his car and sat in it smoking his eleventh cigarette of the day he sometimes played this game with himself ill have one more tonight and deduct one from tomorrows allowance or he would argue that any cigarette after midnight came from the next days stash hed lost count along the way but reckoned by now he should be going whole days without a ciggie to balance the books well when it came down to it ten cigarettes a day or twelve thirteen fourteen what difference did it make the street he was parked on was quiet residential for the most part with big houses there was a basement bar on the corner but it did mostly lunchtime business from the offices on neighbouring streets by ten the place was usually locked up taxis rippled past him and the occasional drunk hands in pockets would weave slowly homewards a few of the taxis stopped just in front of him and disgorged their fares who would then climb half a dozen steps and push open the door to the morvena casino rebus had never been inside the place he placed the occasional bet on the horses but that was about it gave up doing the football pools he bought a national lottery ticket when opportunity arose but often didnt get round to checking the numbers he had half a dozen tickets lying around any one of which could be his fortune he quite liked the notion that he might have won a million and not know it preferred it in fact to the idea of actually having the million in his bank account what would he do with a million pounds same as hed do with fifty thou selfdestruct only faster jams had asked him about mitch roy mitchell rebuss best friend at school the more time rebus had spent with her the less hed seen of mitch theyd been going to join the army together hoping they might get the same regiment until mitch lost his eye that had been the end of that the army hadnt wanted him any more rebus had headed off sent mitch a couple of letters but by the time his first leave came mitch had already left bowhill rebus had stopped writing after that when the morvenas door opened next it was so eight or nine young people could leave the shift changeover three of them turned one way the rest another rebus watched the group of three at the first set of lights two kept going and one crossed the road and took a left rebus started his engine and followed when the lights turned green he signalled left and sounded his horn then pulled the car over and wound down his window mr rebus the young man said hello matty lets go for a drive officers from other cities people rebus met from time to time would remark on how cushy he had it in edinburgh such a beautiful place and prosperous so little crime they thought to be dangerous a city had to look dangerous london manchester liverpool these places were dangerous in their eyes not edinburgh not this sleepy walkingtour with its monuments and museums tourism aside the lifeblood of the city was its commerce and edinburgh s commerce banking insurance and the like was discreet the city hid its secrets well and its vices too potentially troublesome elements had been moved to the sprawling council estates which ringed the capital and any crimes committed behind the thick stone walls of the city centres tenements and houses were often muffled by those same walls which was why every good detective needed his contacts rebus took them on a circuit canonmills to ferry road back up to comely bank and through stockbridge into the new town again and they talked i know we had a sort of gentlemans agreement matty rebus said but im about to find out youre no gentleman rebus smiled youre ahead of me i wondered how long it would take matty paused stared through the windscreen you know ill say no will you i said at the start no ratting on anyone i work with or work for just the punters not even many of them its not like ive been milking you matty ill bet youve dozens of stories you havent told me i work tables mr rebus people dont place a bet and then start yacking about some job theyve pulled or some scam theyre running no but they meet friends they have a drink get mellow its a relaxing place so ive heard and maybe then they talk ive not held anything back matty matty rebus shook his head its funny i was just thinking tonight about that night we met do you remember how could he forget a couple of drinks after work a car borrowed from a friend who was away on holiday matty hadnt been back long driving through the town was great especially with a buzz on streets glistening after the rain late night mostly taxis for company he just drove and drove and as the streets grew quieter he pushed the accelerator a bit further caught a string of green lights then saw one turning red he didnt know how good the tyres were imagined braking hard and skidding in the wet fuck it he put his foot down just missed the cyclist the guy was coming through on green and had to twist his front wheel hard to avoid contact then teetered and fell onto the road mattys foot eased off the accelerator thought about the brake then went back on the accelerator again thats when he saw the cop car and thought i cant afford this theyd breathalysed him and taken him to st leonard s where hed sat around and let the machinery chew him up would it come to a trial would there be a report in the papers how could he keep his name from getting around hed worked himself up into a right state by the time detective inspector john rebus had sat down across from him i cant afford this matty had blurted out sorry hed swallowed and tried to find a story work in a casino any black mark against me theyll boot me out look if its a question of compensation or anything like ill buy him a new bike rebus had picked up a sheet of paper drunk driving in a borrowed car you werent insured to drive running a red light leaving the scene of an accident rebus had shaken his head read the sheet through one more time and then put it down and looked up at matty what casino did you say you work for later hed given matty two business cards both with his phone number the first ones for you to tear up in disgust hed said the other ones to keep have we got a deal look mr rebus matty said now as the car stopped for lights on raeburn place im doing the best i can i want to know whats happening behind the scenes at the morvena i wouldnt know anything at all it doesnt matter how small it seems any stories gossip anything overheard ever seen the owner entertain people in his office maybe open the place for a private party names faces anything at all put your mind to it matty just put your mind to it theyd skin me alive whos they matty swallowed mr mandelson hes the owner right right on paper at least what i need to know is who might be pulling his strings i cant see anyone pulling his strings youd be surprised hard bastard is he id say so given you grief matty shook his head do you see much of him not much matty said not he might have added until recently at any rate rebus dropped him at the foot of broughton street headed back up to leith walk and along york place onto queen street he passed the casino again and slowed a frown on his face at the next set of lights he did a uturn so he could be sure yes it was the roller from gaitanos no doubt about it parked outside the morvena six mind if i join you rebus was eating breakfast in the canteen and wishing there was more caffeine in the coffee or more coffee in the coffee come to that he nodded to the empty chair and siobhan sat down heavy night she said believe it or not i was on orange juice she bit into her muffin washing it down with milk harry tells me you had him working a tape harry our video wizard he said it was a missing person news to me its not official the son of an old schoolfriend of mine standing at a bar one minute and gone the next rebus looked at her and she smiled harrys a great one for gossip im working on it in my own time need any help handy with a crystal ball are you but rebus dug into his pocket and brought out the still from the video thats damon there he said pointing whos that with him i wish i knew shes not with him i dont know who she is youve asked around i was at the club last night a few punters remembered her male punters she waited till rebus nodded you were asking the wrong sex any man would have given her the onceover but only superficially a woman on the other hand would have seen her as competition have you never noticed women in nightclubs theyve got eyes like lasers plus what if she visited the loo rebus was interested now what if she did thats where women talk maybe someone spoke to her maybe she said something back ears would have been listening siobhan stared at the photo funny its almost like shes got an aura how do you mean like shes shining interior light exactly no thats what your friend harry said its the interior lighting that gives that effect maybe he didnt know what he was saying im not sure i know what youre saying some religions believe in spirit guides theyre supposed to lead you to the next world you mean this ones not the end she smiled depends on your religion well its plenty enough for me he looked at the photo again i was sort of joking you know about her being a spirit guide i know he met with helen cousins that night they spoke over a drink in the auld hoose rebus hadnt been in the place in quarter of a century and thered been changes theyd installed a pool table you werent invited along that night rebus asked her she shook her head she was twenty three years younger than damon the fingers of her right hand played with her engagement ring rolling it sliding it off over the knuckle and then back down again she had short lifeless brown hair dark tired eyes and acne around her mouth i was out with the girls see that was how we played it one night a week the boys would go off on their own and wed go somewhere else then another night wed all get together do you know anyone who was at gaitanos that night apart from damon and his pals she chewed her bottom lip while considering the ring came off her finger and bounced once before hitting the floor she stooped to pick it up its always doing that you better watch it youre going to lose it she pushed the ring back on yes she said corinne and jacky were there corinne and jacky she nodded where can i find them a phone call brought them to the auld hoose rebus got in the round bacardi and coke for corinne bacardi and blackcurrant for jacky a second vodka and orange for helen and another bottle of noalcohol lager for himself he eyed the optics behind the bar his mean little drink was costing more than a whisky something was telling him to indulge in a teachers maybe its my spirit guide he thought dismissing the idea corinne had long black hair crimped with curling tongs her pal jacky was tiny with dyed platinum hair when he got back to the table they were in a huddle exchanging gossip rebus took out the photograph again look corinne said theres damon so they all had a good look then rebus touched his finger to the strapless aura remember her helen prickled visibly who is she yeah she was there jacky said was she with anyone didnt see her up dancing isnt that why people go to clubs well its one reason all three broke into a giggle you didnt speak to her no not even in the toilets i saw her in there corinne said she was doing her eyes did she say anything she seemed sort of stuckup snobby jacky agreed rebus tried to think of another question and couldnt they ignored him for a while as they exchanged news it was like they hadnt seen each other in a year at one point helen got up to use the toilet rebus expected the other two to accompany her but only corinne did so he sat with jacky for a moment then for want of anything else to say asked her what she thought of damon he meant about damon disappearing but she didnt take it that way ach hes all right just all right well you know damons hearts in the right place but hes a bit thick a bit slow i mean really the impression rebus had received from damons family had been of a genius in waiting he suddenly realized just how superficial his own portrait of damon was siobhans words should have been warning so far hed heard only one side of damon helen likes him though i suppose so theyre engaged it happens doesnt it ive got friends who got engaged just so they could throw a party she looked around the bar then leant towards him they used to have some mega arguments what about jealousy i suppose shed see him notice someone or hed say shed been letting some guy chat her up just the usual she turned the photo around so it faced her she looks like a dream doesnt she i remember she was dressed to kill made the rest of us spit but youd never seen her before jacky shook her head no no one seemed to have seen her before nobody knew who she was unlikely then that she was local were there any buses in that night that doesnt happen at gaitanos she told him its not in enough any more theres a new place in dunfermline that gets the busloads jacky tapped the photo you think shes gone off with damon rebus looked at her and saw behind the eyeliner to a sharp intelligence its possible he said quietly i dont think so she said she wouldnt be interested and he wouldnt have had the guts on his way home rebus dropped into st leonard s the amount he was paying in bridge tolls he was thinking about a season ticket there was a fax on his desk hed been promised it in the afternoon but thered been a delay it identified the owner of the rollsroyce as a mr richard mandelson with an address in juniper green mr mandelson had no criminal record outstanding whether for motoring offences or anything else rebus tried to imagine some poor parking warden trying to give the roller a ticket with the fat man behind the wheel there were a few more facts about mr mandelson including last known occupation casino manager seven matty and stevie scoular saw one another socially now stevie would sometimes phone and invite matty to some party or dinner or just for a drink at the same time as matty was flattered he did wonder what stevies angle was had even come out and asked him i mean hed said im just a toerag from the school playground and you well youre superstevie youre the king aye if you believe the papers stevie had finished his drink perrier he had a game the next day i dont know matty maybe its that i miss all that all what schooldays it was a laugh back then wasnt it matty had frowned not really remembering but the life youve got now stevie man people would kill for it and stevie had nodded looking suddenly sad another time a couple of kids had asked stevie for his autograph then had turned and asked matty for his thinking that whoever he was he had to be somebody stevie had laughed at that said something about it being a lesson in humility again matty didnt get it there were times when stevie seemed to be on a different planet maybe it was understandable the pressure he was under stevie seemed to remember a lot more about school than matty did teachers names the lot they talked about gullane too what a boring place to grow up sometimes they didnt talk much at all just took out a couple of dolls stevie would always bring one along for matty she wouldnt be quite as gorgeous as stevies but that was all right matty could understand that he was soaking it all up enjoying it while it lasted he had half an idea that stevie and him would be best friends for life and another that stevie would dump him soon and find some other distraction he thought stevie needed him right now much more than he needed stevie so he soaked up what he could started filing the stories away for future use tweaking them here and there tonight they took in a couple of bars a bit of a drive in stevies beamer he preferred bmws to porsches more space for passengers they ended up at a club but didnt stay long stevie had a game the next day he was always very conscientious that way perrier and early nights stevie dropped matty off outside his flat sounding the horn as he roared away matty hadnt spotted the other car but he heard a door opening looked across the road and recognized malibu straight off malibu was mr mandelsons driver hed eased himself out of the roller and was holding open the back door while looking over to matty so matty crossed the street as he did so he walked into malibu s shadow cast by the sodium street lamp at that moment though he didnt know what was about to happen he realized he was lost get in matty the voice of course was mandelsons matty got into the car and malibu closed the door after him then kept guard outside they werent going anywhere ever been in a roller before matty i dont think so youd remember if you had i could have had one years back but only by buying secondhand i wanted to wait until i had the cash for a nice new one that leather smell you dont get it with any other car mandelson lit a cigar the windows were closed and the car started filling with sour smoke know how i came to afford a brand new roller matty hard work mattys mouth was dry cars he thought rebuss stevies and now this one plus of course the one hed borrowed that night the one that had brought him to this dont be stupid my dad worked thirty years in a shop six days a week and he still couldnt have made the downpayment faith matty thats the key you have to believe in yourself and sometimes you have to trust other people strangers some of them or people you dont like people its hard to trust thats the gamble lifes making with you and if you place your bet sometimes you get lucky except its not luck not entirely see there are odds like in every game and thats where judgment comes in i like to think im a good judge of character only now did mandelson turn to look at him there seemed to matty to be nothing behind the eyes nothing at all yes sir he said for want of anything better that was stevie dropped you off eh matty nodded now your man stevie hes got something else something we havent discussed yet hes got a gift hes had to work of course but the thing was there to begin with dont ask me where it came from or why it should have been given to him in particular thats one for the philosophers and i dont claim to be a philosopher what i am is a businessman and a gambler only i dont bet on nags or dogs or a turn of the cards i bet on people im betting on you matty me mandelson nodded barely visible inside the cloud of smoke i want you to talk to stevie on my behalf i want you to get him to do me a favour matty rubbed his forehead with his fingers he knew what was coming but didnt want to hear it i saw a recent interview mandelson went on where he told the reporter he always gave a hundred and ten per cent all i want is to knock maybe twenty per cent off for next saturdays game you know what im saying next saturday an away tie at kirkcaldy stevie expected to run rings around the raith rovers defence he wont do it matty said come to that neither will i no mandelson laughed a hand landed on mattys thigh you fucked up in london son they knew youd end up taking a croupiers job somewhere else its the only thing you know how to do so they phoned around and eventually they phoned me i told them id never heard of you that can change matty want me to talk to them again id tell them you lied to them the first time mandelson shrugged i can live with that but what do you think theyll do to you matty they were pretty angry about whatever scheme it was you pulled id say they were furious matty felt like he was going to heave he was sweating his lungs toxic he wont do it he said again be persuasive matty youre his friend remind him that his tabs up to three and a half all he has to do is ease off for one game and the tabs history and matty ill know if youve talked to him or not so no games eh or you might find yourself with no place left to hide eight rebus searched his flat but came up with only half a dozen snapshots two of his exwife rhona posing with samantha their daughter back when sammy was seven or eight two further shots of sammy in her teens one showing his father as a young man kissing the woman who would become rebuss mother and a final photograph a family grouping showing uncles aunts and cousins whose names rebus didnt know there were other photographs of course at least there had been but not here not in the flat he guessed rhona still kept some maybe his brother michael had the others but they could be anywhere rebus hadnt thought of himself as the kind to spend long nights with the family album using it as a crutch to memory always with the fear that remembrance would yield to sentiment if i died tonight he thought what would i bequeath to the world looking around the answer was nothing the thought scared him and worst of all it made him want a drink and not just one drink but a dozen instead of which he drove north back into fife it had been overcast all day and the evening was warm he didnt know what he was doing knew he had precious little to say to either of damons parents and yet thats where he ended up hed had the destination in mind all along brian mee answered the door wearing a smart suit and just finishing knotting his tie sorry brian rebus said are you off out in ten minutes come in anyway is it damon rebus shook his head and saw the tension in brians face turn to relief yes a visit in person wouldnt be good news would it good news had to be given immediately by telephone not by a knock at the door rebus should have realized hed been the bearer of bad news often enough in his time sorry brian he repeated they were in the hallway janiss voice came from above asking who it was its johnny her husband called back then to rebus its all right to call you that of course its my name isnt it he could have added again after all this time he looked at brian remembering the way theyd sometimes mistreated him at school not that barney had seemed to mind but who could tell for sure and then that night of the last school dance brian had been there for mitch brian had been there rebus had not hed been too busy losing janis and losing consciousness she was coming downstairs now ill be back in a sec brian said heading up past her you look terrific rebus told her the blue dress was wellchosen her makeup highlighting all the right features of her busy face she managed a smile no news sorry he said again just thought id see how you are oh were pining away another smile tinged by shame this time its a dinnerdance we bought the tickets months back its for the jolly beggars nobody expects you to sit at home every night janis but all the same her cheeks grew flushed and her eyes sought his were not going to find him are we not easily our best bets that hell get in touch if he can she said quietly come on janis he put his hands on her shoulders like they were strangers and about to dance you might hear from him tomorrow or it might take months and meantime life goes on eh something like that she smiled again blinking back tears why dont you come with us john rebus dropped his hands from her shoulders i havent danced in years so youd be rusty thanks janis but not tonight know something i bet they play the same records we used to dance to at school it was his turn to smile brian was coming back downstairs patting his hair into place youd be welcome to join us johnny he said ive another appointment brian maybe next time eh lets make that a promise they went out to their cars together janis pecked him on the cheek brian shook his hand he watched them drive off then headed to the cemetery it was dark and the gates were locked so rebus sat in his car and smoked a cigarette he thought about his parents and the rest of his family and remembered stories about bowhill stories which seemed inextricable from family history mining tragedies a girl found drowned in the river ore a holiday car crash which had erased an entire family then there was johnny thomson celtic goalkeeper injured during an old firm match he was in his early twenties when he died and was buried behind those gates not far from rebuss parents not dead but at rest in the arms of the lord the lord had to be a bodybuilder from family he turned to friends and tried recalling a dozen names to put to faces he remembered from schooldays other friends people hed known in the army the sas all the people hed dealt with during his career in the police villains hed put away some whod slipped through his fingers people hed interviewed suspected questioned broken the worst kind of news to acquaintances from the oxford bar and all the other pubs where hed ever been a regular local shopkeepers jesus the list was endless all these people whod played a part in his life in shaping who he was and how he acted how he felt about things all of them out there somewhere and nowhere gathered together only inside his head and chief among them tonight brian and janis that night of the school dance it was true hed been drunk elated hed felt he could do anything be anything because hed come to a decision that day he wouldnt join the army hed stay in bowhill with janis apply for a job at the dockyard his dad had told him not to be so stupid shortsighted was the word hed used but what did parents know about their childrens desires so hed drunk some beer and headed off to the dance his thoughts only of janis tonight hed tell her and mitch of course hed have to tell mitch tell him hed be heading into the army alone but mitch wouldnt mind hed understand as best friends had to but while rebus had been outside with janis his friend mitch was being cornered by four teenagers who considered themselves his enemies this was their last chance for revenge and theyd gone in hard kicking and punching four against one until barney had waded in shrugging off blows and dragged mitch to safety but one kick had done the damage dislodging a retina mitchs vision stayed fuzzy in that eye for a few days then disappeared and where had rebus been out cold on the concrete by the bike sheds and why had he never thanked barney mee he blinked now and sniffed wondering if he was coming down with a cold hed had this idea when he came back to bowhill that the place would seem beyond redemption that hed be able to tell himself it had lost its sense of community become just another town for him to pass through maybe hed wanted to put it behind him well it hadnt worked he got out of the car and looked around the street was dead he reached up and hauled himself over the iron railings and walked a circuit of the cemetery for an hour or so and felt strangely at peace nine so whats the panic matty after a home draw with rangers stevie was ready for a night on the town oneone and of course hed scored his teams only goal the reporters would be busy filing their copy saying for the umpteenth time that he was his sides hero that without him they were a very ordinary team indeed rangers had known that stevies marker had been out for blood sliding studsfirst into tackles which stevie had done his damnedest to avoid hed come out of the game with a couple of fresh bruises and grazes a nick on one knee but to his managers all too palpable relief fit to play again midweek i said whats the panic matty had worried himself sleepless he knew he had several options speak to stevie that was one of them another was not to speak to him but tell mandelson he had then it would be down to whether or not mandelson believed him option three do a runner only mandelson was right about that he was running out of places to hide with two casino bosses out for his blood how could he ever pick up another croupiers job if he spoke with stevie hed lose a newfound friend but to stay silent well there was very little percentage in it so here he was in stevies flat having demanded to see him in the corner a tv was replaying a tape of the afternoons match there was no commentary just the sounds of the terraces and the dugouts no panic he said now playing for time stevie stared at him you all right want a drink or something maybe a vodka anything in it ill take it as it comes stevie poured him a drink matty had been here half an hour now and they still hadnt talked the telephone had hardly stopped reporters questions family and friends offering congratulations stevie had shrugged off the superlatives matty took the drink swallowed it wondering if he could still walk away then he remembered malibu and saw shadows falling thing is stevie he said you know my boss at the morvena mr mandelson i owe him money of course i know him he says we could do something about that what my tab stevie was checking himself in the mirror having changed into his onthetown clothes i dont get it he said well stevie matty thought it was nice knowing you pal all you have to do is ease off next saturday stevie frowned and turned from the mirror away to raith he came and sat down opposite matty he told you to tell me he waited till matty nodded that bastard whats in it for him matty wriggled on the leather sofa ive been thinking about it raith are going through a bad patch but you know yourself that if youre taken out of the equation then theyd be up against not very much my boss has told everybody to get the ball to me if they spend the whole game doing that and i dont do anything with it matty nodded what i think is the odds will be on you scoring nobodyll be expecting raith to put one in the net so mandelsons cash will be on a goalless draw and hell get odds spread a lot of small bets around bastard stevie said again how did he get you into this matty matty shifted again something i did in london secrets eh hard things to keep stevie got up went to the mirror again and just stood there hands by his sides staring into it there was no emotion in his voice when he spoke tell him he can fuck himself matty had to choke out the words you sure thats the message cheerio matty matty rose shakily to his feet what am i going to do cheerio matty stevie was as still as a statue as matty walked to the door and let himself out mandelson sat at his desk playing with a cartier pen hed taken from a punter that day the man was overdue on a payment the pen was by way of a gift so he asked matty matty sat on the chair and licked his lips there was no offer of a drink today this was just business malibu stood by the door matty took a deep breath the last act of a drowning man its on he said mandelson looked up at him stevie went for it eventually matty said youre sure as sure as i can be well that better be watertight or you might find yourself going for a swim with heavy legs know what i mean matty held the dark gaze and nodded mandelson glanced towards malibu both of them were smiling then he picked up the telephone you know matty he said pushing numbers im doing you a favour youre doing yourself a favour he listened to the receiver mr hamilton please then to matty see what youre doing here is saving your job i overstretched myself matty i wouldnt like that to get around but im trusting you if this comes off and it better then youve earned that trust he tapped the receiver it wasnt all my own money either but this will keep the morvena alive and kicking he motioned for matty to leave malibu tapped his shoulder as an incentive topper mandelson was saying as matty left the room its locked up how much are you in for matty bided his time and waited till his shift was over he walked out of the smart new town building like a latterday lazarus and found the nearest payphone then had to fumble through all the rubbish in his pockets stuff that must have meant something once upon a time until he found the card the card with a phone number on it the following saturday stevie scoular scored his teams only goal in their win over raith rovers and mandelson sat alone in his office his eyes on the teletext results his hand rested on the telephone receiver he was expecting a call from topper hamilton he couldnt seem to stop blinking like there was a grain of sand in either eye he buzzed the reception desk told them to tell malibu he was wanted mandelson didnt know how much time he had but he knew he would make it count a word with stevie scoular see if matty really had put the proposition to him then matty himself matty was a definite no matter what matty was about to be put out of the game the knock at the door had to be malibu mandelson barked for him to come in but when the door opened two strangers sauntered in like they owned the place mandelson sat back in his chair hands on the desk he was almost relieved when they introduced themselves as police officers im detective inspector rebus the younger one said this is chief superintendent watson and youve come about the benevolent fund right rebus sat down unasked his eyes drifting to the tv screen and the results posted there looks like you just lost a packet im sorry to hear it did topper take a beating too mandelson made fists of his hands that wee bastard rebus was shaking his head matty did his best only there was something he didnt know seems you didnt know either topper will be doubly disappointed what farmer watson still standing provided the answer ever heard of big ger cafferty mandelson nodded hes been in barlinnie a while used to be the biggest gangster on the east coast probably still is and hes a fan of stevies gets videotapes of all his games he almost sends him love letters mandelson frowned so so stevies covered rebus said try fucking with him youre asking big ger to bend over your little proposal has probably already made it back to cafferty mandelson swallowed and felt suddenly drymouthed there was no way stevie was going to throw that game rebus said quietly matty mandelson choked the sentence off told you it was fixed he was scared turdless what else was he going to say but mattys mine you dont touch him not that youd get the chance the farmer added not with topper and cafferty after your blood malibu will be a big help the way he took off five minutes ago in the roller watson walked up to the desk looming over mandelson like a mountain youve got two choices son you can talk or you can run youve got nothing i saw you that night at gaitanos rebus said if youre going to lay out big bets where better than fife optimistic raith fans might have bet on a goalless draw you got charmer mackenzie to place the bets locally spreading them around that way it looked less suspicious which was why mackenzie had wanted rebus out of there whatever the price hed been about to do some business besides rebus continued when it comes down to it what choice do you have you either talk to us the farmer said or you disappear people do it all the time and it never stops rebus could have added because its part of the dance shifting partners people you shared the floor with it all changed and it only ended when you disappeared from the hall and sometimes sometimes it didnt even end there all right mandelson said at last the way theyd known he would all colour gone from his face his voice hollow what do you want to know lets start with topper hamilton the farmer said sounding like a kid unwrapping his birthday present it was wednesday morning when rebus got the phone call from a mr bain it took him a moment to place the name damons bank manager yes mr bain what can i do for you damon mee inspector you wanted us to keep an eye on any transactions rebus leant forward in his chair thats right thereve been two withdrawals from cash machines both in central london rebus grabbed a pen where exactly tottenham court road was three days ago fifty pounds next day it was finsbury park same amount fifty pounds a day enough to live on enough to pay for a cheap bed and breakfast and two extra meals how much is left in the account mr bain a little under six hundred pounds enough for twelve days there were several ways it could go damon could get himself a job or when the money ran out he could try begging or he could return home rebus thanked bain and telephoned janis john she said we got a postcard this morning a postcard saying damon was in london and doing fine a postcard of apology for any fright hed given them a postcard saying he needed some time to get my head straight a postcard which ended see you soon the picture on the front was of a pair of breasts painted with union jacks brian thinks we should go down there janis said try to find him rebus thought of how many b ampbs thered be in finsbury park you might just chase him away he warned hes doing ok janis but why did he do it john i mean is it something we did new questions and fears had replaced the old ones rebus didnt know what to tell her he wasnt family and couldnt begin to answer her question didnt want to begin to answer it hes doing ok he repeated just give him some time she was crying now softly he imagined her with head bowed hair falling over the telephone receiver we did everything john you cant know how much weve given him we always put ourselves second never a minutes thought for anything but him janis he began she took a deep breath will you come and see me john rebus looked around the office eyes resting eventually on his own desk and the paperwork stacked there i cant janis id like to but i just cant see its not as if i he didnt know how he was going to finish the sentence but it didnt matter shed put her phone down he sat back in his chair and remembered dancing with her how brittle her body had seemed but that had been half a lifetime ago theyd made so many choices since it was time to let the past go siobhan clarke was at her desk she was looking at him then she mimed the drinking of a cup of coffee and he nodded and got to his feet did a little dance as he shuffled towards her afterword i wrote this novella a couple of years ago at the behest of my friend otto penzler the theme of vanishing has stayed with me ever since to the extent that i have in raymond chandlers phrase cannibalized part of it for a subplot in the subsequent fulllength rebus novel dead souls while altering the histories of the characters involved so that both can be read independently ian rankin
