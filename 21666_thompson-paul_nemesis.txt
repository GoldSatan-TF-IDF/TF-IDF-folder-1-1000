paul b thompson nemesis lens the evergray sky of rath darkened from pearl to slate before the agent moved hed spent a day and a night in his hiding place molded into a crevice between two large trees his hooded shroud took on the color and texture of bark and the special unguent on his hands and face had the same mimetic properties while he was hidden elves of the village had passed within arms length of him he could have struck them down with impunity but such were not his orders he had a specific target and his new masters did not tolerate deviation as shadows lengthened in the skyshroud forest the agent stirred his stiff aching limbs his legs burned with the sensation of a thousand needles pricking his skin but with his altered senses he was able to block out the discomfort just as he disregarded any feelings of hunger fear or remorse villagers went about their evening tasks greenish light from their foxfire lamps filtered down and for a moment the agent froze startled by his own faint shadow on the black water beneath the trees he craned his hooded head and saw the tree dwellers pass unconcernedly over him scaling their vine ladders and bridges with practiced ease the large tree house in the center of the settlement was his target the village had been denuded of warriors by the recent attack on the stronghold but a lone elderly elf in snakeskin armor leaned against the doorway of the targets home dont underestimate him his masters voice whispered inside his head what strength elves lose in age they make up for in skill he gave the old guard wide berth circling under the plank porch to the far side of the tree the enormous swamp elm a living pillar twenty feet wide ran straight through the center of the house on the trunks of their tree houses the elves cultivated a special type of graygreen lichen it looked harmless but when pressed it exuded an oil that made the tree too slippery to climb under ordinary circumstances it was meant to keep out hostile merfolk and large predatory snakes beneath his chameleon shroud the agent wore two pairs of black cloth pads one set had finger loops for his hands the other large bands to fit around his knees the pads exuded a sticky substance developed in the evincars own laboratory his master assured him it would defeat the elves lichen he sprang onto the trunk and stuck there like a wasp on a smear of honey he raised his right hand and knee and heaved them upward the pads adhered to the tree without a wobble soon his head was brushing the underside of the porch the climbing pads worked just as well on smooth boards and in moments he was on the porch the house was stillas it should be for its master was away fighting the evincar the targets shuttered window betrayed a hint of foxfire within was she still awake he inserted a finger between the shutter slats the kidneyshaped room beyond was hewn from the living tree there was a bed of boughs at the far end of the room away from the only door the target lay in the bed covered by a dappled green animal skin by the door a carved image of an angel held an open foxfire lamp the shutters were locked with a simple hook which easily yielded to his knife blade they swung out and he lifted a lean leg over the sill the figure in bed never stirred once in the room he closed the shutters and went to the door it was barred with a carved wooden beam as thick as his arm such primitive safety measures were useless against an agent of the evincar he crept to the bed removing the sticky pads from his hands as he went the agent knelt beside the bed and studied the face of his target she was the one all right how many days had he looked into her eyes and felt love how many days did it take the evincars minions to condition such feelings out of him with a sudden motion he yanked his knife from its sheath it wavered for a moment in the lamplight as the deepest vestiges of his old self struggled with his new loyalties he could not resist the blade slid quietly into the nest of soft boughs he took out the vial provided by the overlords and used the knife tip to pierce the wax seal on the stopper one drop is sufficient he was supposed to pour a single drop in the eye or on the lips but he saw something that made him change his method a feather headdress hung from a peg above the targets bed silently he plucked a single blue feather from the stylish array not so long ago hed worn feathers like this he dipped the feather into the vial and gently pulled it out clear liquid clung to the tip it smelled fresh like a field of newly mown grass he brought the feather to the sleeping girls mouth for a reason no one will ever know she sensed his nearness and awoke just as the elixir touched her lips her eyes opened wide the agent dropped the vial and feather and reached for his knife she must not scream no sound came from her slightly parted lips she was dead at the exact moment the deadly potion touched her livid lips her life was extinguished her eyes still soft with sleep stared sightlessly at her killer without a shudder he closed them his mission was only half done he quickly set about finding something to hide the body in an emerald snake hide would give him away in the dark so he cast about for a more suitable wrap he found a brown homespun blanket trade goods from some dal weaver and flung aside the animal skin the girls linen shift might rustle so he stripped it off in death her naked body resembled one of the evincars statues her pale skin translucent in the failing foxfire the agent swallowed three times trying to dislodge a strange lump in his throat noise outsideshouts and the clamor of a crowd startled he flung the blanket over the body a gentle knock on the door thundered through the small room avila are you awake said a female voice did you hear the cries your father returns hell be here shortly the agent hurried to the window his knife and the open vial of death elixir were still in the girls bed there was no time to retrieve them his arms were full avila avila are you all right when no one answered the womans tread could be heard rapidly retreating she called firanu firanu come quickly somethings amiss with avila no time for stealth now he burst through the shutters onto the porch he ran toward the high bridge platform pursuers would expect him to descend to a boat not climb higher in the trees as he rounded the curve of the great tree he came face to face with the elderly guard no doubt firanu he was armed with a barbed snakefang spear stand where you are or ill kill you the old elf said the agent stopped so suddenly that the blanket around his prize slipped down revealing his burdens lolling head avila the agent leaped and kicked the spear from firanus hand before the elderly elf could go for his knife the agent lowered his head and butted him squarely in the chest the steel skullcap he wore under his hood connected with firanus breastbone with a groan the old retainer pitched backward over the porch rail the sound of the crowd was getting louder a woman appeared a matronly elf with a strong family resemblance to the dead girl she saw the shadowy agent his face paint adjusted to the gray night she screamed kidnap kidnap my brothers child is taken she offered no resistance as he rushed by on his way to the bridge he pounded up carved steps three and four at a time on either side he could see the glow of lamps gathering he ran to a swinging bridge of planks and vines behind him someone shouted for help elves some armed gathered at both ends of the bridge one pointed at him and cried out the agent spared them a glance and began to run in earnest nothing matters but the completion of your mission not your life nor the life of any who oppose you a spearwielding elf appeared at the near end of the bridge the agent dropped his prize and sprang at his new foe before the elf could raise his weapon the wraithlike agent was on him bearing him down to the plank floor of the bridge they grappled and the agent used his steelclad head to bludgeon his enemy into submission blood streamed down the agents face mixing with the mimetic ointment he rolled the dead elfs body off the bridge and let it splash in the dark waters below he picked up the fallen warriors spear more torchbearing elves filled the landings at both ends of the bridge they were carrying whatever weapons came to handsnakefang maces flails treelimb knobkerriesbut luckily no bows he slung the blanketwrapped body over his shoulder elves filed onto the bridge there he is what is it a demon no demonsee it bleeds that brought forth calls for more of the agents blood he calmly positioned himself on the bridge and raised his captured spear a thrown mace hurtled past him he faced his nearest pursuers and bared his teeth in a snarl torchlight gleamed off his steel fangs a refinement his masters called it pulling his natural teeth and giving him these metal spikes now the angry elves hesitated transfixed by the weird apparition between them the spear was useless so he flung it at his pursuers he grabbed one of the bridges supporting vines and clamped down on it with his metal teeth the cable parted with a crack the left side of the bridge sagged elves began to scramble back to the platforms the agent turned and just as efficiently bit through another cable the broken bridge fell hed judged his place perfectly his portion of the bridge was just long enough to drag the surface of the water and stop before slamming into a tree trunk clasping his burden the agent plunged into the murky water his shroud and body paint took on the deep color of night and he was soon lost in darkness he knew it wasnt over the elves were master hunters and trackers by daylight they would be after him in force and his escape portal was far enough away that day would be well underway by the time he reached it failure is not an option you will complete your mission whatever the cost clasping the dead girls waist he swam faster light dispels darknessa fundamental principle a law of nature on every known world but on the plane of phyrexia nature does not exist on phyrexia light serves the dark it does not rule it the fourth level of this unnatural plane was the realm of great furnaces here were forged many of the components of phyrexias living machines around the clock for there is no night or day gangs of slave gremlins fed the scrap of redundant mechanisms into the milehigh furnaces molten metal was drawn off alloyed and tempered in greater automatic rolling mills and the resulting mixtures poured pressed or stamped into parts for new phyrexian machines if the gremlins faltered they too were recycled their ranks constantly renewed with more expendable laborers strange then was the mission of the gremlin dabir a minor gremlin of trifling wits he was best known for his reliability and his utter subservience to his masters his immediate overseer the vat priest paax had given him an unusual task dabir stood for hours before a shimmering portal to another plane impatiently awaiting the arrival of what was it again he was waiting for a sample paax said what sample the hulking paax extended an oiled acidetched arm until his black fingers were half an inch from dabirs beaked nose a blue spark arced from the demons hand and the gremlin collapsed on the greasy metal floor of the fourth sphere in agony ask not the will of your betters said paax his voice punctuated by tinny clicks he was bothered by a sticky breathing regulator only obey dabir picked himself up fingering his throbbing nose the smell of scorched flesh made even his feculent stomach churn dabir always obey great wise paax he whined paax swiveled his slender undercarriage and started away on four delicate articulated legs his rear mouth warned be at the portal at the appointed time receive the sample and deliver it to monitor at processing mill you know the penalty if you fail the vat priest maneuvered his bulky upper body around a steaming flue and was soon lost in the maze of heat exchangers and lubricant chases and so dabir waited by the open portala glowing pane twelve inches squarefor the sample he could see through the dimensional doorway glimpses of a world far removed from the inferno hed always known the surface of that distant place was soil and stone not oily metal and living plants waved in the wind if the gremlin got too close the portal would shimmer like the air near the mouths of the great furnaces fearful of damaging the ethereal portal dabir kept his distance he waited through an entire shift of work rubbing his haunches when they numbed from sitting so long he turned his back on the portal and laced his taloned fingers through his yellownailed toes bored as only a vapid gremlin can be bored suddenly there was a flash of blue light behind him he spun and saw the portal had enlarged itself four times a hooded figure was running across a plain of tall dry grass toward the portal pursued by a dozen flesh beings their mouths worked but dabir could not make out what they were saying sound did not traverse the portal several of the tall beings clad in painted hides and feathers nocked arrows and loosed them at the fleeing figure three arrows struck and bounced off a fourth found a chink in the agents armor and buried half its length in his back he staggered and for the first time dabir recognized the hooded figure bore a weighty bundle over his left shoulder hurry come dabir shouted uselessly he cared nothing about the wounded agent fearing instead his own punishment if the agent failed to reach the portal more arrows flashed a second broadhead found its mark and the shrouded figure fell pitching his burden to the ground dabir wet himself in terror he thrust his long arms into the vibrant portal a teasing sensation not unpleasant played over his oily skin the precious sample was just beyond his grasping claws galvanized by visions of his own lengthy and painful death dabir shoved his head through the dimensional window he felt cool air free of oil or soot then came the shouts of the hunters an indefinite light from above dazzled the gremlins eyes he reached out for the clothwrapped bundle his movements seemed slow as if he were swimming through thick oil instead of fresh open air his fingers felt oddly numb and the sensation was spreading up his arms desperately the gremlin snagged the edge of the wrapping with a tremendous heave of his long legs dabir pulled himself and the bundle back through the portal both landed with a thump on the gritty metal plates of the fourth sphere the portal began to dwindle the wounded agent raised a hand either in a final plea or in final salute dabir watched six tall beings surround the fallen figure they had spears shafts rose and fell in pitiless repetition as the portal shrank to a few inches then winked out dabir bobbed up on his knees he sat in the shadows cast by the eternal glare of the furnaces biting his own hands to restore feeling to them his normally glossy black skin had turned ash gray on those parts of his body hed stuck through the portal the numbness slowly faded but his color did not return a whiff of something delectable teased his formidable nose inserting it in a hole in the tattered blanket he sniffed the ugly white thing inside smelled like the air on the other side of the portal no oil no soot no tang of acid aerosols he replaced his nose with his tongue and gave the sample a quick lick flesh newly dead and still sweet the phyrexian agent had died to deliver a corpse dabir delivered the body to monitor as ordered and departed to other tasks monitor ran a laboratory for the analysis of organic specimens the monitor put the slender corpse on his examining table a chemical spray removed the creatures hair the phyrexian precisely measured every critical dimension of the body with calipers then carefully laid a square of flowsheet over the corpses head at the monitors command the tiny machines in the flowsheet crawled over the cold skin conforming themselves to every contour when they were done he had a perfect mold of the dead girls face monitor passed on the corpse to the necrometric unit for further processing body fluids were drained the blood was contaminated by poison and therefore useless a substitute would have to be used the flesh was carefully stripped off and sent to culture vats so the corpses tissues could be preserved for eventual reuse the sterilized polished bones were sent back to the monitor who applied his meticulous skills to them once more measuring them to the finest calibration of his instruments these figures were forwarded to the engine controlling the mighty apparatus of processing mill the rollers and stamping presses of the factory began to churn bars of duralumin and steel were fed into the machinery which formed a hard metal skeleton identical to the one measured by the monitor each bone was copied right down to the individual metacarpals of the hands and phalanges of the feet the girl had once broken her right arm and the calcified break was mirrored in the new duralumin humerus jointed and joined the sparkling new skeleton was sealed in a sterile copper shell to shield it from the everpresent oil rain of the fourth sphere gremlins loaded the shell into a pneumatic tube and sent it whistling away to the culture vats organs and tissues were refitted to the gleaming bones along with certain mechanical improvements added by phyrexian engineers the crude and wasteful processes of eating and sleeping were eliminated by filling the bodys veins with phyrexian glistening oil in lieu of ordinary blood the new body would have six times the speed and strength of the purely organic creature it was based on it would be resistant to heat and cold and its senses would surpass those of any elf or human as a final touch the mold made by monitor was used to restore the old face to the new creation the lifeless body was placed in another copper capsule and routed downward to the sixth sphere where it would await the attention of the inner circle member abcaldro servant of the dark lord of phyrexia himself she awoke standing in a domed circular room it was cold she looked down at her bare arms and legs flecked with goose pimples a moments concentration dispelled them as heat coursed through her veins how strange it was this shell of flesh strange and yet familiar she stood easily testing the articulation of her hands arms and legs breath plumed from her nose in soft wisps all parts worked all systems were in order the chill walls were blue glass polished and seamless without effort she calculated the height of the dome at feet she walked slowly toward the only other object in the room a fivefoothigh chrome tripod above which floated a small black sphere four inches in diameter some things she knew others she didnt she knew she was alive and on phyrexia she knew the periodic table of the elements the expansion rate of live steam in a turbine and the speed at which flowstone multiplied under optimum conditions she knew where to strike a human body to cause the most damage but she could also set a broken leg with her bare hands she did not know her own name that has not been decided yet said a calm genderless voice she darted away from the hovering sphere and crouched near the wall it wasnt fear that made her crouch fear was not in her design her posture was defensive a position from which to strike at the unseen speaker i am abcaldro your master stand up she obeyed speak you have the means said the voice who am i you are called belbe the name had two syllables bellbe what does it mean it derives from the ancient thran language beelbe it means a lens she went to the gleaming tripod in the center of the room lens a device that focuses to a point or spreads apart rays of light or other forms of energy she recited correct belbe looked at her hands do i focus light in your case the name is metaphorical as you are going among flesh beings you are therefore expected to have a name where am i going the plane of rath she closed her eyes and thought rath an artificial world created by our supreme master composed of flowstone nanomachines inhabiting its own plane at coordinates stop the command was mildly expressed but absolute belbe not only ceased speaking she ceased moving at all learn not to speak what youre thinking by so doing you give away too much and bore your listeners belbe remained immobile like a statue of flesh and metal speak commanded abcaldro i do only your will great one a strange liquid bubbling laughter filled the dome it subsided to a sigh listen well belbe you are going to rath soon as our emissary to that world our lens one might say the time approaches when rath will be in congruence with dominaria the prime plane of our ancestors when the conjunction of planes occurs all that is on rath will be on dominaria and all that is on dominaria will be on rath a pause true cold clutched at her fabricated heart even the mildest pique of the high priest raked her entrails like a razor blade of ice you were made to resemble the inhabitants of rath not your masters on phyrexia in fact the native environment of phyrexia is inimical to your existence which is why you must be kept in this environmental chamber until your departure you are as much like them as we could make you and that is an important parameter in your mission the governor of rath has abandoned his post for the sake of personal vengeance his dereliction is contrary to our purpose and it will not be tolerated a new evincar must be found to take his place you will choose the new evincar for us since natural selection is the best scalpel for dividing the weak from the strong allow the candidates to struggle among themselves until one of the specimens establishes himself as the superior candidate you will observe this struggle for us you may choose more bubbling laughter rippled through the chamber we give you leave to participate in the competition as you see fit only one task must remain inviolate under no circumstance is the conjunction of rath and dominaria to be altered delayed or interfered withby anyone do you understand yes great one you may encounter certain beings who by an accident of breeding have the power to pass from plane to plane these planeswalkers may attempt to thwart our plans to overlay dominaria you will not let them interfere your own life means nothing compared to the success of our plan is that clear she bowed with all the grace of her copied body it is master approach the sphere belbe closed within arms length of the black orb it floated a scant inch above the polished tripod the balls surface was smooth yet did not reflect her face as she gazed at it stand still belbe locked her legs in place the sphere silently rose and came to her it touched her at the base of her throat and for an instant she felt nothing the sphere melted into her flesh without breaking the skin or causing any bleeding pressure built inside her chest pushing on her newlyplaced organs she gasped with newfound pain this is our lens it will be the connection from you to us what is this feeling she whispered it is called pain as it is part of mortal existence you must learn to recognize it to rule creatures of flesh you must make pain your ally use it whenever you can belbe it is the foundation of power her mockblood roared in her ears she feared her heart would rupture her lungs collapse belbes vision filmed with gray and her breath caught in her throat she opened her mouth to scream but no sound came out her knees buckled stand the voice of abcaldro was no longer in her ears but inside her head despite intense pain belbe kept her feet she staggered against the tripod blinking through the haze of her suffering the tripod abruptly vanished and she stumbled forward blind and gasping something warm ran down her lip the eye is now in place you will soon adjust to its presence she heard the words but behind them there was something else behind the cool voice and godly demeanor of the high priest belbe sensed this sweet sweet the hall of flesh the song of blood what ancient joy too long have i sleptwhy in this shell i can walk a thousand worlds renew the sensations of lost millennia it is mine it is mine who is better than i i take them all in my hands caress them or crush them my little puppet my lens shrink from nothing please your maker belbe struck herself in the face with her open hand twice three times the thin shrieking voice submerged in the throb of her raging pulse she wiped glistening oil from her lip slowly the room came back into focus it seemed so empty without the orb and tripod she became aware of being watched she saw in her mind an image of herself standing naked under the cold glass dome the lens was workingshe was seeing herself as abcaldro saw her this frail creature was her standing erect on two thin legs belbe was the color of fresh parchment slightly flushed from her exertions a spray of pale blue freckles dotted her face and shoulders her hair an unruly shock of brown began at a peak in the center of her forehead and arched back over her high pointed ears along her arms legs buttocks and back were matte black lines in geometric patterns like tattoos but in fact were strips of reinforcing carbon fiber her face was angular her chin sharp thin white scars remained where her flesh had been reattached to her metallic skeleton she raised her eyes to the apex of the vault the azure glass gradually became transparent and belbe saw her hidden master peering down at her from outside the dome the room was feet in diametershe knew because her master knew it pressing against the clear shell was a mass of translucent tissue pulsing black veins distended with the same glistening oil that filled her blood vessels lined the shapeless body dozens of pseudopods as thick as her waist gripped the base of the dome drops of thick blue slime clung to the dome rhythmically twitching green bladders and complex multilobed organs were visible through the dirty gray protoplasm at the very peak of the dome was abcaldros true eye a swirling green and black iris fifteen inches wide a trio of redrimmed pupils in the center is this how you see me asked the high priest she nodded once slowly how does my appearance strike you my master is beautiful she said such power and efficiency must be beautiful the phyrexians liquid laughter resumed as the dome went opaque again one last warning little one on rath you will be on your own though backed by the power and authority of the dark lord you will succeed or fail by your own efforts i will not fail great one see that you dont it is time to leave the seamless floor split apart revealing dark descending steps humid sulfurous air wafted up from the hole unhesitatingly belbe went down the steps to a wide noisome corridor where four priests in full regalia stood waiting for her behind them was a full entourage of lesser constructs and functionaries and lastly a gang of gremlins bearing her new wardroberobes of woven chrome and onyx brocades headdresses of flashformed obsidian to the rear were the bearers of her arms and armor each piece had been forged in the fourth sphere from monitor s original specifications resulting in perfectly tailored armor that would fit no one but belbe the suit was made of black diamond the hardest substance on phyrexia it was so hard in fact it had to be shaped and cut with fluoric acid since no tools existed that could cut the plates the acid treatment left the armor matte black as dead a color as the lens now embedded in belbes chest she coughed and felt the first drops of sweat form under her arms the priests bowed as belbe passed she thought it odd the exalted clerics of phyrexia should bow to her a newly made creature more flesh than metal but then she heard a whisper deep inside saying my lens my eye their obeisance made sense it was not her they were bowing to it was their master monsters the room was crowded with elf warriors stained with sweat smoke and the blood of battle they had not assembled here to fight but to mourn their chieftains daughter was gone her fate unknown eladamri knelt by avilas empty bed monsters he said again i knew the evincar was vicious and unnatural but i didnt think he would stoop to this the fiend responsible will be found we swear it said gallan eladamris lieutenant the warriors around him grunted in agreement eladamri put his hand on the boughs where his daughter had lain this treachery soured his success at the stronghold his warriors had confronted volrath and his warlord greven ilvec and surviveda victory as signal as any ever recorded on rath now this he withdrew his aching hand bruised by recent combat the motion stirred the soft boughs revealing the soft glint of snake bone whats this the agents knife had fallen to the bottom of the bed beside it was a small glass vial still upright and a single blue feather i know this weapon it was plainly of elven make the garnet pommel bearing the intricate engraving of skyshroud artisans gallan whose knife is this eladamri asked sharply his lieutenant held the blade close in the poor light it wasnt easy to see the emblem is of the clan of carodonal yes eladamri stood tenesi it was too awful to believe but it was the evincars style all right avilas own fiance he was lost in a skirmish twenty nights past id hoped hed found death rather than capture but eladamri made a fist around the tiny glass vial whats that asked gallan something for our healers to study i think now my brothers dont dwell on whats happened volrath thinks he can frighten me into inaction by taking my child this will never happen from this moment i count avila among the dead let her name be added to the roll of warriors whove died to make our land free he fixed the narrow blue feather to the brow of his helmet it would be his talisman during the coming fight for freedom the next day the hunting party returned with the agents body tied hand and foot on a pole like a trophy snake though he had been altered with many phyrexian implants including a control rod in place of his spine every elf in the village recognized him as tenesi once the finest hunter in the skyshroud forest and the betrothed of the lost avila chapter prisoners ertai fell screaming into a tangled mass of rigging suspended from the side of the pursuing vessel in the last second before certain death a giant hand of rope snatched him from the empty air the airship predator reeling under accumulated battle damage scarcely noticed the addition of one to her complement she had an eight degree list to starboard her speed had fallen to a scant four knots and her steering gear was so damaged the ship could not maintain a straight course dead sailors and mogg goblinspredators boarding troopssprawled everywhere smoke billowed from hull scuttles along the battered starboard side filling the deck with choking black streamers into this chaos strode greven ilvec predators master the crewwhat was left of itdashed about in ratlike frenzy each man pursuing his own task greven shook his head in disgust not a brain to be found in any of them he spied four sailors by the starboard rail hacking at tangled rigging with cutlasses never mind that he roared leaning against the slant of the deck he shouted all free hands to the port side cant you feel the list do you want to capsize us but commander said one blade poised greven seized the man by the throat the sailors face purpled his cutlass clattered to the canted deck question me will you greven said seething the choking man could not reply worthless meat lightening the ship will solve two problems so saying he hurled the sailor over the side the remaining three scampered for their lives to the port side of the ship predator trembled and a forward hatch cover blew off a jet of flame erupted from the hold the heavy hatch cover passed within a fingers breadth of grevens headthe wind of its passing cooled his cheekbut he never flinched the shrieks of men burning in the engine room below had as little effect engineer dead stop direct all power to lift firefighters to the forward hold now the rest of you form a work party and clear the decks his voice cut through the terror and confusion and predators crew fell to saving their battered ship thanks to greven and the fearful discipline he instilled the airship slowly righted itself and maintained its altitude stepping over deck wreckage greven reached the forecastle here the ship had taken most of its punishment bulwarks were shattered the alloy casing peeled back like gray flower petals colliding with the closed portal had caused the worst damage the ships prow had been crushed backward to the fourth hull frame the serrated ram had broken off and was lying at the bottom of portal canyon somewhere the forward harpoon gun had been dismounted the barrel jammed into the upper boarding mandible overhead it would be days maybe weeks before such extensive structural damage could be repaired greven stood with his feet braced widely apart on the twisted deck and stared at the ancient portal through which weatherlight had vanished hed lost a battle something he seldom did and hed failed in his pursuit of the enemy something that had never happened before high atop the portal structure the great phyrexian control center styled like a fiercely staring face mocked grevens failure someday gerrard he muttered someday youll bleed for greven i swear it far below clinging to the rigging draped over the starboard side of predator young ertai debated his chances from this height he would never survive a fall to the ground he knew a flying spell but it required calm and the utmost concentrationnot very likely conditions at the moment he briefly considered hiding in the wreckage until predator landed but the rathi airship was still hovering and gave no sign of an intention to land ertais arms ached he couldnt hang on forever the only sane choice was to climb to the ship above talent like his should not be wasted on a meaningless death hed just begun to climb the skein of lines when a body hurtled past a sailor hit the rigging a few feet from ertai and the back of his shirt snagged on some wires he hung helplessly for a moment then his clothing slowly began to tear ertai and the sailors eyes met and for a few seconds ertai saw the approach of death in the mans eyes the sailor clawed at the rigging but he could not find a handhold as he tore free the only sound the man made with his mangled throat was a horribly muted gurgle ertai watched him fall with renewed purpose ertai resumed climbing the wire rigging tore his hands what a shame he thought such wellshaped expressive hands he had the old masters who had trained him in the nuance and gestures of spellcasting always complimented his fine hands now they were being cut to ribbons a greatand painfulshame the shouting from the hull above him abated predator climbed slowly ertai was a few yards below the keel when he heard a voice boom out prepare to clear away the fouled rigging his heart contracted into a hard knot when he saw axes and swords glinting above the rail they were going to chop his lifeline off he tried to climb faster but his feet kept tangling in the rats nest of metallic rope and wire when speed failed he fell back on his greatest asset his magic with one arm wrapped around a thick bundle of lines ertai used his other hand to begin the gestures of a spell the sailors at the rail awaited grevens command to cut away the downed rigging with a nod he set them to work the first sailor raised a heavy ax but before he could bring it down on the mass of lines it flew backward from his hand despite the strain of battle and their fear of greven the men laughed at their comrades apparent clumsiness the next sailor wielded a cutlass it tore out of his grasp and hurtled over the side more laughter the third man had a hatchet it left his hand and struck him between the eyes down he went bleeding from a serious gash in the forehead the laughter died greven approached he turned his head from side to side as if sniffing the wind magic who dares to cast spells on my ship he said aloud sailors stood by with blank looks haul up the rigging greven commanded ertai almost fainted from fatigue no one ever expected a sorcerer to cast spells onehanded while dangling a mile in the air he musedno one but ertai could have done it the last one was particularly satisfying seeing that yokel get his own hatchet back on his thick skull the rigging trembled and began to rise they were drawing him up it was about time rough hands grasped his arms and collar and hauled ertai over predators rail he would have liked to have arrived on the deck in a civilized manner but the angry sailors threw him on his face ertai gathered his wits for a suitable response but before he could do anything a pair of massive booted feet appeared in front of him whats this greven said to ertai his voice sounded like the scrape of a dull knife blade on a whetstone the young sorcerer got to his feet with as much dignity as he could muster he drew a breath to announce himself but it caught in his throat when he saw whoand whathe was facing greven ilvec bore little resemblance to the man he once was head and shoulders taller than anyone else on predator he towered over ertai it was impossible to tell where his armor ended and his body began grafted muscles coiled around his limbs shoulders neck and chest the unnatural patterns of sinew and armor plate lent greven a reptilian look a resemblance heightened by the waxen gray cast of his skin add to that the cuts and scars of countless combats and greven was a forbidding sight to the newly saved young sorcerer youre from gerrards ship greven said ertai bowed ertais the name you made the right decision pulling me aboard so saying he stood back from greven and folded his arms across his chestmostly to conceal his bleeding palms grevens brow arched ever so slightly he pointed at ertai and said kill him and take your time ten crewmen who moments before had been panicstricken sheep formed a ring around ertai they were armed with whatever came to handcutlasses hatchets crowbars lengths of chain inwardly ertais heart raced outwardly he projected utter calm guests not welcome eh he said youre making a mistake captain greven waved aside his warning go on kill the runt if any man fails to strike a blow ill have his ears cropped ertai closed his eyes and summoned the deepest resources of his magical strength images of his faroff homeland flashed through his mind and power flowed through him even with his eyes shut he could see the auras of his attackers maneuvering to strike since they were so hot for his blood ertai decided to cool them off he brought his battered hands up and projected a quick and dirty spell at the closest trio of sailors the deck seemed to come out from under them they rushed forward weapons raised and in the next instant their feet were where their heads once were it was like trying to run on ice their boots could find no traction ertai halfturned and hurled three quick bursts at the next group of attackers crowbars and cutlasses flew backward out of their hands some striking their comrades behind them then ertai had to dodge a killing blow from a hatchet he touched the hatchet man with a single finger and at such short range the ambient force sent the man sprawling the hilt of a cutlass connected with the back of ertais head stunned he staggered forward stray magical energy escaping from his body it condensed the air creating an impromptu fog bank of ice and mist on deck ertai dropped to his hands and knees and crawled to the foot of predators mainmast if he could put a little distance between himself and his tormentors hed show them a thing or two greven leaned one arm on the ships binnacle and watched his crew fumble through the fog trying to find ertai normally his men were accomplished fighters but they seemed unable to come to grips with a single unarmed child it was the most diverting thing hed seen in days ertai reached the mast he started up the iron rungs then someone caught his heels and dragged him back having no time for proper concentration ertai flung the first spell he could think ofand the sailor grasping his feet disappeared under a sudden growth of hair the mans eyebrows mustache beard and the hair on his head exploded into a silky mat that completely covered his astonished face he reeled away unable to see or breathe through the hirsute mass the man staggered blindly to the rail and somersaulted over it greven nodded and smiled in grim humor the runt wasnt bad ertai was running out of strength he had a small reservoir remaining but it wasnt much he made a fist and flung a last magical gasp onto the deck ahead of the charging sailors the dry planking splintered as thick green shoots emerged from the deck predators crewmen caught by the sudden garden of tendrils and vines tripped and fell piling up in a heap in front of ertai gamely a few rose from the tangle to advance again a sergeant in the regular rathi army nasser reached the exhausted ertai first he raised his sword high hold said greven nasser froze he looked to his captain hes spent chain him up ill take him back to the stronghold yes dread lord nasser said his comrades fought free of the rapidly withering vines and seized ertai they took out their frustrations on the helpless young man by raining blows on his ribs and skull heavy hobnailed boots thudded into his side forcing ertai to curl into a protective ball fists only greven warned them i want a prisoner who can give me information fists it was and ertai shrank under the merciless pounding how could this have happened to him the most talented student of barrins school the most valuable recruit on weatherlight clearly something was wrong deeply wrong on the strange plane called rath enough said greven take him below nasser dragged ertais limp body away by his heels greven set the rest of the crew back to effecting emergency repairs as he walked the deck observing their progress greven noticed that the battle damage in the deck planking was gone the wood was like new where ertais spell had hit it and the renewal was slowly spreading outward from the initial spot to the rest of the deck repairs by magicnow there was a useful skill greven looked back at the hatch where nasser had disappeared with ertai the boy had talent that was certain with a clap of thunder the canyon portal closed the shock wave blasted down the ravine hurling him to the ground this fall on top of the wounds dealt him by the cat warrior mirri were too much he tumbled and rolled across the abrasive ground brush and rock tearing at his already ragged flesh weatherlight was gone he expected to follow it shortly into oblivion he no longer cared since selenias death he was more afraid of life than death he spread his arms wide feeling the wind tugging at his clothes the warship chasing weatherlight had been caught in the field of residual energy when the portal closed and did not look like it would be aloft much longer serves them right he thought death was the proper reward for failure he closed his eyes and drew his arms and legs in close this made him roll faster he wanted to believe after he smashed to bits on the canyon floor that his soul would depart for some higher better realm if he could not be an angel he could at least dwell among them for eternity death eluded him as the canyon widened onto the adjacent plain the sound of the wind in his ears changed pitch he opened his eyes for the duration of one heartbeat he saw the jagged walls of the canyon in bold reliefboulders gravel the odd wire grass that was the predominant growth on raththen it was all blotted out by a pall of blackness that swallowed him whole all sensation of movement ceased he was adrift in an endless sea of ink floating between nowhere and nothing crovax who calls my name you are needed crovax he twisted around trying to see who spoke there was nothing to see is this death he wondered is this the end of life its the beginning of your life crovax the mysterious voice could hear his thoughts very well answer me where am i you are suspended in a biplanar field it was necessary in order to save you what do you want with me only to offer you a greater destiny than death and if i want to die you were born to command crovax generations of leadership have been bred into you youve had some conflict some personal loss will you abandon your destiny over these setbacks wouldnt you rather strike back at those whove hurt you than surrender your life as their victory yes i would he repeated it out loud yes i would then fly crovax fly to your ultimate destination speak clearly damn you what am i supposed to do fly crovax will yourself to your destiny he felt stupid but he imagined himself flying through the air encased in a cloud of darkness in the weird visionless void he did feel he was moving again was that a breeze on his face was it possible good crovax you will be there soon i am waiting for you there neither mountains nor walls were a barrier to him sightless he hurtled like a shooting star through the darkest of night skies he flew on and the despair hed endured shortly before gave way to anger hatred and a deep gnawing emptiness when ertai regained consciousness he found he was below deck his hands and feet chained around one of the ships masts a strong regular pulsation not unlike a heartbeat echoed through the airships hull the throbbing was equal parts predators damaged engine and the pain in his aching head the crew had not been easy on him ertai licked his parched lips and grimaced not a pleasant experience tasting your own blood his eyes adjusted to the dim light a few feet away seated on a keg was greven ilvec he sat so still it was hard to distinguish him from the hull frames behind him in repose the massive warrior was no less fearsome than he had been on the open deck even in the feeble light a dark glint of violence shone in his eyes its not been pleasant on your ship ertai said thickly you were not invited aboard even shrugging hurt im not here by choice why are you here boy there was no sense lying about it i was manning the portal keeping it open for weatherlight i jumped from the control station onto the ship as she maneuvered to enter the portal you were coming at us like you meant to board us and they put the helm over to avoid you the course change was so violent i missed weatherlight completely and got caught by your rigging if your ship hadnt been so hard on our heels idve drilled my own grave in the soil of rath a sorcerer as skilled as you killed by a mere fall i find that hard to believe ertai said nothing but leaned his aching head against the mast still i cant imagine anyone trying to plant a spy on my ship in such a careless mannernot even gerrard capashen mention of his weatherlight companion sent a spark of anger through ertai how could gerrard have abandoned him left him in the hands of this grotesque savage such ingratitude we are returning to our citadel greven continued once there your fate will be determined by my master the evincar was that resentment ertai heard in grevens voice tired as he was he tried to read the warriors aura the invisible halo of power surrounding every living thing it was one of the first feats apprentice wizards learned aura reading ertai could practically read auras in his sleep he closed his eyes and let the visible image of greven fade from view in its place came a dark silhouette a broken outline in black on a background the color of old blood no other forces existed in grevens aura but strength and destruction not surprising what did interest ertai was the distinct break in the brutes aura instead of a complete circle of lifeenergy the lines broke at grevens neck something was there that absorbed the life force and did not allow it to radiate in the usual manner something artificial what to do with you greven was saying ertais eyes popped open sweat beaded on his brow what ertai said greven ground his teeth a noise the crew of predator knew to fear i said you cant expect mercy from the evincar he has no tolerance for enemies of the state your only hope is to cooperate with us then volrath may find a use for you he said voice growing ertai hung his head i see his compliant manner made greven unclench his jaw your friends have fled never to return he said rising to his feet he had to stoop to avoid banging his head on the deck above if you are as practical as you are talented youll make the correct decision alone ertai glared in the direction of the departed captain stupid hulk ertai knew his kind bluster and violence thats all men like greven knew they were the easiest types to manipulate appeal to their pride yield to their anger that was how to do it greven hated and feared his master volrath and that was a handy foil too ertai began to feel a little better about his chances of survival he tried his best to open the manacles that bound him to the mast neither his physical strength nor his depleted magical abilities were up to the task and after long fruitless effort he resigned himself to temporary captivity his earlier fit of confidence faded when he found he couldnt erase the image of grevens aura from his mind that black broken aura spoke of terrible unnatural things of a man not alive yet not dead he was controlled by the thing in his spine yet aware of his own lack of free will such a man was like a handleless swordno matter how you tried to grasp it it was always lethal he and greven had something in common then in each their own way they were both prisoners of war chapter brothers darkness was his friend it came to him intimately enfolded him in its profound embrace no aspect of light could ever compare to the sensual companionship of darkness it caressed him flowed over and through him squeezing out the last vestiges of light hed known once his being was suffused by the black void he felt himself stretching out to infinity the gray orb of rath was like an acorn in the palm of his hand he closed his fingers around it and laughed near his left hand floated another brighter world but when he tried to grasp it it melted between his fingers irritated he tried again his hand closed on nothingit was like trying to grab smoke his blood warmed then became feverhot he released rath and tried to seize the evasive second world with both hands forming a cage with his fingers he caught the phantom inside now it was his he closed his hands together and awaited the visceral thrill of possession it never came a brilliant stream of white fire forced its way through his clenched hands pushing back the darkness with its hateful rays he tried to smother the light but it just got stronger it pierced his shut eyes and speared through his brain his back arched in torment his jaw locked with such violence his teeth cracked under the pressure let go let go massed voices seemed to say let go of it before it kills you never he cried dominaria will be mine crovax opened his eyes he was lying on the floor of a vast hall in twilight he leaped to his feet heart racing what was this place how did he get here suspended a few inches from his head was a black spidery contraption studded with short spikes shaped like a cupped hand a silver pearllike object nestled within the hand at first he thought it was hard and glassy but as he stared at it the surface throbbed like a living thing crovax reached out for the strange object but the hand whizzed away retracting upward on a thin black cable with dizzying speed it vanished into the cyclopean heights of the hall leaving crovax alone on the long polished floor his hands were bleeding hed forced his fingernails deeply into his own flesh dream he muttered rubbing his stinging palms on his legs bright smears of blood contrasted starkly against the creamcolored leggings a quick check proved he was standing in his underclothes a light jersey matching leggings his feet were bare the wound on his neck where mirri had bitten him had mysteriously healed a smooth livid scar covered the spot where were his clothes his weapons his armor without arms or armor he might as well have been naked what is this he shouted far above him indistinct movements and soft clicking sounds responded to the sound of his voice crovax had the unpleasant feeling he was under observation he walked along scrutinizing his surroundings the dimensions of the hall were vast weatherlight could have easily navigated above the concourse at equal intervals the vaulted roof was supported by enormous pilasters decorated in a baroque mechanistic style each pilaster featured a grotesque face of greenish black and chrome yards across its stylized mouth open in a silent roar of rage in the distant recesses of the arched ceiling unseen mechanisms clicked and whirred crovax could not imagine the purpose of such a mammoth hall he doubled over shaking violently gerrard hanna mirri selenia crovax toppled forward to the black marble walkway his bloody hands sliding on the smooth cold stone a toothy demon leered at him from the pavement the demons face was his own contorted with hatred anger and suffering he smote the floor with his fist why am i here he bellowed dont you know the speaker was quite close almost on top of him crovax lashed out in the direction of the voice his fists met nothing he scrambled to his feet panting show yourself coward he said stop playing these stupid games the air before him shimmered and an image formed crovax shook his head and rubbed his eyes the being before him was like nothing hed ever seen fully seven feet tall the transparent phantom resembled a grisly statue made of meat and metal its long arms were covered with pink skin only to the elbows above them its limbs were made of metal rods and pulleys the creature wore a beaded leather wrap around its waist the head was the most arresting feature of all atop a skeletal torso perched what looked like a massive head in a mask of fantastic gray and red plumes bone and black fur crovax saw no visible eyes or mouth though corrugated tubes emerged from the beings shoulders and chest and entered the mask at various points it made audible breathing sounds like a winded dog a gorget of brass circled the things wide neck jewels gleamed all over the creature and some glowed and blinked with their own inner light i am kirril servant of the hidden one said the creature in a papery voice crovax could discern no lips moving on the creature yet he heard it plainly you are here because you wished to be my master has taken an interest in you who is your master volrath do you serve the evincar kirrils cadaverous arm made a dismissive gesture speak not the traitors name the one i serve has many namesthe dark lord the hidden one the first master he is our great lord ruler of all phyrexia crovax was impressed but he didnt allow himself to show it what does your master want with me the hidden one has watched you crovax since the day you were born he has seen the seed of greatness in you and bided his time until you recognized it in yourself that moment has arrived once you chose to follow the path to power you became his servant but greater things await you crovax if you have the vision and the strength to accept them he scowled at the phyrexian i am no mans servant do you hear i am certainly not submitting myself to your dark lord ive ruined my soul already with hatred and murder but i will not bow to anyone in this worldor yours kirril glided past crovax the hair on his arms prickled as the phyrexians projected image passed in his wake kirril left a strong odor of ozone as if his presence singed the very air its common for birth pangs to be painful kirril said proceeding down the concourse whats important is how one deals with the pain do you let it defeat you or do you return it tenfold upon those who caused it what are you saying the deaths of the angel selenia and the feline mirri were not accidents who is responsible for these acts of pain i am that is the weaklings answer you were not bred to be weak crovax who started you on this journey by whose hand did you arrive on rath his face burned gerrard capashen kirril moved on crovax watched him go it was unsettling to see the wall reliefs and pilasters through kirrils imageor was it his words that were so disturbing wait crovax said kirril vanished only to reappear directly in front of him crovax recoiled then recovered his nerve if all these things are gerrards fault why do i feel soso bereft for a moment the phyrexians only answer was his blinking jewels then he said every being arrives at a moment of choice between avoiding their destiny or embracing it the weak turn away from power and decry in others what they cannot accomplish themselves the strong throw off the constraints of restrictive morality and recognize that ultimate good is that which is efficient and successful you crovax have not made the choice yet youve acted according to your true nature as a predator but you havent accepted the truth of your superiority yet thus you are in torment like the fools who brought you here kirril pointed to the floor between them a conical vessel with a flat lid materialized it was made of dark translucent stone or glass inside the vessel a dimly glowing yellow object moved about furtively your new life can provide rewards youve never imagined do you hunger crovax is there an emptiness deep within you yes damn you pick up the container crovax hefted the jar it was a foot high and quite heavy remove the cap kirril commanded the jar was sealed with a strip of lead crovax peeled away the seal and lifted off the thick cap take care it doesnt escape crovax peered into the jar a lobed ball of light the size of a plum floated inside it moved in slow circles stopped and reversed direction like a caged animal suddenly it seemed to sense the lid was off and darted for the open mouth crovax clamped his hand over the jar the globe touched his raw palm and melted into it he saw the glow through the back of his hand a shock passed down his arm followed by an intense sensation of pleasure crovaxs dour face broke into a wide smile the emptiness the anguish inside him evaporated he felt invigorated and strong what was that the lifeforce of a living creature every living thing contains it most creatures replenish their supply by eating common food and expend it through physical and emotional activity because you deny your natural role as a hunter and master of flesh beings you expend your lifeforce needlessly fueling useless emotions like pity anguish and regret you have progressed beyond mortals crovax you now have the ability to absorb the lifeforce from other beings will you use it or perish like a miserable weak human the cuts on his hands were gone how has this happened the power was always within you by your acts on weatherlight you have awakened the latent instinct crovax dropped the jar it smashed to flinders on the black pavement i want more he said give me more i need more the image of kirril spread its bony hands wide you will have moreas much as you desireif you meet the hidden ones final test with another fluid turn of his hand kirril summoned the dream catchers spidery claws descended rapidly from the ceiling surrounding crovax in a ring of spiny black hands what are these for your education crovax it is important you know the history of rath so that you will not repeat your predecessors mistakes these appliances will allow you to experience the past as it actually happened are you prepared for that you will know terrors and pleasures few mortal men have known this time crovax wasnt alarmed he kicked aside the fragments of the broken jar and stood in the center of the dream machines my appetite is very large he declared good kirril answered it must be now prepare yourself for your lesson crovax lay spreadeagled on an operating table somewhere on the fourth level of phyrexia tubes filled his nose and a breathing mask covered his open mouth no less than four phyrexian birth priests were working on him at the same time each with his own quadrant of crovaxs body in the hazy recesses of his mind crovax knew this was happening he had seen the full history of rath and he realized he was getting the same treatment volrath hadhe was being modified to fill the role of evincar what conclusion do you draw from volraths history kirril asked him volrath was a fool and a weakling crovax replied he was for many years a highly effective governor for suppressing some ragtag elves and whipping moggs he was fine the first time a real challenge appeared weatherlighthe bungled everything worse he became so out of control he abandoned his post to pursue his private quarrel with gerrard not good form for a man with his responsibilities you would not make such mistakes never replied crovax how would you deal with an incursion by weatherlight weatherlight is not important its a vessel a means to deliver an end delicate microtomes scraped at crovaxs flesh through all the detachment and anesthesia the sensationor his thoughts about the sensationseeped in through kirrils eyes he saw his own naked body laid open on the phyrexian operating table his ebon skin pinned back like supple leather his organs still alive quivering his heart pumping a highpitched whine distracted crovax he saw again his own transformation this time a small whirring saw blade was being used to open his skull the hulking priest wielding the saw had three arms each tipped with slender metallic digits of excruciating delicacy the phyrexian touched the bright blade to crovaxs head and the former member of the weatherlight crew screamed inwardly he felt he was hurtling through an abyss of total darkness the plunge was all the more terrible because he knew it would last forever he would never reach the bottom never feel the absolving impact of death below him a dim light gleamed it grew steadily larger and brighter resolving into the form of a glowing angel selenia he tore past her twisting and grasping at her diaphanous trailing robe her sorrowful face seemed blurred indistinct yet when they recognized each other the angel folded her beating wings and dropped after him crovax strained to reach her outstretched hands their fingertips brushed many times and failed to meet despair gave way to frustration then to anger crovax knotted both hands into fists and hurled himself at selenia a dull red halo surrounded him as he shot upward to meet her she opened her arms wide to embrace him and he did likewise flushed with triumph they met in midair and he clasped the bright angel to him she was not dead not dead not dead selenia writhed in his grasp let me go let me go crovax youre hurting me would never hurt you let me go i cannot bear it crovax drew back far enough to see her agonized face he knew instinctively the power he exuded was hurting her the same force that allowed him to stop falling and reach selenia was now killing her let me go crovax im burning i wont let you go youre all i care about feathers from her wings fell away scorched brown she became dead weight in his arms and they slowly turned in the air until she was hanging limply beneath him her robe smoldered her gossamer hair was singed crovax youve killed me he kissed her lifeless face where he touched her her lips and cheek blistered rather than see her beauty entirely consumed by his raging heat crovax released her she spiraled down into the darkness wings rigid in death he covered his face with his hands if he could tear out his memory expunge selenia from his mind he might be saved from the torment of her death kirril kirril can you hear me grant me this boon no said the phyrexian you must preserve memories of all your deeds why i dont want to remember the awful things ive done they only seem awful because you cling to inferior concepts of right and wrong you must learn to savor your experiences in that way you will be strong youll be superior to those mortals who live in fear and react to pain can you give me this strength kirril you have it already all that needs to be done is to delete what remains of your useless moral sense then do it are you certain what is taken away cannot be restored do it an electrode tipped with a miniature cauterizing iron slipped into crovaxs brain with a hiss what remained of his painful conscience burned away chapter arrivals at low speed and with considerable cursing on the part of greven ilvec predator approached the airship tunnel high on the slope of the stronghold it had taken two days to return from portal canyon instead of the usual five hours negotiating the usually roomy tunnel through the slopes of rath peak appeared impossible predators steering was a juryrigged shambles and none of the boneheaded crew could do anything to correct it they made three approaches to the tunnel mouth only to abort each one at the last instant to avoid piling up on the side of the crater furious and desperate greven stormed below to where ertai was still chained to the mast are we there yet ertai asked cheerfully greven dearly wanted to wrench the boys smirking head off but he settled for stomping a cider keg to kindling it was a full keg and the sweet smell of cider filled the cramped hold predator lurched heavily to port shouts of alarm penetrated from the deck above grevens scarred lips curled in disgust well said ertai i cant do much chained up down here who says i want you to do anything greven snarled you didnt come down here to offer me cider did you grevens normally sallow face darkened he reached out with his massive sinewy hands and ertai feared his time had come greven grasped the chain between ertais hands and with little more than a shrug snapped them in two ertai just stared in amazement greven did the same with his leg shackles and the young wizard stood up for the first time in more than a day many thanks captain i was beginning to cramp shut up greven said get on deck ertai shuffled up the gangway chains jingling as he went he emerged on the main bridge the sailors were trying to steer predator with her tattered mainsails even if they had been in top condition such methods were too coarse for steering the airship into its home base ertai craned his head and gazed at the stronghold a vast rounded cone rose steeply from the surrounding plain to a height of over three miles the barren slopes were yellow stone streaked with red and brown mineral deposits the western side was covered by a silvergray cascade of newly fabricated flowstone at the peak the great hub floated on a continuous stream of sizzling blue energy this vast cylindrical object received the energy lancing down from indefinite space above though not bright in the sense that the dominarian sun was bright ertais eyes began to water from the light this is no time for tears greven said im the sensitive type ertai said dabbing his eyes greven dragged ertai to the forward rail we have a steering problem he really loathed what he was about to say and it showed clearly on his brutal face you will use magic to get us through the tunnel im a prisoner of war youre on my ship greven replied his teeth beginning to grind if we crash you go down with us ertai couldnt help but smile thats persuasive he strolled to the port side of the bridge then to starboard predator was making a large slow turn that would eventually bring it back on course for the tunnel opening the rudder is wrecked ertai asked greven nodded can you steer with differential thrust from your engines normally yes but the starboard engine is off its mountings only the port engine is supplying thrust ertai shaded his eyes from the blue glow of the peak and studied the sailors trying to manhandle the port mainsail to counteract the offcenter push of the engine even as he watched the flapping sail whipped loose and swept three men off the boom they plunged to their deaths and no one paused to mark the fact least of all predators captain can you abandon ship asked ertai thats not an option greven said folding his arms across his chest what can you do remember if you fail youll follow those clumsy fools over the side as you so eloquently stated captain were all in this bucket together ertai closed his eyes and extended his hands power crackled from his fingertips there was plenty of energy in the air here even if it was primarily of a destructive variety he drew in some of this harsh background energy it felt bad and made his bruised body ache but desperate times sanctioned daring actions what are you doing greven demanded making a road ertai murmured he visualized a great rod of magical energy emanating from his hands to the distant tunnel entrance that was simple enough but then he drew the stream of force down his arms and pushed it through his body to his feet by anchoring the power stream through the hull he would force predator to follow it the sensation was akin to hugging a naming tree but it had to be done predator shivered and turned smartly toward the stronghold prepare for a crash landing ertai gasped this will be rough greven gave the order and the surviving sailors and moggs hunkered down behind bulwarks fore and aft disdaining danger greven remained on the bridge with ertai moron ertai whispered what uh im more on course his limbs began to tremble sweat soaked through the filthy rags he wore the bow sank and the airship gathered speed here was the real danger though ertai didnt bother explaining it to greven his spell could easily keep the airship straight but he didnt know if he would have enough strength left to stop the ship once inside the crater cut engines greven sounded far away ertai struggled to keep his balance heat was building where his body touched the ship the soles of his feet blistered under them the decking began to smolder someonepresumably greventhrew a bucket of water on ertais feet thank you he gritted were almost there greven replied shouldnt you open your eyes i can see better this way without the hum of the engines predator was alive with seldomheard soundsthe creak of the masts the pop of the hull under stress the odd metallic twang of cables automatically adjusting themselves to changes in tension in his minds eye ertai saw the yellow cone of the stronghold loom before him the magical beam pierced the center of the airship tunnel predator entered it at high speed the slipstream from the interior of the crater blew warm on ertais cheek with a whoosh predator burst into the hollow center of the stronghold crew members cried out and ertai opened his eyes they were hurtling toward the broad column of energy passing between the hub above to the citadel below greven laid a hard hand on ertais shoulder steer wide of the beam he said if we hit it were dead ertai closed his hands to fists and tried to will the invisible stream away from the energy column the stream was strong and it liked flowing into the beam veins stood out in ertais neck as he wrestled with the channeled power bend bend he thought furiously go where i will you the conjured stream bent to starboard until it was just clear of the energy column predator roared past in a full degree dive the port main boom brushed the glaring energy field and sizzled into instant oblivion ertai held the turn and the airship rocketed into a downward spiral toward the landing dock located at the highest point of the citadel better slow down greven said here was the point ertai had contemplated even in the extreme duress of his conjuration rath was his prison greven his jailer and predator was an instrument of oppression to thousands of free people why should he save it why not let it crash into the citadel doing as much damage as possible at least then he could strike a blow for the oppressed slow down greven repeated more urgently dying is easy his old teacher once told him dying is passiveliving is active a true mage must live in order to accomplish the goals of his art what have you accomplished in your short life ertai slow slow greven roared predator was just one ship greven just one commander the coils of phyrexian domination would scarcely tremble at their loss he on the other hand might accomplish great thingsif he lived long enough ertai flung his arms wide the magical stream visible only to him spread out in front of the plunging airship it piled up against the tower in waves and each rebounding crest struck predator a hammer blow slowing her the already smashed prow struck the mooring ring and demolished it the great ship slammed into the platform and skidded sideways shearing off its ventral landing blade greven was catapulted from the bridge to the deck below only ertai rooted in place by the power flowing through him kept his feet predator came to a hard stop against the flowstone carapace greven leaped to his feet amid the tumbleddown wreckage you you wrecked my ship he said pointing a thick finger at ertai it was already a wreck ertai said weakly he staggered to the slanting rail were alive what are you complaining about that said he slumped to the deck where hed stood two blackened footprints were scorched into the planking dorian ildal chamberlain of the evincars palace awaited the arrival of greven ilvec with trepidation everything was in chaosthe citadel had been breached for the first time in history the garrison was in disarray the mighty airship predator was a steaming wreck and worst of all evincar volrath could not be found dorian paced up and down outside the evincars private chambers unsure of how to proceed greven would no doubt be in the foulest mood given his failure to catch weatherlight the shocking debacle at the citadel would not salve his conscience either what dorian feared most was what might happen when word spread that volrath was missing would the evincars subjects revolt would the rebel elves and their allies attack again what of the moggswould they obey their overseers without volraths authority to back them up the tramp of heavy feet brought dorian out of his gloomy reflections greven ilvec descended the spiral ramp from the airship dock followed by the remnants of his crew two crewmen carried a limp body between them a young man clad in foreign clothes dread lord dorian began bowing hastily we are blessed youve come back to us unharmed save the oil for someone who needs it greven said he directed his men to lay the unconscious man on the floor where is his highness i must report his highness volrath is uh yes hes not here dorian thought sparks would fly from grevens tooth grinding the warrior seized dorian by his elaborate sleeves lifting him until his toes danced on the mosaic inlay where is he greven demanded ii dont know dread lord after the intruders were expelled from the stronghold he was nowhere to be found grevens anger vanished he set dorian on his feet nowhere have you searched yes dread lord greven stared at dorian from the base of his skull to the small of his back the warrior had a phyrexian control rod implanted in place of his natural spine this rod gave him enormous strength but it also obeyed the mental commands of the evincar of rath to disobey brought instant retaliation in the form of unendurable pain greven had been so busy saving predator hed not noticed the empty sensation left by volraths lack of control now he swept all points of the compass for his hated master and felt nothing if volrath were on the plane of rath greven should have been able to sense him yet volrath could not be dead for the sudden severance of the evincars control would have struck his spine like a thunderbolt hes gone greven announced the evincar is not on this world having spoken the words he made the leap of logic and deduced the truth volrath was on weatherlight what dorian said tremulously gerrard might have captured the evincar no thats not right why would he flee if he had volrath as hostage then his highness willingly went on the enemy ship greven fingered the control rod where it entered the base of his skull yes thats what he did the fool greven raged to himself he used his shapeshifting powers to stow away on weatherlight what did he hope to gain ah dread lord dorian was whimpering now what is it what are we to do about what everything who will rule in his highnesss place his pudgy face brightened youre the evincars secondincommand you must take over dread lord let the people know a firm hand still holds the reins of rath the airship sailors cheered and loudly urged greven to assume the governorship he glared them into silence this is not a robber bandwe dont elect our chiefs here he said theres an order in things that must be observed evincars have died before and new ones were found our distant masters must be notified and their will obeyed i will consult them dorian and the sailors blanched as one do we dare asked nasser predators veteran sergeant you do not dare i do greven said inwardly he was not so eager for the first time in many years he was free of domination he could take the stronghold as his own but he knew he couldnt keep it the overlords would not allow it and his punishment at their hands would make volraths casual brutality toward him seem like a childs game he strode from the evincars antechamber to the nearest lift there were four of these large square platforms each supported by a flowbot arm passing through the many floors of the citadel dorian and the airship crew followed reluctantly bring the prisoner greven reminded them ertai was carried along the lift lowered them smoothly to the throne room the oval chamber took up an entire floor the decor was a mishmash of earlier evincars tastes from the brutal efficiency of davvol to the mechanistic fetishism of burgess volrath had seldom used the throne room he had preferred the larger convocation hall deeper in the citadel for his state functions high above the throne of rath hung a large inverted threesided pyramid made of some translucent gray phyrexian alloy it was cradled by an intricate multiarmed flowbot carriage this was the window to phyrexia a voice and image portal only it could not send or receive artifacts or travelers word of grevens return and volraths disappearance brought out the evincars court chosen from the cooperative families of the dal the vec and the kor the courtiers of rath were servants sycophants and spies of the evincar their stock in trade was gossip and treachery as they jockeyed among themselves for honors and privileges during the twopronged attack by weatherlight and the army of the elven rebel eladamri volraths collaborators had taken refuge in their citadel apartments the danger past they emerged in their court finery ready to be seen and counted when the window to phyrexia was opened sailors deposited ertai at the foot of the empty throne greven planted his fists on his hips and declaimed overlords of rath hear me the pyramid remained dim and inert greven repeated his summons the surface of the pyramid began to sparkle encouraged greven said i am greven ilvec commander of the armies of rath our evincar has left us and we request that our overlords restore him to us or send another in his place a slender red beam lanced out from the mechanism perched atop the pyramid it raked harmlessly across grevens face tracing every contour and comparing it to images of the warrior stored in its memory when it was satisfied greven was who he claimed to be the flowbot flexed its limbs and lowered the window the brassyellow machinery whirred and squeaked until the pyramid reached head height over the throne the window came to life with an ominous crackle of power sending skittish courtiers shrinking back in alarm be brave greven sneered its only a machine dark colors ricocheted through the pyramid corner to corner to corner it stabilized in the center and assumed a bluish tinge greven squared his broad shoulders and awaited his masters command greetings the phyrexian voice sounded slurred and mechanical greetings our loyal warrior greven ilvec he knelt on one knee humblest greetings great lords we have a grave problem the matter is known to us the hidden one is not pleased with the evincars desertion or your soldiers failure shall we track down volrath and punish him great lords asked greven that is not necessary it is more important for you to strengthen your forces on rath and crush the rebellion brewing among the elves yes great lords to this end we are sending a special emissary who will find a new evincar reorganize the government and improve the schedule of flowstone production a murmur circled the room would it not be simpler to appoint a new governor to do all that greven said fatigue made him more blunt than usual the red beam returned but this time it was not harmless it struck greven in the chest and the powerful warrior groaned and collapsed he twitched on the floor several seconds until the beam relented courtiers at the rear of the room quietly slipped out lest the overlords displeasure spread do not question only obey the pyramid intoned expect the emissary in seven intervals she will appear in the dream halls at that time all will obey the emissary or be punished greven winced as he stood well obey without question great lords the light within the pyramid began to swirl and dart about again then became inert once more the flowbot retracted the device back to its former position near the ceiling ertai hobbled on burned feet to stand beside greven seems were in the same boat again he said how so runt the warrior rumbled theres always someone bigger around who expects you to bow and scrape just to get along isnt there some of us are bigger than others and some of us stand to fall from a greater height the young man replied now where can i get some salve for my feet life is sweet this was crovaxs conclusion as he stood at the extreme end of the dream halls gazing down on the royal laboratory and prison tower the map tower and the chaotic mogg warrens below the minions of rath scurried about their tasks like the residents of an anthill each life could be his to take and savor he smiled and the dark face in the flowglass smiled back at him why not take them all eventually the value of cattle was as food for the lion with a wave of his hand the flowglass parted crovax stepped up to the sill and stood on the edge hundreds of feet above the laboratory roof he raised one foot and was amused to see the flowstone sill rapidly extend to support him he lifted the other foot and the nanomachines swiftly advanced under that one too crovax repeated the process until he was standing on a spindly flowstone platform six feet out from the ledge he stood with his arms outstretched and laughed at the absurdly great power that was now his with an ominous crack the thin flowstone structure bowed under his weight crovaxs euphoria disappeared he leaped back to the dream halls just as the feeble platform crumbled away crovax hit the sill square in the chest driving the wind from his lungs gasping he heaved himself over the ledge and rolled back inside the hall the window flowed shut behind him crovax lay on the cold stone floor heart hammering then he laughed at the far end of the dream halls the delegation led by greven had just arrived normally only volrath could have opened the flowstone locks on the doors to his sanctum but when the group arrived the massive twin doors were already mysteriously apart greven entered boldly as if he were a frequent visitor behind him came dorian ildal and a select group of courtiers an honor guard drawn from the palace garrison and ertai dorian had voiced a concern over bringing the captive wizard along hes an enemy the chamberlain said surely he belongs in prison all in good time greven answered for now let him see the power he opposes ertai slipped along quietly on bandaged feet the honor guard was close behind him so he had no chance to slip away he only considered escape for a moment the prospect of meeting an emissary from phyrexia was far too interesting to miss the dream halls were their widest where the structure joined the main part of the citadel none of them had ever seen the interior before and the austere monochrome reliefs starkly stylized images of volrath and weird flowbot machinery kept the delegation in a tight group heads turning in all directions only greven kept his dignity and strode straight on he drew ahead of the rest until dorian called to him dread lord wait for us stop dawdling youve lived in the stronghold most of your lives and you act like youve never seen such sights before ertai sat down on the polished black floor might as well wait here he said on your feet said a shocked dorian my feet hurt ask lord greven why they do leave him said greven when the emissary arrives hell stand like everyone else how many intervals has it been dorian consulted the time meter he wore around his neck the dial was as big as a dinner plate but as thin as leather in between ordinary numbers intricate runes and sigilsphyrexian numbersappeared and disappeared irregularly six intervals and a half he said when the yellow symbols appeared on the meters face stand at ease greven said to the honor guard the guardsmen led by sergeant nasser slouched in their stiff conical suits of ceremonial armor no one spoke for several minutes ertai amused himself by reading the auras of the courtiers their strongest components were fear and greed the honor guard was a different story they all wore haloes of violence and their leader nasser had a powerful aura that spoke of great personal ambition ertai looked back at greven and wondered if he knew poking at the floor ertai discovered the marble was just another variety of flowstone he concentrated as he pushed with his finger and for a fleeting instant he thought he felt the substance soften surprised he lifted his finger there was no sign of any indentationbut the sensation must have been genuine he was far too practiced to mistake a thing like that the silence was broken by a faroff whistling everyone in the delegation pricked up their ears ertai stood the honor guard snapped to attention the emissary said dorian breathlessly greven peered down the dim cavernous hall dont be an idiot do overlords whistle like steam kettles dorian sidled up to the towering warrior whoor what is it then the trilling grew steadily louder it didnt sound like a person whistling more like a pipe or a tin whistle could it be volrath returned ertai asked that sound is not volrath greven replied a voice filtered down distorted and sourceless in the odd acoustics of the hall as everyone strained to hear the noise grew more distinct greven ordered the guards forward they formed a wedge in front of greven and leveled their spears the whistling was louder and clearer but there was still no one in sight whoever you are greven shouted show yourself the whistling stopped and was replaced by quiet eerie laughter all eyes rose and they beheld crovax in his new phyrexian finery standing on the vertical wall of the hall twenty feet above them his position defied reason and gravity for he was standing at a ninety degree angle to the floor with no more support than the soles of his boots by the colors ertai muttered how did he get here you know him greven said mildly his name is crovax hes a sullen tormented man who came here with us on weatherlight greven parted the line of soldiers what are you doing here this is the sanctum of the evincar of rathtrespassing here means death crovax turned to face the floor and walked effortlessly down the wall a small bonewhite flowstone device perched on his shoulder began to whistle the melancholy nomad song again crovax reached the floor and stepped down i am the evincar of rath said crovax chapter messenger greven drew his blackbladed sword in a swift fluid motion youre either a madman or a liar in any case your life is forfeit get him the guards lowered their spears and charged crovax utterly composed made no immediate move to evade them when the soldiers were ten paces away the smooth black floor suddenly turned to jelly the soldiers feet sank into the black goo and were held fast dread lord he commands the flowstone dorian cried greven circled wide around the mired troops crovax edged away from greven drawing his own sword he seemed wary of engaging the hulking warrior greven leveled his weapon you have some influence over the flowstone but you dont command it as volrath did do you he cut wide circles in the air with his wickedly curved blade can you direct my control rod impostor you have this one chance before i kill you he made a terrific overhand slash at crovax who parried shakily ertai pushed to the front of the crowd of frightened courtiers crovaxs aura was astonishingly dense and dark far stronger than it had been on weatherlight and it extended to where the soldiers were stuck in the grip of the flowstone he had little power left to fend off greven however greven came on fiercely cutting at crovaxs head thrusting at his stomach and legs one underhand lunge was blocked in the last second by crovaxs lighter blade grevens great muscles bulged and he brought his blade up against crovaxs full resistance the latters sword snapped and the flowstone blade went skittering away stopping at ertais feet to his astonishment the broken blade sprouted tiny legs stood up and began marching back to rejoin itself to crovaxs hilt taking his sword in both hands greven raised it high for a death blow the flowstone released the soldiers and the section of floor between greven and crovax heaved up to ward off the warriors blow grevens blade stuck fast in the flowstone shield he grunted and tugged at the imbedded blade crovax breathing hard searched for a weapon with which to strike the distracted greven three deep even tones echoed through the vast space like the tolling of a great bell a shock wave blasted down the dream halls silent and powerful lightly dressed courtiers went sprawling ertai dropped on his face and clawed at the hard pavement to his amazement his fingers probed shallow handholds in the flowstone the soldiers buffeted by the noiseless blast struggled to keep formation crovaxs flowstone shield receded greven recovered his sword but stayed his hand the tremendous displacement of air could mean only one thingthe emissary was coming tumbling through the air down the center of the hall came a gray cube turning successive faces toward them as it came it grew rapidly in size only greven and crovax held their ground the courtiers and soldiers cowed by the enormous power confronting them backed away once the wall of wind ceased ertai raised his head to see what was happening the cube stabilized hovering a few inches off the floor it was at least feet to a side and its boiling misty surface revealed no details of its purpose or composition behind the veil of gray there was movement bumps rippled the facing surface of the cube the phantom gong tolled three more times and a hand appeared through the cubea lithe slender hand gloved in a black gauntlet a knee and toe appeared then the leg connecting them in a simple natural movement the emissary stepped through the portal into the dream halls the emissary was dwarfed by greven clothed head to toe in attenuated sable armor plate the emissary was only slightly taller than ertai the closed helmet turned this way and that surveying the scene the emissary raised a hand but not in greeting a small device the phyrexian held made a chirping sound and the portal began to shrink as it did it spat out four large black metal boxes the cube shrank to the size of a small nut tumbling in the air as it hovered the emissarys control device chirped again and the tiny cube vanished back went the device into a pouch on the emissarys belt air rushed in to fill the space of the departed portal soldiers and courtiers dragged themselves into some semblance of order ertai stood up absently combing his tousled hair with his fingers the emissary stood motionless and ertai wondered for a moment if the phyrexians had sent a mechanical creature like karn his former crewmate slowly the stranger raised its hands to its helmet the headpiece slipped off with an audible hiss its a girl ertai said be silent greven said he went down on one knee all hail the plenipotentiary of the supreme master of phyrexia with much rustling of stiff cloth and squeaking metal the delegation knelt before the emissary ertai was the first to stand he wanted a better view of this girl from another plane her features were sharp like the elves of his world she had high pointed ears and the spatulate cheekbones of a pureblooded elf her eyes he saw were identically hued incongruous freckles dotted her nose and cheeks her armor fit as if a matteblack skin and where it ended her own pale complexion revealed strange dark crosshatching lines in spite of the awesome presence of phyrexia she bore with her the emissary looked to be little more than ertais agethe human equivalent of nineteen years old crovax bowed smoothly greetings excellency welcome to rath she looked at him blankly who are you ertai sniggered at a nod from greven two soldiers seized the young sorcerer in an unfriendly grip i am crovax the new evincar of rath ive heard of you the emissary answered coolly you exceed yourself i am here to appoint a new governor and i have not chosen you yet crovax visibly recoiled around him the flowstone floor rose in tiny peaks like a tempesttossed lake it quickly subsided greven stepped forward greven ilvec commander of all citadel forces and captain of the airship predator at your excellencys service commander what a flat emotionless voice she has ertai thought the members of the court led by dorian ildal greeted the emissary in turn each swearing undying loyalty to her and to the power she represented she accepted their boot licking and toadying with the same indifference with which she received crovaxs arrogance what about me ertai called out the soldier holding his right arm let go and gave the sorcerer a resounding rap on the back of the head who is that asked the emissary no one excellency a prisoner of war greven explained you bring prisoners to me why good question said crovax this one has a certain talent for magic greven said i brought him along to witness your arrival excellency as an object lesson has he been interrogated greven steeled himself for punishment no excellency the first task of a captor is to extract information from prisoners the girl said you will see to his interrogation greven ilvec at once excellency he signaled the guards to drag ertai away ertai looked between the hulking soldiers and said you havent told us your name greven was about to order ertai silenced but the emissary stopped him a logical question my name is belbe my name is ertai i was first in my class take him away greven said irritably i will question him myself crovax extended his arm to lead belbe from the hall she ignored his pretense of gallantry and walked briskly on greven asked about the crates sent with her have them taken to the evincars quarters i will occupy them she said this was mogg work but the smelly brutes were forbidden to enter the dream halls greven moved as if he was about to order the guards to remove the crates when crovax made a suggestion let the courtiers do it he said the palace is their business isnt it dorian blanched at the prospective exertion were not laborers belbe said do as crovax says but your excellency dorian protested this man is an intruder as much an enemy as the wart ertai greven said pointing at crovax by rights he should be in a cell too no belbe said this one has received the attention of the overlords hes not evincar yet but he stands in contention for the post so long as his orders do not contradict mine he will be obeyed crovaxs altered face split wide in an unpleasant grin what are you waiting for see to the emissarys baggage dorian and the others filed past crovax the metal cases were six feet long and half as wide the pampered in some cases elderly courtiers struggled to lift the heavy containers to their shoulders crovax could not restrain himself from laughing when one aged dal collapsed bringing a crate down on himself dorian directed the rest of the courtiers to hoist the box off the fallen man blood stained the old mans goldtrimmed robe and his face had gone the color of cold ashes dorian lifted the mans wrist hes dead his voice choked crovax stood over them useless parasite he said his brow furrowed and a segment of the floor detached itself and formed a stretcher walking on short flowstone legs the stretcher bore the body of the elderly courtier from the hall dorian looked up at him with tears in his eyes if you command the stone why dont you order it to carry the emissarys baggage crovax grabbed dorians collar and effortlessly lifted the corpulent chamberlain to his feet prove your devotion to the overlords by carrying her excellencys baggage all of you he roared ertai and his escorts had lingered watching this scene unfold this is bad ertai muttered hes gone mad utterly mad he was hustled away belbe greven crovax and the honor guard stood by as the aged and softliving members of the evincars court struggled to carry belbes crates belbe gestured to dorian what is that on that mans face tears said greven a saline solution excreted for the purpose of removing irritations from the surface of the cornea the old man who was killed was chamberlain before dorian greven said he was dorians father belbe started for the evincars quarters without waiting for her baggage greven excused himself to see to ertais interrogation before he left he said if your excellency needs assistance or protectionyou need only call there are guards posted throughout the citadel he shot crovax a warning look and departed what remained of the honor guard awaited her orders what shall we do excellency asked nasser carry on with your duties she said and i crovax asked if youre to command the forces of rath you should inspect the army and become familiar with it they have performed poorly of late have they not its true excellency nasser said grimly there was great confusion when we found we had to deal with both rebels and an enemy airship very well in five intervals i expect to hear your military report crovax inform the chamberlain and greven iivec that i want them present as well she walked away crovax watched her go man to man what do you make of her mused crovax very strange the sergeant said why would the overlords send a young girl on such a mission theres a reason sergeant we just dont see it yet the overlords do nothing without a wellthoughtout reason by the way whats your name nasser sir how long have you served greven iivec seven years sir seven years and you only command a troop of palace guards greven does not appreciate you nasser met the other mans gaze no sir he does not well have to remedy that he held out his hand lead on nasser formed the honor guard and marched them away crovax strolled behind them smiling at some private amusement the sound of marching feet receded in the distance belbe took a deep breath alone again thankfully though shed been on rath scarcely an hour she was feeling bruised by the experience she found the company of the citadels inhabitants wearingthe great hulking presence of greven the soldiers so wrapped in armor as to seem less alive than the phyrexian priests shed encountered the court officials with their washed out anxious faces always ready with a whisper and an open palm her master abcaldro never told her that people were like this the only two that interested her were the young one called ertai and the dark one called crovax they were very different types ertai radiated brash wit and vast selfconfidence even with shackles on his feet crovax was dangerous she could tell hed been to phyrexia and received the special attention of fourth level artificers she walked unerringly to the flowbot lift that could take her to the evincars suite of rooms halfway up the great tower a detailed schematic of the stronghold had been implanted in her mind when she was made every strut every brace every creeping fleshstone appliance was as familiar to her as her own hands yet everything was strange too because she knew shed never been here before she stepped into the flowbot lift the conveyance didnt budge so she prompted it to the evincars quarters the citadel had existed a long time and successive occupants had altered decorated and embellished it as they saw fit belbe passed through floors reflecting the tastes of six previous evincars each new master having overlaid his predecessors alterations the basic structure was a shell of brassy phyrexian alloy and ceramic over which were layers of flowstone designed to resemble wood marble glass and so forth its organic form survived every decorative whim and centuries of human habitation afflicted it like scars on the body of a great sea beast a squeaky voice announced each floor as they passed observation deck courtiers apartments flowbot repair shop evincars museum stop belbe said the lift shuddered into place they were halfway between floors go down to the evincars museum the lift obediently climbed down several feet belbe stepped off the platform the floor was dark with only a few reflective glints showing light she ordered nothing happened i want light some flowstone globes burst into full illumination other contrary appliances refused to light at all as a result the room was harshly shadowed a condition made worse by the bizarre contents of the museum volrath had made it his business to catalog all forms of life on rath specimens of every species were here carefully preserved and mounted on marble flowstone pedestals there were animals birds reptiles and fish all with staring glass eyes some of the specimens were old and suffered from neglect and decay as belbe walked slowly past she touched the plumage of a stuffed bird pale blue feathers turned to dust in her hands belbe brushed the powder away and a small twolegged machine scuttled from the shadows its bellshaped proboscis noisily sucking up the offending dust volrath hadnt settled for just animals each sentient race on rath was represented by four preserved specimens adult male adult female child male child femaleall in appropriate costume and with typical accouterments she passed exhibits of the kor the dal and the vec sleek powerful merfolk were artfully displayed inside blocks of transparent green flowstone simulating the sea in which they lived the last race displayed were the skyshroud elves only a single example was provided a fully grown male belbe paused arrested by what she saw the face though masculine was very similar to hers she climbed on the pedestal with the embalmed elf and stared curiously into his long dead face who were you some hunter some fisher the evincars soldiers caught one day where did you live why do you look like me belbe touched the elfs face it was cold dry and hard the taxidermist had given the elf bluegray eyes she touched the dusty pupil with her fingertip it was not glass it yielded to her touch belbe jumped down from the pedestal trembling she rubbed her hands repeatedly on the skirt of her armor the room had suddenly grown small and oppressive she had to get out now the lift was waiting for her she leaped aboard and said go go where asked the device to the evincars quarters at once by the time the platform stopped at the lowest level of the evincars suite the structure had narrowed to a mere two hundred feet in diameter the antechamber was cool and dim give me light the room gradually brightened with an intense pulsating blue light belbe moved to the center of the room as the walls passed from opaque to translucent the throbbing blue light was the energy beam outside she could feel the energy bleeding through the walls on her skin the bottom floor of the suite was one large room with inward curving walls and as she stood fascinated by the energy passing between the flowstone factory and the hub the floor began to flicker languorous waves of color circled the floor in alternating bands of red orange yellow green and blue centered in this silent vortex of color belbe stood in silence the chromatic waves circled the room around her feet she knew this was caused by feedback in the flowstone as it soaked up the energy seeping through the walls but it was delightful whatever the cause she drifted a few steps toward the stairs leading to the next floor as she did the color wheel shifted to recenter on her new position amused she backed up a few feet the clockwise swirl followed her belbe trotted around the room her reengineered legs were capable of formidable speed but in the confines of the tower she did not test her limits the spectral bands in the floor chased her no matter how fast she ran static charges built up in the air belbe held out her hands laughing as white sparks discharged from her fingertips on her twentieth circuit of the room she noticed crovax standing by the lift she skidded to a stop the floor went through noiseless paroxysms of clashing color finally settling into its wheel pattern once more light she said her heart was beating rapidly and her hair was damp with sweat the walls became opaque as the artificial lighting came up crovax hands clasped behind his back looked somber in his black robes and acidetched phyrexian breastplate what do you want belbe asked i came to see if you were all right excellency he used the language of a subordinate but he did not speak like one from below we could see colored lightning playing about the tower i didnt realize you were enjoying yourself an amusing effect she replied i discovered it by accident an interesting substance flowstone it can be controlled if one has the will to do so halfcontrolled and halfinfluenced it is unpredictable please be careful excellency without a spoken command the sides of the lift rose to enclose crovax until later he said as the device sank through the floor she was tired being on display was wearing and her sprint around the room used up what vitality she had left belbe climbed the ornate stairs to the next floor an evincar could have willed the stairs to carry him but she had to make her own progress she wandered through chambers filled with paintings and statues mostly warriors portraits and battle scenes most of the individual images bore the face of volrath belbe found it odd anyone would want to be surrounded by pictures of himself especially such exaggerated extravagant images volrath slaying an entire army with just his sword a colossal volrath wreathed in cloud standing astride the stronghold volrath trampling nations and worlds beneath his feet interspersed among the statues paintings and tapestries were more useful itemscabinets cupboards shelves chairs settees the furniture was uniformly hard when belbe sat on it from its dished and bulged shapes she deduced it was flowstone and that it would soften for the evincar but no one else she found a bed at last a large circular mattress laden with handmade quilts and pillows these were gifts of the evincars subjects and thankfully were not flowstone the bed was sized for a very tall occupant so she had to boost herself up as she sat there her feet dangling she noticed another statue much different from all the others it was sited so that only a person lying on the bed could see it in the adjoining room belbe hopped down for a closer look the statue executed in genuine white marble depicted two figures facing each other the taller figure was inescapably volrath though this was the only statue in which he wore royal robes instead of armor his hand was extended clasping the hand of the facing figure belbe circled the twelvefoothigh statue trying to see who the other figure was the figure facing volrath was shorter and proportioned like a normal man he had necklength hair and the suggestion of a beard and was likewise dressed in peaceful fashion when belbe finally reached a spot where she could see she discovered the figure with volrath had no face at all lets talk this over ertai said greven nodded to his two mogg warders who tore ertais shirt from his back he didnt regret the loss of the garment as it was in tatters anyway but he did take exception to the assorted irons roasting in a brazier not three feet away this isnt going to accomplish anything ertai added i have nothing to say greven took an instrument from his belt pouch a slender red rod wound in a tight flat coil he pinched the end of the coil between his fingers and it slowly unrolled into a rigid rod what is that ertai asked clearing his suddenly tight throat the hulking warrior loomed over him he gave one end of the rod a twist and short spikes appeared on the opposite end ertai decided he preferred the branding irons he backed away the wall stopped him again greven gestured to the moggs who seized ertais ankles they jerked his right foot up and greven bent over it rod in hand ertai shut his eyes click the heavy shackle fell from his leg ertai opened his eyes in time to see greven withdraw the spiky rod from the keyhole he repeated the operation to the other shackle keyworm the warrior said tucking the slowly coiling creature back in his pouch by all the colors ertai said sighing gustily i thought the warders slammed him against the wall greven picked up an iron the tip was pale orange almost white hot now said greven tell me about weatherlight ertai his hands pinned closed his eyes and conjured a psychokinetic blast from his locus his solar plexus such conjurations were not as controllable as ones channeled through the hands but considering his situation he had little choice he mentally hurled it at greven and was rewarded by the sound of the iron clattering to the floor i can keep this up longer than you greven said he retrieved the fallen iron now cooled to cherry red and returned it to the fire this can take all day or it can be over when you wish it to be what do you say a modicum of resistance is mandatory ertai said faintly after all i am the most naturally talented sorcerer of the age greven picked up fresh hot irons in each hand down here boy youre just meat chapter gifts belbe relaxed in volraths bed for an hour and rose feeling stiff and a bit disoriented a few seconds of concentration dispelled the cobwebs in her head some discreet servant had left a tray of soft cakes and wine for her refreshment in the outer chamber but she didnt eat she knew about food and drink but the phyrexians had designed out of her such weaknesses as hunger and thirst belbe sniffed the cake and nibbled off the corner of one to her it had no taste she sipped the amber wine then spat it on the floor to her inexperienced palate the drink was vile her baggage had been delivered to the floor below belbe touched the flowstone seals with her index finger and the crates opened like black metal lilies the first two boxes held her clothing the third held a variety of weapons and spare powerstones for them the fourth box held three smaller cartons of thin metal each labeled in phyrexian the largest carton was marked nanomachine conversion accelerator the small one merely said power unit these were equipment updates she was to install in the flowstone factory deep in the bowels of the citadel remote transplanar portal read the middlesized box belbe shed her confining suit of armor once the lightweight ceramic plates were off she stretched luxuriously and scratched her sides what freedom she never realized mere garments could make such a difference in comfort it was dusk near the time shed set for the council meeting to celebrate her newfound freedom she chose a loose fitting pair of billowing red trousers topped by a waistlength silver tunic she went to the lift stopped and doubled back to her castoff armor the belt kit was still around her cuirass never be separated from your kit abcaldro warned her it contained her single most valuable piece of equipment dorian ildal greeted her he looked wan and worried with him were two scribe machines set to take down every word of the meeting they crouched on either side of dorians chair looking like severed gray arms each of the flowbots four fingers was stained black with ink the nail of each finger served as a nib and all four fingers wrote at once not only keeping minutes of the meeting but making triplicate copies at the same time greven was there as tidy and groomed as he ever could be both men bowed when belbe entered the room where is crovax she asked i dont know dorian replied gnawing his lip shall i send someone to find him she considered the idea briefly and dismissed it no he knows were meeting at this hour if he chooses to miss us thats his choice they seated themselves around the table belbe assuming the tall chair reserved for the evincar she first asked for an account of the strongholds assets sweating the chamberlain wedged a monocle in his right eye and began to read from a lengthy scroll in a singsong voice so many retainers so many courtiers so many menatarms resided in the citadel they ate so much meat per day so many loaves of bread so many gallons of water beer and spirits belbe listened attentively for the first half hour but as dorian drew a second scroll from a hamper that contained another five her mind began to wander the doors flew open revealing crovax at the head of a band of soldiers youre late belbe said he saluted rather than bowed your excellency set me to a considerable task i did not wish to arrive with it incomplete greven narrowed his eyes the troops at crovaxs back were led by nasser and included all the senior sergeants in the garrisonan unusual selection of men youre not allowed to bring armed troops into the citadel only the evincar rates a bodyguard greven chided glaring at the newcomers crovax strode in a slight swagger in his step these fellows theyre not armed her excellency asked me to inspect the state of the garrison and who better to ask than the men who lead the men the sergeants greven leaned on the table and growled you men are dismissed the doors closed behind the departing soldiers crovax took a seat opposite greven he sat down without waiting for belbes leave dorian gasped at his insolence you sound distressed chamberlain he remarked folding his hands in his lap was it something you ate no just something he cant swallow greven said dorian made to resume his monologue but belbe stopped him i will hear from commander greven the imposing commander spoke without notes the captive ertai was questioned by me for eightythree minutes he said is that all asked crovax no more was needed belbe said what did you learn until recently he was a student at a school of magic run by one barrin he was recruited from the school by gerrard capashen to accompany capashen to rath for the purpose of rescuing the woman sisay a prisoner of volraths the prisoner was freed she asked greven nodded curtly i could have told you all that crovax said bored greven bristled belbe held up her hand the essence of a successful interrogation is not always what youre told but how completely the prisoner gives up what he knows go on commander it was ertais job to hold open the old valley portal allowing weatherlight to escape from rath his magical skills are considerable for one so young as he will tell you given the slightest chance during weatherlights escape he was thrown from the deck of gerrards ship to predator where i captured him greven put a tightly wound scroll on the table this record contains every detail ertai told me about weatherlight and her crewconstruction specifications armament everything his enormous hands closed into fists soon ill know that ship better than i know predator next time i will crush weatherlight yes next time crovax said the refrain of the defeated without any warning words or grinding of teeth greven reached across the table and grabbed crovax by the throat crovax tore at grevens thick forearm with both hands slowly he began to unlock the commanders powerful grip surprised greven landed a smashing blow to the smaller mans nose crovax flew backward skidding several feet on the polished floor your excellency do something dorian cried belbe leaned back in the evincars chair i am doing something greven advanced kicking crovaxs overturned chair out of the way the wouldbe evincar was quickly on his feet ignoring the blood streaming from his busted nose his hand flashed to his armpit and out came a short dagger at this point belbe said firmly no blades crovax he shrugged and tossed the weapon aside greven threw two heavy punches left hand first then right they met only air crovax ducked under the bigger mans reach and kicked greven hard in the gut it was like kicking a tree trunk crovax concern showing in his face for the first time sprang away avoiding his foes massive fists a little unfair dont you think crovax panted circling nearer to belbe why do you imagine combat has to be fair she replied snarling greven snatched up an empty chair and flung it at his evasive enemy crovax leaped impressively dodging the flying furniture he executed a whirling kick that connected solidly with grevens jaw snapping the warriors head back greven shook off the blow and climbed on the table forcing crovax to give ground dorian whimpered and went to huddle behind belbe her boredom had disappeared she watched fascinated as the two men fought around the roomcrovax wily and agile greven impossibly strong and resilient when one or the other connected the impact sent a hot fleeting pang through her it wasnt like the pain she felt when abcaldro inserted the lens in her chest the sensation left a warm feeling in her face and belly she found herself wanting greven to hit crovax again that surprised her what difference did it make to her who won a rake from the ring on crovaxs left hand opened grevens scarred scalp and the commander began howling with unconfined rage he moved with a speed astonishing in so large a man hemming his opponent into the doorway crovax stepped in pummeling grevens throat and face with blows he paid for his temerity grevens backhand sent him crashing against the closed doors why dont you command the flowstone to save you greven sneered belbe was wondering the same thing crovax had been given enough psionic ability to control the nanomachines in a rudimentary way he could have tripped greven with the floor or raised a shield like shed heard he had done in the dream halls why didnt he greven took the stunned man by the wrist he intended to wrench crovaxs arm out of its socket but even as he steeled himself for the effort a low unnatural laugh filled the council chamber crovax raised his head his eyes blazed with unfathomable mirth do your worst savage this is the last time youll ever lay hands on me in the time it took greven to draw his next breath he understood what crovax meant the control rod in his spine awakened and began to shriek pouring torrents of pain through even square inch of his body wracked with agony he released crovax belbe could see the livid implant between grevens shoulder blades to her enhanced eyes the rod glowed with excess power that the phyrexian mechanism converted to unendurable pain she shivered her mouth went dry crovax wiped the blood from his lips strike me down greven im right here grevens knees buckled he clawed at the rod which he couldnt even reach due to the massive width of his own shoulders crovax lifted a foot and lightly pushed grevens chest the huge warrior toppled backward lights scrolls and chairs were upset by the force of grevens fall this is just a taste crovax said when i am evincar youll lick my boots every morning or know my displeasure belbe came up behind him crovaxs control of the spinal rod was not without effort sweat stood out on his face and neck and ripped from his elbows he trembled violentlyfrom exertion or excitement she could not tell belbe put a hand on crovaxs shoulder his skin burned feverishly youve made your point she said have i commander greven is a valued member of our forces i do not want him damaged crovax went back to the council table and set his chair upright again once he was seated he visibly relaxed greven let out a long gust of breath and ceased writhing proclaim me evincar crovax said in a low voice i have command of the flowstone ive just demonstrated my ability to affect control rods what more proof do you need discharge your commission and name me governor belbe went silently to her chair dorian was still peeking out from behind it when she stood aside waiting the chamberlain sheepishly resumed his seat well said crovax youre the leading contender belbe said but there are others who have not yet had the opportunity to display their talents others who him crovax indicated the prostrate greven with a thrust of his chin no one approaches my power as i see it your power is limited you can influence flowstone in your immediate vicinity but only with great concentration the shapes you create are not permanent just now you were too busy evading commander greven to think about the flowstone were you not and at what range can you affect a control rod one yard ten yards more is required than psionic abilitycan you command the army can you execute the orders of our overlords faithfully and without question crovax sullenly said nothing my decision will be deferred until i have sufficient evidence as to who is best qualified to be evincar belbe said she sorted through the scramble of scrolls on the table do i have your report on the readiness of the garrison he took a flattened scroll from his inner jacket pocket and tossed it in front of her thank you briefly what is your estimate of the military situation several long seconds passed before crovax replied the stronghold garrison is in disarray theyre afraid the rebels are equipped with airships and they know volrath has left them in the lurch the rebels think they won a victory because some of them penetrated the citadel and escaped with their lives theyll be full of bluster and confidence and will no doubt be planning new raids she opened the squashed scroll crovax tossed at her what do you recommend attack without delay belbe and dorian exchanged looks are you certain my lord asked the chamberlain its the course of action the rebels least expect belbe read crovaxs report in seven seconds flat how will you do it ill form a hardhitting force the cream of the garrison he said warming to the subject nasser tells me volrath had agents among the rebels whove provided maps of the skyshroud forest ill locate and destroy the village of eladamri the rebel leader he tapped a finger against his forehead take out the brains of the rebellion and the rest are just carrion belbe quickly rolled crovaxs scroll closed how many troops will you need ten thousand should do it what support supplies ill take an equal number of moggs along as porters he said no pack animals or clumsy machineswell move fast and strike hard he struck the tabletop with a scratched and bleeding fist you have leave to try crovax he stood and saluted ill bring you eladamris head in a basket belbe blinked several times why would i want his head in any container crovax limped from the room smirking hed taken some punishment and couldnt quite manage the swagger hed come in with on his way out he deliberately stepped over greven still supine with remembered pain after the doors closed behind him belbe called out what do you think of crovaxs plan greven white as death crawled to a chair eladamri will do what i could not he said hoarsely the emissary and the chamberlain looked blank he will kill crovax unfortunately he may also kill the best part of my army half a hundred humans and elves gathered in the silent night their meeting place was a small hummocky island in the swamp near the edge of the skyshroud forest here freethinking rathi rebels had come to hear the gospel of resistance all the worlds races were represented save the merfolk who were blood enemies of the elves and would not seek their company even if it meant avoiding total extinction most of those present were dal and vec a single kor male lingered on the edge of the crowd no torches were lit darkness was the rule for this gathering i dont like this said a mature dal man he was richly dressed and wore a jeweled dagger on his belt agents of the evincar could be hereour lives are at hazard and for what why did you come if youre so afraid this from an elderly vec woman leaning on a tall staff im not afraid said the dal just cautious caution is our enemy now as much as greven and his army proclaimed a ringing voice into the milling circle of men and women came eladamri and his lieutenants the elves were well armed with captured weapons they fanned out to the edge of the little island watching the night for signs of an ambush eladamri hail said the old vec woman greetings tant jova said the elf leader they clasped hands how flourishes the tribe of jov we are many and there is metal in our hands o eladamri in the past twenty days we have seen but few of the evincars men the skyship does not fly over us and we have slain many moggs found wandering in our territory this is just the beginning tant jova said eladamri as we grow stronger you will see fewer and fewer soldiers on the plain and in the air the rich dal harrumphed eladamri turned to him skeptical darsett yes im skeptical a raid is not a campaign all winning campaigns should start with a victory said gallan eladamris friend and second in command yes but you have a long way to go darsett replied the bulk of the dal behind him murmured in agreement we have a long way to go eladamri said raising his voice for all to hear the time is past when my people alone could resist the stronghold with any hope but survival now is a chance for victory for the overthrow of the evincar and his tyranny we must forge an alliance of all free people on rath to fight the evincar and his forces only then can we be truly free a pretty speech darsett said but speeches wont beat volraths army well build our own army gallan countered what about the airship if we openly revolt greven ilvec and predator will come and destroy us said tant jova mention of the terrible commander and his flying warship provoked a fresh round of unsettled muttering gallan tried to calm the dal and vec leaders but they were plainly afraid of arousing the wrath of greven darsett raised his voice over the noise already those dal in the stronghold who resisted the evincar have vanishedlady takara my cousin sterba the lone kor had gradually circled into the crowd until he was close to the elves he caught eladamris eye i dont know you friend who are you furah he said in his odd lisping way of the fishers of life all comment ceased the fishers of life were a tribe that lived near the summit of the stronghold itself no one knew the peak as well as they it was rumored the fishers of life even had access to the inner crater through secret fissures in the flowstone speak said eladamri tell us your mind furah the whiskered catlike kor shoved his face close to the elf chieftains volrath is no more he said four full seconds went by then the assembly burst into spontaneous cheers eladamri alone frowned how do you know this he asked we know the fishers of life see into the stronghold as you see into the water beneath your village volrath left rath on the other flying ship the one pursued by greven ilvec gallan excitedly rattled his sword in its scabbard if this is so our task is half done theres more said furah grevens flying ship lies in ruins atop the citadel i myself have seen it there without predator the evincars troops have no long range reconnaissance and no ability to strike at great distances from their base in the stronghold there were small outposts stationed here and there on the plain but without the airship they would be easy targets for eladamris raiders everyone began talking at once furahs news changed the dal and vec leaders from cautious conspirators to fiery revolutionaries some actually wanted to storm the stronghold at once i want greven ilvecs blood tant jova said darkly for all the members of my clan whove perished at his hands wait be still eladamri barked no offense to you honorable furah but we must be sure of news of such importance gallan i want confirmation of what the kor says is volrath gone is the airship out of action the young elf nodded it shall be done eladamri he immediately sprinted into the night to carry out his orders this changes things eladamri said gravely we have an opportunity to strike a blow for freedom in time a new evincar will be chosen by the overlordsit may be happening even now before the enemy can reorganize we must strike if the leaders of the free dal and vec pledge their support and send warriors to fight with us ill take every royal outpost between the stronghold and the skyshroud forest tant jova whistled through her gapped teeth there must be thirty outposts in the territory you describe she said how many warriors would you need to do such a thing as many as i can get my friend where will you attack first asked darsett he pondered only a moment the block house at chireef thats within sight of the stronghold yes not a likely place for us to attackso all the better a place to strike darsett and the young dal fighting men began proposing various battle plans eladamri listened with half an ear then he noticed furah was no longer present damn him he thought he wanted to trust the kor but their ways were so strange and they were so close to the stronghold could furahs news be a ruse to lure them into open battle gallan would find out the truth until then they would plan for an attack tant jova took eladamri aside your liege gallan told me your daughter avila is dead at the hands of a stronghold assassin i grieve for a fathers loss thank you volrath thought by such means to break me but this foul murder only hardens my resolve tant jovas coppercolored face softened she was very very old for a vec shed seen many terrible things in her long life all coming from the stronghold ill make a pact with you o eladamri she said we shall never submit to the evincar never cease to fight his forces and never put down our swords until greven ilvec and all his minions have paid the price of justice eladamri grasped her ancient hand no words were spoken but even if faced with death neither would break their solemn bond after many hours the pain had not subsided his mind flickered in and out seeking a place to hide from the terror solace was brief because his body would not let his mind go tormented by thirst ertai crawled across the floor of his cell to the flowstone spigot mounted high on the wall the warders had teased him pantomiming that ertai had to speak to the spigot in order to get water from it so he crawled from the filthy pallet on which grevens moggs had thrown him crawled despite the burns on his legs and chest and despite the fact that most of his fingers were broken waah was as close to the word water as he could manage the spigot could not or would not understand him and remained closed ertai hated these machines they were so inelegant and inefficient why duplicate the power of magic with crude artifacts it was an old argument one he remembered having with hanna barrins daughter and weatherlights navigator how he wished he could have an argument with the stubborn serious hanna right now he yearned for a cool drink he had to focus past his pain ertai called forth memories of waterthe clay jar that stood in the corridor outside the bedroom of his boyhood home the one with the leaping fish painted on it the waterfall at jendary all thunder and cold mist the blue ocean around tolaria the rich everchanging basin on which the magical isle shimmered a single cool drop hit his forehead water water water he shouted with his mind a trickle rewarded his effort but no more what little liquid fell moistened his parched lips and he croaked water the spigot opened with a gush eagerly ertai gulped at the silver stream it had a hard mineral taste but at that moment it was finer than any rare vintage enough said a voice the flow stopped he wiped his eyes and discovered he wasnt alone the greenfreckled girl the emissary was standing inside the cell door watching him youll flood the room she said pointing to the spreading puddle on the floor licking his lips ertai rasped i have nothing to say i didnt ask you anything oh he tried to stand but there was no strength in his limbs forgive me for not standing he straightened with difficulty what do you want i observed you just now you opened the valve using magic didnt you so it shows considerable skill for an unaugmented person to have any influence however small over flowstone belbe said i have considerable skill ertai replied with futile dignity belbe came closer and squatted down ertai shrank from her until he realized she wasnt there to hurt him she examined him with keen eyes he felt a bit like a butterfly in a collectors jar her expression was without any feeling but curiosity i want to release you she said give me your word you wont try to escape and ill parole you he could hardly believe it at best he expected a quick execution after telling greven everything he knew whats to become of me he asked i want you to work on developing your ability to influence flowstone ertai let out a short highpitched giggle then another a moment later he dissolved in a fit of coughing when he tried laughing with his broken ribs water said belbe she held her cupped hands under the spigot they filled and she said enough kneeling beside the wheezing ertai she offered him water from her own hands with trembling fingers he guided her hands to his lips thank you he whispered if you can control the flowstone she went on unaffected great things await you are you offering me a job asked ertai wryly belbe separated her hands the last drops of water fell to the damp floor im offering you a chance to become evincar of rath chapter enemies with volrath gone the empty throne lent an air of uncertainty to every activity in the stronghold crovax stepped into this maelstrom of confusion and doubt armed with belbes commission to strike at the rebels he threw himself into the task troops of the royal army were marched out of the stronghold and mustered on the plain by companies battalions of moggs less disciplined and less intelligent massed behind the soldiers and awaited their new commander crovax disdained the elaborate military ceremonies favored by volrath and went on foot among his troops followed by his newly formed personal guard the corps of sergeants the one thing missing from this gathering of martial might was greven ilvec since crovax did not ask him to join the expedition against eladamri the erstwhile commander of all rathi forces chose not to appear on the plain with the army he remained in the citadel overseeing the extensive repairs being made to predator crovax hand on his sword hilt approached the corps of sergeants nasser stepped out of line and saluted the army is mustered as ordered sir very good do you have the list asked crovax nasser slipped a hand under his breastplate and pulled out a folded slip of parchment crovax studied it briefly then walked to a spot in full view of the massed troops he closed his eyes and extended his hands fingers spread the flowstone substrate humped up a murmur went through the soldiery the hump became a rectangular stage six feet wide and ten feet long crovax raised his hands and the platform bulked higher when the stage was a full six feet off the ground he lowered his hands just before his boots touched the side of the platform steps indented themselves allowing crovax to easily climb to the top only the front ranks had seen crovax command the flowstone but word filtered back through the assembled troops they stirred restlessly arms and armor clanking as they fidgeted and stretched to get a glimpse of their new leader far in the back the moggs grunted and hooted and climbed on each others backs to see crovax soldiers of rath he exclaimed one hundred companies of soldiers each snapped to attention in unison the moggs quieted i am crovax of urborg the emissary of the overlords has appointed me to command an expedition against the enemy the rebel skyshroud elves we will shortly undertake this expedition but first i have some things to tell you an aerial vehicle came to rath from a faroff place and lent support to an attack by the rebel leader eladamri he did not mention he came to rath aboard that same vehicle the enemy airship has been dealt with and will not be a factor in our fight more muttering rippled through the ranks crovax let them talk for a few moments then held up his hands for silence our own ship predator is under repair and will soon be flying again the rebels believe we dont dare move against them without our airship theyre wrong starting today i will lead this force against the home village of eladamri whose location our spies have made known to us he paused expecting cheers when none came crovax glowered nasser and the sergeants raised a shout and the soldiers halfheartedly joined in crovax waved for quiet we will exact revenge for the defeat the elves dealt greven ilvec but first i have another task a solemn and sacred warriors duty he unfolded the parchment nasser had given him when i read the following names i want the officers named to come to me he cleared his throat from the first company captain thayer ilvec from the third company captain ulan ildal from the seventh company lieutenant shirzod ilvec the list grew until eighteen officers all company commanders stood nervously at crovaxs feet you commanded companies during the recent fight with the elf rebels crovax said all of you were either outfought or outthought by your foes because of your dereliction of duty cowardice and incompetence in the face of the enemy for your abject failure as commanders and as soldiers you are hereby condemned to death the officers milled around in shock they had no place to run on the right they were hemmed in by the corps of sergeants and on the left by a band of moggs whod been summoned by crovax for just such an eventuality several of the officers fell to their knees and raised open hands to crovax who stood above them glowering mercy mercy great lord the fault was not ours they cried with a nod crovax set the moggs on the pleading men the shambling creatures dragged six screaming officers from the crowd and dispatched them with their heavy clubs it was considered a great disgrace to be killed by a mogg and the surviving twelve officers closed ranks and drew their swords ready to slay any mogg that approached them hold said crovax the moggs lowered their bloody clubs crovax turned to the surviving officers for your last soldierly action ive decided to suspend your sentences you are reduced in rank to common soldiers and assigned to the scout battalion you will lead our column into the skyshroud forest if you distinguish yourselves in combat you may yet be restored in rank again crovax wanted hurrahs but the troops were uniformly silent the spectacle of six rathi officers bludgeoned to death by moggs did not encourage anyone to cheer irritated crovax dismissed the men the designated companies will muster on the plain for the expedition in six intervals he shouted the stage sank back into the ground nasser and the sergeants assembled in front of him worthless rabble crovax said did you see their faces they were sickened by those cowards deaths no wonder they lost their last fight what can be done with such weaklings they will recover once they taste victory nasser said theyll win if i have to whip them all the way to the skyshroud about the route sir have you given any thought to what part the smell of freshly spilt blood teased crovaxs nostrils his attention kept wandering to the slain officers finally the lure proved too strong and he walked away losing nassers question in midsentence the six men lay in a heap their skulls crushed not one man drew so much as a dagger to defend himself crovax could not understand it he announced their deaths and still they didnt fight spineless worms there was one among the slain officers who hadnt quite surrendered his life crovax could sense it his hands and face tingled and the strange hunger awoke inside him he kicked aside two corpses to uncover the one who was still alive the soldiers face was white and his chest barely moved to draw breath crovax knelt in the gore and gently turned the mans face to him a faint current of lifeforce played over crovaxs fingers just a feather touch but it was there the jar kirril had given him in the dream halls had contained a primitive life taken from some animal the remembered thrill of absorbing the glowing orb made crovax shudder by the time hed mastered himself again the officer was about to expire crovax pressed his hand to the dying mans face ignoring the crushed bone and purplish blood clotted there yes he had it invisible by daylight the escaping lifeforce of the soldier was snared by the tidal pull of crovaxs appetite though it was but the last gasp of a dying man it was far sweeter than the crude sample hed taken from kirrils jar what delight what ecstasy he endured he felt uplifted ennobled enriched here indeed must be the food of the gods he heard his name being called distantly over and over gradually he became aware of a hand on his shoulder in a sudden burst of action crovax leaped up scattering nasser and two other sergeants whod been standing over him my lord you were in a trance nasser said so if it was my trance why do you presume to interrupt it uh my lord its been a full hour since you dismissed the army there are preparations to be made crovax looked wildly at the sky time had passed the pile of gray clouds which earlier had been stationary in the sky were now billowing on a brisk northern wind it was only a moment crovax whispered my lord never mind carry on with the preparations send a squad of moggs to clear the bodies away and burn them nasser finished cremation was the custom on rath no crovax said have the moggs set up a gibbet by the causeway and hang the bodies from it i want the whole expedition to march past them it will motivate them dont you agree as you say my lord supported by two somber guards and accompanied by belbe ertai was ushered into a small chamber within a large tower outside the main citadel it was an unsettling place filled to the ceiling with vats vessels and urns of unknown purpose some tanks held rank solutions that bubbled and seethed even though no fire burned beneath them here and there flowbots continued in tasks volrath had set for them one rotated an hourglassshaped flask at precise twominute intervals a muddy brown solution drained endlessly from one half of the flask to the other another long insectlike arm switched bowls of red and yellow gelatin from under a device emitting colored rays ertai could feel the air was alive with power most of it was destructive energy the forces of corruption and decay it was so strong he reasoned there must be a powerstone somewhere in the laboratorya very large powerstone what is this place he asked thinking hed been better off in his cell volraths laboratory belbe said he did considerable work with animals here i understand his collection of artificial creatures is quite fascinating would you like to see them no thank you she shrugged perhaps later heres what we came for in the center of the room almost obscured by other apparatus was a large circular slab of crystal the flat top was grooved with five concentric rings the sides were lined with narrow vertical flutes made of some smoky transparent mineral the slab was sited under an elaborate metal tripod fifteen feet high rendered in the skeletal organic style of the fortress itself the tripod supported a second faceted crystal about half the diameter of the slab below it wires were attached to the smaller crystal running off to all parts of the laboratory here was the source of the power ertai had sensed since entering the room both crystals were saturated with it help him onto the device belbe told the guards wait a minute ertai protested youre not putting me on that thing do you know what it is belbe crossed her arms you want to be well dont you this machine can alleviate all your injuries in a few minutes otherwise youll have to be confined to bed for days maybe weeks even then your hands may not heal properly ertai tried not to look at his ruined hands greven had allowed his moggs to crush his fingers with thumbscrews after hed outlasted the branding irons crovax is leaving this day with a force to destroy the rebels belbe went on if he succeeds i must name him evincar once that happens i can do nothing else for you hell have me killed ertai said he looked up at the tall soldier holding his left arm wouldnt you think so the guard nodded why was he hesitating so he got an infusion of negative energyso what hed handled amounts of such power before on an experimental basis it was distasteful but hed suffered no ill effects from it power was power only stumpwater witches and country bumpkins still believed types of power were good or bad he had no illusions about becoming evincar of rath so absurd was the whole idea his first response after belbe proposed it was to laugh in her face the laughter quickly died smothered by the fire in his tormented flesh and the look of disappointment on belbes face when she offered the option of rapid healing and a far more comfortable existence than either a barren cell or a headsmans ax he chose to play along for a while once he regained his strength he might be able to escape to portal canyon open a gateway to dominaria and get back home at least there was a chance the loss of such a talented wizard would be an infamous crime a terrible loss to civilization what do you say belbe asked breaking in on his reverie the choice is yours i suppose i can handle a little he said good belbe smiled ertai found himself feeling glad hed pleased her the soldiers hoisted the young wizard onto the crystal slab belbe ordered them back she fiddled with the alignment of the upper focusing crystal centering the stream of power on ertais chest dont overdo it ertai said trying to sound nonchalant she didnt answer but went to the shielded control station to make a few adjustments volrath used this infuser to heal experimental animals after hed surgically altered them on higher settings it can mutate living creatures into drastically different forms belbe clicked over several switches im using a lower setting in this case she announced beginning now with a loud crack sparks flew from the array of wires above the focal crystal ertai helpless because of his injuries could do nothing but watch the fireworks overhead stand by belbe shouted over the throb of the machinery im diverting power from the laboratory flowbots one by one the automatic mechanisms in the lab shut down jars fell to the floor and smashed spilling their unnatural contents horrible odors wafted through the room ertai noticed the focal crystal had begun to glow darkly it was an odd concept a dark glow but there was no better way to describe the presence of negative energy he expected to see a beam emerge from the stone and touch him but it never did instead the glow got wider and darker gradually blotting out everything else in sight unlike the power hed tapped to bring predator in for a crash landing ertai discovered this dark energy in its pure form felt cold his body felt flooded by ice and the cold spread rapidly through his chest and down his legs it did blot out the pain of his injuries and for that he was grateful with a snap the surge of power ceased ertai pushed up on one elbow and saw the laboratory was hip deep in mist each breath he exhaled made sparkling ice crystals in the air belbe appeared swimming out of the fog she looked disheveled her hair awry how do you feel she asked wonderful ertai flexed his hands formerly crumpled like a bundle of broken reeds i feel like newno better than new he hopped off the slab and patted himself all over his burns were gone his ribs were healed even the bruises from the beating predators sailors had given him were gone what about his mind he held up a finger on his right hand and a tiny flame appeared at the tip ertai extended the next finger and made the little flame leap to it and then the next finger and so on it was an elementary magical exercise one he could do since he was a small child by the time the flame had jumped to his fourth finger it flickered and turned orange then red it dropped down to his pinkie and became purple when ertai transferred the violet flicker to the thumb of his left hand the tiny flame went jet black he stared at the black flame belbe watched him are you all right ertai snuffed the flame with his other hand its nothing he said hed never seen the finger flame change color before he was suffused with dark energy true but hed created a yellow flame and not willed it to change that it did so by itself was disturbing belbe gently pulled his hands apart come its time you had a proper bath clean clothes and food she led him by the hand through the misty lab on his way out he saw two empty suits of armor standing near the door the men inside the two guards whod brought him there were gone where are the soldiers he said in answer to his own question ertais foot snagged something soft behind the shelves was a fivefootlong gray slug oozing a trail of iridescent slime across the floor another monster slug nudged at the base of one of the suits of armor perhaps i used too high a setting after all belbe said mildly the skyshroud expeditionary force tramped down the long causeway from the stronghold their faces wrapped in scarves to keep out the swirling dust the wind had picked up in the past few hours a hub reversal was nigh and that always unsettled raths weather the massive device atop the stronghold periodically rotated itself to equalize the wear on its energyfocusing apparatus when the hub turned rapidly changing winds scoured the surface of rath crovax raised another flowstone reviewing stand from which to watch his troops march out he had a total of fifty companies ten thousand men and ten thousand moggs acting as porters carrying supplies for a sixteenday campaign twothirds of his force was infantry while the other thirtyfive hundred men were rathi cavalry they rode mutant twolegged beasts called kerls created by volrath as cavalry mounts it was a powerful force far larger than any sent out by any previous evincar soldiers marched down the causeway to the plain passing the six corpses twirling in the hub wind moggs had stripped the bodies of anything of value leaving the dishonored officers clad only in rags confronted by this sobering display the skyshroud expeditionary force marched out in total silence crovax fumed as the long column of men and moggs slogged by the troops had no spirit on dominaria an army left home singing with pipes and drums playing martial tunes the army of rath was a dull sullen force compared to the warriors crovax remembered when half the column was past his reviewing stand crovax dissolved the platform and mounted his kerl he took the reins from a mogg whod held them patiently crovax spurred his mount bowling over the mogg and sending him rolling in the dust in the vanguard of the army were the twelve condemned officers acting as scouts behind them rode crovaxs orderlies from the corps of sergeants each orderly had a percher on his shoulder these were another of volraths creationspigeonsized flying creatures with leathery blue wings and flaring trumpetshaped mouths perchers understood simple commands and could repeat short messages verbatim they flew back and forth over the army relaying orders before nightfall the scouts had reached the outpost of chireef this was a twostory blockhouse situated on the edge of a flowstone sea a basin consisting of miles and miles of flowstone frozen in motionless waves like the surface of an ocean the garrison of chireef stood ready to receive crovax and his force crovax and his aides galloped up to the blockhouse in a flurry of jingling arms and flapping banners the commander of chireef gunder ildal was plainly stunned by the size of the army crovax brought with him my lord he said where are you going with so vast a force where i will crovax replied curtly how are conditions between here and the skyshroud forest quiet as the grave my lord gunder ildal mopped his brow pushing his helmet back to get to his generous forehead no rebel would dare get so close to the stronghold yes yes the cavalry needs water for their mounts after theyve had their fill let the moggs drink what they can he reined his blackspotted beast around will you be staying the night gracious lord i can offer what accommodation our humble outpost affords the column marches all night crovax replied if in two days time any rebels come your way i want you to stop them theyll be fleeing their defeat and i dont want any to escape gunder looked puzzled defeat my lord yes the defeat i shall inflict on them the first company of cavalry lined up by a row of spouts set high on the walls of the blockhouse crovax rode by and mentally commanded the valves to open out gushed fresh water from the blockhouse cisterns kerls pushed their fleshy faces into stone troughs and lapped the cascading water with their flat black tongues only yards away thirsty moggs weighed down by almost two hundred pounds of supplies each licked dry lips and anxiously awaited their turn at the troughs gunder slowly walked down the line of his troops eyeing them carefully chireef had only a normal garrison of fortyeight soldiers fiftyfive were mustered on the plain and that made gunder nervous suppose someone noticed crovax and his leading elements swept on and gunder ordered his men back inside once the metal door was closed and barred he pulled off his helmet and poured a pitcher of cold water over his profusely sweating head wine he shouted can someone find me wine whats the matter asked eladamri emerging from the shadows you should be pleased darsett youve met this new warlord crovax face to face and he didnt see through you or your men darsett and his dal followers shed their helmets and heaved a collective sigh of relief eladamris raiders had taken chireef by stealth only hours before they were about to set fire to the place when they spotted the huge dust cloud raised by crovaxs oncoming army rather than be caught in the open by a vastly superior force eladamri kept his warriors inside and sent darsett out disguised as the late commander of the outpost what do we do now darsett said peeking through an arrow slit to spy on the troops passing by outside wait until theyre gone said eladamri then well proceed as planned gallan who had wrapped his elven hair and ears with a scarf to pose as a dal soldier said anxiously we know where theyre going eladamri the elf leader nodded his snakehide armor was freckled with blood he dipped a rag in an open barrel of water and dabbed at the stains crovax is heading for the forest he thinks he can destroy us by destroying our homes he said calmly are we going to let him gallan demanded hes welcome to try evincars as far back as my grandfathers day have tried to impose their rule on us this crovax seems no wiser than they in fact so far he shows less wit than the departed volrath our late evincar used infiltrators and the airship to hunt us down his tactics were very dangerous as our losses in the past year show he paused in his scrubbing even my daughter wasnt safe in my own house but we have little to fear from a big blundering mass like that where they go well fade away and when theyre tired and low on food and water well strike he stooped to pick up gunder ildals helmet tossed on the floor by the nervous darsett upon seeing the grim visage of volrath on the brow of the helmet eladamris face darkened with implacable hatred chapter baptism the army marched all night around the edge of the flowstone sea by daybreak the men were dragging spears and shields in the dust behind them moggs normally hardier than humans were staggering under the burdens crovax had imposed on them disciplined formations broke down gaps appeared in the long column and still crovax led them on crovaxs handpicked aides galloped the length of the column cajoling and threatening the men to close ranks and move forward soon they were faltering too reeling in their saddles like the exhausted cavalry screening the armys flanks perchers took over their job relaying crovaxs increasingly shrill orders to the rearmost elements of the force crovaxs outriders spotted a band of elves on the open plain some miles from the forest they werent rebels just a hunting party but the rathi cavalry rounded them up and herded them back to crovax tired his sable armor coated with gray dust crovax was in a foul mood when the elf prisoners were brought before him they did not cower or beg for mercy from him that annoyed crovax without even asking any questions he ordered five of the eight elves beheaded on the spot the remaining three hunters ashenfaced huddled together in a circle of rathi lancers crovax willed the flowstone up around their ankles both to restrain them and to demonstrate his mastery of the nanomachines he dismounted and walked over to the eldest elf where is eladamri the elf whose white hair was turning amber with age shook his head i do not know eladamri crovax clasped the elf around his waist and thrust a long dagger through his ribs he held his blade there staring into the eyes of his victim as the elfs blood coursed over his feet crovax withdrew his dagger with a swift jerk releasing at the same time the elder elfs feet from the flowstone the hunter folded like a candle held too near a flame crovax wiped the blood from his blade with two fingers he stood close to the next prisoner and flung the dead elfs blood in his face where is eladamri he asked again the second elf held his chin up and shook his head unwilling to answer crovax dagger in hand crossed in front of him the elf shut his eyes dreading the thrust he thought was coming crovax circled behind him while his eyes were closed he put the dagger in his teeth and leaped into the air kicking the elf in the small of his back because his ankles were held by the flowstone he couldnt fall naturally and when crovax bore down on his back with all his weight the elfs legs snapped at the knee he screamed as crovax stood on his back unmoved by his agony my lord began one of the troopers the next man who speaks will be given to the moggs crovax said quietly he squatted on top of the moaning prisoner and asked his question again the elf could only choke in the dust crovax took the prisoners head in his hands and in one powerful wrench broke the elfs neck the third prisoner was the youngest and he openly trembled when crovax approached eladamri lives in the village of sweetwater he said unconsciously tugging at his captive feet he left there five days ago to meet dal kor and vec chiefs to convince them to join the rebellion crovaxs face shone with pleasure everyone around him assumed he was pleased to finally be getting information but in fact he was in the throes of ecstasy after imbibing the lifeforces of the two elves hed killed he smiled at the third elf in a dreamy languorous way where did this meeting take place i dont know i dont know great lord spare me please spare me crovax still smiling laid a hand on the young elfs cheek whats your name boy valin merciful lord crovax nodded he drew back his hand and struck the prisoner hard on the jaw with a crunch of bone the youth fell to the ground unconscious crovax released the elf from the flowstone chain him and put him in with my personal baggage he may have more information to tell us hidden among the waves in the flowstone sea the rebels watched the gradual disintegration of crovaxs army with satisfaction years of soft living inside the stronghold had taken the iron out of the soldiers legs eladamris ardent young followers urged him to make a spoiling attack on the column before it reached the skyshroud forest not yet the elf leader said its a long march to the forest and a lot of useful obstacles lie in between but our homesour families gallan and the others protested send word for them to retreat to the tree tops deeper in the forest word was sent but the hotheads around eladamri continued to seethe with pentup frustration their anger was fanned when they heard about the capture of the hunting party eladamris scouts saw the whole episode and reported it to their chief eladamri received the news impassively we must save the survivor gallan urged hes lost said eladamri he was lost the instant the riders took him but he lives said cardamel another of his youthful followers what would you have me do lose ten to save one thats what our enemy wants us to do our people are dying and were doing nothing gallan said eladamri swept the remains of their meager lunch from the stone around which they sat shall destroy their army isnt that enough but when in less than a day the enemy will reach skyshroud by then the column will be stretched out halfway back to chireef well hit them before dawn when most of them will be asleep he threw down a snakeskin scroll and added two thousand warriors from skyshroud the dal and the vec will combine for the attack if the gods favor us crovax and his men will be snake food by this time tomorrow the elves cheered fiercely and clasped each others arms pledging their lives to victory eladamri did not join in but silently left the rock crevice where theyd been eating when he was gone cardamel took gallan aside some of the lads want to do something about the hunter held by crovax he said his voice low his names valin hes firanus grandson did you know that gallan shook his head theres four of us ready to take valin away if you give us leave i wont go against eladamris orders gallan replied cardarnels face fell but if you four should happen to slip away tonight i may not be able to remember where youve gone the elves clasped hands may the gods bless your faulty memory cardamel said grinning on the underside of the citadel near the lava inlet to the great flowstone works greven ilvec was supervising the repair of his airship workmen mogg labor gangs and flowbot machinery swarmed over the broken hull slaving around the clock to rebuild the ship greven applied himself to the task at hand he tried to forget his humiliation at the hands of crovax tried not to think about the fact that the insolent usurper was leading the armyhis armyagainst the rebels even now greven had hunted eladamri for years and he respected the elfs cunning he sensed deep in his muchaltered chest that crovax was courting disaster ruthlessness was no substitute for experience and in his own brooding way greven welcomed the day when crovax would meet defeat overhead a hull frame slipped from the grasp of a flowbot crane and crashed to the floor crushing a pair of moggs loitering there greven threw down the blueprints he was holding and stormed out onto the dock dung for brains he bellowed dont you know you cant hoist a hull frame with just one crane use two you worthless worms a second flowbot arm lowered and grasped the fallen frame now you see youve bent it greven raged he ordered the damaged frame to be returned to the foundry and pounded straight again greven retrieved the fallen plans when he straightened he found a slender ethereal kor standing not two feet in front of him how did you get in here what do you want the kor pressed a hand to his chest a gesture of respect kor performed instead of bowing greetings dread lord my name is furah of the fishers of life greven knew the tribe they lived outside the stronghold crater they were harmless almost invisible people who never troubled the authorities what is it greven asked impatiently im quite busy as you can see certain information has come to me information of value to you i believe about what the activities of a certain resident of the outer landsthe skyshroud forest perhaps grevens teeth began to grind talking to a kor was like trying to swat flies with a broadswordthings never seemed to connect speak plainly before have your legs broken i speak of the elf eladamri dread lord you have news of eladamri greven tried to take the kor by the arm but he missed somehowhis hand swept through empty air furah stepped back just beyond his reach forgive me dread lord but i dislike being toucheda quirk common to my people get to the point furah pressed a hand to his chest again eladamri has been trying to enlist the cooperation of the dal the vec and the kor in his war against you furah said i myself went to a conclave in the forest on behalf of my people and how was eladamris message received with great enthusiasm dread lord but not by you why are you informing on them furah behind greven a trio of moggs overturned a crucible of molten flowstone on their way up a ramp into the airship the liquid stone immune to commands or programming formed into legions of tiny silver spheres and skittered in all directions workers who stepped on the flowstone slipped and fell all over the dock with a snarl greven left the kor man and roared for all work to cease the tumultuous airship dock fell silent save for the hiss of the waiting flowbots everyone stand still greven shouted and he was heard throughout the dock when the stone solidifies it will be safe to move again a tiny silver bead whirled in place at grevens feet as it cooled the flowstone slowly flattened into an egg then a disk and finally spread itself as thin as paper it lost its silver color and took on the patina of whatever substance it was lying on resume work greven called the dock exploded with activity all over again he turned around expecting to find the kor waiting for him but there was no sign of furah what should he make of this information if eladamri had forged an alliance with restive elements among the outland dal and vec then the simple annoying elf rebellion could turn into a fullblown civil war crovax crovax had taken half the army on a moggs errand into the worst swamp on rath he was expecting to trample over a few hundred elves when in fact he was facing an unknown force of much greater size he shouted for his vec foreman and ordered him to keep the repairs going no matter what where are you going dread lord asked the foreman to see the emissary he found belbe in the evincars suite she was sitting in one of volraths grand chairs watching ertai wash himself in the evincars ornate bath hello greven ertai said breezily he sat in steaming water up to his hips while a jointed fleshstone appliance scrubbed his back with a sodden rag what in the overlords name greven spotted belbe in volraths chair observing ertais ablutions its called a bath belbe said evidently a custom among humans the ritual serves both as relaxation and hygiene i know what a bath is excellency grevens molars were ready to pulverize iron at that moment why is this enemy of rath this prisoner in the royal bath because i was dirty ertai replied its hardly fitting for a sorcerer of my skills and a candidate for evincar to go around smelling like one of your moggs words failed greven completely he spread his powerful hands and looked to belbe for enlightenment its true she said crovax while presenting excellent qualifications cannot be the sole candidate it wouldnt be efficient to award the position to him without competition since ertai has demonstrated outstanding magical ability including some untutored influence over flowstone its efficient to offer him a chance to try for the job as well belbe descended from the high chair she was clad in a large belted scarlet tabard that flowed from her shoulders like a cape and swept to the floor against the monochrome decor she blazed like a flame which reminds me lord greven would you like to be considered for evincar as well you have many years of effective service on your side and manifest talents for the job there it was plainly stated at last greven had pondered this possibility since volraths departure and he knew what his answer must be thank you excellency but i must decline he said as you choose but why im content to remain a loyal servant of the throne it would mean the end of the control rod ive considered that i served volrath for many years and ive seen firsthand the effect unfettered power had on him i would rather be the blade than the hand that wields it ertai plucked the washcloth from the fleshstone scrubbers soft claw he wiped his face with it and said why is that he could not explain his past to thesechildren greven had once been envec a leader of a great warrior nation treachery and jealousy cost him his position his clan and his life with no other recourse but ignominious death he fell into the hands of volrath and became ilvec the hated outcast he said simply because the victim curses his killer not the blade that cuts him blades have no choice who they cut men do ertai replied i have given my answer greven thundered he struggled for calm in the presence of the emissary excellency i have news of grave import greven recounted his odd conversation with furah belbe listened while walking around the edge of the tiled bathing pool you believe crovax has led his army into a trap she asked after some contemplation i do excellency how would you remedy this situation i doubt i could reach crovax with a relief force before the rebels strike greven said worse crovax would probably commandeer any companies i brought enlarging eladamris bag of killed or captured that sounds like him ertai said digging at his ear with the washcloth greven ignored him i can if your excellency desires puttogether a force and go to crovaxs aid he said i can have a scratch force prepared in two hours no said belbe no greven and ertai asked together this expedition is crovaxs audition his way of proving he is strong enough to be evincar very well let him prove it if your informant is correct crovax faces a more skillful enemy than he imagines this is his chance to prove his mettle cold muttered ertai when belbe asked him to repeat himself he said the waters gone cold then get out snapped greven ertai looked from the hulking warrior to the gamine emissary and shook his head i can wait greven gritted his teeth then he continued we may lose many soldiers excellency yes and valuable arms and a host of moggs quite possibly does any of this concern your excellency what matters in a test of strength is who wins belbe said she paused looking into the pool where ertai sat her crimsondraped reflection wavered with every ripple of the water victory belongs to the strong dont forget luck and brains ertai added the strongest wrestler may fall if he slips upand a smart fighter provides his own bar of soap so saying he squeezed the cake of soap in his fist it squirted free landing at grevens feet he kicked the perfumed bar back into the tub so i am to do nothing greven asked once the metaphors had settled down put the garrison on alert belbe said and try to trace this furahif he spies on his friends he may be spying on us as well i fear insurrection should crovax be defeated greven said gravely there are thousands of dal in the crater city and thousands more vec and kor below the citadel i dont think the shorthanded garrison could defend the citadel in the face of a general uprising hostages said ertai what belbe and greven questioned in unison take hostages from the leading families of the vec dal and kor ertai said that way theyll not be inclined to act up should the worst happen greven was inwardly surprised this cocky boy not long ago his helpless victim had hit upon a real stratagem was he a serious contender for evincar after all a useful idea dorian ildal knows the people in the stronghold have him work out who will be taken and how many from each race belbe looked up from the tub lord greven you will round up hostages as ertai has suggested be firm but dont rough them up hold them in a secure place until crovaxs fate is known it shall be done your excellency with that the stalwart warrior departed once greven was gone belbe sat down on the edge of the bath and dipped her bare feet in the water she smiled with delight at the sensation swishing her feet back and forth in the suds suddenly she stopped this waters still warm ertai slipped carefully through the shallow pool until he could lean on the edge beside her belbe he said confidentially whatever happens dont let anyone hurt the hostages why if no threat is perceived taking hostages has no strategic value he laid a damp hand on her knee she froze shocked by the sudden intimate contact if you hurt the hostages you really will have a civil war on your hands then why did you suggest it he looked around furtively may i speak freely she nodded its part of my plan to become evincar i dont understand ertai lowered his voice further past evincars ruled by fear yes fear of death fear of soldiers fear of the overlords and their machines i wont rule that way belbe should i become evincar it will be with the support and acclaim of the people not through terror if crovax wins his battle i want to present the hostages their freedom if he loses i want to save them from grevens revenge there was no sound but the drip drip of water from the flowstone spigot the humidity was such that belbes hair relaxed and dew formed on her cool skin rulership is imposed not granted she recited as if reading a text tyranny is imposed ertai countered freedom is the will of the people freedoma lack of political or social control also known as anarchy democracy or mob rule ertai pushed away he waded to the opposite end of the pool where a heap of towels and a dressing gown lay he glanced back once out of selfconsciousness then climbed out of the bath belbe did not look at him she stared blankly at the lapping water i forget who you are where you come from he said even though she wasnt listening you dont understand anything but brute force do you on a hunch he read her aura to his surprise she was not so dark as crovax or greven belbe had a streak of violence in her makeup but radiating outward from her physical self were the bright coronas of other attributespassion intelligence reason the strongest force at work in belbe was curiosityan interesting discovery ertai tied the sash of the gown tightly around his waist his fingers twinged from the effort as if from rheumatism not fully healed he mused perhaps he should visit volraths laboratory later for another infusion that would make his studies in magical flowstone manipulation go much easier good night belbe he said still pondering she didnt answer night fell and crovax allowed the army to halt its headlong advance the hub had completed a halfrevolution that night and wind from its motion whipped through the camp in heavy humid gusts on the horizon the dark profile of the skyshroud forest beckoned tomorrow the army would penetrate the forest in his tent crovax received the reports of his scouts of the twelve condemned officers only eight had returned from the forest to relate what they found the other four entered and were never seen again large sections of the forest are impassable my lord said one scout he was coated head to toe in sticky gray mud the ground below the forest canopy is very swampy and entirely unpredictable in depth i walked for a mile in kneedeep water then without warning stepped in a hole deeper than my head so the swamp is a swamp crovax said dryly thank you for that valuable information how do the elves traverse the skyshroud the hunting party we captured hadnt a speck of mud on them another scout saluted they use the trees my lord i saw bridges made of vines connecting tree to tree they may use trees for small groups but i cant believe they use them exclusively crovax said there must be dry paths built up above the level of the swamp i want them found a jingling sound from the next compartment distracted him he glanced that way and added find me a way into the forest i dont care if it takes all night you hear find it the filthy fatigued soldiers saluted and filed out when they were gone crovax dismissed the guards from the door and sent his aides to inspect the camp once alone he went to the large brassbound hamper in the corner of the tent and threw back the lid a thin scrap of tapestry inside squirmed crovax slowly lifted the cloth hello he said he reached in and dragged out the elf prisoner valin the youths hands and feet were chained and a strip of rag gagged his mouth crovax sat down on a pile of carpets and regarded his prisoner do you believe in curses boy he said valin could only grunt in reply you should believetheyre real somewhere in the distant past my family was cursed by the gift of an amulet my ancestors thought it was just an heirloom but it held a captive angel inside who served our family for generations his tone was so measured so reasonable valin regained his composure he sat up with his back against the hamper cradling his shackles in his lap her name waswell it doesnt matter suffice to say i destroyed the amulet out of anger and the angel was freed because of me she fell under volraths spell and fought for his cause until i was able to find her again we fought i killed her as my familys heir my soul was bound to hers though i didnt know it when she died part of me died with her that was the curse you seethat my life should continue only by the death of others crovax poured wine into a heavy silver goblet at first i was devastated by her loss but i know now that selenias death was a necessary part of my evolution the overlords instructed me they changed what seemed like a foolish tragedy into the source of my strength i know now the path of greatness is strewn with corpses ill pave my way with as many dead bodies as it takes he downed the wine in a gulp and let the cup fall to the carpet the flowstone lanterns in the room dimmed crovax stood his eyes glowing pale red they blotted out my feelings to cure me of my weakness crovax said flatly funny the changes carry over to so many small things wine has no taste anymore eating is just exercise for my jaws the only food i crave now is the life inside other living things so far ive only tasted life from the dying tonight ill dine on the living valins eyed widened in terror he struggled to stand and run even though he was hobbled by thick chains crovax watched him thrash toward the door in two steps he caught the elf and seized him by the back of the neck its an honor really crovax whispered in his ear at least i know your name valin the thousands who follow you will be as anonymous as cattle chapter failure four shadows slipped through the wire grass wrapped head to toe in dark gray cloth they were armed with shortshafted spears cut down to allow for fast handling in tight places the four elves were going to a tight place indeed the camp of the skyshroud expeditionary force cardamel and his comrades kameko darian and sanyu dropped to the ground sidebyside a dozen yards from the picket line every few minutes a pair of kerlmounted men rode by in between the mounted patrols two foot soldiers marched past in the opposite direction barely thirty seconds passed between the concentric rings of sentries not much time to run twenty yards and stop somewhere out of sight lets take out the men on foot kameko suggested even close together it was hard to hear each other the wind was up and would stay up until the hub ceased rotating the first riders to miss them will sound the alarm cardamel said so what do we do asked sanyu cardamel eyed the long rows of tents if they could reach them there were plenty of dark places to skulk there well have to do it one at a time he said run straight for the tent line and hide until the last one crosses over no one had any better idea so cardamels approach was adopted after the next pair of kerls clopped by he sprinted for the tents massed campfires inside the camp robbed the night of its cloak of black and cardamel knew he was highlighted against the sky he ran for all he was worth and slid to a stop between two tents just as the paired foot soldiers appeared around the curve he made it said kameko im next kameko sprinted into cardamels arms and they hugged the dirt as the next patrol came by darian rubbed dust on his hands and crouched in the tall grass ready to run the cavalrymen passed and sanyu slapped him on the back go darian wasnt much of a runner but he was a leaper he was six feet from the tents when the foot guards appeared so he gathered himself and jumped headlong into the shadows with his friends one of the rathi soldiers unslung his crossbow what was that what i didnt see anything said his partner you didnt see something hurtle across right there no what was it i dont know kind of biga bird maybe the soldier licked his lips fresh meat would be great we could roast it when we got off duty he left the path and probed cautiously into the shadows bow leveled his partner waited at the perimeter hurry up he said well be punished for leaving the path here birdie chirped the dal soldier kameko rose up and snatched the crossbow from the astonished mans hands cardamel clamped a hand over his mouth and dragged him into the darkness darian shoved a knife under the hungry soldiers breastplate and he stopped struggling come on called the waiting sentry well get in trouble kameko raised the crossbow and put an irontipped quarrel through the second sentrys throat sanyu burst out of hiding grabbed the dead soldiers feet and dragged his body to the tents just as the next mounted patrol appeared cardamel thought fast he donned the bird hunters helmet and cloak took the crossbow from kameko and stepped out into the open one of the oncoming riders called sentry what are you doing i had to answer nature cardamel replied the riders snorted derisively wheres your partner sanyu was ready for this question he donned the other guards helmet and cloak and stepped out beside cardamel shaking a leg as he went ah he said broadly i needed that the riders spurred on the two elves kept their faces averted under the helmet brims peasants said one rider as they trotted by stick to your assigned route youve seen what lord crovax does to those who fail in their duty we know sanyu muttered before the next patrol came the elves conferred they had no choice cardamel and sanyu would have to walk post for the dead sentries or the game was up itll work cardamel said once you find valin come back here and wait until you see us march bythen youll know its safe how will we know which sentries are you asked darian wait at this exact spot cardamel explained each time i march by here ill tap the bow against my helmet like this he tapped out a pingping pingping sound against his helm then youll know its us they ran to catch up to where the sentries were supposed to be leaving darian and kameko to rescue valin the camp was very large and the elves had to make certain assumptions if they hoped to find their brother elf a prisoner held for interrogation would likely be near the commander of the armycrovax in other words crovaxs quarters would be the largest in camp probably in the center of the sea of tents the elves made for the heart of the enemy camp skirting bright campfires and small groups of moggs the soldiers were dead tired from marching all night and all day so most of the tents were full of snoring men kameko crouched between two tents and pointed ahead the center of the camp was an open square dotted with posts newly sunk in the ground several rathi soldiers were tied to posts their bare bloody backs were mute evidence of the floggings theyd received no doubt for some petty violation of army rules a tall vec soldier with sergeants insignia on his helmet was directing the distribution of water to the punished soldiers a provost if we grab him hell know where valin is kameko said darian nodded they watched the sergeant tick off that each flogged soldier had received a dipper of water then he rolled up his scroll and made to leave the elves flitted between tents ahead of him and when he turned off the main path to reach his bedroll for the night they tackled him high and low the sergeant fought but darian pressed a snakebone dirk against his windpipe kameko hissed be still or die the vec soldier stopped fighting but remained tense ready to spring wheres the elf prisoner where is valin elf prisoner repeated the sergeant loudly kameko nicked him with the dirk for being noisy do that again and youll have a second mouth in your neck wheres the elf prisoner the sergeant smiled in lord crovaxs quarters his smirk infuriated darian who punched the sergeant hard in the gut take us there if you give us away youll be the first to die the two elves followed the sergeant to a complex of conjoined tents in the northeast corner of the square there were no guards at the entrance the sergeant ducked inside kameko and darian followed and kameko pulled the sergeant back if this is your commanders tent why are there no guards he said lord crovax doesnt require them the elves exchanged looks do you want to find him or not darian shoved the sergeant forward go on the tent was a maze of flaps and canvas rooms it seemed deserted until kameko heard a sigh emanating from an adjoining room using the vec soldier as a shield he pushed into the room the sergeant promptly stumbled over a body on the floor kameko look stretched out on the carpet was the young hunter valin empty eyes staring at the ceiling the sergeant had fallen to his knees but in the center of the room sitting slumped on a heap of carpets was crovax himself he looked passedout drunk kameko knelt by the dead elf there were no signs of violence on him no blood no bruises crovax did not react at all to the intruders darian rushed forward ready to kill the enemy commander where he sat his blade went up but froze there kameko the elves looked into crovaxs face a strange rosy light shone in his open eyes even though they were rolled back in his head thin vapor like breath on a cold morning trickled from his open mouth his teeth appeared sharp like those of a wolf or a shark and his body was larger and stronger than it had looked when the elves had seen him for the first time back at chireef worst of all something was moving under crovaxs skinsmall bumps in the flesh of his face moved about of their own volition the forgotten sergeant threw himself on darian down they went in a heap grappling for the elfs bare knife kameko was about to help his friend when the seemingly inert crovax grabbed him by the wrist darian help darian had his own problems the vec sergeant was strong and outweighed him by thirty pounds darian raked the vecs cheek with his knife tip drawing blood the sergeant responded with several pounding blows to the face and darian saw the room swimming away in a black haze crovax lifted his head he pursed his lips and whistleda slow eerie tune kameko drew his knife with his left hand but before he could thrust it through a joint in crovaxs armor the enemy commander effortlessly crushed his wrist bones snapped and ground together a sickening sound kameko screamed and fell to his knees dropping his knife marching side by side in their stolen helmets and cloaks cardamel and sanyu heard shouting inside the camp all the cavalry on the perimeter turned and galloped down paths between the tents toward the center of the camp what do we do sanyu asked keep walking were sentrieswe cant leave our post cardamel replied after much shouting and dashing about a percher appeared flapping its narrow wings and blaring the message given to it assassins assassins have tried to kill the commander two elves are caught more may be around stand your ground assassins assassins weve got to get out of here cardamel said throwing down the crossbow but our comrades our comrades are dead and we will be too if we dont leave now they bolted for the wire grass twentyfive yards away four kerl riders spotted them and gave chase the elves split up cardamel running to the right and sanyu to the left two riders followed each fugitive cardamel knew he couldnt outrun the tireless kerls so after topping a slight rise he whirled and drew the short spear off his back he knelt on one knee and braced the spear with his foot the first rider came tearing over the hill and plowed right into cardamels spear the kerl made a flat bleating sound and heeled over greasy green blood gushing from its chest the rider hit the ground heavily and lay stunned cardamel planted a foot on the thrashing kerls chest and yanked out his spear the second rider hauled on his reins twisting his beast away from the fallen kerl cardamel leaned back and cast his spear it caught the cavalryman in the chest his armor saved him but the impact knocked him backward off the kerls abbreviated rump before he could rise and call for help cardamel cut his throat running for all he was worth cardamel despaired kameko and darian lostvalin was as good as lost he prayed sanyu would evade pursuit and make it back to eladamri he ran more than a mile before he felt safe enough to check behind him wire grass whipped in the hub wind but there were no signs of further pursuit weary cardamel slumped to his knees his bold plan was in ruins and his brave comrades sacrificed what a terrible farce get up he looked up into the grim face of eladamri cardamel opened his mouth to speak but the rebel leader cut him off with a curt wave of his hand save your entreaties you disobeyed me cardamel how many warriors did you lose on your moggs errand mutely cardamel held up three fingers so thats the price weve paid for your night of foolishness just then a courier ran up eladamri eladamri a message from tant jova he handed the elf leader a square of cloth on which the vec matriarch had penned a note eladamri read it and hurled the scrap into cardamels face worse news your bungling has raised a general alarm in the enemy camp and their cavalry have found the vec warriors hiding at the edge of the swamp all our preparations are in jeopardy miserable cardamel drew his knife he sat there despondently fingering the blade eladamri took it away from him theres no point in dying now he said evenly theres fighting to be done cardamel looked at his leader may i go in the vanguard eladamri nodded and gave him back his knife the clamor of distant combat grew until it overcame the constant wind it was not yet midnight hours before the planned attack but all of a sudden the elves had a major battle on their hands ertai slid off the crystal base of the power infuser his formerly aching body felt supple and fit after a few minutes of exposure to the power stream cracking his knuckles he tried the passing fire exercise again this time the tiny flame was black from the start even though he willed a yellow flame he snuffed the ebon flicker and for a moment had the frightening thought that the treatments would alter him permanently like the unfortunate guards who first brought him there scrounging around the laboratory he found a metal tray among volraths equipment and anxiously studied his reflection in it it was still ertai who gazed back at himwasnt it same shock of blond hair same flat nose same weak chin he thrust his jaw forward as he often had when he was a boy trying to correct the receding line of his chin it sank back into place when he relaxed same old ertai he was glad to be healed his talent was too valuable to waste on a meaningless death but he wondered what sort of bargain hed made could he really become ruler of an entire world ruling rath could not be a comfortable position mysterious overlords above and seething revolution belowno being evincar was no job for a sane man let crovax have it sanity was not a handicap crovax enjoyed his stomach growled meals were a problem in the citadel belbe never ate and neither did greven of course he was sure he didnt want to see whator whogreven ilvec ate but hungry he was so he returned to volraths study deep in the laboratory amidst the bizarre apparatus and dripping vilesmelling beakers was an island of cabinets chairs and a monumental desk a dark polished wood cabinet looked promising and the lock broke easily when he applied a psychokinetic spell it contained a number of obvious wine bottles and some paperwrapped bundles that ertai assumed were food the bundles contained hard yellow biscuits he sat down in one of volraths many oversized chairs and nibbled a biscuit experimentally it was dry and slightly salty but better than nothing ertai propped his feet up on a misshapen mogg skull lying on the floor marks on the bony cranium revealed the former master of rath once had the same habit what was his best course of action crovax would likely murder him given the slightest provocation likewise greven belbe was friendly enough but cold as ice if it served her mission for him to die he wasnt sure she would object the cracker gone he began on another there was still the phyrexian transplanar device in portal canyon if he could get there ertai knew he could operate it trouble was portal canyon was a long way from the stronghold getting there was a problem and getting there without being stopped was an even bigger conundrum the only course as he saw it was to continue to play along with belbe that way he had the freedom of the citadel and could improve his magical knowledge and his control of flowstone then when the time was right hed get to portal canyon there you are ertai saw belbe standing nearby lost in thought he hadnt noticed her arrival what are you doing she said contemplating my options she pointed whats that food do you want some he handed her the package now half empty i dont eat belbe said sniffing a biscuit where did you find these in there volrath must have kept them on hand for snacks volrath was energy sufficient like me he didnt need to eat she read the phyrexian script on the biscuit wrapper im sure he never ate this why asked ertai what is it mogg wafers it says ertai grimaced this is mogg food no its made of moggs i imagine volrath fed these wafers to his experimental animals crovax emerged from his stupor to find three dead elves in his tent sergeant tharvello wounded and his entire staff ranting about a night attack by the rebels he shouted for silence send the first cavalry company to fend off the rebels crovax said hold the third and fourth cavalry in reserve north of camp get the infantry and moggs moving i want a standard echelon formation with no more than ten yards between each company string the moggs out in front as skirmishers what is the strength of the enemy unknown said nasser the scouts estimate more than a hundred all on foot it may be a diversion crovax said maintain a sharp watch on other fronts to your posts he stepped over the corpses without a second look tharvello his face bleeding went to his company without any questions or thanks from his commander crovax emerged from camp and stalked quickly through the wire grass the night was tinged cobalt by the distant glow of the strongholds energy column overhead the clouds swirled in a wide spiral pattern flashes of green lightning arcing from one band of clouds to another a cavalry officer galloped in his lance bloody my lord the enemy is retreating to the swamp who are they what were they doing crovax demanded theyre vec my lord our riders first spotted them crawling through the grass toward the camp vec so eladamri has allies no matter harry them to the forest edge captain but dont enter the swamp there may be more of them lying in wait for just such a move the captain saluted and galloped away crovax called for his kerl behind him the expeditionary force was drawing up on the plain in a checkerboard formation each block represented a troop of fifty men and four blocks made a company moggs formed a ragged line ahead of the regular troops the rathi battle formation was a mile long from west to east with the camp nestled behind the center of the line the balance of crovaxs cavalry was positioned north of the tents in reserve crovax rode out to see the actual fighting in the eerie halfdarkness the rathi cavalry was circling small groups of vec warriors who popped up now and then to throw hatchets or stonetipped spears at the kerls and riders crovax saw a stone spearhead shatter on a cavalrymans shield and laughed move in on them crovax cried theyre just savages theyre using stone spears what are you a gang of moggs stung by his taunts the cavalry overran the vec lancing nomad warriors right and left groups of vec not yet engaged began to run for the swamp half a mile away crovax slumped in his saddle this was no contest recall the troopers he said perchers took to the air screeching his orders nasser approached and crovax called to him any movement on other fronts no my lord ive sent scouts out in all directions they report no rebels in sight they rode together back to the battle line to crovaxs surprise the soldiers in the front ranks raised a ragged cheer theyve changed their tune he said all soldiers want is victory nasser replied the wind died for the first time in many hours a fragile stillness ensued the night grew darker as the clouds spread apart filling the whole sky a series of wavering orange lights appeared on the plain north of the rathi camp far away the hub reversed its rotation sending a fresh wind rushing from the north it arrived on the battlefield heavy with the odor of smoke campfires nasser wondered crovax stood in his stirrups a smear of white smoke rolled down the plain with his enhanced eyes he could plainly see his reserve cavalry silhouetted against the winddriven cloud somethings wrong flames leaped skyward from the dry prairie the plain north of the camp was on fire and the winds change of direction was propelling the flames toward crovaxs army face about crovax shouted the enemys behind us elves whirling torches around their heads ran through the high grass applying brands to the thickly growing weeds now a wall of flame a mile long came sweeping toward crovax behind it were more than a thousand elf warriors the cavalry kerls were dumb beasts bred for endurance and passivity but they would not stand in the way of fire two cavalry companies milled about in confusion as their mounts bleated in growing terror reluctantly crovax ordered them out of the way and sent the infantry marching back through the camp to meet the enemy tents and stacks of equipment disrupted the tight battle formation the formal checkerboard broke down into streams of soldiers leaning forward into the wind and smoke the gap between the rathi soldiers and the elves closed to a few yards tents were burning all along the north side of the camp behind the smoke and flames the elves hurled salvoes of spears their snakefang tips were keen and though they didnt always pierce rathi armor they did find enough chinks to inflict casualties on the advancing infantry when the soldiers slowed under the hail of spears the fire caught up to them the lead ranks wavered and began to fall back moggs were already scampering through the camp hooting in alarm why are they retreating i ordered no withdrawal crovax shouted men cant fight in a fire nasser said we must abandon the camp give up the camp to rebels never he spurred forward trampling men and moggs who got in his way a wave of fire was inundating the tents and had almost reached the center of camp soldiers staked in the square for punishment screamed for help as the flames advanced some of their comrades tried to reach them but the conflagration rapidly engulfed the area turning the square into an enormous funeral pyre crovax held his shield over his head to ward off the rain of elven spears his kerl blubbered and pranced anxious to escape the flames crovax ignored the protesting beast standing in his stirrups and staring through the fire for a glimpse of eladamri and his rebels commander or not the kerl had had enough it lay down rubbed crovax off bounded to its feet and galloped away bleating he didnt have time to curse the stupid beast before flames washed over him he threw an arm over his face and waited for the searing pain it never came crovax felt the heat but it never crossed his threshold of pain pleased he jumped to his feet the fire had passed him still propelled by the hub wind in the flickering light hundreds of lightly armed elves darted in and out lofting their spears over the advancing fire roaring crovax charged into the nearest group slashing at them with his sword every elf evaded his blade melting back into the darkness beyond the firelight i am crovax crovax of urborg he bellowed come out eladamri and fight me face to face less than thirty yards away eladamri saw crovax striding about shouting and waving his sword the rebel leader simply watched crovax rave will you fight him gallan asked look at him eladamri said hes utterly mad hes the enemy commander why dont you kill him eladamri leaned on his spear shaft did you see what he did he fell from his animal wallowed in the fire and got up unhurt hes not flesh and bloodhes been altered like volrath hes not going to fall to a snakefang spear he laid his spear on his shoulder its time we put an end to this battle lord crovax will have to wait another day to die eladamri put a hand to his mouth and uttered a loud trilling cry it was echoed by the throats of a thousand elves along the battle line the sound halted crovaxs futile ranting and he turned his back on the elves walking swiftly back to his singed and shaken troops elves circled wide around the western flank of the burning camp there darsett waited with over four hundred dal in full battle gear beside him was tant jova and the main vec force three hundred strong most armed with rathi weapons scrounged from crovaxs fallen soldiers eladamri whacked darsett on the back and clasped hands with tant jova time to wash our spears in enemy blood he said the three rebel elements swept forward shouting screaming banging their weapons on their shields to the rathi infantry it seemed as if an entirely new enemy force sprang out of the darkness and hurled itself on them the flustered stronghold troops formed a hollow square and fended off waves of rebel attacks the dead and wounded piling up deeper each time a fresh attack broke over them moggs outside the infantry squares were slaughtered in great numbers gradually the exhausted rathi line was pushed backward changing from a square to a narrow triangle eladamri kept the pressure on all through the night while segments of his force were sent away to safety in the forest the hub wind died before daybreak and the fire went out the camp was a heap of cinders of the ten thousand soldiers who arrived on the edge of the skyshroud the night before two thousand were dead or dying and another three thousand were wounded only a few hundred moggs could be found crovax had lost over half his army in a single battle eladamri was not in a celebratory mood with far slenderer resources his loses numbered just over one hundred elves three dozen dal and nearly two hundred of tant jovas vec nomads killed no rich haul of captured weapons could be expected following the allconsuming fire he blamed himself and he blamed cardamel for ruining his trap another six hours and we couldve had them all he stormed at the postbattle council deep in the forest not just their lives but all their weapons and supplies too thats what your little adventure cost us cardamel the young elf who lost a hand in the fight said nothing tant jova tried to calm eladamri we have beaten them in open battle for the first time my brother she said their new commander crovax is disgraced theres no one to lead them now weve gained time as well as a victorytime we can parley into a bigger and better army the aged vec matriarch shuffled to the center of the tree house another thing perhaps most important of alli have this morning received a summons from the oracle envec she has tidings she says of the korvecdal the korvecdal was the fabled deliverer of vec prophecy a hero who would overthrow the stronghold and lead the peoples of rath to freedom when weatherlight came to rath there was talk that her captain gerrard capashen was the korvecdal no one thought so now as hed left in his flying ship and the stronghold was unbowed every eye in the room turned to eladamri eladamri sighed deeply hed won an expensive victory and his first thought was the preservation of his army holy prophets were not his concern well withdraw to korai he said rubbing the smoke from his eyes there we can take stock of our losses and maybe gain a glimpse of the future chapter victims the operation began at sunrise it was not going well it should have taken a few hours to cull hostages from the leading families of the dal the vec and the kor but as dorian ildal stood on a broken wall in the ruined city quarter studying his timepiece he saw the roundup was entering its eighth hour it would take longer still to get things recorded properly greven descended on the crater with two thousand soldiers and as many moggs he had a list of names drawn up by dorian and his fellow courtiers and he had to go house to house to find the people he wanted quotas called for no less than two thousand hostages from each group word quickly spread about the roundup and finding the listed hostages got harder and harder there were scuffles but no real fighting most of the hostages were quietly anxious or stubbornly sullen but few offered open resistance lines of captives sorted by family and race marched four abreast out of the city of traitors under the stronghold to the ruins beyond soldiers lined the way with arms ported if i put whips in the hands of my moggs the lines would move faster greven mused dorian was horrified you cant do that moggs whipping the evincars subjects theyll riottheyll rebel easy old man greven said this jobs about stopping a rebellion not starting one i was just thinking like a soldier thinking like a savage dorian thought so the chamberlain stood on a tumbleddown wall with a trio of scribes below him totting up the people as they trudged by each list was checked against grevens master list to make certain the exact number from each group was represented in an operation like this dorian stressed no one race should be seen as being favored by the authorities the resentment thus caused would undo the salutary lesson of taking hostages in the first place greven turned away from surveying the operation whats the count dorian slapped his secretaries on the shoulder in turn one thousand three hundred and fortyfour of the dal said the first one thousand two hundred and eightynine of the vec said the second eight hundred and seventyfive of the kor added the third why so few kor theyre more elusive dorian said ive had reports that kor from outside the stronghold have not been taken at all the fishers of life the chamberlain consulted a scroll yes thats the clan how did you know greven didnt answer instead he asked have the holding areas been prepared such as they are if we have to hold these people more than a few days theyll not stand for the conditions here theyll stand for what theyre told to stand for greven snapped he signaled his escort to form up he wanted to see the holding area himself at the far edge of the ruins near the city moat three large squares had been cleared by mogg laborers rough walls made from the debris of fallen houses were piled up to create crude stockades each stockade had a single entrance hostages were marched into the stockades according to their race some hours passed and the lines began to thin eventually dorian and his secretaries appeared with the soldiers whod been driving the lines forward the chamberlain looked happy greven turned his eyes to dorian whats the final count we made up the kor tally a whole band of them arrived at the last minute dorian said under his breath the quota is within persons of being prefect where are the kor there at the end of the line they turned themselves in what dorian shrugged they appeared on their own behind the escort detachment one of them spoke to me and asked to be added to the tally greven grasped dorians soft arm in a painful grip the kor you spoke towas his name furah the chamberlain grunted in pain dread lord youre hurting me what was the kor leaders name furah sounds right or furdahsome such uncouth name greven released dorian with a shove and waded through the ranks of guards in front of them were the last hostages in this case over a hundred kor in identical gray leather outfits though greven had lived his entire life on rath with both dal and kor as neighbors hed never seen an entire clan look so identical startled greven called out furah furah i want to speak to you in one motion a hundredplus kor turned and looked back at greven they were all furah the warrior shook his head did you see that greven asked a nearby soldier see what dread lord nothing never mind the night of the hub wind belbe made her first inspection of the flowstone factory she did this alone or rather with six moggs to carry the new machinery sent with her from phyrexia the court advisors she quickly dismissed as useless sycophants greven and dorian were busy rounding up thousands of hostages and ertai was nowhere to be found this last fact annoyed her in some illdefined way belbe found herself wanting ertais company and not having what she wanted made her feel thwarted she soon forgot about ertai greven hostages and everything else once she was deep in the flowstone works unlike those parts of the citadel adapted for habitation the factory was the most phyrexian part of the stronghold and in belbes short life phyrexia meant home the structure of the factory was purely organismicthe adamantine frames of the building were like bones and the cladding was applied like muscle and skin over the factorys skeleton the entire fortress cantilevered out from the side of the stronghold cone and was studded with flues exhaust ports and enormous conduits channeling liquid flowstone outside the crater over the years residue from the great works accreted outside like scar tissue blunting the lines of the severe architecture by the time belbe arrived the citadel was like a vast wasps nest growing organically and infested with thousands of poisonous inhabitants in the domed control center atop the factory belbe stood in rapt fascination of the great cauldron at the heart of the citadel here lava the raw material of flowstone met the energy beam sizzling down from the hub atoms disintegrated in the energy stream were whirled about at extreme velocities and reformed into programmable nanomachinesflowstone it was all so wonderful magnificent and efficient moggs lolled on the floor behind her taking a breather while belbe was lost in admiration of the factory she recovered her sense of purpose and ordered them to bring up the nanomachine conversion accelerator this was a globe eighteen inches in diameter whose outer skin was encrusted with extruded tubing wires and output jacks it was a selfaware device capable of accepting verbal orders and implementing them throughout the factory phyrexian technicians had designed the conversion accelerator to optimize production of flowstone as things stood the factory ran at one speed all the time actual output varied however according to the amount of energy from the hub the quality and amount of lava and the purity of the raw materials used the conversion accelerator would harmonize these elements so as to produce more flowstone when conditions warranted and expend less energy when conditions were unfavorable overall production efficiency was expected to increase by almost twentyseven percent the moggs maneuvered the heavy module into place belbe made the master power connections and the accelerator came to life implement final installation she commanded understood the device extended sharpedged feelers to the control console the tubes punched through the flowstone skin thin yellow oil wept from the incisions but they quickly healed connection complete said the accelerator input flow nominal output flow at percent reduce output to percent that is not maximum countered the machine this is a test of your verbal command structure reduce to percent the accelerator vibrated slightly on its new mountings lights all over the factory dimmed brightened then settled down the constant drone of the molecular whirlpool in the factory core declined half an octave output flow percent the accelerator announced belbe adjusted some of the external controls on the module one of them was the voice command recognition circuit who am i emissary from central control unit number stop you are correct do you acknowledge my authority command authority is authentic are there any default authorities she asked curious the evincar of rath any others no others very good seal command authority to my voice and the evincars the unit clicked loudly and said sealed one task done another major task remained the moggs had a second carton to deliver in her belt pouch she had the control unit for a transplanar portal the only portable device of its kind on rath the second carton in her baggage was a portal generator a special device that could open a portal to any plane in the multiverse the portal if opened would need space it also needed to be out of the way where to install it belbe ran through the complex floor plan of the citadel in her head there was a place she called the moggs installation of the accelerator had taken so long the moggs had fallen asleep leaning on the second carton she shouted at them and they twitched awake she took the catwalk that circled the mighty central crucible this close to the factory static from the tremendous energy input could be felt through the walls of the furnace the moggs didnt like it one bit and slunk along scratching their tingling skin on every available protrusion belbe found the prickling sensation stimulating not unlike her experience with volraths bath when she reached the place shed chosen she checked carefully to be sure she was not observed location of her portal equipment had to be secret there were people in the palace who would kill for a chance to leave rath and belbe had explicit orders from her masters not to allow anyone access to the portal an hour later the portal device was deposited in a seldomvisited part of the citadel belbe made a mental note to ask greven to execute the moggs who helped her install the machinery as a standard security precaution belbe had minimal need for sleep the glistening oil in her veins kept her active long after ordinary beings craved rest at daybreak she descended to the lower airship dock to see what progress was being made on predator she found the hull had been reassembled and new deck fittings were being installed all that remained after that was the tricky job of installing the engines and rigging she spotted grevens vec foreman and asked him where his master was i havent seen him since yesterday excellency said the vec he left with lord dorian and i havent seen either of them since thank you excellency when you find lord greven ask him please to come back as soon as he can we dont dare set the engines in place without him belbe promised to pass the word to greven on her way out of the ship dock a guard stopped her if youre looking for lord greven excellency youll find him in the ruins beyond the city of traitors she searched her implanted memory and found she didnt know this place where is that belbe asked the guard stepped to the edge of the docking platform and pointed to the floor of the crater see the lights down there excellency thats the city of traitors if you head that way he pointed to the far side of the crater in the direction of the mogg warrens theres a lot of fallendown buildings thats where youll find commander greven belbe leaned on the railing a warm updraft smelling of molten rock and ozone ruffled her hair and the tight sleeves of her teal gown whats greven doing down there havent you heard excellency thats where hes taken the hostagesthe hostages from the city of traitors belbe had a sudden urge to descend to the ruins and observe the operation for herself without the airship it was a long journey to the crater floor belbe dismissed the guard and stood by the rail gazing down at the hazeshrouded area pondering how best to get there your excellency the second word was enunciated with ironic precision there was ertai leaning casually on one of the inverted buttresses supporting the airship dock something was different it wasnt just his appearance though he had finally given up his tattered robes and donned rathi garbhigh collared doublet knee breeches and anklehigh fleshstone boots all in different shades of gray it was something else about him less tangible than a change of wardrobe ertais presence was different someone needs to speak to the tailors in this place he said they have no sense of color at all but i did want to be presentable since you called me i didnt call you you were thinking about me i came to find you i had work to do she said pretending not to care in the factory then im glad i missed it theres nothing as boring as machinery he came to the rail and looked down on the city awful place he remarked he glanced upward at the vast overhanging bulk of the citadel its like living in a well with a boulder balanced over your head i want to go down there she said pointing to the distant ruins ertai asked why she reminded him of his hostage idea greven and dorian are down there now gathering them ertais face darkened im sorry i suggested it i dont know how such an idea came into my head he shrugged of course its a very good idea from a certain point of viewlike all my ideas but no good will come of it i want to go there belbe repeated ertai took hold of her hand she made a mild attempt to free herself but he held on let me take you there excellency she stopped struggling you dont have to call me that dont i no very well belbe i can get you down there faster than an airship or any silly flowbot crane how he let go of her hand turned and walked about six feet away he sat down on the gritty floor folding his legs in front of him ertai pressed his palms together and closed his eyes visualization he said softly is the most important part of spellcasting belbe watched him closely ertai trembled his fingers went white from the pressure and most of the color drained from his face the collar of his new doublet wilted from perspiration something disturbed the air behind her belbe turned and saw a large vague shape with flapping wings hovering a few yards from the platform ertais expression grew more strained and the outline of the flapping object grew more distinct air itself seemed to be congealing to form the creature which gradually assumed the form of a great predatory bird what is it she asked impressed ertai did not answer he opened his eyes and stiffly unbent his legs his brow was etched with deep furrows as he fiercely maintained his concentration even with the distractions of open eyes and movement he extended a hand toward the phantom bird drew it back and closed his outstretched fingers into a fist the giant bird flew into the dock its wings and head passing through the solid structure of the platform without resistance yet when it reached ertai it extended a taloned claw and grasped him around the waist he repeated the clasping gesture and the spectral falcon took hold of belbes waist as well whats this she protested trying to open the birds talons though solidly in the creatures grip her efforts to repel the bird met no solid flesh at all it was most disturbing being lifted by visible yet untouchable claws stop it she said ill use the citadel egress itll only take a few hours to go down there before she could finish the sentence the spirit falcon rocketed away from the airship dock belbe to her consternation saw she was dangling beneath the translucent creation hundreds of feet in the air some primitive part of her was thrilled with terroran emotion she was learning on rathbut her good sense told her interrupting ertais mental focus would be disastrous for them both the falcon descended in a rapid spiral through the hot lavascented air they circled quite close to the upward flowing column of lava between the giant falcon claw clamped around belbes waist and the stifling heat of the lava it was hard to breathe fortunately the falcons next loop took them away from the lava flow well out over the city of traitors as they coursed through the thin clouds belbe started to enjoy the experience the sweep the feeling of speed and power flying conferred was intoxicating she looked down on the city below marveling at the gridwork of streets and houses it was some minutes before she realized the streets and squares were devoid of activity not a single vec or kor could be seen ertai started to choke loudly his face had gone ghastly white and blood was dripping from both nostrils he let out a wracking cough and to her horror belbe felt the falcons claws thin and slip they were two hundred feet above the city if she fell from this height not even her metal skeleton would save her and ertai would surely die they descended too rapidly as the falcons wings faded in and out of existence at fifty feet rooftops rushed by and chimneys became serious hazards ertai was hanging limply in the falcons evanescent grip blood staining the front of his new clothes thirty feet belbe looked up the body and wings of the falcon were almost gone just the faintest outline was left abruptly the magical creature vanished belbe lunged for ertai she caught him twisted in midair until her feet were down and braced for impact they hit the roof of an empty house broke through hit the floor of the second story and went through that as well when belbe hit the ground her legs jackknifed hard but the phyrexian alloys took the stress her augmented nerves signaled massive pain then shut down over and over they rolled in the dust and debris of the abandoned dwelling coming to a stop against an outside wall belbe rose from the rubbish her illused legs quivered from the strain already her implanted healing systems were kicking in repairing torn muscles and ligaments and liberally dosing her nervous system with pain suppressants she turned ertai over his color was already coming back and his nose had stopped bleeding belbe had taken the full force of the fall for him ow he said clasping his head what a headache what happened your magical bird failed my spell fail impossible his conviction strongly spoken made his head throb unmercifully it dropped us if i hadnt caught you youd be dead now the dim interior of the ruined house the drying blood on his face and neck and belbes unflinching manner must have convinced ertai that she was telling the truth the spirit falcon is a taxing spell to perform but ive never heard of it failing like this he said genuinely puzzled it began to fade after just a few minutes he scratched his rusty blond head there must be something interfering with the flow of magical energy perhaps its your healing treatment the native energies of rath must be very different from those of your home world belbe helped him stand good thing we fell on an empty house he said quietly for reasons she did not entirely understand belbe leaned forward and pressed her lips to ertais he was so startled by this unexpected action he failed to respond in kind belbe drew back expressionless did i do it incorrectly i dont know he said i wasnt prepared prepare yourself then she said it may happen again in awkward silence they made their way out of the ruined house the unpaved street was covered with sickly yellow moss and gray lichen and clogged with blocks fallen pediments bricks and shards of pottery belbe and ertai picked their way through the ruins to the next street this wide path was clear of debris and the thick dust had been stirred recently by a large crowd of people the hostages came this way belbe said must be hundreds of them thousands lord greven is not one for half measures they walked down the broad empty road ruddy light from the rising column of lava painted the ruins in shades of pink ertai looked at belbe may i ask you a question she put her arms behind her head and stretched her healing limbs of course do you ever ask yourself if youre on the right side or not she looked at her feet of the road no in this struggle no why not the right side is the side that succeeds she said simply this is the basic truth my masters taught me they could be wrong it is possible but not likely time will tell i used to think i knew right from wrong ertai said that was before i began my advanced studies in magic then i learned that power is power regardless of its origin any species can be used to kill or cure and if thats so how can any of it be good or evil it simply is i think people are like that too we simply are i will ask you a question she said he agreed do you regret coming here do you miss your comrades on weatherlight he stopped feet stirring little gouts of fine dust they left me here ertai said i was angry at them for that now in an odd way i think they did me a favor amid the ruins the sanguinary light of the lava column the still humid air at the bottom of the crater belbe had a strange new experience a more worldly woman could have told her she was feeling affection for the first time as it was she had to figure it out herself the hostages filled the stockades with resignation each family staked out a place in the dusty enclosures and waited for word they could go home again soldiers stood atop the low rubble walls eyeing their quiescent charges belbe and ertai arrived to find greven seated on a broken monolith dorian ildal was with him a picnic lunch spread out on a cloth between them when they saw belbe approaching both men rose and bowed greetings excellency you are looking well today why didnt you let us know you were coming i would have prepared a repast for you as well dorian said effusively its of no matter she replied i do not eat are the hostages here ertai asked impatiently six thousand of them confirmed greven five thousand nine hundred eightyeight to be exact said dorian he held up several loose scrolls i have the tallies here if your excellency would care to see she ignored the proffered scrolls and walked to the mouth of the dal stockade moggs grunted and sidled away from belbe guards on the wall snapped to attention dorian ertai and greven came up behind her what does your excellency require asked the chamberlain a better view first she looked left and right judged the far wall to be straighter and sprang from a flatfooted stance to the top of the sevenfoothigh structure belbe looked out over the dusty arena jammed with almost two thousand dal with designed thoroughness she catalogued the crowd one thousand five hundred and thirtythree adults four hundred and sixtyone children most of the adults were elderly or female she started counting crutches in the crowd and stopped when she passed one hundred and fifty distaste rose in her throat she turned to the trio of men waiting below her who chose these people she shouted why i did excellency with lord grevens help dorian replied why take these particular peoplewomen children the aged come down excellency id rather not have this conversation yelled from the stockade wall greven said his face hardening she did come down landing inches in front of the towering warrior explain your choices chamberlain dorians lip trembled thethe dread lord and i discussed it we agreed these would make the most effective hostages go on greven stepped up our goal is to keep peace inside the stronghold we chose people who have strong bonds with those not chosen dal men will think twice about rising against us if they know we have their mothers fathers wives and children in our power i think youve erred commander belbe said now were as much hostages as those people beyond the wall ertai spoke up what do you mean if any harm comes to these people it will foment rebellion rather than quell it she was angry and she didnt know how to handle the emotions stirred up by the plight of the hostages why didnt you round up young males instead theyre the potential allies of eladamri not these helpless folk in matters of civil unrest there are no innocent bystanders greven said be at ease excellency dorian pleaded no one wishes harm to these people when lord crovax returns triumphant all will be well and if crovax loses asked ertai the silence that followed was suffocating chapter rivals the skyshroud expeditionary force remained on the field for two days burning its dead and building temporary defenses out of turf rocks and the wreckage of the armys equipment everyone expected the rebels to attack and wipe them out but they didnt cavalry patrols were sent out to locate eladamris band but they returned in a few hours and reported finding no sign of the enemy the rebels didnt leave behind a single scrap every thrown spear every bent sword every broken helmet was scavenged from the field of battle nor were any rebel dead left behind the plain around the burned rathi camp had been trampled flat by men elves moggs and kerls but no other evidence of eladamris force remained crovax withdrew to his makeshift quartersa pile of scorched sod with a square of canvas for a roofand brooded over his defeat organization and defense of the rathi position fell to nasser aside from grunting approvals to nassers suggestions crovax did not speak for two whole days late in the afternoon on the second day after the battle he emerged from his hut nasser had been lingering outside waiting for his commander to appear my lord said nasser when crovax stood unblinking in the late day sun what are your orders any sign of the enemy asked crovax quietly none my lord break camp we will march crovax turned to go back inside very good my lord where to the stronghold the army had been waiting for just such an order and in less than an hour they were ready to march the cavalry fanned out to watch for rebels and the infantry column much reduced in length shouldered their weapons and started off the corps of sergeants waited patiently for crovax to join them the commanders kerl was tethered to the stump of a lance outside his quarters more than half the army was on the path back to the stronghold and there was no sign of crovax someone should rouse him tharvello said the other sergeants shook their heads no one wanted to incur his wrath nasser youre his favorite you do it said tharvello i can wait ha youre afraid of him too eyes narrowed to slits nasser dismounted his sootsmudged kerl and tossed the reins to the nearest mogg he squared his shoulders and walked to the door of the little sod hutjust a flap of tattered canvas waving slowly in the light breeze five feet from the hut nasser halted and called out my lord the army is underway will you take your place with us a muffled thud and a cloud of dirt whirled away from crovaxs hut shafts of blinding white light burst from every crack and crevice in the sod walls nasser threw an arm over his face and the hut collapsed with a spurt of gray dust and ash sergeants to me nasser cried a dozen seasoned warriors ran to the destroyed shack and tore through the poles and clods of earth looking for their commander when they found themselves scraping at virgin soil beneath the hut the sergeants realized crovax was gone everyone spoke at once what happened eladamri elven magic some new weapon eladamri nasser squatted in the remains of the hut toying in the debris with his fingers his careful contemplation of the situation gradually calmed his fellow sergeants at last someone said where did he go maybe back to where he came from tharvello said what do we do now the senior sergeant dusted the drab soil of rath from his hands i will take command they were more than happy to let him shoulder the burden tharvello said what are your orders nasser without a body i cant assume lord crovax is dead the commanders last order stands he decided we go home predator was airborne again thanks to grevens tireless efforts after the hostages were secured greven returned to the airship dock where he oversaw the replacement of predators powerful engines the hull was floated out the lower dock and carefully steered to the upper landing pylon there the final refit would take place and greven would take on new crew to replace those lost in the costly battle with weatherlight ertai disappeared into the libraries of the citadel beset by the conundrums of his place in the scheme of things days passed and belbe saw little of him when she finally did she was amazed by the changes slowly transforming him early one morning she found him perched on a table in one of the old scroll depositories surrounded by heaps of discarded documents it was stifling in the narrow room and ertai had stripped to the waist to better bear the heat never a muscular fellow formerly ertai now displayed a formidable breadth of shoulder as he sat hunched over a scroll that and the fact his hair had become copperbrown made belbe doubt she was seeing him at all hello she said uncertainly i see youre making use of the libraries these scrolls are all wrong ertai said pushing the heavy scroll aside their description of energy crossover whats happening to you ertai he looked at her from under heavylidded eyes what are you talking about youre changing your hair your physique its to be expected he said stretching his bare arms now covered with thin ropy muscles the energy infusions you started me on are doing it every time i go back to volraths laboratory i change a little more she drew back youre still using the infuser why imagine my chagrin when i discovered the effects of the device were only temporary when my injuries return i have to go back to the infuser for another treatment i shouldve known it wouldnt actually heal me if i hadnt been so hurt im sure i would have thought of it thought of what ertai leaned his cheek against his knee only natural lifeenergy can heal human flesh other varieties can mask damage by transforming it into something else in my case volraths device seems to be making me into a lesser version of our friend greven no it doesnt matter i cant stop now anyway if miss a day at the infuser the misery of the torture session comes back i cant bear it a little muscle wont hurt me and my mind is still my own maybe even better if thats possible im reading eight books a day did you know that ill be through this library soon then ill move on to the next be careful ertai he smiled in his own wry way ertai held up his hand palm out to the closest scrollladen shelf the flowstone rippled like a reefing sail he sustained the motion for several seconds before it faded your influence is improving she said pleased yes i may give crovax a surprise before long she wanted to speak to him about his growing power but ertai lowered his head to his reading again and quickly forgot belbe was present she backed out of the close little room her heart was beating fast and she didnt know why it took several minutes to slow it to a normal rhythm belbe continued her rounds of the citadel stopping by the factory control room to check on the accelerator unit shed installed the stubborn device kept trying to raise production to inefficient levels above percent which forced belbe to improvise a method to hamper the machines excessive enthusiasm for production she settled for tampering with the output meter resetting it by hand to fool the accelerator into thinking the factory was producing more flowstone than it actually was however there was a problem with her makeshift solution like every other mechanism in the factory the output meter was self correcting in the course of several days production it would discover its readings were inaccurate and correct itself thus belbe would have to return to the control dome every other day to reset the output meter to maintain maximum efficiency while she was adjusting the output meter for the first time she spotted a ball of white light about two feet wide circling and descending the energy column the ball darted first in one direction then another belbe lost it for a second against the glare of the beam then adjusted her vision to see past the columns corona high above the white ball of light hovered over the upper airship dock it dipped behind the pylon and was lost from sight curious she left the control station and made her way back to the residential wing of the citadel everything seemed normal servants and courtiers bowed as she passed guards stood at their stations unalarmed she reached the main intersection in the heart of the palace from here stairs and flowbot lifts branched out all over the structureup to the evincars quarters down to the laboratories libraries map room armories and prison belbe strained every nerve in her being searching for the fiery intruder the strongest trace which was very weak indeed came from a window in the outside wall from there she looked down on the mogg warrens map tower volraths laboratory and the roof of the dream halls the arched roof of the hall bore ghostly heat trails crisscrossing back and forth the phantom visitor was there for the first time in her short life belbe ran her legs were quite healed after her fall in the ruins a few days ago and she ran to the physical limits of her alloy frame flashing down the dark corridors of the palace she passed unsuspecting courtiers and soldiers in a blur within seconds belbe was at the doors of the dream halls her hands were just about on the handles when the tall double doors swung silently inward belbe rushed into the vast silent hall ah my young mistress crovax he was still in his dusty armor she could smell blood and smoke and saw bits of wire grass snagged in his boots was that you she said incredulous you saw me oh yes youre the emissary you see everything he seemed dizzy and shuffled his feet to keep his balance a bonus from our masters he said i can will myself from point to point teleportation is that what its called hard on the head if you ask me he called up a flowstone stool out of the floor and sat down what about the army why did you leave them my army he exploded worthless cowardly cattle i would have killed them all if i were eladamri you lost your entire army crovaxs face contorted i lost little of value how many survived where are they now he leaped to his feet who are you to question me i am the emissary of the overlords belbe said calmly i ask you again where is your army out there he flung a hand we fought a night battle the rebels started a fire upwind of our position and many of the soldiers were trapped by the flames and eladamri crovaxs voice was almost inaudible he escaped the distant dream machinery near the ceiling clicked and whirred for some seconds it was the only thing moving or making noise in the dream halls then belbe spoke you failed the cold hard edge returned to his voice this is only the first round there are many acts yet to play a new evincar must be named soon then name me who else can you choose greven hes been a slave too long to know how to rule there is another candidate the flowstone around belbe heaved like a sea swell she ignored it and when it was calm again she said i refer to ertai that boy do the overlords know youre considering that arrogant little cur the overlords know everything i do she said stiffly ertai has magical gifts far in excess of anyone else on rath his influence over flowstone grows daily can he command an army can he govern can he rule those are questions still unanswered about you crovax as for ertai hes intelligent clever and has many insights it was ertai for example who devised the stratagem of taking hostages from the local population to insure they wouldnt lend support to eladamris rebels crovax broke into an awful face splitting grin hostages what a delightful idea i give the pup credit he walked a slow circle around belbe close enough for her to feel his cold breath on her face how many hostages a thousand why she gave him the wrong figure she didnt know where are they the ruins outside of the city of traitors he stopped his perambulation directly behind her i see thank you excellency for what for restoring my faith in the wisdom of our masters he said cool fingertips brushed the back of her neck but hear me girl i will be evincar of rath are you threatening me crovax the fingers were withdrawn certainly not excellency i merely pledge to do my utmost for the cause you do your best for the overlords dont you i do the task i was made for he suddenly enfolded her from behind in his powerful arms one around her waist the other around her neck in a splitsecond decision belbe decided not to struggle but remained as relaxed as possible were allies after all he said softly in her ear cooperation can be as satisfying as competitionwith the right company im here to choose the best person for the job whoever that is belbe still didnt move no emotion involved crovax asked emotion is not efficient crovax tightened his grip you cant overpower me crovax i wouldnt dream of trying excellency he dropped his arms and belbe stepped away adrenaline coursed through her she felt like a coiled spring all wound up crovax appeared quite calm i want a full report on the battle in writing detailing your losses eladamris tactics and the state of the army belbe said inwardly shaking with excitement she kept thinking about what it would be like to break crovaxs arms and legs she knew just how to do it even through his armor as you wish when shall i present my report you will wait upon my pleasure belbe imagined his face exploding in a shower of blood and bone fragments his teeth falling like hailstones to the polished floor where are the survivors of your force a few days march from here will they make it back on their own with one kick she could crush his windpipe and he would slowly strangle to death he shrugged that has more to do with eladamri than my soldiers predator is flying again ill send greven to find your men and escort them home the ship has no weapons on board yet but the rebels wont know that with one blow she could drive the cartilage in his nose back into his brain he saluted your excellency is wise and frugal crovax departed and the dream halls doors closed silently behind him belbe leaped into the air kicking her feet and pounding the air furiously with her fists when this failed to satisfy her she ran to the wall and punched an elaborate basrelief depicting one of volraths dreams of glory the flowstone walls made to imitate marble splintered under belbes blows no sooner had the fragments fallen to the floor than they began climbing back up to rejoin the broken structure she pounded on the wall until her knuckles were scored and weeping glistening oil panting with excitement she stood back to catch her breath her violence triggered the dream device overhead with a hiss of servos and uncoiling wire three dream catchers dropped to belbes eye level in each was a dirty white pearl representing some dream experience the device thought appropriate to belbes current state of mind she stared at the trio of machines and with a howl of pure fury seized one in each hand and ripped them loose the third dream catcher hastily retracted belbe enjoyed crushing volraths dreams under her heel the army reached chireef the last outpost before the stronghold three days after the battle a march that had taken crovax a day and a half nasser was content to do in twice the time his men were tired many were wounded and no one was in a hurry to return home from a defeat riders came back with the news that the blockhouse at chireef seemed abandoned the doors were closed and barred and none of the garrison responded to the scouts hails alarmed nasser and the corps of sergeants rode ahead of the main body with all the remaining cavalry to investigate what happened at chireef the blockhouse looked deserted arrow slits were vacant no sentries walked the roof some unknown banner hung limply from the flagpolethe air was too still to stir it despite repeated calls no one inside the blockhouse responded the door was a massive bronze affair and the rathi soldiers were not equipped to batter it down a team of four men was ordered to scale the blockhouse walls with ropes and grappling hooks the outside of the blockhouse was as smooth as glass to prevent just such attempts at climbing by the enemy so it took some time before the soldiers were able to reach the roof three men were detailed to enter the blockhouse and open the outer door while the fourth hauled down the mysterious flag and tossed it to nasser it was a triangle of rough green cloth with a simplified image of a red snakes head fangs bared in the center with a loud clank the doors of chireef rolled back the cavalrymen whod entered the blockhouse emerged looking puzzled no one was inside alive or dead the place had been stripped cleannot even garbage was left what about the cisterns nasser asked the army was thirsty empty the scouts reported someone had broken off the flowstone valves allowing all the water to drain from the storage tanks this was plainly the work of eladamri and his rebels but the mysterious state of the blockhouse was unsettling why were there no signs of a fight where were the dead or the wounded they couldnt even find any bloodstains how could a band of rebels armed only with hand weapons capture a welldefended blockhouse the army had visited only a few days earlier a smudge of dust on the horizon warned nasser the foot column was on its way tharvello and some of the sergeants wanted to keep the troops away from chireef hide the strange fate of the garrison from the rank and file nasser would not allow it let everyone know he said grimly this is what they can expect at rebel hands let them contemplate chireef and fight harder to avoid their comrades fate each company marched past the empty blockhouse smashed valves and puddles at the foot of the wall made it clear there was no water for them word filtered through the ranks about the disappearance of the entire garrison and a chill enveloped the already dispirited army nasser ordered the march to continue until dusk though they were within a nights march of the stronghold the senior sergeant didnt want his dejected troops to arrive home in the middle of the night he decided to camp one more night and march into the city by the full light of day nasser sent a percher ahead with this news not knowing where crovax was he addressed his message to greven ilvec he halted the army astride the main road from the stronghold to chireef the tired men filed out of formation and dropped their packs in the dirt details were sent to gather tinder for campfires and the communal pots were unpacked for dinner these mundane tasks occupied the army in the last hour of daylight nasser and his comrades were about to sit down when sentries reported an unknown light in the sky nasser overturned his bowl in his haste to stand he didnt have to go far before he spied what the sentries had seen a bright golden light low in the air and moving with considerable speed it was approaching from the southwest directly away from the stronghold airship suggested tharvello an enemy airship i dont know alert the troops if were going to be attacked the men must disperse trumpets and perchers blared and the soldiers gave up their meager meals to stand to arms the aerial beacon was easily visible to all now as it maneuvered below the sluggish clouds anxious murmurs passed through the ranks the hum of aerial engines reached the soldiers the first dim outline of the ship behind the light could just be made out its a big one tharvello said shut up nasser replied the gilded searchlight raked the grassy plain right left ahead and back some cavalry were caught in the beam and the kerls pranced nervously when the light hit their weak eyes nasser raised his hand to alert the troops at his signal they would scatter to avoid the airborne attack no missiles or bombs erupted from the airship instead it slowed and began to descend the searchlight swung down highlighting the patch of ground where the ship would alight in the reverse glow nasser recognized the long prow the jutting boarding mandible its predator the rathi troops let out a concerted shout of relief and hundreds rushed forward to greet the landing vessel predator dropped to within a few feet of the ground and hovered lamps blazed fore and aft and against the light nasser could see crew members scurrying about on deck a rope ladder unrolled to the ground but the first man off the ship didnt use it greven ilvec jumped from the deck landing lightly he stooped to clear the overhanging bulk of the airship standing erect once he saw the corps of sergeants drawn up to greet him dread lord nasser said over the throb of the hovering ships engines its good to see you is this all that remains of the force greven said sternly surveying the men clustered around predator taken aback nasser recovered his professional demeanor and replied it is dread lord wheres crovax nasser looked greven in the eye hes not here sir we havent seen him since this morning what greven thundered every man present veteran or recruit flinched where is your commanding officer nasser explained how crovax vanished when the strange explosion demolished his hut he expected a further display of temper but instead the giant warrior seemed pleased to hear of crovaxs unexpected departure gone is he his chance to be evincar is gone too greven noticed the press of soldiers around him and snarled do you men have nothing better to do than stand here gawking like a bunch of hungry moggs the relieved soldiers returned to their campfires greven ordered predator aloft to watch for trouble while he remained on the ground he wanted to hear a full account of the battle with the rebels then he announced he would personally lead the remnants of the skyshroud expedition into the stronghold greven got the whole story from nasser and the sergeants they blamed the wind and fire for their debacle and confirmed that eladamri had vec and dal allies in the fight greven listened to every word his inhumanly hard features were a mask to the assembled sergeants as greven sat there thinking yet saying nothing one by one the sergeants slipped away to catch a bit of sleep nasser was the last to go if theres nothing else dread lord ill say good night greven gazed at the dying campfire nasser saluted curtly and disappeared into the outer darkness he hadnt gone ten yards before tharvello grabbed him from behind what is it said nasser you heard greven back there this means the end of crovax doesnt it such decisions occur far above my head come now you and i took up crovaxs mantle gladly thinking it would advance us in the army and get us out from under that bastard grevens thumb well crovax botched it we should make amends to greven you talk like a softhanded courtier nasser said ill not sell my loyalty at the first sign of adversity tharvello grinned so youre staying with crovax i serve rath not any one man if you think crovax is finished youre badly mistaken defeat or no defeat hell be back stronger than ever mark what i say nasser left him tharvello opened his hauberk and pulled out the percher hed hidden underneath perchers remembered the last words spoken in their presence your words are marked tharvello thought stroking the winged creature chapter banquet ertai strolled down a vacant corridor a long scroll in one hand a hunk of soft bread in the other the end of the scroll dragged on the floor as he went munching his snack he stepped out into the main corridor just as dorian ildal came barreling along they went down in a tangle the scroll entwining around them both as they struggled to free themselves be still will you ertai said youll tear the scroll help ive no time for this foolishness ugh where is the emissary young man ertai slid out of the tangle i havent seen her i must find her she must be told about this terrible thing what terrible thing dorian tried to shuck the coils of parchment and untangle his legs from ertais the hostages the hostages have disappeared ertai shoved dorian backward the chamberlains head thumped on the floor and when it did the flowstone gripped his balding head and held it there eyes wide with shock dorian babbled you control the stone in small ways ertai replied rising and dusting himself off now whats got you in such a panic six thousand people dont just disappear greven must have moved them greven flew out in predator this morningand not a single hostage remains in the holding area his words speared ertai through the heart with his concentration rattled his control of the flowstone evaporated freed dorian sat up and clutched ertais leg i received a report from the commissary officer not two hours ago he went to the stockades to distribute food and water and discovered everyone was gone what about the guards gone too dorian began to weep there were large numbers of footprints leading out of the city into the caverns but theres no way out of the crater there did you send anyone out to search dorian nodded wiping his nose on his sleeve of course i did some came back saying the tracks lead right up the crater wallbut theres no tunnel or cave at the spot just a blind wall four men were lost during the search i fear the death pits whats that dorian squirmed with reluctance a fable mostly the residue of the flowstone creation process is pumped into remote caverns and crevices it looks like tar but its very poisonous the credulous believe the death pits are sentient its just a myth you said you feared it ertai objected it is poisonous dorian began to tear up again if a single hostage dies it will be very bad for us come said ertai hoisting the rotund chamberlain to his feet well find belbe ive looked and looked no one knows where she is ertai closed his eyes and held his hands six inches apart right in front of his chest magical energy crackled between his palms quickly solidifying into a spinning starshaped object whats that asked dorian drying his eyes a ferret ertai imparted a single mental command to his magical creation find belbe the star spun away he grabbed the front of dorians robe and said this way dont lose sight of it they followed the flying ferret through dark halls and light and before long it became obvious where it was going shes in the great hall ertai said where she arrived one of the huge doors was ajar the spinning star hovered outside unable to pass the powerful wards placed around the dream halls ertai dispelled the ferret with a wave of his hand with dorian in tow they entered the vast hall ertais foot crunched something the floor was littered with shiny gray shards it wasnt flowstone but some kind of crystal as far as the eye could see the concourse was peppered with the stuff several yards away there was a crash followed by the tinkle of broken bits ertai raced ahead and found fragments of a newly smashed globe still spinning on the mirrorblack floor belbe he heard a low voice muttering and another gray globe came crashing down a few feet away ertai looked up and saw a figure moving in the dim heights overhead belbe he called more loudly go away im busy he frowned what had gotten into her its about the hostages theyre missing she was silent for a moment then said come up he cast about for a ladder stairs any way up how youre the magician angrily he went to one of the monumental pilasters that supported the glass roof he placed his hands against the hard flowstone surface and scooped handholds formed for him he climbed steadily noting the handholds smoothed out after he passed them the ceiling was very high and it took him several minutes of climbing before he reached a sort of mezzanine made of a black metal lattice invisible from below here were stored all the strange devices volrath used to explore and preserve his dreams belbe had been going along the platform prying out all the dream storage globes and hurling them to the floor she sat astride the mesh ledge her feet dangling in the open air ertai cautiously slipped onto the platform and tried not to look down what are you doing he demanded its called cleaning house she said ive been getting tid of volraths collection of terrors and pleasures she held up a broken shell in his case there wasnt much difference belbe the dal vec and kor hostages are missing she tossed the shell into the void did they escape i dont know dorian says even the guards have vanished ah i wonder you know something he leaned over and grabbed her hand belbe whats going on the safety of thousands is at stake she looked away its probably crovaxs doing crovax is he here crovax has returned and his powers have greatly increased he could open a tunnel through the crater wall with a wave of his hand by all the colorsif he hurts those people every member of their families will join eladamris rebellion crovax she gripped the mesh platform on either side each finger in a different perforation when she said crovaxs name she closed her hand tearing the enormously strong metal lattice like rotten cloth lets get down from here she announced i can make handholds if you want to go down with me too slow she grabbed an empty dream catcher and hugged it close come here ertai he crept to her she scooped him in with her free arm hold on what are you before he could finish his question belbe slid off the platform they plunged down ertai yelling all the way halfway to the floor the dream catchers wire spool tightened slowing them it adjusted for their extra weight and lowered them gently to the concourse his feet on solid ground again ertai said you could have warned me candidates for evincar should be bold she said she opened her arms releasing ertai and the dream catcher the empty mechanism whirred and with a snap flew back to the rafters with dorian in tow belbe and ertai rushed out of the hall she detoured through the garrison to turn out the palace guard seal the citadel she ordered the guards no one was to get in or out without her approval then she ertai and dorian piled into one of volraths fleshstone walking machines even with extreme haste it would still take a couple of hours to circumnavigate the crater to the point outside the stronghold where the hostages tracks had led deep within the skyshroud forest lay the eye of korai a flattopped mound created over the course of several centuries by the elves of the forest baskets of dirt and stone were brought from outside the skyshroud and deposited in a spot located within the densest part of the swamp over the years an artificial island was created rising some twentytwo feet above the stagnant black waters the flat top covered an acre and a half and was paved with thousands of carefully fitted stones brought in by hand by generations of elves the mound was called the eye of korai after the great elf chieftain who began it early in the rebellion greven ilvec found the eye from the air and the site was badly damaged by bombs the eye was repaired and a giant camouflage net was fabricated to cover the mound woven of living vines the net blended in with the natural tree canopy hiding the elves sacred assembly site it was at the eye of korai that the elf tribes gathered to celebrate their most solemn ceremonies to honor their dead who were buried in tomb chambers deep in the mound and to consult each other on important issues it was only natural the eye was chosen as the place eladamri and his allies were to meet the most revered holy figure on rath the oracle envec no one knew her real name she was incredibly old far older than matriarch tant jova or any of her sisters it was rumored the oracle dwelt on other planes and could see not only the future of this world but the future of other worlds as well no one saw her arrive eladamri and his people went to bed one night after their arrival and awoke the next day to find a strange pavilion had appeared in the exact center of the eye the pavilion resembled a vec nomads tentconical roof sloping wallsbut was larger and changed color constantly as light and shadow played over it there was no obvious entrance eladamri was amused when darsett walked around and around the pavilion looking for a door and finding none its a blasted trick darsett growled of course eladamri said what better way to preserve your privacy than to live in a house without a door tant jova and her young female bodyguards joined the dal and elf she leaned on the arm of one of her proud granddaughters the warrior liin sivi lady how do we speak to this oracle of yours darsett finally asked tant jova answered you cant o darsett when the oracle has something to say she will call you they lingered by the mysterious pavilion for some time halfhoping to be summoned into the presence of the famed oracle when minutes turned into hours darsett grew irritated and left eladamri likewise had pressing matters to attend to and took his leave only tant jova remained sivi found a folding stool for her grandmother to sit on and stayed with her after his defeat of crovax eladamri sent runners to every district bearing the news as he hoped new recruits trickled in wanting to fight the disarrayed government forces he established a number of recruiting camps on the fringes of the forest there trusted lieutenants weeded out the treacherous and the lazy from the stream of volunteers those who showed commitment and staying power would be taken deeper into the skyshroud and begin training for war daylight was failing when eladamri and darsett were alerted by tant jova that a door to the oracles tent had appeared the three allied leaders stood side by side outside the pavilion gazing at the fluttering canvas opening the oracles tent was haloed by a faint greenish glow this troubled the vec matriarch its a bad sign said tant jova how so asked darsett to my people green is a color of illomen among mine its a good sign eladamri said cheerfully green is the color of our ancient trees perhaps she wears this aura to honor me tant jova did not look convinced i suppose we should go in darsett murmured eladamri nodded and took the lead darsett followed and a worried looking tant jova brought up the rear entering the tent was like walking into a fogbank every visible feature including the entrance disappeared once they were inside the faintly greenish mist smelled strongly of incense and rare spices the odors were strong enough to make eladamris head swim he kept going straight aheadat least he assumed he wasfor several yards which didnt make sense the pavilion was no more than fifteen feet across as seen from the outside was he walking in some kind of dazed circle seeker come you are welcome said a sourceless voice where are you said eladamri here all around you he fumed a little why were these mystical types always so obscure i want to speak to you face to face he called out no sooner had he said so than a dark outline appeared in the mist eladamri approached cautiously the silhouette resolved into a seated vec woman dressed in nomadic robes densely patterned with green and brown embroidered swirls she sat at a tall bowlshaped table filled with a silver liquid her face was averted her arms gripped the bowl on either side are you the oracle envec asked eladamri id hoped your first question would be more intelligent startled by her impudence the elf leader replied what is this did you admit me to snipe at my wits peace o eladamri take no offense at my free tongue when past present and future exist in your mind at the same time its difficult to spare enough thought for manners she raised her head eladamri had heard the oracle was an aged crone but the face he saw was as fresh as an open lily he took her to be no more than fifteen years old im much older than that said the oracle what you see is an illusion i will you to see you read minds when theyre simple enough i peer behind the thinkers eyes and read his words before they form on his lips more insults why am i here o oracle she blew on the surface of the bowl and the silver liquid rippled to the edge and back your cause is just o eladamri and your triumphs genuine but final victory is beyond your grasp all things are possible with the gods help he said are you telling me the rebellion is doomed it will never succeed on rath he didnt want to believe it for all his invocation of the gods eladamri was a realist believing first and foremost in eladamri it rankled him for this ancient oracle this freak to tell him flatly his cause was hopeless not hopeless she said you will defeat your enemies one day elf lord and be hailed as the savior of a world not your own enough vagaries he said tell me something useful what is crovax doing at this moment she pursed her brown lips and blew again over the silver pool though eladamri could see nothing in it the oracle peered closely at the bowl she shuddered violently and struck the fluid mirror with the palm of her hand oh oh was all the oracle could say what is it horrible i cannot what blood and more blood he feasts on their lives abomination eladamri leaned forward resting his hand on the edge of the bowl he thrust his face close to the oracles and for a instant caught a glimpse of her true visagedeeply wrinkled skin the color of mud sunken eyes a nose little more than two holes in her face he blinked and the impression was gone the dewy eyed girl was back speak plainly he urged i must know crovaxs doings i cannot speak it she whispered he turned away in disgust this is useless can you tell me nothing of value two things o eladamri your destiny lies in the stronghold not in the forest or on the plain a door will be offered to you and you must enter to do otherwise is to doom all you cherish the stronghold should i attack there before a new evincar is chosen is that what youre telling me the oracle sagged in her chair covering her face with her hands no no attack on the stronghold will succeed it will fall to the quietest of all no man no elf you must go there in chains o eladamri go in chains go in chains the dead one will open a door for you and you must go i dont understand will i be captured is that what you mean the mist thickened between them he tried to reach through it and take hold of the oracle but it was like seizing a shadow where will this door take me he cried her reply was a fast fading whisper to a land of light and color go there go there and be the korvecdal the mist disappeared and eladamri found himself standing in the open atop the eye of korai the oracles tent was gone darsett and tant jova were a few feet away their eyes closed eladamri shook off the aftereffects of the oracles intense illusions and called to his friends both awoke at the same time shes gone said darsett was she ever here eladamri asked even though he knew the answer i heard everything tant jova said her prophecies and her proclaiming you the korvecdal i heard it too but i couldnt see or speak darsett said puzzled yes yes tant jova said the word must be shouted in every village and every tenteladamri is the promised one eladamri is the korvecdal rebels on the mound gathered quickly when they heard the vec matriarch shout they took up the refrain the promised one the korvecdal and shouted it as loudly as they could over and over liin sivi and gallan raised eladamri on their shoulders despite his misgivings about the oracles murky predictions eladamri was vastly relieved all his life he had dreamt of this moment so much had been sacrificed not least by himhis wife his only child a safe and normal lifeall lost to the dark forces of the stronghold now the final fight could begin he would be the korvecdal no matter what gloomy and ambiguous prophecies the oracle envec made they carried eladamri around the perimeter of the eye shouting and singing war songs they were about to start a second circuit when four weary bleeding elves appeared at the edge of the mound the triumphant parade abruptly ceased and eladamri was set back on his feet he greeted the harried new arrivals i know you brother he said to the eldest elf in the group youre raydon of mossbridge village i am health to you brother raydon had a number of sizable sword cuts on his arms and visible blade marks on his breastplate my nephews and i are all thats left of a band forty strong we were on our way here to join you eladamri when we were attacked by the evincars flying ship alarm ricocheted through the crowd what said darsett predator flies again it does or its twin said the weary raydon we took a shortcut across the plain from mossbridge and the devils fell upon us without warning you have hand weapon injuries eladamri said how did that happen it was their method brother said the elf they did not rain fire and arrows on us as in the past the flying ship alighted and a hundred soldiers came out greven iivec led them mention of the rathi warlord provoked fresh outcries for vengeance eladamri quieted his friends and allies this changes much he said i had hoped to forge an army to meet the strongholds soldiers in open combat but we dare not expose ourselves to destruction from the air what can we do asked gallan eladamri pondered for a moment we must go on he said well go back to the old waysambush hit the enemy and run well steal their weapons and bide our time as our strength grows we cant win by ambushing outposts said darsett its that flying ship tant jova said striking the ground with her staff without it the stronghold would collapse like a rotten cask the allies fell to arguing strategy voices rose as they disagreed on how to fight under the threat of aerial attack gallan turned to eladamri what is our best course of action brother destroy the flying ship you make it sound easy darsett said sourly it wont be easy eladamri answered but it must be done but how predator roosts inside the stronghold gallan objected yes darsett snorted are you proposing we storm the stronghold just to destroy the flying ship not storm darsett just pay a little visit a few friends and i tant jova looked stunned youre not going to raid the stronghold o eladamri no he said im going to give myself up it would have been faster to seek crovax by air but greven had taken predator to find the skyshroud expeditionary force so they were forced to rely on one of volraths old twolegged walkers the headless turkey as ertai called it lumbered across the undulating landscape below the crater the walker made slow progress over this uneven terrain opposite the strongholds main causeway the plain was level and covered with kneehigh yellow grass as the turkey climbed out of a shallow gully belbes acute eyes spotted a smudge on the horizona crowd of people faster she said volraths old machine covered the flat ground at an admirable clip each sweep of the metaltoed feet tearing up a dusty divot ertai was at the controls which consisted of two levers one each for the right and left leg he had them shoved forward as far as they would go maximum speed belbe stood at the front of the car hand to her brow scanning ahead for obstacles bouncing in the back was dorian gripping the sides of the walker with whiteknuckled hands when they were still a mile away from the evident crowd belbe stiffened and signaled for ertai to slow down he hauled back on the levers bringing the turkey from a gallop to a lazy lope what do you see asked dorian people she replied puzzled they seem to be floating above the ground a faroff shriek reached out to them a thin wail of pure terror and utmost anguish ertai dropped his hands and the walker stopped hes not he is belbe vaulted over the side it was eight feet to the ground but she landed lightly on her toes and took off running ertai shoved the controls forward sending the walker pounding after the fleet emissary belbe covered the last eight hundred yards in seconds what she thought were people floating was not that at all ahead the plain was thickly studded with sharp poles formed from the flowstone substrate under the thin layer of topsoil impaled on the poles were the hostagesthousands of them belbe stopped frozen in her tracks by the scene before her crovax had commanded the spikes to thrust out of the ground impaling the victims where they stood some died immediately others took time to find death and a few still clung to life their moans were like a swirling wind coming from every direction at once she didnt hear the walker thump to a halt behind her it squatted and ertai got out dorian couldnt he buried his face in his hands and sobbed next thing belbe knew ertais hand was on her shoulder she shrugged it off how could he do this ertai whispered his power over flowstone is developing exponentially belbe said hes learned to fix the forms into permanent shapes impressive impressive how can you say this savage is impressive ertai took a step back a horrified look on his face slowly belbe walked into the forest of death most of the poles were eight to ten feet high tall enough that the victims feet couldnt reach the ground the gray metal spikes were black with gore and the air was heavy with the smell of blood ertai tried to follow belbe but within a few yards he broke down nauseated dazed belbe wound her way through the maze of spikes since theyd sprung up wherever a person had been standing there was no order no pattern to their placement where a family huddled together for safety a spike for each of them had erupted standing alone was no safer many victims looked as though they were caught in midstride age and gender made no differenceall had fallen to crovaxs insatiable vengeance a scream came from close by numbly belbe turned toward the sound she saw a band of moggs manhandling a dal man without thinking she hurled herself at them lashing out at the loathsome gremlins with her fists and feet bewildered the moggs let their prey go and fled whooping belbe tried to help the man stand but he was crazed with fear and kept trying to crawl away on all fours its all right its all right belbe said over and over the man mired in gore looked up at her and started to speak his words were cut short by a spike bursting from the ground beneath him it thrust up so powerfully that the man was carried four feet in the air before belbe could even react she grasped the still growing post and tried to break it but even her considerable strength could not affect a metal pole eight feet tall and now almost seven inches thick blood cascaded down the pole over belbes hands trembling she backed away and screamed ertai heard her cry sick and shaken he ran to her calling her name he dodged around a cluster of thick spikes and they fell into each others arms belbe was bathed in gore up to her elbows and a thick spray of blood had at some point struck her in the face belbe belbe he shouted shaking her by the shoulders he raised a hand to strike her but with her lightning reflexes she caught his hand long before it could connect hit me and ill kill you she cried to emphasize her point she squeezed his hand ertai bent his legs to relieve the pressure on his hand and belbe forced him to his knees dont hurt me he said havent enough people been hurt today suddenly shamed she released him crovax i must find crovax blood and dust made a dense brown mud that clung to ertais knees ill go with you they wandered through what seemed like an endless field of carnage ertai kept his eyes on the ground but belbe gazed wideeyed at every horror the sights and smells of death assaulted her at every turn and the relentlessly analytical mind given to her by her phyrexian masters made her catalog each victim as she passed male dal estimated age impaled through the chest male vec estimated age impaled through thigh abdomen armpit female vec estimated age impaled through foot thigh and head female dal estimated age impaled through abdomen female dal impaled male vec female kor female female male ertai was clutching her hand she ceased her macabre catalog and said do you still want the job how can i defeat a man who does things like this he said how can you allow a monster like him to rule this entire world i must choose the best candidate for evincar belbe said faintly i exist to make this choice belbe heard voices ahead ertai dropped her hand and went on belbe followed methodically counting the dead at the epicenter of the death field was a clear space twenty yards wide in the midst of the clearing sat crovax at a long rectangular table covered in a spotless white tablecloth his back was to them assorted moggs armed with axes and clubs stood idle around the edge of the clearing others in weirdly comic liveryfancy velvet uniforms and wigsbore silver trenchers laden with food to the table welcome excellency crovax said keeping his back turned is my rival young ertai with you bastard ertai spat starting forward belbe restrained him are we having lunch she said some coolness had returned to her voice the sight of crovax gave needed focus to her outraged senses a light repast its been a busy morning please join me ertais face purpled but belbe cautioned him with a glance i do not eat but thank you she said she motioned ertai to follow her they circled the end of the table crovax had raised from the ground two highbacked chairs bubbled up and solidified across from crovax belbe slid gracefully into one chair ertai fell heavily into the other it was an extraordinary scene crovax had discarded his customary black garb and was clad instead all in whitebloodless sterile white without a speck of gore or dirt on him a white mantle edged in gold draped across his shoulders and on his head he wore a plain circlet wrought in gold and white enamel hed cut off his long pigtail at neck length and let his hair hang loosely had he not been backed by a panorama of violent death crovax would have been the epitome of a peaceful civilized monarch wine he said a mogg in an illfitting white cravat hopped to belbes elbow and held out a silver urn its one of volraths vintages he drank it for pleasure im told belbe said nothing so the mogg filled the heavy crystal goblet by her plate the wine was brilliantly scarlet and smelled faintly of flowers give some to the boy too i assume he can drink crovax said the mogg waddled to ertai why have you done this belbe said why slaughter these innocent people you surprise me excellency didnt the overlords teach you that the most valuable tool of rulership is fear this small exercise will insure the loyaltyor at least the complianceof the civil population during the coming campaign against eladamri small exercise ertai shouted his goblet overturned spilling bright red wine over the snowy tablecloth before it lapped the undersides of the heavy silver dishes the scarlet liquid vanished as did ertais cup no more wine for you crovax said five thousand eight hundred sixtyeight killed hardly qualifies as a small exercise belbe said its more than a thousand he said tweaking her for her lie but they were expendable dorian chose only the old and the weak youre a monster ertai said flatly crovax sawed off a bit of rare cutlet and forked it into his mouth this from the boy who would be evincar im told the hostage idea was yours no one was supposed to get hurt youre sentimental ertai crovax said theres no room for sentiment on rath what you call sentiment i call prudence belbe said she could see her reflection in the empty silver plate before her the wild bloodsmeared face could hardly be hers your actions are precipitate crovax theres no evidence the people of the stronghold intended to rise in rebellion against us it is you whove given them common cause with eladamri by murdering their families with all respect excellency you dont know what youre talking about i was with the army when we were ambushed by the rebels there were dal and vec warriors with the skyshroud elves so you avenge your defeat on helpless old people and children said ertai yes he sipped wine as evincar i will brook no resistance to my rule the only law of the realm shall beobey or die youre not evincar yet belbe said crovax slammed down his goblet snapping the stem then declare me so now there are other factors to consider what him crovax whipped a knife off the table and thrust it at ertai i can kill him without leaving my chair weve seen what youve learned to do belbe replied your mastery of the flowstone increases daily but you lost a battle and a sizable part of your army with it you show little understanding of how people should be governed relying on naked force instead of statesmanship in short crovax your methods are inefficient and as far as im concerned the issue of who will succeed volrath is still unresolved he sat back you constantly amaze me excellency of course youre right well see in the coming days who the best man is wont we chapter ghost beneath the main causeway leading into the stronghold the remnants of the skyshroud expeditionary force marshaled awaiting the orders of greven ilvec predator droned overhead searching the wide plains for the enemy the airship had attacked several bands of rebels the previous day landing troops beside and sometimes among the startled foe these small actions had done much to restore the armys morale and crovax or no crovax they were marching into the stronghold as an army not a defeated rabble a percher landed on grevens shoulder urgent from predator urgent from predator it squawked he hated the raucous leathery creatures what now unknown intruder unknown intruder greven grasped the irritating creature by the neck the perchers heart fluttered wildly land in the hollow below threetoe hill he said to the messenger i will meet you there he flung the percher into the air it circled once then flapped away to find the airship greven hollered orders at nasser take the men to their barracks send the wounded to the healers then confine everyone to quarters until i return trouble asked nasser he had no idea but answered no threetoe hill was a fortyfoot high promontory half a mile east of the causeway there was a wide but shallow hollow below the hill where the airship could land and not be seen while on the ground by the time greven walked there as no kerl existed big enough to carry him predator was waiting the airships boatswain narmer by name was on the ground waiting for greven he ran up the slope when the commanders huge silhouette appeared on the hilltop dread lord whats this about an intruder cant you handle a lone man on foot said greven theres more to it than that dread lord narmer looked quite disturbed he wrung his hands and scuffed his feet continuously in the dry turf i thought this should be brought to your attention immediately all right greven unlocked his jaw lets find this intruder of yours narmer put a hand to the warriors massive chest greven was frankly surprised the boatswain dared touch him theres no need dread lord what why not we picked him up narmer said he pointed to predator hovering a few feet off the ground a figure appeared at the rail deeply clothed in the shadow of the hill behind them he wishes to speak to you greven went slowly to the dangling rope ladder for one of the few times in his life he actually experienced a feeling of dread the shadowed figure leaned on the rail as grevens eyes accustomed to the shade he saw the intruders face eladamri youre insane darsett endal and the inner circle of the rebellion were seated in the great room of eladamris home their host sat on the floor by the door casually whittling a block of wood the garnet on the pommel of his carving knife gleamed in the cool light of four foxfire lamps i mean that with all due respect darsett added when no one seconded his opinion what i mean is this scheme of yours seems far more desperate than circumstances require ive been hunted by the airship for years eladamri replied he scored a hole in the end of the stick and blew away loose wood chips my wife died in an airship attack theres no way the rebellion can proceed with that machine flying over us spying on everything we do and raining death on us from above granted o eladamri but why must you go on this raid how do you know greven ilvec wont have you killed on the spot said tant jova i know him said the elf if he thinks he can lay hands on me killing me is the last thing hell want to do greven will want to know all the details of the rebellion including the names of my allies he smiled at his dal and vec friends in either case hell want me alive for a time thats all i need in the past few weeks eladamri had aged noticeably the hard determined elf hed always been had given way to a contemplative almost wistful one hed not worn a helmet since meeting the oracle envec going bare headed with his long hair tied back in a rough ponytail deep lines etched his face and his eyes betrayed a weariness never present before i wish youd let some of us go with you gallan said that would only increase the danger eladamri replied there are no elves in the evincars army and my escort must pass close inspection as rathi soldiers there are no women in volraths army either gallan protested yet liin sivi is going with you sivi is the best fighter in my clan tant jova protested shes an adept of the totenvec this was the unique whipknife combination weapon used only by female warrior societies of the vec im not happy eladamri has chosen this course but i feel better in my heart if sivi is with him in the stronghold its settled eladamri said he slipped together the two halves of the fetish hed carved a little glue and the joint would be invisible well leave tomorrow at sunset do we have enough captured uniforms and equipment enough for a regiment darsett said grinning theres a surfeit of officers outfits we can all be rathi officers if we want they died especially often if i show up at the stronghold the prisoner of ten officers i think theyll be a little suspicious eladamri said it would be best if you went as the lowliest of privates eladamris plan called for a handpicked force of ten warriors drawn from his dal and vec allies to don rathi uniforms they would walk to the stronghold with eladamri as their prisoner and present him to the authorities there once inside the stronghold they would find where predator was moored and destroy the airship gallan and tant jova would assemble the rebel army now almost eleven thousand strong and when eladamri and his team returned a full scale war on the stronghold would commence what if you dont find the predator conveniently docked waiting for destruction asked gallan then well wait until it returns replied the elf leader and if greven murders you before the airship comes back eladamri was momentarily silent while he bored a hole in the top half of the image he was making he licked the end of a length of string and threaded it through the hole this war is not about me gallan understand that now whether i live or die this is not eladamris rebellion it belongs to every free person on rath not to me if i die on this operation or any other you must fight on do you hear otherwise everything weve fought for becomes just vanity an empty struggle for glory will you swear to carry on the fight no matter what happens to me it is sworn o eladamri said tant jova i swear liin sivi added youre a fool darsett said scratching his bearded cheek a gallant dedicated fool im proud to know i swear too gallan was alone everyone in the room watched him struggle for the words i will fight on he said at last but if you die i further swear to show no mercy to crovax greven ilvec or any other stronghold leader they will all dieby my hand if necessary eladamri continued to carve the pile of white shavings at his feet grew larger thank you gallan he said crovaxs army has returned ertai said he was standing by one of the odd protruding eggshaped windows in the evincars quarters far below he could see the soldiers fanning out from the causeway to the dal city located on the lip of the crater wall overnight word had spread about the massacre and thered been trouble in all the settlements nothing majorno attacks were made on the citadelbut small bands of outraged city dwellers had roamed the streets all night some moggs had been killed and small groups of soldiers set upon but when the citadel garrison turned out the troublemakers went home the knowledge that both crovax and greven were present in the crater deterred the common folk from taking matters too far inside the citadel however a siege mentality took over patrols constantly circled inside the fortress making sure all entrances were secure dorian ildal was prostrate after witnessing the aftermath of crovaxs revenge and he had abandoned his regular duties fearing assassination courtiers locked themselves in their rooms belbe withdrew to the evincars suite before long ertai joined her his clothes stuffed with scrolls borrowed from the citadels libraries they spoke little ertai dragged a chaise to the window and read there occasionally glancing outside to see what was happening belbe huddled in one of volraths oversized chairs her knees drawn up to her chin she stayed there for a complete night and half of the following day im afraid she finally said ertai looked up from his scroll why are you afraid youre the emissary of phyrexia of the people here youre probably the safest one of all no one dares harm you perhaps i misuse the word ive never felt this way before i think its fear what are you afraid of hurting someone ertai left the chaise and leaned on the arm of belbes chair youre afraid of hurting someone else not being hurt yourself yes whore you afraid of hurting crovax the young sorcerer did a double take by all the colors he said why should you be afraid of that because i want to hurt him i think about it all the time i want to break his limbs put out his eyes dismember him castrate him i get the idea ertai said hastily no one would weep if you did kill crovax she seized his hand in a powerful grip listen to what i say i want to hurt him and when im done i want to hurt him all over again killing him would be mercy i dont want him to find any mercy belbe my hand at first the images were just fleeting i could distract myself with other things in the dream halls i broke volraths dream records because i really wanted to break crovaxs skull her fingers were digging into his flesh ertai tried to pry her fingers loose but even his newly grown muscles were no match for belbes enhanced strength im not supposed to care what crovax does so long as it serves the purposes of my masters his methods are coarse but he is the strongest candidate for evincar why dont i name him to the post and depart i have the means im not responsible for the people here is it because i know in time crovax will kill every living thing on this world to feed his appetite for destruction ertai made a fist and hit belbe as hard as he could on the jaw her head snapped back and for a brief instant he saw the light of rage in her eyes his heart shrank to a hard ball and a hollow place opened in the pit of his stomach belbe must have seen the expression of fear on ertais face and she abruptly released him he backed away quickly rubbing his sorely bruised hand im sorry i didnt mean to hurt you ertai i hope im not around when you do mean to hurt someone he said ruefully his mood quickly changed do you really have a way to leave rath of course i cannot allow you to go she said lowering her feet to the floor even if it means crovax kills me yes ertai paced up and down you know i cant compete with him for the evincar post although my knowledge and talent far exceed his i cant match him in sheer power no one can crovax feeds on death every time something near him dies he absorbs the lifeforce from it increasing his own power combined with his innate lust for destruction no one will be able to stop him how long have you known this she lowered her head to her knees it became clear to me yesterday i kept trying to determine why his power keeps increasing despite the mistakes he makes then i realized his modifications on phyrexia were largely neurological not mechanical though he was obviously given muscular and size enhancements the important changes must have been made on the inside he still eats food like a normal being of flesh but its just a habit he hasnt given up yet his command of the flowstone is growing exponentially it doesnt come from rare cutlets and sour wine obviously he has another source of power then i realized what was happeningthe deaths of so many soldiers in battle fed crovax enough energy for him to teleport for the first time from the battlefield to the citadel slaughter of the hostages has boosted his power a thousandfold more soon hell be unstoppable thats why i want to hurt him i want him to know what it feels like to suffer at anothers hands for a moment ertai forgot about escape why dont you kill him hell kill us both if we get in his way i must put the best possible candidate on the throne of rath why he shouted the flowstone around him rose in a hundred tiny peaks its my purpose she replied hotly its the reason i exist i have a notion for you belbe exist to be yourself loyalty is an admirable trait but you cant cling to it in the face of certain destruction she stalked across the floor flattening the flowstone waves with her feet an inch from his face she stopped this is why you and your kind will failyou think only of yourselves your own petty individual concerns above the welfare of your race my masters will destroy you and anyone else who stands in their way its the law of nature that the efficient shall displace the inefficient ertai carefully lifted her hand and clasped it with his own youre the same race as i he said youve no common cause with beings whose sole purpose is to force people like us into slavery his touch was firm and warm belbe stared at him at their hands she dropped ertais hand and turned away he put his arms around her unlike crovax his touch was gentle why do you always turn away at the last moment he said i cannot do what i imagine why not what stops you belbe shuddered i am not alone and never have been there is a device in my body which transmits everything i see and do to my masters on phyrexia he turned belbe to face him where is this device she took his hand and pressed the tips of his fingers to her breastbone he felt the curved surface of the lens imbedded there can it be removed perhaps on phyrexia not here he closed his eyes and probed the lens with his mind touching it even psychically was like entering a vast empty well black and bottomless there seemed no end to it as it stretched all the way from rath to the secret plane of her overlords belbe lowered her head to his shoulder ertai sighed in awe that thing could swallow me whole could you break it or block it she murmured at least for a little while hmm maybe your masters cant bear the natural lifeforce right perhaps if i send a charge of such energy into this device it will blind them he cupped his palms together over the imbedded orb and summoned all the natural magic he could reach on this unnatural world belbe felt a buildup of heat in her chest it didnt burn but slowly diffused outward through her neck arms and abdomen ertai removed his hands did it work she asked theres no way to know for certain she draped her arms around his neck i dont care anymore im tired of being a lens i want to be alone with you if only for a while after some hours in each others arms ertai was spent and belbe drained of her stormy emotions he fell asleep on the chaise she watched him a while breathing deeply his lips just apart his hair was russet brown now and next to her pale skin the increasing grayness of his flesh was quite noticeable he was indeed beginning to resemble a lesser version of greven ilvec belbe got up careful not to disturb her sleeping lover she was cold and though she tried to dispel the goose pimples on her arms and legs she found she couldnt this puzzled her until she decided it must be due to ertais spell her phyrexian systems werent meant to handle natural magic and her loss of metabolic control was probably due to the presence of his magical charge in her system she glanced back at the naked sleeping ertai it was worth it she wandered through the empty suite letting her fingers drift across volraths strange artwork she hadnt touched them before and she discovered some of the statues had latent flowstone responses to being touched though they looked like stone when caressed the statues became soft as velvet supple as leather and warm to the touch what a strange person the evincar must have been wasting his intimacy on inanimate though responsive objects in volraths bedroom she paused by the mirror her hair was disheveled her face flushed and her lips bruised these were superficial things belbe stood closer to the mirror she traced the line of her face and throat as she had on volraths statues her skin was cool to the touch and it didnt change texture as her fingertip passed over it why was that was she less responsive than flowstone no one would have said so two hours ago now that her passion was spent was she the same as she was before ertai rolled over empty arms seeking belbe not finding her he opened his eyes across the chamber in the shadowed recesses of the ceiling he saw what looked like a suit of black armor hanging by its feet from the ceiling the armor moved ertai bolted from the chaise who is it he demanded he raised his hand come down or ill knock you down lilting laughter was his answer the intruder dropped from the ceiling somersaulted and landed on his feet crovax congratulations boy crovax said met the emissary on equal terms have you how long have you been there long enough who wouldve thought the overlords would send us such a spirited representative he sauntered over and picked up a piece of belbes discarded clothing ertai snatched it from his hand crovax laughed now youre going to defend her as any rustic swain would youre a filthy animal ertai said he was terrified to be found like this by crovax his fear compounded by not knowing what crovax would do to him or belbe and youre a stupid boy todays performance not withstanding crovax sat down on the same chaise where ertai and belbe had made love its a good trick though ill give you that seducing the emissary is bound to be good for your candidacy thats not what happened crovaxs dark eyes shone are you going to tell me its love ii dont know there was a sharp intake of breath both men saw belbe standing in the doorway ertai snatched up the first available garmenthis doubletand hurriedly draped it around her the proper answer was yes crovax said stretching shut up ertai said crovax stood hands falling slowly to his sides youre welcome to try and make me boy what passed between us was not about human love belbe said archly i had some curiosity about the practice of copulation and ertai was obliging me so i saw if all you wanted was experience you could have done better crovax said im always available for your excellencys enlightenment ertai started forward but belbe stopped him dont she said hes trying to provoke you ive seen it before crovax shrugged and sat down again better listen to her boy i can kill you any time i want he flung out his hand suddenly ertai flinched affording crovax a hearty laugh youre not a total fool youre smart enough to be afraid of me what do you want crovax said belbe i came to tell your excellency that order has been restored in the stronghold cities he said when the army returned i posted soldiers in every square tavern inn and gathering place in the crater therell be no more trouble good you may go one thing excellency since master ertai has obliged you dont you think it prejudices you in the matter of his candidacy i will choose the new evincar based on total ability not by military or magical skillor biological prowess crovax chuckled and made to leave hed gone a few steps when belbe moving with blinding speed rushed up behind him she uttered a short sharp cry crovax whirled but his fists met only air belbe lashed out with her bare foot it caught him under the right breast and he flew backwards his cuirass deeply dented from the blow belbe dont ertai shouted crovax sprang to his feet and the flowstone furniture between them coalesced into a solid wall seven feet high and four inches thick belbe could not stop her rush in time to avoid slamming into the barrier crovax grinned and the wall slammed belbe twice more he was about to smash her against the wall of the citadel when she leaped over the ponderous bludgeon and landed a kick squarely on crovaxs forehead down he went but the floor boosted him back to his feet crovax had a sword but he didnt draw it instead he willed the floor to hold belbe by the anklesbut he was too slow she leaped to a nearby pillar made of natural ironoutside crovaxs influenceand clung there by her fingertips and toes panting crovax shucked off his breastplate wincing from the blows hed taken youve made your point excellency he said i shouldnt try to bully you but in the interests ofshall we say efficiencywill you set a date at which time you will name the new evincar of rath belbe remained on the pillar her hair awry looking like one of volraths exotic statues she drew a deep breath swallowed and said i will set a date when she glanced at a timepiece on the wall the phyrexian numerals dissolved into simplified rathi ones two days from now at midday exactly crovax slung his dented armor over one shoulder and bowed slightly i await your excellencys wise decision when he was gone belbe dropped to the floor ertai hurried to her thinking to comfort her he found her shaking from head to foot its all right he said he wont hurt you he dares not at least until you choose the next evincar belbe wasnt shaking from fear that was wonderful she declared i want to demolish him with my bare hands ertai dropped his comforting arms without another word he retrieved his discarded clothes and hurriedly dressed belbe was so overcome with excitement she didnt even notice him until halfdressed he started to leave where are you going she asked to the library he replied coldly ive a lot of reading to do my final examination is in two days is it not he slammed the ornate flowstone door behind him sergeant nasser bathed and attired in a fresh uniform waited on crovaxs pleasure in the evincars council room i have my account of the armys march back to the stronghold my lord nasser said holding up a slim scroll when crovax did not reply he laid it on the starshaped table before him where is greven ilvec asked crovax called away to the airship something about an intruder on the east plain i see let him chase as many wanderers as he likes in two days the overlords emissary will convene a special assembly her purpose is to name the new evincar of rath the choice is clear my lord so you say but our esteemed emissary is under all sorts of pressures and influences in such circumstances she may not make the correct decision we cant let that happen no my lord tomorrow i want the corps of sergeants to return to the citadelall of them every man is to bring his sword shield helmet and dagger the palace guards wont allow armed troops inside nasser protested then smuggle the arms in use your imagination crovax glowered the ceremony will be at midday two days from now at midday less two hours i want the corps of sergeants to gather in the evincars antechamber arrive in twos and threesdont come in a body be fully armed nasser nodded he knew what crovax intended but part of the price of his complicity was making his new lord and master admit it out loud what do you intend lord the succession cannot be left to the whims of a hotblooded girl crovax said he drew his dagger held it point up for a second then drove it into the table to the hilt before you and all the sergeants the emissary will name me evincar or die on the spot her paramour the boy ertai will die regardless nasser folded his arms it shall be done my lord chapter traitor beset and bewildered belbe escaped the intrigues of the palace by retreating to the factory no one else could stand the noise and crackling atmosphere of the flowstone works for long so it was an ideal place to hideno sequester herself amid the intake jets centrifugal distributors and flow regulators she found a measure of serenity or so she thought even under the faceted dome of the control center belbe was haunted by memories and choices she didnt want her life her total existence she owed to abcaldro and phyrexia there was no disputing that but did she have the right as ertai suggested to exist for her own sake she had never considered what would happen to her once her task on rath was done would she be recalled to phyrexia life there would be severely circumscribed by her need for an unpolluted environment could she live under abcaldros dome like one of volraths experimental animals always under the eye of her polymorphous master clearly no if it was up to her could she remain on rath this option had positive and negative aspects once an evincar was chosen shed no longer have any role to play belbe might stay on as advisor to the new governor but tolerance for her position seemed doubtful perhaps she could find some minor role in the citadelmaintaining the flowstone production facility for example no even that job was destined to be shortlived the conjunction of rath and dominaria was not far off the final invasion would begin then and shed be lost in the tidal wave of the phyrexian onslaught belbe gazed through the manypaned dome at the energy beam pouring through the heart of the artificial crater beyond it like an azuretinged ghost was the pinnacle of the palace topped by predators high landing dock the accelerator broke into her daydreaming output flow is submaximum it bleated increasing output to percent absently belbe dialed the output meter down to percent and recalibrated it to read the entire factory shifted with the fluctuation in production the accelerator accepted the doctored information with a flat increasing output to percent her hand was on the dial what did that suggest she had only a moderate knowledge of planar mechanics but she knew enough to know rath and dominaria were slowly coming into the same planar coordinates when they matched the worlds would interlock and become one rath would overlay on top of dominaria and be the bridgehead for invading phyrexian forces she looked over the mosaic of dials and switches and the image of the massacred hostages filled her sight all those people those innocent loyal subjects killed to gratify the vengeful hunger of one man how is it different her remorselessly logical mind went on to allow the hidden one to slake his hunger for power with the lives of innocent dominarians how is it different how there is no difference she declared out loud the critical factor in the congruence of rath and dominaria was mass the two worlds actually occupied the same interspatial niche but rath had insufficient mass to affect a hold on the older naturally created world the greater raths mass the slower its vibrational rate became until at last it resonated at the same rate as dominaria thats why the flowstone factory had the highest priority for resources on ratheach layer of nanomachines no matter how thin they appeared to be increased the mass of rath and hastened the day when the two worlds would be joined what if it didnt happen what if rath lacked sufficient mass to permanently overlay dominaria belbes hand still rested on the output meter she could make a choicethe choicefor rath if the final conjunction failed to take place rath could be changed the absolute rule of the evincar could be dispelled negotiations with the rebels could put an end to the guerrilla war law and reason could take the place of rule by fiat the overlords would surely strike back but before that could happen the energy imbalance on rath could be reversed resulting in a toxic environment for any potential phyrexian invaders ertai knew enough about magic to help make this possible unfortunately for all his talents ertai was no match for crovax she could not depend on him alone to alter the course of raths destiny greven was more capable but his control rod prevented him from openly opposing crovax dorian and the court were useless the real subversive power to change things lay in her hands alone belbe touched the lens lightly ertai claimed he had blinded the implant did she dare believe it she had to belbe could not face the balance of her life no matter how short it might be knowing she was responsible for the destruction of two worlds and the deaths of millions she adjusted the output meter to percent warning lights flashed throughout the factory until she curtly ordered them stopped belbe quickly recalibrated the meter to read if she could maintain the subnormal flow until the predicted time of conjunction the mass of rath would be too low to overlay on dominaria she was confident no one in the citadel would notice her tampering the meter would have to be adjusted daily if the reduced output was to be maintained otherwise the selfregulating factory would compare flowstone production to past rates and correct its output belbe regularly visited the factory anyway so no one would suspect her if she made daily trips to the control center as she was permanently disabling the alarm system predator entered the crater passing several thousand yards over the control center the dome vibrated as the powerful airship circled around the energy beam belbe watched the vessel glide smoothly to the upper dock and moor there wings folding back against the hull she finished her alterations and left the dome shed just reached the central corridor of the palace when greven ilvec and the airship crew arrived on their way down from the dock belbe noticed among the usual crew a tall figure wrapped in a floorlength brown cape and hood no one else in the crew was so attired she used her infrared vision to peer through the disguise but discovered she couldnt penetrate the apparently simple cloth wrap what was going on here curious she changed her path to intersect grevens they met at the foot of the staircase that led to the grand convocation room excellency said greven bowing greetings how do you find your repaired vessel sound enough though ill be glad when the armament is back aboard scouting is weak tea for a fighting ship like predator the crew waited patiently in grevens shadowall except the hooded one he sidled to one side as if to slip away unnoticed belbe stepped directly in front of him i dont know you do i the hood snapped sharply in grevens direction excellency explained the warrior this is a delicate matter id be glad to explain it to you in a less public place she gestured up the steps the room is empty i believe belbe mounted the steps followed by greven and the hooded figure the doors to the convocation roomonce the throne room of evincar burgessconsisted of a series of giant disks rolled together to form an irislike barrier at belbes command the enormous door dilated to admit them with a scrape like glass on glass the disks rolled back together well said belbe her voice echoed in the vast empty hall your excellency knows we have a network of spies and assassins operating outside the citadel greven said this is one of our agents the hooded figure kept his distance standing aloof with his hands crossed belbe tried once again to see through the heavy cloak but with no more success she had a fleeting impression the person beneath the cloth was evading her changing even as she tried to identify him it was an unsettling experience is there anything else you require asked greven impatiently let me see your face she said directly to the hooded one excellency let me see your face gloved hands rose and folded back the deep rim of the hood a lean feline head emerged with a wispy goatee and bifurcated upper lip grevens mysterious companion was a kor he pressed his hand to his chest in formal fashion and said i am furah chief of the fishers of life furah must not be recognized inside the citadel greven said it would compromise his safety as our agent of course belbe said thank you for indulging my curiosity belbe departed and furah raised his hood again simple enough said the kor she wont be a problem dont underestimate her greven replied she may look like a child but she was made by the overlords and has many talents youve grown cautious greven you didnt used to be were playing a very dangerous game i value my life wretched though it is furah folded his hands into his voluminous sleeves dont betray me greven the bitter warrior held his chin up and replied i betray no one just understand this is your gamble your fight i will not hinder youbut i cant help you much either greven stalked away the doors opened for him furah remained in the convocation room for a time contemplating the tapestries and basreliefs commemorating the deeds of the previous evincar ten rebels clad in captured rathi uniforms walked single file across the dry plateau the six dal were lead by teynel endal darsetts nephew wearing the helmet of a rathi corporal the four vec followed liin sivi now disguised as a vec male shed cut off her long black hair close to her scalp and disguised the break between her hips and waist with a bloodstained bandage the blood was realsivi had taken the wrapping from a dead rathi soldier her ancestral weapon the totenvec she coiled around her waist under the bandage the totenvec consisted of a bone handle six feet of braided snakeskin leather fashioned like links of chain and a doubleended doubleedged knife blade eight inches long the snakeskin whip was threaded through a hole at the base of the knife because vec nomads had so little access to good metal they developed weapons like the totenvec in lieu of traditional swords a skilled user could cut an enemys throat from six feet away or take out an eye with a flick of the wrist sivi was an acknowledged master of the whipknife hence her title liin which literally meant striking viper eladamri suitably clothed in rags sat on the back of a plodding kerl his hands shackled together the kerls reins were carried by medd one of the dal impostors the elf had a copy of the shackle key hidden in his sash so he could free himself if necessary he was unarmed and bareheaded he squinted against the steady stream of dust blown in his eyes the tall cone of the stronghold broke the silver horizon ahead they were still a days walk away the rebels were bored they sang for a while the dal teaching the vec their songs and the vec returning the favor with their own ululating repertory after a few hours the songs ran out and their throats grew dry eladamri refused to let them bring adequate water rations they were supposed to be stragglers survivors not wellequipped commandos if they arrived footsore and dried out so much the better for verisimilitude teynel shaded his eyes no sign of the airship he said i kind of hoped theyd spot us and pick us up are you mad sivi responded you couldnt get me into that flying machine its better than walking offered khalil one of the vec warriors sivi shook her head vigorously that machine is an unnatural creation some day the gods will strike it from the skies strike away but until then id rather ride than walk said teynel want the beast said eladamri holding up the reins in his manacled hands shamed the young dal declined i wouldnt ask your lordship to walk im not a lord the elf said sharply i dont carry any rank either call me eladamri or brother and nothing else i thought only elves called each other brother said sivi anyone who fights at my side can call me brother this put new spring in the rebels step they had covered a lot of ground by midday when they paused for a scant meal of rathi army rations what little breeze there was died shamus the dal on lookout spotted a rising column of dust in the distance someone comes he announced keep your places eladamri advised youre not supposed to be alarmed by the sight of your fellow rathi soldiers the origin of the dust proved to be a band of kor a hundred strong males females and children marching in loose formation and bearing everything they owned on their backs the sight was so unusual even eladamri got to his feet he whispered a few words to teynel who hailed the kor band hold teynel shouted who are you people four male kor bearing a stretcher on their shoulders promptly lowered their burden to the ground the women squatted in the grass with the children fanning themselves in the heat a kor elder approached teynel with arms folded greetings soldier of rath he said i am theeno and these are my people the fishers of life where are you going to the mountains far to the south brave soldier our chief is dead and we must leave our homes on bluefire mountain now teynel understood many people living outside the stronghold referred to it as bluefire mountain why must you leave it was the dying wish of our chief he was well known to your commander lord greven teynel stepped past theeno the body of a middleaged kor lay on the stretcher draped in a diaphanous shroud midway between the collar and the hips a dark brown stain was soaking through the shroud this man died violently teynel said it is too true soldier of rath theeno said our chief went to meet the lords of the crater as was his wont only this time he returned with his death wound eladamri stood over the body ruse or no ruse he had to know who lay dead on the carrier forgive me i mean no disrespect the elf lord knelt and turned down the drape the dead kor was furah eladamri covered the body again and stood up he frowned at teynel be on your way teynel commanded we have to deliver this prisoner to lord greven the kor stared at eladamri with slitted eyes this is eladamri he is an enemy said theeno give him to lord crovax he will dispatch him as he did the others sivi stepped forward what others theeno smiled showing prominent eye teeth lord greven gathered six thousand from the peoples of the crater to hold as hostage against those who would aid the vile rebels of the forest when lord crovax returned from battle he spared us the fishers of life he knew we were his loyal servants the rest theeno held two clawed fingers in front of his eyes and made a stabbing motion they burn even now crovax killed them all asked sivi voice rising all but the fishers of life our chief was friend to lord greven and so we were spared the great lords wrath teynel again ordered the kor to move along the women and children stood and the bearers hoisted the body of furah to their shoulders with much churning of dust and no speaking the fishers of life moved on when they were far enough away not to hear sivi exploded the butcher six thousand peoplehis people from his own citieskilled at once what kind of devil are we fighting eladamri apparently one with great bloodlust the elf replied he divided his gaze between the retreating kor and the distant cone of the stronghold i thought volrath ruthless and cruel but this crovax can only be pure evil my overtures to the people of the crater have been roundly ignored you know i thought them too afraid or too comfortable to fight their oppressors now crovax and greven have slain six thousand the oracle envec saw it happen but she couldnt describe it to me it was so horrible its a monstrous crime but it may yet rebound in our favor if i send agents to the crater again this time the response should be favorable to our cause he folded his chained arms do i sound callous a little teynel said finding advantage in a catastrophe seems cold eladamri remounted his sleepy kerl a revolution is not a country dance we cant save those already dead but we can pay back their murderers for their crimes see clearly what were doing all of you this isnt a game or a contest of honor its bloody vicious business the difference between us and crovax or greven is that we do what we do to put an end to oppression and bloodshed for them violence is a way of life and always will be he directed the team to follow the fishers track back to the stronghold it gave them a clearly trodden path and helped obscure their own footprints should predator or a rathi patrol discover them news of the massacre put new strength in their step when teynel proposed they walk all night to reach the stronghold by the next morning no one objected dorian ildal left his chambers for the first time three days after the hostage massacre hed not slept in all that time hunger finally drove him out and he roamed the halls of the citadel in his dressing gown trying to remember where the kitchens were he found no one but guards in the corridors the first dozen he asked gave him directions to the dining hall but each time he moved on a few yards he forgot what he was told one soldier took pity on him and gave him two salty biscuits from his ration bag mumbling profuse thanks dorian wandered on nibbling the hard bread and leaving a trail of white crumbs on the polished black floor once hed eaten his biscuits dorian was thirsty he drifted aimlessly into one of the less used areas of the palace the storerooms clustered outside the bridge to volraths laboratory and the map tower dorian knocked on faceless doors saying water has anyone a cup of water for dorian the storerooms were sealed and he encountered no helpful soldiers in the hall he started to cry tears wore tracks through the flour on his lips and chin sniffing he shuffled along shaking door handles and muttering hoarsely for water after trying more than thirty sealed rooms his hand fell on a door handle that turned dorian brushed the tears from his eyes someone in here would give him a drink the room beyond was short and wide with a low ribbed ceiling dorian went in and he was roughly grabbed by the front of his robe and jerked into the room he stumbled and fell to his knees the door slammed shut behind him and a light flared on he was surrounded by burly men in rough clothes arms were piled on the floorswords scabbards breastplates helmets as he lifted his head he saw who held the lamp crovax ah help help dorian shrieked lips curled in disgust crovax indicated he wanted dorian silenced a callused hand clamped over the chamberlains mouth and fists pounded his back and belly gasping dorian sank to the floor and whimpered be quiet and no one will hit you crovax said what are you doing here i want a drink of water the sergeants exchanged puzzled looks nasser and tharvello lifted the rotund dorian to a kneeling position and shoved a stool under his rump the chamberlains face was streaked with fresh tears whats the matter with him tharvello wondered aloud the old fools never been a hale warrior but ive never seen him wander about the place weeping he seems distressed crovax said rising dorian shrank from crovaxs slight movement the latter smiled sharp highlights growing on his face from the lamp in his hand its me isnt it he said do i frighten you dorian he shut his eyes and shook his head furiously may i have a cup of water nasser looked to crovax who shrugged a sergeant handed dorian a bottle the chamberlain drank greedily water flowing down his chin enough said crovax hes revolting the bottle was taken away dorian grasped at it and cried when it was taken beyond his reach be quiet crovax snapped im sorry sniffed dorian why are you hiding in here who says were hiding asked nasser dorian pointed to the heap of arms youre not supposed to have those in the palace your mind hasnt completely left you i see crovax said setting the lamp on the table too bad as an idiot you were harmless as a witness with his wits youre a danger whatever else was wrong with dorian he knew when he was in peril he struggled to rise but six strong sergeants forced him back on his stool he tried to scream but someone shoved a rag in his mouth gagging dorian lost his recent meal of biscuits and water hold him said crovax he drew a doubleedged dirk from his belt dorians eyes widened in terror he fought feebly to stand crovax pressed the needlesharp point of the dirk into the fleshy underside of dorians chin the chamberlain lost all his color and ceased struggling crovax looked down at the helpless man and stayed his hand he turned to tharvello and then tossed the dirk to the young sergeant you do it why me because i told you to tharvello put the edge of the dirk to dorians flabby throat just as the blade was about to cut the chamberlains skin crovax shouted stop all eyes were on him crovax held out his hand for the weapon tharvello laid the dirk pommel first in crovaxs hand in one swift motion crovax closed his hands around the handle and slashed horizontally with the dirk he cut a throat in one clean stroke but it wasnt dorians tharvello reeled back against his fellow sergeants blood pouring down his chest traitor crovax snarled you meant to sell me out to greven and that worm ertai what said nasser his question was echoed by every man in the room crovax shoved his hand into the crumpling tharvellos tunic out came a percher its legs and wings tied with strips of ribbon crovax held it up and bade it speak i serve rath not any one man the creature repeated your words crovax asked nasser mine but i said more than that the senior sergeant said calmly youre right crovax gave the percher a little shake and it spoke again if you think crovax is finished youre badly mistaken defeat or no defeat hell be back stronger than ever mark what i say crovax crushed the percher to a bloody pulp in his hand and threw the remains on the dying tharvello very prescient of you nasser our friend tharvello recorded what you said and went to see greven ilvec with it when greven wouldnt act on what he heard and appoint tharvello chief of the corps of sergeantsover your retired corpse nassertharvello swore he would take his percher to ertai and the emissary as it turns out i have a certain amount of influence with greven and he revealed the whole sordid story to me tharvellos eyes rolled back his flesh had taken on the color of new parchment from his stool dorian lifted his slippered feet and tried not to let the blood touch him youll find me tolerant of many things crovax said wiping the dirk on the terrified chamberlains gown drunkenness dueling gamblingthese are normal recreations of fighting men as long as they dont compromise your duties i dont care what you do on your own i can even tolerate failure we all fail now and then he laughed though no one else in the narrow room joined him what i wont tolerate is treachery this is the fate of traitors he kicked tharvellos stillwarm corpse do you know why i gave him the knife first the sergeants nodded or grunted ignorance to give him a chance to kill me if hed tried to strike me down with a quick thrust i wouldve spared him assassins i can use traitors are just carrion you know your places for tomorrows operation youre the best men on rath the best fighters and true leaders when i am evincar you will all share in the bounty of my victory nasser raised a fist in salute crovax victory the sergeants took up the cry crovax victory dorian swallowed the bile in his throat and croaked crovax victory oh yes the chamberlain i almost forgot you he grabbed dorian by his thick throat and hoisted him into the air the portly chamberlain weighed easily as much as two normalsized men but crovax lifted him with one hand dorians eyes bulged and froth formed on his red lips i cant trust you any longer crovax gritted youve always been a fool but at one time you had enough sense to keep your mouth shut losing your wits has cost you your life he threw dorian against the flowstone door and it held him fast the door panels flowed outward gripping dorians head arms waist and legs crovax twirled the dirk between his fingers observe he said ill show you the stroke i used on tharvello was no fluke chapter prize the pile of discarded scrolls spilled off the table and covered the floor a good third of the bookshelves were empty ertai slumped over the latest treatise head propped on one hand he couldnt read anymore for sixteen hours straight hed labored in this obscure annex where some past chamberlain had stored all the books he found too old or too esoteric for the palaces main collection the technical information he gleaned from the scrolls was straightforward enough the tiny machines were highly resistant to normal magical influence because it was artificial flowstone existed on the molecular level in order to survive programming and recombination flowstone molecules were extremely well balanced harmonically and therefore resistant to any sort of energy input in a natural substancewood for examplematter was balanced statically at rest under normal conditions wood was wood add heat to it and its balance broke downburning resulted no fire in the world could burn flowstone because adding heat to the harmonically stable substance had no effect trying to ignite flowstone was like trying to boil an ocean by adding a teakettle full of hot water the secret of flowstone manipulation lay in focusing magic or mental energy on individual molecules of the stuff ertai imagined it this way start with a tall brick tower solid and level a man could not topple the tower simply by shoving against it or even by battering it with a sledge hammer but with a chisel and mallet he could loosen bricks around the base of the tower when the foundation became unstable the tower could be toppled with a single finger the real skill was in trying to make the resulting rubble into something useful evincars were given this psionic ability by the phyrexians during their physical metamorphosis unaltered minds could influence flowstone only through absolute concentration or conversely by a massive outpouring of directed magic ertais effects came from the latter method his magical skills got him started and the infusion therapy hed been taking boosted the available power for him to tap now however his method was at a dead end all the natural magical power present on rath wasnt enough to enable him to raise up a table or turn the floor to putty as crovax did ertais candidacy was in a word doomed the trick was to make certain he himself wasnt doomed along with it he considered going to crovax and abdicating his chance to become evincar surely the relieved crovax would spare him maybe even allow him to depart rath via the old phyrexian portal in portal canyon of course crovax was such a kindly forgiving fellow ertai shoved the remaining scrolls off the table the small flowstone lamp overturned and for a moment he feared it would start a fire among all the loose manuscripts the yellowish wick kept glowing inside the glass shield there was no fuel as such in the lamp commanded to glow it glowed in time the nanomachines in the lamp would break down disintegrate and the light would go out it would take several hundred years at least ertai put his head on the table and stared at the light it reminded him of belbe bright purposeful untiring and singleminded what did she think of their solitary encounter he tried to understand what it meant to him since he was a small boy ertais life had been centered on the practice of magic for nineteen years it was the first thing he thought of in the morning and the thing he dreamt of at night at barrins academy hed been too busy for romanceif something didnt advance his knowledge of magic what use was it he could laugh now at his own arrogance except he didnt feel like laughing with thumb and forefinger he tried to pluck the glowing wick from the lamp it winked out throwing the cluttered room into darkness he took his fingers away and the element resumed glowing no flame no heat more than ever it reminded him of belbe she had her own portal she said if so she must go and take him with her as ertai saw it they had common cause to leave rath together once crovax was in power no one on rath was safe everyone would be fodder for his appetite his own private herd of twolegged cattle as a defeated rival ertais life was obviously in danger and he could see belbes would be too yes belbe would be number two on crovaxs to do list where to go dominaria it was home but very soon it would be the scene of a horrible war gerrard and the others had told him this and belbe confirmed it in their private moments belbe explained how rath and dominaria would intermingle the landscape of one becoming part of the landscape of the other once the rathi overlay was in place the legions of phyrexia would pour forth in all their awful technological efficiency and life on dominaria would be either enslaved or extinguished ertai considered himself a realist gerrard hanna and company couldnt prevail against the hosts of the hidden one hed thought it possible once but no longer they would be faced with an army of a hundred thousand crovaxes utterly ruthless and totally without mercy his homeworld was doomed belbes portal could take them anywhere there must be a million worlds or more out there populating the void even the phyrexians couldnt reach them all perhaps he could find some peaceful world of magic to inhabit where machines were made of wood and didnt think where floors existed only to be walked on and a man and woman of talent could live a good life together until time mingled their souls into the great firmament forever go out he willed and the lamp obeyed clouds were piling up in high black drifts over the stronghold as eladamri and his team approached the foot of the main causeway teynel had gotten on their lone kerl as befitted his senior rank among the rathi troops eladamri walked behind his manacles tied to a long rope teynel looped the other end around his saddle ring the causeway rose from the plain a massive raised bridge of solid masonry usually busy traffic up and down the road was today only a trickle it soon became clear why a heavy cordon of soldiers patrolled the end of the road and guard posts along the bridge were fully manned teynel waved sivi and the others forward they lined up and stood at attention eladamri came alongside the dal corporal and got down on both knees trying to look downtrodden why all the soldiers teynel asked do they know whats up no said eladamri his head hanging low if they suspected us they would have swooped down on us long ago theres something else amiss it cant hurt to ask said sivi were all one army arent we weve been lost more than a week so it wont be strange if we dont know whats going on true enough said eladamri he raised his head look outweve been seen the buff stone barbican at the end of the causeway was a small fortress in itself a sentry standing in the open arched doorway spotted the rebels and hurriedly called his superior a rathi captain appeared eating a bright blue pear he shouted an order inaudible from where eladamri sat and soldiers poured out of the barbican fully armed in ragged order they ran at the waiting rebels now is the time for cool heads eladamri said remember youre all rathi soldiers those men coming are your comrades the soldiers fanned out and encircled the little band teynel leaned nonchalantly across the neck of his kerl liin sivi stuck the stem of a long blade of grass in her teeth the captain arrived still clutching his halfeaten snack who are you he said sharply teynel saluted corporal elcaxi of the fourth company its good to be home the captain squinted at him fourth company eh teynel smiled thats right the fearsome fourth not many of you fellows made it back the captain extended a hand welcome home teynel shook the mans hand with genuine relief we have a prisoner to turn in the captain stood over eladamri hands on his hips whyd you bother idve cut his throat and left him on the plain sivi stepped forward oh no she said we caught us an important rebel this is eladamri the fruit fell from the captains hand stuff me with stone the rebel leader himself are you sure thats who he says he is cant think why anyone would claim to be eladamri unless he was i mean knowing whats gonna happen to him yes teynel said on your feet the captain signaled his men to come forward and take the prisoner sivi and the rebels closed around the elf blocking the soldiers hes our prize she said we caught him well take him in the captain burst out laughing youre the fourth company all right nobody else has such brass he waved his men back come to the guardhouse ill give you a token thatll get you through the other stations and ill send a percher to lord greven with the news lord greven hates perchers teynel said boldly send a runner instead were not in a hurry and this elf aint going anywhere without us flushed with excitement the captain readily agreed a runner was dispatched with the startling news of eladamris capture the rebels strolled to the guardhouse amid the admiring looks of the rathi soldiers eladamri dragged his feet and did his best to look dejected the captain gave teynel a pass an engraved metal disk four inches wide with the citadel seal on it teynel hung the cord around his neck and let the token fall across his chest this is wonderful said the captain tell me how did you capture him it was tough sivi said our battalion charged through the burning camp when we saw this band of elves cross in front of us we chased em into the swamp losing half our number on the way we killed twenty or thirty rebels and caught this one about to skewer himself we tried to find our way out of the skyshroud but we got turned around in all the trees the rest of the battalion was lost to potholes snakes and fever we got out eventually but the army had moved on we made our way back as best we could the soldiers hung on sivis every word when she finished they cheered lustily sivi couldnt help but grin this is the best news weve had since predator was repaired said the captain with their leader gone the rebels wont have the stomach to face us again surrounded by waving cheering troops the team herded eladamri forward when the barbican had fallen behind them the elf spoke nice work teynel teynel grinned and nodded i was doing my best to sound like an insolent soldier what about my performance sivi asked splendid said eladamri you have the gifts of a bard he trudged on his arms weighed down by the heavy shackles its one thing to fool common soldiers at the gate but greven iivec will turn up soon and so will crovax for all we know so keep your heads im not worried teynel said once word gets around were bringing in eladamri no one will look twice at us and so it proved at each guardhouse they passed soldiers turned out to hail them and to stare at the captured rebel chief not all their looks were baleful however many were simply curious to see the famed eladamri the elusive guerrilla leader whod evaded them for so long popular rumor made eladamri a wizard of elven magic which accounted for his many miraculous escapes it was disappointing for the legend lovers to see the fabled elf turn out to be a slight middleaged fellow wearing rags the runner must have had a busy tongue because everyone they encountered along the causeway knew eladamri was coming soldiers and civilians alike lined the bridge and more arrived every minute civilians from the crater settlements came out to see the procession the disguised rebels were almost overwhelmed by the hordes of curious dal and vec who wanted to see eladamri suddenly the crowd in front of them melted away kerlmounted cavalry were cantering down the bridge with lances leveled people scrambled to avoid the troopers behind them came a battalion of heavy infantry in tall conical suits of armor in their midst was greven ilvec decked out in fearsome battle gear eladamri checked the faces of his young comrades more than one rebels face lost color at the sight of the towering warlord of all the rebels liin sivi was the calmest hip outthrust she casually rested her hand on the handle of her totenvec dread lord teynel said his voice cracking corporal elcaxi and men reporting for duty we have a prisoner the heavy infantry parted ranks and greven stepped out front of them so you do he was a good two feet taller than the manacled elf yet as they sized each other up a kind of equality existed between them not respect but recognition that each was a formidable warrior if youre not eladamri you should be greven said do you doubt it dread lord said sivi he eyed her as if she were an insect crawling across his dinner plate doubt keeps a soldier alive he said you should cherish it as closely as your sword he said i am eladamri son of kelimenar are you going to leave me standing here for a moment a fleeting fragment of a second he saw indecision on the other warriors face then it was gone and greven gave his orders deliver him to the citadel guards on the factory concourse but dread lord teynel said what will happen to him is it any concern of yours soldier yes dread lord sivi interjected as his captors we want a reward for taking him some of the civilians in the crowd gasped at her impertinence the genuine rathi soldiers listened for the telltale grinding of teeth but none came everything youve earned will be yours this is the word of greven ilvec he stood aside and let teynel lead his team through the dark brooding bulk of the stronghold lay ahead eladamri lifted his face to the sky and took what he hoped was not his last look at the turbulent gray clouds of rath the tense atmosphere in the citadel had reached an unbearable level every minute was like the hour before a storm when all is still but the threat of an upheaval is clearly in the air belbe sensed things were about to break she donned her closefitting armor for the first time since the day of her arrival to her logical mind the danger came from the thousands of dal and vec people living in the crater these were the people crovax had wronged by murdering their loved ones and despite the relative calm of the past two days belbe felt certain a revolution was bubbling just beneath the veneer of normality armored with her helmet tucked under one arm and a slim phyrexian sword on her hip belbe went forth to find the other residents of the citadel she had little luck ertai was missing probably buried in some forgotten library dorian ildal was nowhere to be found she went to his private chambers and found the door open dorians rooms were a shambles bedclothes were torn off the bed broken pottery littered the floor his chamberpots were full and reeking when she emerged from dorians rooms the hall was full of peoplecourtiers some of whom she hadnt seen in a week and members of the palace guard even offduty guards in their padded jerkins were milling around in the corridor belbe stopped an elderly dal whats happened she said tremendous news excellency said the courtier they say the elf lord eladamri has been taken hell be here in minutes eladamri taken if the man had told her greven had changed sex she could not have been more surprised how did it happen i know not how the rascal was caught only that he is coming here in chains he hurried away after bowing numerous times belbe a bit dazed stood motionless in a river of moving chattering people eladamri captured the ordered tread of guards in formation awakened her turning she ordered them to stop the twelve guards halted and their leader saluted we have orders to convey the rebel eladamri to the palace prison the senior guard said were to meet lord greven on the factory concourse and take custody of the prisoner im changing your orders she said you will bring the prisoner to the convocation chamber i want to see him the captain of the guard saluted again and continued on his way belbe ascended the stairs to the convocation antechamber at midday she was scheduled to announce her choice for the next evincar in preparation for the ceremony the antechamber had been polished and decorated with banners and martial flags guards in blackenameled dress armor already stood by the iris doors they presented arms when they saw her at ease she said a state prisoner will be brought here shortly you will admit him his escort and anyone that follows is that clear it shall be done excellency she stepped between them the circular panels hissed apart until then admit no one belbe added yes excellency the hall was decked out with a wide semicircle of crimson and gold banners each one bearing the heraldic arms of a past evincar each company of the rathi army was represented by a battle flag the governors throne stripped of volraths insignia had been brought down from the upper throne room just for this occasion flanking the tall chair were two flaming braziers she walked slowly down the aisle surrounded by symbols of raths past and present might from the odor she realized the flames she saw were real not flowstone simulations the braziers were the size of warriors shields mounted on black metal tripods her footsteps were loud in the stillness she felt strangely numb belbe mounted the shallow steps to the dais and sat down on the throne her back had just touched the rear of the seat when she heard a voice say how does it feel crovax walked out of the shadows directly above her dont you get tired of walking around upside down an amusing trick of the flowstone sometimes useful he replied walking down the wall but you didnt answer the question its a chair like any other crovax stepped down to the floor not so thats the seat of the evincar of rath the sole arbiter of the lives of millions i thought the power resided in the ruler not the furniture you have so little appreciation of the trappings of power anyone who sits there no matter how base gets a taste of rulership that doesnt happen with ordinary bar stools or kitchen chairs on phyrexia such trappings are unnecessary power comes from knowledge and control not flags and furniture my own master her voice trailed off as she remembered the formless mass of abcaldro he has no need for chairs crovax descended the dais youre here early have you come to a decision yes care to share it with me not yet then why are you here excellency havent you heard eladamris been captured grevens bringing him here even as we speak crovax was electrified you jest no you never doeladamri captured he clapped his hands and smiled broadly a fitting prize to begin my new era on rath noise swelled in the antechamber and the iris doors scissored apart leading an enormous crowd was greven ilvec still clad in his battle armor at his heels came ten nondescript soldiers with muddy feet in battered rusty armor next were the palace guards in a box formation four abreast in the center of the box walked a lone figure in gray rags his hands bound by heavy chains courtiers in their baroque finery filled the hall behind the guards and a motley collection of offduty soldiers servants and the odd mogg or two filled out the crowd belbe craned to see the famous rebel leader but with greven and a wall of guards in the way she couldnt get a clear view of him greven halted the procession a few onlookers coughed nervously your excellency greven boomed the soldiers of the army of rath bring you tribute he stepped to one side crovax stood at the foot of the throne arms folded he opened his mouth to speak but his words were stillborn when belbe rose from the evincars throne and descended the steps the hall grew deathly quiet her boots clicked on the mockmarble floor she felt as though she was confronting a great mystery a lost wonder of nature teynel sivi and the rebel raiders held their breath they never imagined they would get so close to the seat of the enemys power the vast stronghold impressed them the flowstone factory puzzled and frightened them rank upon rank of tough professional soldiers worried them now in the very heart of the citadel they were face to face not only with greven ilvec and crovax but the personal emissary of the dreaded phyrexian overlords she was a girl a young elf girl these are the soldiers who brought in eladamri greven explained teynel saluted with such force he almost knocked his own helmet off ccorporal elcaxi of the fourth company your excellency corporal this is my second private vertino sivi returned belbes vacant look with an icy appraisal of her own the rebels parted ranks to let belbe pass when they were clear she got a better glimpse of eladamri he was of moderate height and the color of his hair meant he was past the prime of life for his race the lofty palace guards chosen from the ranks of the regular army for their size and strength still prevented her from seeing him clearly greven nodded and a door of armored warriors drew back eladamri looked upon her face and she on his his eyes widened and a rush of blood flamed in his cheeks eladamri let out a roar of perfect rage and though weighed down with thirty pounds of shackles and chains he threw himself on belbe and bore her to the floor she thought time had stopped everyone was fixed like the statues in volraths suitethe guards hampered by their ceremonial garb the ragged soldiers whod captured eladamri gaped crovax hovering on the periphery of the scene watched and smiled greven who always seemed on the knifes edge of violence just looked on with curious passivity theyre going to let me die she thought theyre going to let this madman kill me eladamri had both hands around her neck because of her gorget he couldnt throttle her so he raised her head and slammed it against the floor it hurt but only superficially her alloy skull could turn an ax blow as it was each time her head struck the floor there was a dull metallic thud assassin murderer the elf cried avila avila the footsore soldiers of the fourth company moved first they grabbed eladamri by the arms and shoulders and tore him off belbe once they acted the spell was broken and the palace guards quickly pinned the rebel leader to the floor with their polearms elcaxi and his comrades pushed away the guards bills and axheads relying on their bodies to hold the raging eladamri someone lifted belbe to her feet her vision cleared and she saw her benefactor was crovax i knew he was crafty but i never thought eladamri was insane crovax said mildly are you all right excellency belbe rubbed the back of her head no permanent damage damned murderers they did it on purpose devils monsters dear avila sweet child how could they do this belbe was still holding the back of her head what is he raving about crovax and greven were clueless you men let him go belbe commanded sivi and teynel hesitated but followed orders up said teynel and the rebels scrambled to their feet eladamri arched his back and sprang to a crouching position with one flex tears streamed down his cheeks with a second heave he regained his feet the palace guards interposed a wall of polearms between him and belbe hold she said to the troops dont harm him she turned to eladamri why do you risk death to lay hands on me who is avila he advanced a step breathing heavily does my face mean nothing to you ive never seen you before he gripped the polearm shafts barring his path where do you come from girl greven backhanded eladamri sending him sprawling the crowd let out a collective oh you do not question the emissary greven barked belbe held up a hand to the hulking warrior be still she said she pushed through the hedge of polearms and knelt beside the elf eladamri pushed himself up on one arm and dabbed the blood from his freshly split lip do you attack me because im the emissary of your enemy said belbe i attacked because youre an abomination a horrible lie eladamri said in a low voice you should be exterminated as all unnatural creatures should be i wouldnt speak too lightly of extermination crovax said shouldering through the press from where i stand the best candidate for extermination is you eladamri stood he was weighed down by his chains but when belbe tried to assist him he pulled away from her glaring hatefully remove his shackles belbe said when no one complied with her order she shouted do as i say teynel shoved the key in his leaders bonds he tried to urge eladamri to be calm with a meaningful glance the elf did not meet his eyes he burned holes in belbe and kept doing so even after his chains fell loudly to the floor what are your orders excellency greven asked what is the first task of a captor he bowed as you command excellency at grevens order the box of guards was reformed teynel and the rebels kept discreetly to the rear dont kill him belbe added as the prisoner faced about find out what he knows but preserve his life do you understand greven avowed he did crovax sighed so much trouble i doubt hell tell us anything better to strike off his head now and be done with it i can have the airship drop it on the rebels in skyshroud forest shut up belbe commanded crovax shrugged the massive crowd tried to get out of the way of eladamris escort but there were so many packed in the rear of the hall that it took a few minutes to clear the doorway just as everyones attention was focused on the departing rebel leader the floor of the hall turned to soft clay and the dilating doors melded into a solid mass everyone was lifting their feet losing shoes and slippers in the sticky stuff belbes frustration was written on her face what are you doing crovax restore the door and floor crovax was seated on the throne he looked very natural and comfortable in the tall black chair leaning back he propped his chin on his hands and waited until everyone was looking at him to respond the noon hour is not far off excellency why not take advantage of these splendid witnesses and announce your choice for the next evincar of rath she looked around ertai is not here should he be he is under consideration for the post crovax flexed his fingers four flowstone rods like the ones he had used to slaughter the hostages erupted from the floor around belbe secondary spikes jutted from the footthick shafts isolating her in a ring of artificial thorns belbe glared i tire of your displays his right eyelid twitched a fifth rod formed between her feet it rose slowly to knee level and held there the tip bending backward to caress her leg like some inquisitive tentacle name your choice crovax said quietly not yet the fifth rod leaped up to her chin limp pseudopodia emerged from it and delicately probed the joints of her armor she knew that with a single thought he could convert them to steelhard spikes if you kill me youll never be named evincar belbe said knowing that do you think you can frighten me into a decision crovax burst out laughing it was hard unfriendly mirth but the cage of spikes sank into the floor the rest of the crowd found their footing had firmed up their exodus accelerated now that many of them had seen crovaxs talents for the first time i defer my decision until tomorrow morning by then i will know more about the rebels plans and can act accordingly with that belbe strode from the hall eladamris eyes hatefully followed her out of the room chapter pawn ertai awoke slowly the room was pitch black and so hot that sweat from his brow had pooled on the tabletop matting together several old manuscripts there was a vile taste in his mouth coughing he sat up and realized hed chewed on a scroll in his sleep that explained the awful flavor of ink he thought the lamp into working it flashed to life first red then orange gradually brightening to a soft yellow glow he had no idea what time it was or how long hed been in the dusty arid annex trampling through piles of open scrolls he reached the door and threw back the bolt air poured in like a cool waterfall he held out his arms and drank it in gratefully these citadel rooms were all but airtight with their doors closed it was a wonder he hadnt suffocated in this booklined tomb sweaty and with sleepswollen features ertai sauntered down the corridor from the amount of light coming from outside it seemed like late morning or early afternoon rath had no proper day or night but diurnal variations in the great energy beam approximated two halves of a day he wanted a cool drink some decent food and a bath thoughts of bathing made him smile hed use the fancy tub in the evincars quarters again maybe this time belbe would join him it would be a good place to spring his plan about the two of them leaving rath forever the side hall connected to a major corridor that was surprisingly full of people the citadel hadnt been this lively since hed arrived now the place bustled with servants and elaborately dressed courtiers some hastening from point to point others lingering in handy alcoves conversing in loud theatrical whispers pardon me but whats the stir he asked a trio of gaudy loafers have you not heard weve captured eladamri the fat courtier who bowed under a headdress loaded with gems didnt look like hed ever captured anything but a free meal are you certain when did this happen i saw him myself in the convocation hall not half an hour ago said the fellow haughtily hes a savage no doubt about it he tried to kill the emissary in front of the whole court he tugged on the courtiers copious sleeve is belbe all right lord widewaist removed his gold embroidered sleeve from ertais inkstained fingers no harm came to her excellency he sniffed ertai made a slight alteration to the flowstone around the courtiers feet uttered a brief thanks and hurried on a few moments later he was rewarded by the sound of the bloated courtier falling flat on his face ertai had locked his slippers to the floor the hall leading to the convocation antechamber widened ertai broke into a trot he dodged around slow moving loiterers then bumped into the broad back of a man who wasnt moving at all out of the way he said this is a public hall not a public house the big man turned around i know you ertai said youre a soldiersergeant somebodyorother nassers my name another sinewy fellow moved in behind ertai this is sergeant valmoral the sweat turned cold on ertais neck how dyou do they were both in cloth jerkins and trews so he said is this your day off boys a sergeants work is never done nasser replied the one called valmoral poked the tip of a short but very sharp knife in the small of ertais back we know youre a tricky fellow so chose your next act carefully you have my full attention youll come with us valmoral said you really think you can abduct me here in front of all these people youll come said nasser the life of the emissary is at stake belbe ertais eyes narrowed he could with a little effort send simultaneous psychokinetic bursts from each hand and repel these two roughnecks but then what for all he knew belbe was already in their hands he relaxed letting his shoulders sag good thinking nasser said this way they moved slowly against the general flow of the crowd the soldiers stood on either side steering him with nudges from their broad shoulders he thought fast and hard at least tell me where were going he said out of the side of his mouth to a place of calm reflection nasser replied i could use some calm reflection ah valmoral pricked him with the point of his knife you chatter like a percher be silent they turned off the main corridor to a small side hall losing most of the foot traffic as they did they went on quite a ways and turned off again this time into a passage just wide enough for two men to walk abreast fourth door on the right nasser said he slowed his pace until valmoral reached out to shove him forward as soon as ertai shuffled forward out of arms reach he commanded the flowstone walls to narrow two bulges formed in front of the sergeants blocking their way ertai ran hold you he skidded to a stop at the fourth door and glanced back at the trapped men one was shouting dire threats the other was trying to worm past the obstruction ertai put a hand on the door handle it swung inward he looked into the smiling face of crovax having fun boy he said good im in the mood for some fun too teynel sivi and the rebels cautiously trailed behind eladamri and his escort of palace guards it was easy to follow them even through the crowds because greven ilvec overtopped everyone in sight as long as they kept the warriors towering frame in view they knew where their leader was except for sivis totenvec they were unarmed even as rathi soldiers they had to surrender their weapons when they entered the palace eladamri had been preternaturally calm through all the danger until he laid eyes on the emissary his subsequent murderous implacable rage was something none of them had ever seen in him before the emissary looks like an elf sivi noted as they shadowed their captive leader is that what angered him i dont know said teynel but i have a bad feeling about it i wasnt expecting her and i dont think eladamri was either i didnt think they would act so quickly to interrogate him we cant let them torture him sivi said teynel turned back abruptly coming nose to nose with liin sivi we have a mission to perform if you arent happy with the way im leading it youre free to leave her hostile glare softened so he added i dont intend to lose eladamri but he may have to endure some hardship before we can retrieve him he understood that before we left skyshrouddidnt you eladamri and his captors halted near the mouth of a gilded bridge that led out into the open crater a short way down a large conical building extended well below the line of the bridge they heard greven speak take a last look he said his inflection oddly respectful you may not see daylight again eladamri inhaled deeply i will know the light far longer than you butcher any trace of compassion left grevens voice forward he barked the guards locked their shields together eladamri was now closed inside a living cage head held high he strode in perfect step with the escort the rebels were pressed into individual niches in the wall just behind the bridge landing they saw and heard the exchange between greven and eladamri what is that place asked sivi a prison i assume teynel said its isolated from the rest of the fortress how do we get in we dont were following eladamris original plan sivi you take half the men and look for predator ill lead the rest and search where you dont take no action when you do find it we need to make sure of the one attack well get well tendezvous in four intervals at the entrance to the big hall we saw then we all go back to the airship and finish it once and for all sivi stepped out of her niche and tapped the shoulders of four of the rebels wordlessly they peeled off and followed her teynel watched her take her squad up a spiral staircase teynel signaled the remaining rebels to follow him since sivi chose to go higher in the citadel they would search low she could still feel the pressure of his hand around her throat what was it that drove this total stranger to attack her in full view of the assembled court belbe sat sideways in the throne of rath and tried to answer the question logically he called her an abomination a lie both implied representations of truth that were actually false how was she false she was who she was made on the fourth sphere of phyrexia for this exact mission did she resemble someone known to eladamri she rejected the idea as too absurd if that was true who was avila belbe shook her head it throbbed a little where eladamri had dashed it against the floor she didnt have enough information to answer her questions the only place she could get more was from eladamri the convocation room was empty all that remained were the flags eladamris manacles and belbe she picked up the heavy chains by now the rebel leader was beginning his interrogation she remembered what ertai looked like after greven was done with him a sour taste spread up her throat no doubt eladamri was tougher than ertai but the thought of him being burned and beaten by grevens moggs made her ill it was easy enough to send him there when hed just tried to throttle her she regretted it now thered been enough violence in this placetoo much she was sick of it if she had authority to stop it it was high time she exercised it belbe hurried from the hall still gripping the manacles shed had enough of crovaxs bullying too hed humiliated her in the past but this last time was in public and she wouldnt stand for any more if greven would back her up she was willing to name ertai as the next evincar of rath crovax wouldnt take it lying down but she had a few surprises for him among the equipment sent with her from phyrexia was a case of special weapons she was supposed to supply these weapons to the new evincar but she had a better use for them her masters might not approve but she had already gone too far down the road of resistance to feel fainthearted with ertai at her side shed free greven from his control rod and together the three of them would destroy crovax and establish rath as a sovereign world no longer the puppet of phyrexia or a threat to dominaria and possibly if eladamri were amenable he could have a post in her new order too the flowbot lift carried her swiftly to the evincars quarters when she arrived in the outer chamber the room was dark belbe asked for light but nothing happened annoyed she climbed the stairs and entered the statuary room there lamps blazed brightly she stopped short something was amiss nothing in the room was disturbed but she avoided the usual path through the statues preferring to hug the wall instead the phyrexian crates were where shed left them seals intact she pressed her thumb into the shallow depression on the back of the seal and it opened with a click nestled in the crate were two identical weaponsplasma energy dischargers they were shoulder arms like crossbows but instead of a steel bow at a right angle to the stock there was a long metal casing ending with two sharp metal points pointing forward dischargers used a single powerstone six were stored in the crate these stones were so strongly charged they couldnt be loaded barehanded she picked up an lshaped loading tool pressed it against one of the powerstones and inserted it into the slot on the underside of the weapon a row of green and red jewels on top of the discharger began to glow the weapon was armed cradling the phyrexian weapon under her arm belbe hurried to the lift she was halfway across the statuary room when she heard a tinny whistling belbe swung the discharger around aiming the double points in the direction of the sound the little tune repeated come out or ill use this she said the whistlers reply was mockingly the same her thumb pressed against a smooth pad on the rear of the metal housing there was a flash like lightning an earsplitting crack and one of volraths statues was blasted in two the tune ceased our masters make impressive weapons dont they crovax was close behind hertoo close she tried to bring the heavy discharger to bear but he tore it from her hands before she could get it leveled belbe leaped at him trying to snatch the weapon back crovax casually punched her on the jaw she flew backward against a statue of a crouching youth by the time belbe shook off the blow the tips of the discharger were an inch from her face you have an extraordinarily hard head but i suspect this device can deal with that said crovax at this range youll vaporize my skull belbe said really crovax caressed the weapon admiringly belbe waited for the flash and the oblivion to follow crovax raised the tips to the ceiling get up he went to the door men filed in from the darkened staircase she recognized them as the corps of sergeants two of them bore a third man between them hands tied and mouth gagged ertai their eyes met belbe made a half step in his direction but froze when sergeant valmoral pressed the edge of his knife to ertais jugular she forced herself to be calm now what this is a coup crovax replied matteroffactly as of this moment i am taking over the rule of rath you will name me evincar in front of these witnesses now and if i dont sergeant valmoral will bleed the boy dry belbe folded her arms so do it ill not be coerced crovax shrugged and nodded valmoral drew his knife back to add force to the cut ertais eyes widened then he squeezed them shut down came the stroke of the blade under her arm belbe had secreted a broken piece of the statue shed fallen against it was a young mans handa slender elegant hand fingers gathered in touching the finely carved thumb made of flowstone it weight about a pound she whipped this at valmoral with all the speed and power she possessed it hit him on the forehead just before the stroke of his knife laid open ertais throat the room erupted ertai swung his bound hands at the nearest man catching him in the gut belbe whirled and sprang at crovax he pointed the phyrexian weapon at her but nothing happened alarmed he dropped it and the flowstone statue of an androgynous nude between him and belbe came to life at his command belbe tried to dodge it but the statue caught her around the waist and flung her back two sergeants moved in they wore helmets and breastplates but were armed only with knives belbe got a foot against the moving statue and heaved it away the first man slashed at her she caught his arm and broke it like a twig he howled and dropped his blade she twisted his arm behind him spinning him around and shoved him against his oncoming comrades the floor crept up around her ankles and hardened belbe dodged one soldier knelt and hammered the flowstone with her fist the material around her right foot splintered freeing it she promptly used it to kick one of her attackers in the chest his cuirass indented three inches from the blow she felt the ribs behind the armor crack and the man went down a knife point raked across the bridge of her nose this one was going for her eyes enraged belbe brought her hand across to ward off another attack the sergeant drove his knife right through the palm of her hand she blocked the pain and closed her fingers around his knife crushing every bone in his hand he groaned and fell to his knees belbe slid her impaled hand off the knife blade and delivered a reverse kick to the back of the mans skull there was a crunch of bone and he pitched forward the man was dead before his head hit the floor all of a sudden the fight was over belbe had disposed of four attackers her left foot was trapped in a thick block of flowstone and glistening oil was leaking from the hole in her hand crovax and the rest of the sergeants withdrew beyond her reach ertai arms and legs stretched wide was being held by two of volraths statues animated for the task by crovax his shirt was torn open and a bright red slash crossed his chest valmoral an ugly gash on his head had cut ertai once and was poised to do so again finish him crovax ordered no said belbe dont hurt him you see crovax said to his surviving men love conquers after all two statues seized belbe by the hands and feet spreadeagling her off the floor like ertai crovax found the discharger and picked his way over the fallen men and toppled statues to belbe youre quite formidable the overlords built you well he said ill be sure to relay your compliments she replied panting he held up the discharger why wouldnt this work for me the mechanism is protected it will function only if i use it she lied crovax tossed the exotic weapon aside too bad a splendidly destructive device he closely examined her wounded hand not blood belbe shook her head interesting crovax sniffed the glistening oil and without warning licked the thin black liquid oozing from the wound belbe strained against the statues grip the one holding her wounded hand softened its hold just for a second it was enough belbes open palm connected with crovaxs cheek and sent him sprawling nasser and some of his men started toward him crovax got to his knees and stopped them with a bloodchilling glare no one moves he hissed why not release me and make it a fair fight belbe taunted waving her free hand crovax caught her hand in his and they wrestled for a few seconds why do you imagine combat has to be fair he gasped he backhanded her across the face twice belbes eyes filmed with gray until she shut out that pain as well crovax was plainly surprised when she took his blows and grimly smiled at him you are the strongest belbe said theres no point resisting the inevitable i will name you evincar all fell silent ertai chewed through his gag and spat out the wad of cloth croaking belbe no you heard her crovax cried pointing a finger at the assembled sergeants she said it i said it and i mean it belbe said but its not official until i proclaim you governor before the overlords on phyrexia how can you do that do i have to travel to phyrexia no i must declare you evincar before the open window she meant the voiceonly message portal in the convocation hall crovax stood back the statues released belbe and ertai i give you this much grace as you are the emissary and a redoubtable fighter he said summon the court to the window and proclaim me evincar to everyone belbe rubbed her battered hand i will tomorrow why not now its late she said we can do this in haste or we can install you with all grave and proper ceremony its up to you theres also the matter of eladamri whats he got to do with it wouldnt you like to have him at your feet in chains when i name you to the throne everything in the hall will be seen on phyrexia you know wouldnt you like to impress the overlords by presenting them with the defeated leader of the rebels she saw the glimmer of vanity in his eyes crovax nodded with satisfaction i still dont see why we cant do it sooner he said give greven the night to break him belbe said coolly you wouldnt have him shout rebel slogans while the overlords are watching would you hardly crovax smiled youre much too clever for someone whose life is measured in weeks why dont you remain on rath when i am evincar i will need clever servants to carry out my will she didnt say anything she cradled her injured hand in her good one and regarded it thoughtfully the idea intrigues you said crovax its an interesting proposal i shall consider it the sergeants picked up their dead comrade and the injured men hobbled away to the dispensary four of them including nasser remained behind surrounding ertai ill keep the light of your life until tomorrow crovax said his life is my guarantee youll not renege on your promise you will be evincar belbe said you have my word as emissary of the overlords let ertai go crovax laughed shall we say tomorrow an hour past midday id hate to become governor until after the courtiers have been fed choose the hour you want i will be there crovax herded ertai and the sergeants out he paused by the door ill have to do something about this clutter he said my predecessor had appalling tastesuch a weakness for the human form good night excellency i enjoyed the fight she picked up the castoff phyrexian discharger the jewels on the top were dark belbe turned the weapon over and discovered the powerstone was gone someonepresumably crovaxhad removed it during the melee an impressive feat considering hed never handled such a device before hed also removed the powerstone without the special tool barehanded an ordinary man would have been struck dead by the potent energy stored in the stone chapter decision at the very pinnacle of the citadel sivi and her comrades crouched behind a crane on the airship dock a few yards away predator floated gently tethered to the platform by a halfdozen thick cables the airships massive deck gun which fired a huge barbed harpoon against enemy airships had just been lowered to the deck by another crane gangs of moggs tugged on lines rocking the gun carriage back and forth until it slipped onto the prepared barbette sivi counted at least thirty moggs and their dal and vec overseers around predator maybe a hundred more were close by in various workshops what do we do sivi asked khalil one of the vec volunteers if we could get on board we could do some damage she muttered teynel told us not to act alone said langwin a dal kinsmen of darsetts we should meet up with him as planned and tell him we found the airship yes and by the time we get back the damned thing may have flown away sivi said all the while eladamri is in the hands of greven i tell you we have to do what we can now she loosened the fake bandages and uncoiled the totenvec from around her waist are you with me her vec clansmen quickly agreed the dal were less enthused listen she said if we can destroy predator it will create confusion throughout the stronghold itll be easier for us to rescue eladamri and get out of here the two dal rebels mopped sweat from their faces all right said medd the elder of the two how do we get on board sivi looked all around there was too much open floor between them and the floating airship though still dressed in rathi uniforms they were in a restricted area and were bound to be stopped long before they reached their target sivi raised her eyes the flowbot crane they were hiding behind was the largest on the dock the gantry rose forty feet and the gooseneck section reached out well over the moored airship feel like climbing she said she looped the totenvec around her shoulder and started up the skeletal framework of the crane one by one the others followed the gantry was big enough to allow them to climb three abreast but liin sivi took the lead she soon reached the end of the vertical section sivi paused and looked down her hands tightened on the framework not only was she forty feet above the platform she could see over the edge of the dock to the citadel far below the everpresent energy beam was on the other side of predator and the sizzling blue stream almost drowned out construction noises from the dock the workers slacked off the lines on the deck gun once it was in place moggs with heavy iron mauls circled the gun and pounded redhot rivets into the weapons pedestal sparks flew and when other moggs threw cold water on the rivets to harden them in place gouts of steam clouded the deck it was opportunity sent by the gods sivi frantically waved her men forward and one by one they dropped from the crane to the vacant quarterdeck they crouched along the port bulwark and worked their way aft to some open hatches they heard voices and sounds of work below medd looked to their leader what now there must be flammables on a ship like this she said oil niter liquor something well search below decks until we find some then phutt she tossed a hand in the air the rebels nodded solemnly they were about to ease down the first open hatch when a dock worker popped out unexpectedly he stared at the five rathi soldiers huddled there what was all he managed to say before the rebels dragged him out and pounded him unconscious they shoved him in a scupper out of sight sivi unslung the totenvec with gestures she indicated shed go first step by step she descended the wide ladder into the ship the air was heavy with the smell of hot metal and freshly cut wood sivi let the knife head of her weapon dangle by a few inches of cord a mogg came out of a side cabin a bundle of reinforcing rods on his shoulder he didnt see sivi frozen like a statue a few feet behind him so he kept going she flattened against the bulkhead and peered around the open door two more moggs were working inside bolting rods to the outer hull plating sivi waved for her companions to slip past when they were clear she boldly walked by the open door whip hanging loosely from her hand they descended two decks and reached an open ventilator shaft above the engine compartment the ventilator was four feet square and the metal grating normally covering it was dismounted and leaning against the aft bulkhead hot humid air rose from the quiescent motor sivi risked discovery to gaze down into the engine room she counted five dal workmen wiping down the powerstone accumulators with rags polishing the brass fittings until they gleamed like gold sivi sniffed mineral spirits that would burn nicely where were they getting it from she leaned out farther the workmen were passing a tin bucket around dipping their rags in and wringing out the excess when the bucket was empty they refilled it from a cask standing nearby this is it she whispered get ready they poised themselves around the hole when four workmen were in sight sivi nodded and they dropped one after the other on the unsuspecting men the unarmed rebels surprised the workmen and quickly pummeled them into submission sivi was hurling one man headfirst against the bulkhead when the fifth dal returned with a bucketful of mineral spirits he dropped the container and shouted for help engine noise drowned him out he turned but before he ran two steps sivi unleashed the totenvec she made a single underhand cast with a snap the knife blade spun through the air at the end of its chain and took the fleeing man in the back he froze arms outstretched as if turned to stone sivi yanked the totenvec and the return impetus spun the man back to fall dead at her feet the other rebels looked on in awe did you think it was a toy get that barrel over here she said the group wrestled the heavy cask to the starboard side of the engine sivi leaned in and the three of them toppled the barrel over brownish mineral spirits washed down the deck filling the air with a pungent aroma medd turned his head to avoid the fumes someone will notice the smell someone did the second after his sentence a heavy wrench hurtled from above catching one of the dal in the forehead he fell like a poleaxed kerl the rebels looked up and saw the ventilator opening was lined with moggs growling gibbering and waving hand tools a barrage of wrenches and mauls banged off the bulkhead and engine housing sivi and medd leaped one way khalil and langwin the other a couple of moggs got carried away and jumped into the compartment the floor was slick with spirits and they slipped and fell heavily this didnt prevent other moggs from leaping down on top of their friends two of them fell on the helpless dal who had been hit by the wrench and clubbed him to death the remaining rebels were divided by the massive engine and a growing swarm of moggs a mogg covered in spirits got up waving his maul sivi flicked the totenvec blade into his warty chest it hardly seemed to mind she and medd exchanged worried looks theyre tougher than they look medd observed sivi frowned i just have to find a soft spot she did burying the eightinch iron blade in the moggs left eye it shrieked and fell kicking the deck with its stumpy legs lets get out of here medd shouted khalil langwin try to make it to the main deck langwin dodged a blow and waved that he understood we need a torch sivi cried a wrench caromed off the bulkhead beside his head the tool scraped against his borrowed helmet flint steel i thought this was a raid not a camping trip they backed out the forward hatch medd slammed shut the door a thrown maul proved useful in jamming the latch footsteps pounded on the deck above sivi and medd ran forward eyeing the ceiling sounds like a hundred the dal rebel said sivi looked thoughtfully at the ceiling no more than sixty id say the passage ahead was still clear watch that way she said medd hovered by the next door dividing his attention between the corridor and what liin sivi was doing she spotted a lamp on the wall it was on a pivot to freely adjust to whatever attitude the airship assumed putting aside the totenvec she grabbed the lamp in both hands and succeeded in breaking it off she adjusted the wick control and the lamp began to glow volatile spirit was leaking under the engine room hatch predator was trimmed heavy at the bow because the deck gun had just been mounted so the spill was slowly flowing forward sivi stood back and hurled the glowing lamp at the darkening pool seeping under the door the lamp shattered the light went out damn their lamps dont use flame two workmen appeared in the passage they ducked when the totenvec came whistling their way and quickly fled what now asked medd weve got to do some damage said sivi could we use the big crane outside batter the ship with it that works for me lets go they ran down the long passage crossing the hold on a narrow catwalk the interior of the airship had the same zoological quality as the citadel and running through it was like traversing the belly of a great beast the deck was planked with wood but the bulkheads and ribs of the vessel were some sort of reddish alloy between metal and bone at last the passage ended and they found a metal ladder leading up sivi climbed when she poked her head out a crossbow bolt plunked into the deck the fletching creased her cheek she ducked so fast she knocked medd off the ladder below her are we trapped asked medd rubbing his hip not yet she let the totenvec dangle down the steps with a quick flick she tossed the knife head out the hatch and whipped it in the direction the arrow came from it stuck in something sivi tugged it resisted she raised her head enough to see shed killed the bowman but the totenvecs cord was entangled in the dead mans crossbow the deck was clear they scrambled out and slammed the hatch khalil and langwin were ahead on the main bridge besieged by swarms of angry moggs weve got to help them medd cried sivi frantically untangled her weapon from the dead mans bow well need more than one totenvec to stop that mob more than a totenvec medd looked over his shoulder at the biggest weapon hed ever seen he took sivi by the hand and dragged her along do you know how to operate that thing she asked sizing up the weapon on the run how hard can it be the deck gun was loaded with a barbed harpoon with a shaft as thick as medds thigh the breech end of the gun was a hedge of levers none of which were labeled men and moggs were gathering on the dock sivi saw the glint of sword blades among them hurry medd pulled a lever the deck gun swung left making a note of that he tried the lever on the opposite side the gun obligingly swung right a lever between those two made the gun elevate or depress he hauled back on the left side control the gun mount rotated rapidly until it was pointed dead astern medd let off the lever he depressed the muzzle until the raked tip of the harpoon was pointing not at the mob of moggs menacing their friends but at the deck below them a bolt whizzed by his head hurry medd yanked a short lever below the three main controls and was rewarded with a spurt of vapor from the gun mount sivi twitched her totenvec back and forth nervously try again she yelled on the elevation control knob was a black button medd pressed it there was a deafening blast and the deck gun fired point blank into the rear of the ship sivi was thrown to the deck the enormous harpoon barely cleared the barrel before imbedding itself below the bridge planking on the bridge peeled back as far as the harpoon penetrated the impact hurled moggs through the air end over end sivi sat up holding her head a loud clanging filled her ears and it took her a few seconds to realize the noise was real and not coming from inside her battered brain medd dragged her to her feet he shouted something she couldnt hear him he put his lips close to her ear and shouted theyve raised an alarm this placell be swarming with soldiers soon the breech of the gun opened automatically after firing a brown drumshaped object popped out of a shute alongside the gun and a pile of harpoons were stacked conveniently on deck medd staggered to the scattered pile of harpoons and manhandled one back to the gun it wouldnt feed through the breech so he loaded it down the muzzle the brown drum was exactly the size of the cavity at the rear of the gun so he inserted it and closed the breech smoke from the first firing drifted across the deck to the airship dock dock workers had taken cover after the gun was fired and in their place came heavily armed palace guards sivi used the smoke to reach the quarterdeck stunned bleeding moggs lay everywhere she had to dig under them to find her missing comrades khalil was dead killed by the moggs before the gun fired langwin was senseless she dragged him out and boosted him to his feet you on predator stand away from that gun shouted a voice from the dock medd pulled the right lever and the harpoon thrower swung smoothly toward the voice stand away or well storm the deck medd leveled the gun in the speakers direction he waited until sivi appeared through the smoke with langwin leaning on her shoulder loose a wave of arrows swept the deck shielded by the massive gun medd was safe enough but the volley caught sivi and langwin in the open langwin was hit twice sivi let the dead man fall and threw herself on the deck what are you waiting for she yelled let fly twentyodd soldiers came running through the smoke swords bared they were in skirmishing order so medd depressed the gun at them and pressed the firing button there was a double explosion the harpoon shaft snapped and the barbed head plowed sideways through the attacking guards the butt end of the harpoon shot crazily into the air ricocheting off the dock and flying into the energy stream it vaporized in a burst of white light and smoke medd had failed to close the gun fully firing it with the breech plug unlocked the resulting explosion completely wrecked the gun bleeding from minor shrapnel cuts to his face and hands medd staggered to his feet sivi was lying face down on the deck a few yards away heedless of the danger he moved across the smoky deck to reach her there were no obvious holes in her but she wasnt moving he knelt and prodded her with a bleeding finger sivi sivi are you alive she raised her head of course i am she stood up and dusted herself off she coiled the totenvec in her hand youre pretty dangerous with that thing i ruined it good thats why were here the dock was still though the alarm bell still pealed the surviving rebels ran to the edge of the foredeck and rattled down the gangplank no one on the dock was alive the sideways spinning harpoon head had slain the entire squad sivi paused long enough to salvage a pair of daggers medd found a sword that hadnt been bent too much by the blast and shoved it in his empty scabbard come he said we must find teynel and the others they reached the side stairs just as another detachment of palace guards arrived on the main lift the rebels slipped away in the smoke leaving a damaged but intact predator floating easily on its moorings he never cried out greven admired him for that the questioning went on for hours without result greven and the mogg warders went through their standard repertory of branding irons thumbscrews and pincers eladamri never screamed never begged for mercy he cursed for a while then fell silent his resistance spooked the moggs and they began to slip away from the session by midnight no one was left in the cell but greven and the stubborn rebel leader the vec warrior poured himself a cup of tepid water he sat down on a low stool and studied the enemy who had so long eluded him unlike the common soldiers of rath greven never believed eladamri had magical powers he understoodor thought he understoodthe mind of a dedicated fighter but when eladamri exhausted his interrogators and revealed nothing of his plans his organization or himself greven felt bereft of understanding he was just a middleaged elf of no great size or physical strength he didnt preach about freedom and liberty the way some rebel prisoners did he said nothing he endured whats your secret greven asked hanging by his wrists eladamri twisted slowly with the torsion of the rope hed escaped into unconsciousness but he was still visibly breathing the cell door swung open greven jumped up snatching his bare sword from the table beside him a shadowy figure stood in the entrance whos there the intruder stepped forward and greven saw the hooded figure clearly its you he said theres nothing to tell he wont talk the hooded one glided into the room pale hands emerged from the wide sleeves and gently folded back the cowl greven saw the face of furah why are you here he asked the kor ive been interested in this one a long time said the visitor your usual methods failed didnt they greven admitted they had you cant break a warrior like eladamri by abusing his body someone like you greven whose entire being is wrapped up in his physical form you would have broken by now greven bristled i am no stranger to pain pain isnt the author of submissionfear is theyre quite different ordinary men come to this room filled with terror because they know they will suffer great pain eladamri was not afraid his spirit preserves him from mere physical suffering to reach him we will have to find out what he fears do you have time for this the emissary has been holding out against crovax but she cant withstand him much longer will you act soon theres time i have certain elixirs with me that will open windows into eladamris mind ill use them greven set his face like stone he hated drugs under normal circumstances there was a kind of bond between prisoner and interrogatorstrength vs strength it was though he would never admit it to the visitor he felt eladamri had qualified for an honorable death he was tortured he held out and the next step ought to be a dignified execution elixirs were a cheat no one could resist them eladamri would tell everything now and his honor would be lost he ordered greven to bring the elf down greven untied the rope and lowered eladamri to the floor a heavy chair was dragged over and the unconscious rebel leader was strapped to it all the while the visitor busied himself at the table mixing powders from various vials into a cup his stirring rod tinkled in the gloomy cell he held out the cup hold his nose he said i dont want to be bitten greven tilted back eladamris slack head he held the elfs nose and pulled his chin down in came the cup delivered by a slender kor hand greven got a whiff of the potion it had a sharp odor like vinegar suddenly a metallic bell began to clang loudly in the corridor greven released eladamris nose intruders the guards can handle it said furah putting the cup to eladamris lips i must see to any disturbance greven insisted pushing the cup away you should come too why me things are very unsettled its a dangerous time for all of us if you want to keep up with whats going on youd better come along you dont want me to administer my elixir are you afraid ill succeed where you failed the prisoners not going anywhere if the alarm is false or the situation easily resolved we can returnnothing will be lost said greven the visitor raised his hood time will be lost but i take your meaning order must be restored to rath if my plan is to succeed greven quickly buckled on his sword belt what do you intend to take whats mine nothing less teynel and his team descended into the bowels of the citadel in search of an airship docking station none of them knew their way around and the deeper they penetrated the labyrinthine recesses of the flowstone works the more lost they became dont these people believe in signs teynel asked in exasperation hed thought as long as they kept going down they would eventually find evidence of the airship dock no such luck occurred before long the rebels found themselves negotiating tunnels too low for them to stand in the air was oppressively hot and humid and the lower they went the hotter it got theyd not encountered any people for quite some time this did not mean the tunnels were unoccupied as teynel and his men crept along stepping over ridges in the ribbed floor they saw strange creatures moving about in the semidarkness one numerous creature had an eggshaped body about the size of a water pail it walked on two long legs bent backward at the knee covered in bare spotty skin it had no discernible head the creature smelled like rotten meat it paid no attention to the rebels who pressed themselves against the wall and let the headless thing hop by moving on they reached a narrow vertical shaft the top was lost in profound darkness the bottom glowed brightly with a pulsating red light a rushing sound like deep waters pouring over a precipice boomed up the shaft theres light down there teynel said it may be a way to the dock his clansman garnan offered to scout the situation the walls of the shaft were deeply ribbed so he had no problem climbing down the other rebels lay on the tunnel floor and watched their comrade descend toward the throbbing red light after a few long minutes garnan called up teynel you must see this what is it teynel come see its fantastic they all wanted to go but teynel ordered the remaining rebels to stay put he spit on his hands and began his climb down the ribbing was coated with some kind of resilient skin yielding to his grip it looked oily but in fact was dry to the touch and teynel was able to descend with confidence ten feet or so below the tunnel the glare all but shut out the dark shaft above air in the shaft was broiling yet the walls remained surprisingly cool teynel could not see any bottom to the shaft but he kept going garnan was a sound fellow and wouldnt call him if there wasnt something worth seeing he lowered his right foot but instead of another rib found only air teynel held on waving his foot around trying to find a place for his toe something grabbed his heel over here its me with garnans aid teynel climbed out there was a platform made of polished tubing at the bottom of the shaft teynels feet began sliding as soon as they touched the slippery ledge careful garnan said this stuffs like glass teynel gripped the rail circling the platform they were suspended hundreds of feet in the air at the very lowest point of the whole citadel the entire structure was above them and below clearly visible through the slatted tubing was the crater floor and lava well by all the gods teynel gasped a column of molten rock thirty yards wide rose from the funnelshaped aperture below the citadel it was drawn up to a large cluster of nozzles in the center of the citadels belly the stream of redhot liquid rock thundered into the tubes with a sound like a hundred waterfalls the heat was intense and teynel had to cover his face with his arm just to glance at the flow look there garnan said tugging at his arm teynel tore his eyes from the awesome spectacle and followed garnans pointing hand perhaps forty yards away was a massive pylon jutting down from the main body of the citadel a wide platform served by cranes was built on the end of the pylon the airship dock teynel shouted over the roar yes and its not there either sivis found it or predator has left the crater teynel said pushing his comrade to the shaft opening lets go back we must keep our rendezvous with the others garnan leaped and caught hold of the ribbed inner lining of the shaft he pulled himself by his arms alone until he could get his feet on the bottom lip teynel watched him climb then poised himself to repeat garnans leap the platform quivered beneath him as the polished surface was almost frictionless teynel skidded in a small circle he grabbed at the rail and realized to his horror that the platform was circling toward the thundering lava stream garnan garnan hurry the round opening his comrade had entered had become crescentshaped this was no mere observation platformit was part of the huge flowstone works the shaft was used to convey molten lava to the factory far above teynel leaped he caught the ribbing with one hand it wasnt enough one by one his fingers tore free and he fell heavily on the bright floor of tubing teynel garnan hanging by his feet and one hand waved for his kinsman to try again the inexorable progress of the rotating platform would soon immerse teynel in molten rock the dal rebel threw himself at garnans outstretched hand their fingers met but their sweaty palms slipped over each other garnan shoved his shoulder down and wrapped his fingers around teynels sleeve for an agonizing second teynel dangled at the end of his friends arm the shaft opening was still waning teynel took hold of gamans arm with both hands face purpling the young dal hauled his friend up teynel just got his feet through and the opening closed to just a few inches cousin or no as of today you are my brother teynel vowed does this mean i cant marry your sister quipped garnan teynel and garnan struggled for breath in the relatively cool shaft when they were able they climbed to the intersecting tunnel kireno vellian and shamus were not at the end of the tunnel where theyd left them they retraced their steps through the tunnel after calling quietly to their comrades and receiving no answer teynel paused to listen hear that a soft tearing sound was coming from down the corridor garnan nodded i hear they crept on senses straining to detect any danger the tunnel curved to the left and rose rounding the curve teynel spotted something lying on the floor some yards ahead part of the object was moving as they slowly closed teynel made out a pair of booted feet lying motionless on the floor the remnant of a dirty rathi army mantle was draped over the rest it was a corpseone of their men he couldnt tell which one standing on the corpses back was one of those spotty twolegged creatures it didnt have a head but it had a mouth full of crooked needlelike teeth it pivoted its jaws down and took another bite of the body garnan saw it too and drew in breath with a sharp hiss teynel ran forward and kicked the hideous scavenger with all his might it squealed and went flying ominously there were answering squeals from the darkness lots of them filthy little monsters teynel said i wonder how many more of them are out there i dont care to find out garnan replied the mysterious death of their comrade and the disappearance of the other two men put haste in their stride when garnan and teynel emerged in a normalsized welllit corridor in the lower palace they paused again to catch their breath do you reckon they were captured or eaten asked garnan neither i pray i hope kireno got impatient and went to meet liin sivi at the rendezvous the pair moved on they were within sight of the convocation chamber steps when the alarm erupted teynel knew instantly it meant some part of their team had been found out he resisted an urge to run he and garnan stood to one side as palace guards massed in the hall crovax appeared sword in hand and demanded a report theres been a disturbance said one of the guards what a revelation speak plainly crovax snapped some soldiers attacked the workers on predator teynel gripped his partners arm sivi damn her he told her not to act on her own soldiers what soldiers crovax was pacing and swinging his sword sounds like rebel infiltrators to me probably trying to liberate their leader he swiftly ordered army troops into the citadel when the captain of the guard protested the use of regular troops in the palace environs crovax raised a flowstone tentacle and strangled the man where he stood any other objections he asked good you men follow me fifty guards formed ranks and marched away to the stairs and lifts teynel and garnan were about to slip away you there where do you think youre going crovax was looking right at them teynel saluted returning to our company my lord never mind that i need you now teynel spread his hands ive no sword my lord nor has my friend crovax raised an eyebrow slightly two spires of flowstone rose from the floor the formed into identical short swords complete with cross hilt and moon pommel teynel and garnan stared in amazement take them you idiots crovax said when the rebels did the supporting rod of flowstone detached and retracted into the floor the swords took on the color and weight of standard steel weapons come crovax swept away mantle billowing teynel and garnan sheathed their new swords and ran to catch up one way or another they would find their comrades even if it meant joining the troops sent to catch them chapter forsaken he was no stranger to pain he knew it in many forms from the bite of a skyshroud snake to the ragged kiss of a merfolk blade his had been an active life and he had endured many injuries there were worse forms of suffering than the physical kind the vision of a wife in the burned and shattered remains of the home theyd built together an empty bed where a gentle daughter had slept and died he learned to kill his enemies as revenge for these hurts it didnt help but he was never troubled by their blood on his hands what did weigh on his conscience were all the dead friends and allies people he led to war who died for his cause each of their lost lives was one more scar to bear a burden he knew would grow larger before life was done with him since he was alone eladamri let the tears flow down his lined face hed always been awake even through the worst of grevens torment at times his mind departed on its own leaving him unsure of what he was seeing or feeling he rememberedthought he rememberedgreven ilvec sitting across the table from him watching him with something like puzzlement on his evil face hed been joined by another someone eladamri hadnt known his erratic eyes showed him the face of furah the kor tribal chief but furah was dead his daughter was dead too yet someone was walking around with her face was this unholy fortress full of ghosts tears softened the crust of dried blood that glued his right eye shut he opened both eyes and stretched them wide coals glowed feebly in the iron brazier by his feet thumbscrews branding irons and other horrible instruments lay scattered about he could smell water in the pot on the table licking his parched lips eladamri yearned for a sip thinking him unconscious greven had tied eladamri to the chair by the wrists and anklesa mistake eladamri relaxed his hands folding his fingers inward to make his wrists as small as possible he worked his left hand backward against the cords the black rope was made of the same mimetic cable used on predator and was thus a form of nanomachine like flowstone when he pulled against it it shrank tighter around his wrist he stopped and the cord ceased shrinking eladamri realized grevens mistake was not so grievous if he continued to fight the mimetic cord it would eventually cut his hands off he leaned forward and managed to lift the rear legs of the chair off the floor the chair weighed a good fortyfive pounds but once he got it rocking it was easy enough to tip it over it crashed to the floor hard on his left side the brazier overturned scattering embers how did magic rope like heat eladamri scraped a glowing coal closer with his ruined fingers what did a blister or two matter when your fingers were already broken he pressed the cord against the coal a stab of heat passed through the binding to his wrist nothing else happened so much for burning off the cords he heaved the heavy chair forward to a pile of nowcold branding irons he couldnt quite wrestle the heavy irons into his grasp with just his fingertips now what he could see the pottery pitcher on the table above him what he wanted most perhaps even more than his freedom was a cool drink of water since he couldnt get to the pitcher so long as he was tied to the chair it was a moot point eladamri butted his head against the table leg he did this again and again until his vision dissolved in a haze of red this couldnt go on with the lightest touch he let his battered head rest against the table leg and sighed the jug shaken to the edge of the table promptly toppled to the floor it smashed to pieces in a spray of water none splashed his face not my best day he decided the pitcher was boneware a hard glassy pottery suitable for his purpose he picked a nicely jagged shard and sawed against the cords for a moment the mimetic strands tightened then began to fray his heart leaped when the cord sprang free of his wrists and wriggled on the floor like a headless lizard a few cuts more and his right hand was loose then his feet eladamri tried to stand but found his abused knees wouldnt let him he sat on the floor free but too hurt to walk he tied pieces of cord together and used it to bind an iron to his left leg as a splint using the table for support he managed to stand he grabbed the cup on the table and prepared to down the contents but when it neared his lips his nose detected an acrid odor poison meant for him no doubt and here he almost did grevens job for him his meager possessions lay strewn on the table the only thing he took back was the small wooden fetish hed carved his last night in the forest he examined it carefully it was intact so he hung it around his neck eladamri found another branding iron with a blunt hook on the end to serve as a weapon he went to the cell door and found it unlocked that worried him why wasnt he locked in was this some kind of elaborate trap so greven could claim eladamri was killed trying to escape a muffled mechanical clangor filtered through the stout walls some sort of alarm thats why greven had gone he swiftly made the connection to his young warriors and their mission to destroy the airship eladamri did not pray but he fervently wished his comrades success the odds were long against them he hobbled into the corridor no one in sight the conical towers shape meant the passage ran outboard of the cells which were arranged around the axis of the tower like slices of pie as he looked both ways down the vacant corridor his guerrilla instinct gave him an idea never overlook a chance to cause maximum trouble for the enemy he went to the next door it was locked and the mechanism was protected by a nasty looking flowbot whose jagged jaws encircled the lock use the wrong key or try to fiddle with the device and your hand could be bitten off eladamri rapped softly on the door he pressed his ear to the panel and heard shuffling of feet inside there was a low wicket through which the prisoner was given meals he opened the sliding gate and whispered hello whos in there im a friend instead of a voice or a face a fleshy red tentacle appeared and wrapped itself around eladamris leg a burning sensation started where the thing touched him and its grip tightened and tightened he was sorry for whatever beast or freak volrath had imprisoned but he wasnt about to lose his leg in a show of sympathy a few well aimed blows of his iron discouraged the creature and the tentacle was withdrawn the next three doors either were closed on empty cells or else the occupants didnt feel like responding to eladamris summons at the fifth door he distinctly heard a thin voice talking or singing bending low to the wicket he hissed are you human in there are you human out there was the sarcastic response im a skyshroud elf a prisoner as you are ill let you out no answer he gingerly inserted the iron into the lock mechanism sure enough the flowbots jaws snapped shut deeply indenting the hard iron bar eladamri leaned all his weight on the trapped tool and with a crack broke the lock without dislodging the flowbot protecting it the door opened into the corridor the smell of filth from inside was overwhelming something gray stirred within and for a second eladamri thought hed been tricked by another one of volraths monsters the gray shape became a human forma gaunt redhaired young woman of modest height clad in filthy rags she blinked at the light you are an elf she said i thought my time had come and volrath was playing a little game with me who are you my name is takara daughter of starke he knew the name from darsett endal takara had been part of the early dal resistance movement why was she still alive takara slumped against the door has there been a revolution or are you the new chief warder neither im escaping if i can if you would be free come along though limping himself he gave his arm to the stranger takara didnt look like shed been grevens guest in the interrogation cell her skin was unmarked but she was terribly thin and weak probably starved for weeks she looked down at his makeshift splint and battered hands youre not in any shape for this are you im not alone he advised some of my people are in the citadel but we have to find them takara lowered her head to his shoulder oh well this has broken the tedium the alarm bell ceased it had been part of the background so long its sudden cessation seemed louder than the noise had been in its place they heard footfalls echoing along the curving corridor takara lifted her head the worlds shortest escape she said sighing eladamri held a finger to his lips he pulled the iron splint from his tortured leg without the brace he almost collapsed takara held him up though her frail arms trembled from the effort he nodded thanks they huddled in the shallow recess of a shut cell door waiting for the runners to appear eladamri caught a glimpse of rathi boot and breastplate and swung his iron it whistled by kirenos nose missing him by a hair brother the vec rebel cried its us the momentum of the swing carried eladamri to the floor takara couldnt disentangle herself and fell on top of him the two were gently separated by kireno and one of teynels many cousins shamus they propped the elf against the wall be easy brother kireno said he took the water bottle from his hip and gave it to eladamri he drank greedily until he saw takara watching him with parted lips he wiped the mouth of the bottle and offered it to her takara seized the bottle with both hands and raised it high water spurted from the corners of her mouth and ran down her chin cutting white tracks in the gray grime on her face eladamri smiled what news of teynel liin sivi and the rest we fear teynel and cousin garnan are dead shamus put in we were trying to find the lower airship dock wed heard about and got lost in some tunnels deep in the fortress teynel and garnan went ahead to scout but we were attacked greven crovax creatures monsters kireno said poor vellian put his hand in a nest of them these twolegged ratballs devoured him we had to run we had no weapons to fight them with we were supposed to meet liin sivi and her men at the hall where we saw greven and crovax but the bell started ringing and there were guards all over the place so we came to find you instead shamus finished kirenos sentence for him whats it like in the citadel asked eladamri chaos kireno replied theyre bringing troops in from the city garrison i heard them say the whole place will be overrun with soldiers sivi must have drawn their attention very well we need to get out of sight for a while and wait for things to calm a bit before we try to get out the elf said where can we go said shamus grevens bound to return here to finish with me said eladamri i cant decide whether to ambush him here or clear out to fight another day begging your pardon o eladamri but youre in no shape to fight kireno said lets find a quiet corner to hide in as you said takara interjected the map room she said its the next building over before you get to the mogg warrens its for the evincars use only so no one goes there much you know your way around this maze she looped dirty copper hair behind her ears my father was volraths mentor and later his servant i know something about the stronghold she handed the empty water bottle to eladamri the map room it is he said he and takara had to be helped to stand they braced each other takara smiled wryly you never know what youll find behind a closed door do you when the alarm went off belbe was in the control room of the flowstone factory making the third of her subversive adjustments to the output meter as she suspected the monitoring units built into the factory machinery had detected the reduced output by comparing current production figures to those of the past all through the day the production of flowstone steadily increased by the time she arrived late that night the works were churning out flowstone at percent of capacity the speed at which the factory corrected itself troubled her it meant she would have to be more vigilant in her sabotage if her goal of preventing the conjunction with dominaria was to be met when the alarm sounded she covered all traces of her tampering and started back to the palace to find out what was going on she found the corridors clogged with guards though the palace garrison numbered over two thousand men she found hundreds of troops of the regular army mustering on the factory concourse she accosted a captain of the tenth company and asked him what he knew about the situation forgive me excellency i dont know much more than you do the officer said i heard something about predatora riot between the moggs and the workers maybe i dont know why would they need so many troops to quell a brawl theres thousands of moggs in the warrens excellency if they get out of hand it would take the entire army to put them down whos commanding this operation the captain frowned and pointed belbe followed his gesture and saw a sergeant standing on a flowbot armature shouting orders if the corps of sergeants was involved it meant crovax was in charge belbe was seized by a sense of foreboding she smelled a plot if crovax had engineered an emergency in order to flood the citadel with army troops it gave him an unbeatable advantage in the struggle for power true she had offered him the evincars crown but that was just a ploy to save ertais life shed still held out hope that with grevens help she could suppress crovax and lead rath in an entirely new direction now things looked very bad if not hopeless once in the palace she learned there had been a disturbance at the upper airship dock she went there immediately and found the pinnacle heavily occupied the docking platform was littered with slain guards and the air was spiced with the smell of burnt gunpowder predator floated evenly on its tether but there was obvious damage to the deckhouse and main bridge she easily picked out greven and crovax among the mass of troops greven bowed when he saw her crovax did not she approached greven whats the matter things are unclear at the moment excellency he replied were questioning the workers and moggs who were on board when this happened but were not getting a coherent story from any of them the guards who responded to the first call for help are all dead killed by that he indicated the twelvefootlong harpoon head now imbedded in the far wall of the platform someone fired the deck gun without closing the breech the guns mangled and the harpoon cut down more than twenty men at once what do the workers say asked belbe they say the moggs went berserk and attacked them and what do the moggs say moggs are moggs greven said ive learned not to put much stock in what they say tell her crovax said he seemed halfangry halfexcited tell her what they said its not proven greven said evenly even this mild contradiction brought swift retaliation from crovax grevens face contorted as his spinal rod sizzled into action enough belbe said you tell me crovax crovax made his hulking victim suffer for a few seconds then released him the moggs claim they were attacked by soldiersmen of the army why would our own soldiers attack predator crovax leaned closer and in a mocking whisper said when is a rabbit not a rabbit what when its a fox sergeant nasser on the foredeck of the airship hailed his master crovax excused himself politely and went to see what nasser had to tell him belbe turned to greven the warlord still had his eyes tightly shut greven she said are you all right hes learned to inflict lingering pain greven said through clenched teeth hes done this to me several times in the past few days he punishes me or amuses himself with my suffering i think its over but he leaves me a surprise lately its been acute pain when light hits my eyes belbe lowered her voice im sorry to hear that would you walk with me a moment i have a proposal i want you to hear as you command excellency first grevens eyes sprang open they were shot with blood and when the normal light of the stronghold hit them he grimaced and uttered a short cry of agony does it hurt so much im getting used to it greven grunted however if i dont gratify lord crovaxs sense of humor by screaming he will redouble the effect next time belbe shuddered come i have something important and secret to tell you she led him into the shadow of the flowstone carapace dismissing the guards who were already there when they were alone belbe began the time has come for plain speaking crovax has been pressuring me to name him evincar after many threats and some violence ive agreed to do so tomorrow afternoon in the convocation hall ive wondered why youve delayed this long said greven she was taken aback at first i wanted him to prove himself worthy later i became afraid of what he would do when total power was his i saw what he did to the hostages i was there it troubled him no more than you or i swatting a fly i discovered he gains power when life is extinguishedhe absorbs the lifeforce of dying beings into himself dont you see this guarantees people will continue to die we will all die sometime excellency belbes hands closed into fists whats the matter with you of all people i expected you to understand he torments you he mocks you it will only get worse cant you see that have you no ambition for yourself greven if we could forge an alliance against crovax we could change things on rath crovax is too powerful he controls the flowstone ertai has influence over the stone too not as great as crovaxs but sufficient to even the odds if you and i attack him together greven made a pretense of looking around where is ertai i dont know crovaxs men are holding him prisoner then hes a dead man no she said forcefully give me your wordpromise youll join with us against crovax and ill find ertai this night and free him i cannot belbe was visibly deflated by grevens flat rejection there is more at stake here than you know excellency i cannot act as you ask my loyalties are committed i dont believe it she said i know you hate him can it be youre afraid of him as well she thought this taunt which always enraged greven in the past would arouse him again but the hulking warlord turned away without a word im not free to act excellency greven said i never have been though i command armies and the flag on predators bridge is mine i do not have command of myself im sorry speechless belbe watched him return to the hubbub surrounding the damaged airship on the way he was intercepted by an officer of the palace guard in a crimson mantle though greven outranked anyone else in the guards or regular army she distinctly saw him salute this minor officer crovax really has him rattled she decided her options were shrinking hour by hour ertai captive greven immobilized even the rebel leader eladamri was no longer a threat crovax stood alone on the field waiting for belbe to place a crown upon his head she must find ertai once she knew he was safe she would go to her last resource if he didnt help her then every living being on rath was doomed kireno and shamus still attired like soldiers of the fourth company boldly walked out on the open causeway connecting the prison to the map tower two sentries were posted on the bridge between the buildings one on each side facing each other kireno and shamus approached in measured step halt the vec rebel shouted hoping to sound military whats this asked the sentry on the right nearest kireno were your relief the rebels waited tensely the guards relaxed their stance about bloody time one guard groused we shouldve been relieved two hours ago theres trouble in the citadel shamus said thats why they sent for the fourth company oh yeah you guys talk a lot but what makes you so great we captured eladamri kireno said the sentries couldnt top that and they didnt try they shouldered their polearms and prepared to march back to the citadel then one of the guards stopped hey how do you plan to stand guard without any weapons shamus and kireno exchanged quick glances uh they wouldnt let us through the palace armed said the dal rebel what in a general alarm kireno dodged the sweep of a poleax and charged in before the guard could recover he hit the man high carrying him along until the reached the edge of the bridge the vec gave an extra shove and the guard toppled backward over the rail his scream faded as he fell and it was soon drowned out by the constant background rumble of the factory energy beam shamus had more trouble with his man he avoided the guards spearhead but the back swipe of the shaft caught him behind the knees and down he went that would have been the end of him if kireno hadnt jumped on the guards back knocking the rathi soldiers helmet off in the process they fell in a tangle on top of shamus and rolled over and over in a flurry of fists and kicking feet eladamri and takara came out of hiding at the prison tower gate by the time they reached the scuffle the unfortunate guard was hanging by his hands over the side of the bridge shamus was out cold and kireno was bleeding from a busted lip help help me yelled the guard eladamri and takara stood over him the rathi soldier stopped shouting please help me he said the elf held out his hands thanks to greven ilvec theres not much i can do he said lady please help takara looked around she spotted the guards poleax in her weakened condition she couldnt fully pick it up so she dragged it by the butt end to the edge of the causeway thats it said the guard hand me the shaft and ill climb up takara said nothing but held the poleax shaft over the guards head he regarded her quizzically until she let go the stout shaft connected solidly with the soldiers bare head and he disappeared with a screech the poleax tipped up and followed him into oblivion a waste of a good arm kireno said he knelt by shamus and patted his face roughly to revive him eladamri leaned on the rail looking intently at takara that was cold i learned from an early age if someone gets in your way put them aside said takara they cleaned up the bridge of all traces of trouble and hurried to the map tower the door was locked but takara claimed she knew how to circumvent the mechanism she fearlessly thrust her hand into the flowbot jaws and manipulated the lock inside eladamri and the rebels waited to see if the jaws would bite off her slender arm my father taught me this she said good for sneaking in where youre not allowed i hope volrath hasnt changed the locks since he threw me in prison with a loud clank the doors spread apart takara carefully withdrew her arm from the lock after you said eladamri the interior of the map tower was suffused with wavering green light which fostered the odd sensation of being underwater it came from the tower cone glazed entirely with heavy irregular panes of jadegreen glass the upper half of the map tower was taken up by some kind of complex machinery all gears and cams and glowing powerstones takara led eladamri and the rebels into an amphitheater which filled the bottom quarter of the structure this single room was over three hundred feet wide and featured two concentric seating platforms focused on a central column of intricate design a set of wide steps descended to this column and overhead a segmented gantry curled above the central pillar like the tail of a huge metallic scorpion as they entered the vast empty chamber their footsteps rang hollowly off the green glass walls welcome to the map room takara said her voice was still weak from privation yet the acoustics of the map room enabled her voice to be heard easily i dont see any maps said shamus still groggy from his fight on the bridge ill show you she descended a staircase to the inner ring of seats at the foot of the steps was a panel covered with strange glyphs and symbols takara stood before this arcane altar hands poised then as if playing a musical instrument her fingers flew over the controls touching the symbols in a complex sequence with a deep hum the enormous machine awoke the broad descending column covered with brazen cog wheels and bundles of tubing retracted ponderously into the ceiling it left behind a thick stump serrated with large angular flaps these flaps folded outward and stopped when the column was about thirty feet up it locked in place now what eladamri asked in a hushed voice here she stroked a single glyph the air between the column and the serrated base shimmered a swirl of gray and green fog formed whirling on both axes it darkened became opaque and assumed the shape of an oval spinning globe more definition developed and the rapid rotation slowed in seconds the globe settled into a mottled gray egg turning slowly on its vertical axis rath takara said eladamri looked on fascinated this is rath takara nodded for years ive heard philosophers debate priests about the shape of the world most of the holy ones taught the world is flat surrounded by a void like a stone lying in a stream some philosophers claimed it was round like an egg which did you believe i always considered it unimportant since no one can see the whole world at once what difference does it make what shape it is its with knowledge like this that the evincar can locate and strike his enemies show me the skyshroud forest he said takara toyed with the controls and the gray globe was instantly replaced by a flattened halfsphere centered in the portion facing eladamri was a broad irregular patch of dark green this is skyshroud as seen from a height of feet she said punching a button made the green patch treble in size from feet takara touched the panel once more and the image swelled to cover the entire hemisphere from feet she said this is how it looks from predator eladamri looked for the eye of korai his village and other features he knew none were discernible there was texture to the image made up of taller and shorter trees but the canopy was as featureless as the sea now i know why volrath and greven have had such trouble catching us the elf said even with this great artifact the skyshroud is still our shield and sanctuary intrigued by the maps kireno and shamus came down and joined them for several minutes the rebels were lost in the birds eye view of rath heres something none of you have ever seen takara played the panel expertly and the hemispherical view of rath was replaced by a brilliantly colored globe compared to rath which was made up of shades of gray green and brown this world was a blinding array of colors bright blue oceans yellow and red deserts smoky purple mountains feathery clouds filled the atmosphere softening the contrasts between the sharper colors the whole thing was like a jewel a bauble fit for an empresss brow something about the colorful world moved eladamri deeply what is that takara dominaria he knew the name weatherlight had come from there with its motley crew of heroesand so had crovax dominaria the name tripped from his tongue as pleasingly as the rainbow sphere delighted his eye tell me about dominaria he said its the original home of our kind yours and mine takara replied the ancestors of every soul on rath came from there some ancient sages say even the overlords came from there long ago theres a prophecy that says the demon world will one day tear apart the clouds and rain destruction on the bright world i think the seers knew what were only beginning to realizethe purpose of rath is to destroy dominaria how can that be theyre separate worlds i know people and machines fly between them but how can rath destroy another world weary takara braced herself against the control panel i was never educated about such high things what i can tell you is rath is a shadow created by the overlords of phyrexia as a gateway to dominaria just as sleeping mortals serve as bridges to the terrors of the night so is rath the nightmare bridge to dominaria for hundreds of years rath has been growing coming closer to the old home world the stronghold is the key point the focus of the overlords grand design this dark fortress is where nightmares are made flesh the swordpoint against dominarias throat gods preserve us shamus muttered you said your father served volrathwhere is he now the elf asked gone away she shuffled backward from the panel i dont know where why didnt volrath kill you does he know of your work with the rebellion she laughed dryly volrath cared nothing about my work with the dal resistance he locked me up to make certain my father wouldnt betray him takaras eyes rolled back in her head kireno sprang to her side and caught her in his arms without her hands on the controls the map apparatus shut down the double sphere of rathdominaria rapidly lost color and definition finally winking out like a vanishing soap bubble chapter coronation ertai had to give crovax credit the man was a remorseless killer but he did have a certain amount of coldblooded style ertai was feeling generous as he waited to die he was imbedded up to his neck in a cube of flowstone eight feet wide at the rear of the cube a thin pipe stretched back to one of the main flowstone conduits little by little the cube was growing larger and therein lay crovaxs wicked genius the cube was balanced atop the flowstone furnace an endless blue torrent of energy plunged into the crucible meeting the raw lava rock brought up from below the citadel when crovax and his minions placed him here ertai had been at least twelve inches from the edge of the furnace cone in the past four hours the cube had grown at least eight inches per side in another six or seven hours the cube would be so large the narrow ledge could not support it he would topple forward into the works and be disintegrated by the furious energy beam it took crovax only minutes to create the cube he mentally programmed the nanomachines to retain their shape as the cube grew and thoughtfully provided ertai with a cavity in the cube sized exactly to his body once the sergeants shifted the cube in place atop the crucible crovax stood back and watched for several minutes the flowstone also absorbed radiant heat from the energy beam and got hotter all the time isnt this all a bit too elaborate ertai said would you tell an artist his painting was too elaborate replied crovax if need be you have no sensitivity boy the beauty of this arrangement is its slowness you have half a day to contemplate your end i hope you use it wisely why kill me at all im no threat to you i cant even get out of this cube much less challenge your command of rath you really do miss the point youve been an annoyance to me and therefore deserve to die also because of your close ties to the emissary killing you should be very painful for her ertai called crovax all the dirty names he had in his considerable vocabulary crovax responded by tightening the flowstone around ertais throat until his tongue protruded and his face turned blue then just as suddenly he relented id love to stay and play but im being crowned today he said duty before pleasure as they say he descended the steps to where his private guard was waiting and never looked back ertai tried to influence the flowstone enough to allow him to escape he expanded the space around his body slightly at the expense of enlarging the cube prematurely it was like wrestling inside a block of cheese when he concentrated the stone closest to him softened but he couldnt influence the outer bulk of the cube the effort left him gasping and the growing heat wrung sweat from his every pore what a fool he was to agree to this sham he was a wizard not a politician or a warlord all his grandiose plans to escape or become evincar of rath were the consequences of overweening pride now he was paying the price of his folly his eyes started to swell shut he guessed this was from being so close to the blazing energy beam such promise such talent he had all wasted on this ugly colorless world ruled by ugly colorless people was this the ultimate fate of dominaria should the phyrexian invasion succeed if so he was glad he would not be alive to see it there was belbe why did he care about her he tried to tell himself hed seduced her that his motives were only selfserving looking back on it those hours he spent with her were not just the best ones hed had on rath but maybe the best hed known in his entire short life he didnt seduce herhe was the one seduced for the first time ertai found a woman who didnt ignore him or reject him for his thundering arrogance the hole at his neck was just large enough for ertai to poke a few fingers out despite his best efforts he found he couldnt enlarge the hole conjuration was always more sure when the sorcerer could use his hands to gesture but in this situation hed have to do without once before hed searched for belbe with a magical ferret now he summoned up a similar creation this time a retriever it was hard evoking anything to appear in the glare of the energy beam but he managed to create his retriever in the air above his head it resembled a ghostly ball studded with spikes like a translucent sea urchin bring belbe here was all he told it the retriever spun away ertai couldnt tell if it survived passing so close to the beam but it was his last and only chance it took a long time for sivi and medd to work their way down from the airship dock they were helped by the flood of soldiers entering the palace they were able to mix with the new men and gradually put some distance between themselves and predator by the time the alarm was quelled the two rebels were within sight of the convocation hall doors the antechamber was curiously devoid of troops as sivi and medd entered from the central corridor they paused to survey the roomnothing no courtiers no soldiers no palace guards when we get out of here you know what im going to do medd said as they proceeded what im going to drink myself into a stupor the likes of which has not been seen before sivi smiled sounds like a good idea whats your drink black eye this was a dal drink made from fermented lichen never had any she said why do they call it black eye oh it has something to do with the effect you drink enough you fall down and wake up the next morning with a black eye thats an old mans tale sivi and medd whirled out of a shadowed alcove in the rear wall came teynel and garnan cousin medd burst out but teynels somber face stilled any further display of joy by the young dal rebel what have you been doing liin sivi said teynel coldly my duty she replied you attacked the airship didnt you she folded her arms isnt that why we came did you destroy predator sivi chewed her lip no wheres the rest of your group dead where are yours teynel flipped the mantle back from his shoulders lost or slain i dont know by now there must be four companies guarding the airship well never get through to it all we can do now is find eladamri and get out of here she said nothing garnan and medd walked ahead a few paces while teynel fell into step beside the vec woman you disobeyed my orders he said in a voice for her ears only i had an opportunity and chose to take it and failed their boots clacked loudly on the faux marble if eladamri is dead ill see you die as well she raised a single eyebrow ill make my case to any council or court you can raise im not talking about a trial teynel explained i mean just thisif eladamri is dead ill kill you sivi nodded you can try thirty yards outside the prison tower they ran into their first checkpoint a mix of palace guards and regular soldiers had blocked off the passage with a wall of spears and shields teynel stepped in front of garnan and medd piled against the wall were three dead moggs their sword wounds were still oozing blood halt said the guardsman at the shield line stand and be recognized teynel saluted corporal elcaxi of the fourth company this is my squad were supposed to patrol out to the prison and back he rolled his eyes trouble is nobodys told us what were patrolling for dont i know it said another guard the alarm sounds we turn out and what happens nothing sivi pointed to the dead moggs whats that bunch of moggs tried to force their way through here the first guardsman grinned they didnt make it the guards pulled two sets of proppedup shields aside and let the rebels pass these fellows arent very smart garnan observed dont underestimate them said teynel theres thousands of troops in the stronghold so no one can know them all this little charade of ours cant succeed much longer as soon as somebody recognizes you two from predator or figures out there is no corporal elcaxi well be in the soup they passed through another roadblock before reaching the bridge to the prison tower the bridge itself was empty teynel had the others follow him single file to hide their numbers from any oncoming foe they entered the lower doors of the prison without encountering anyone this is too easy sivi said someone should be on guard here it smells bad i agree teynel looked both ways down the curving passage i wonder where theyre keeping eladamri should we split up and search asked medd not this time stick with me we may be in for a fight teynel chose to go right they moved slowly down the hall checking the doors they passed for noises except for some soft shuffling and scraping sounds they heard nothing i guess prisoners dont last long here said sivi the farther they went the darker the hall became flowstone lamps provided anemic orange light sivi sniffed at them recalling her failure to ignite predator with such a lamp teynel tried to adjust one for more light instead of getting brighter it went out lets get out of here garnan said suddenly we cant abandon eladamri said teynel youre getting spooked medd suggested so a light burns out so what theres no real danger yet lets go on teynel and sivi were going on regardless an open door partly blocked the passage in front of them teynel waved for everyone to stop a low steady light shone from the open door with hand signals he indicated he wanted garnan and medd to stay in the corridor he and sivi would investigate the room teynel peered around the heavy door the cell was set up as a torture chambermanacles on the wall pans of hot coals and all kinds of hideous tools were laid out on a table in the center of the room a stout chair sat with its back to the open door someone was in the chair teynel drew his sword he slipped in and sivi ghosted in behind him totenvec in her hand he carefully circled to the left around the chair while sivi circled right more and more of the sitters face came into view eladamri teynel rushed to the chair the elf was tied hand and foot to the massive chair his head hung down teynel put a hand to his chest and felt a strong heartbeat he lives he announced joyfully sivi knelt and began cutting the bonds on his legs with the blade of her totenvec teynel used his sword to free eladamris hands water teynel said sivi brought the clay pitcher from the table teynel gently splashed some on the elfs face eladamri stirred you came he said weakly im sorry brother theres been trouble teynel said the airship i tried to destroy it o eladamri sivi said i failed teynel poured water into the elfs cupped hands eladamri drank can you stand teynel asked we should get out of here as soon as possible give me a moment sivi leaned her hip on the table when she did something cracked under her feet flecks of broken pottery she picked one up the shard was yellow boneware with a red glaze on it just like the water pitcher teynel held someone must have broken an identical jug there were sounds of movement in the hall the scrape of metal on stone medd cried out soldiers coming teynel hurry in a flash sivi was at the door she looked past the two dal fighters and saw at least fifteen palace guards coming down the passage time to go time indeed eladamri rose swiftly from the chair without a trace of pain or injury teynel still kneeling beside the chair stared in amazement i was beginning to think theyd never get here the elf said what are you talking about brother said teynel your doom rebel fool teynel stood up sword in hand hed spent many days with eladamri and theyd always been of similar heightteynel was about a hair taller in fact the eladamri with him now was more than six inches taller even as he gazed in horror at the familiar face the bruises and burns were fading from view by the gods he said it cant be what is it sivi said to her horror she saw teynel raise his sword to strike eladamri the surprisingly strong elf caught teynels wrist and with a brutal motion he broke the dal fighters arm teynels sword fell to the floor already the two rebels in the corridor were hotly engaged with citadel guards the too narrow hall didnt allow the rathi troops to exploit their superior numbers giving the rebels a small chance the impostor eladamri still holding teynel by the arm stooped to retrieve the rebels sword he examined the hilt briefly nodded then with his left hand thrust the blade through teynels chest the dal rebel gasped bastard sivi yelled she flung the totenvec at the impostor he tried to dodge but he was hampered by the dying teynel the iron blade caught him on the side of the neck he snarled with rage and hurled teynels lifeless body at the vec warrior woman tearing the blade from his neck the impostor seemed to swell even larger distorting his false elven features grotesquely sivi recovered the totenvec and lunged for the door medd and garnan were holding off the guards who seemed strangely reluctant to press their attack sivi stood back to back with medd watching the door of the interrogation cell she expected the misshapen eladamri to emerge but instead greven ilvec stepped into the hall she knew it was the same man by the neck wound shed given him dread lord called the captain of the guards are you all right quite all right watch out for the pretty one her little toy can sting whats happening back there garnan said desperately parrying concerted sword thrusts never mind keep your eyes front and fight sivi cried the greven impostor did not attack either he backed away always keeping his eyes on sivi at the first door beyond the open cell he stopped and put a key in the flowbot lock greven stepped farther back opening the door as he went id love to remain and watch the fight but i have an appointment with lord crovax he said in my place i leave you a gellerac from the black cell door a single red tentacle writhed out seeking something to grab it found its liberators leg and tried to coil around it but greven brought his heel down sharply on the leathery appendage it retracted a foot or two and changed direction two more tentacles appeared followed by a fat wallowing torso covered in the same dark red leathery hide friends said sivi were in trouble the rebels and the guards stopped fighting to gaze at the monster more and more of the gellerac oozed out the door a bulbous upper appendage reached the light the top was covered with a mass of white miniature tentacles that wriggled and flexed in faster imitation of the lower tentacles midway between the things neck and animate hair was what might be a mouthan obscene starshaped orifice rimmed with oily gray skin and drooling pink saliva the palace guards muttered among themselves and fell back you have only to keep the rebels from escaping greven told his troops otherwise you can leave them to the gellerac the beast filled the width of the passage and there was no sign it had fully emerged from its cell the tentacles gripped the door of the interrogation room pushing it shut liin sivi wondered if the monster would simply crush them with its disgusting ponderous bulk as if in answer the vile mouth erupted outward inverting the wet skin to reveal row upon row of conical teeth she lashed at the creature four times in quick succession the blade of her weapon scored deep gashes in the monsters blubbery flesh but it hardly seemed to notice a bloodred limb as thick as her arm wrapped around her ankle and jerked her to the floor the gellerac moving with astonishing speed hurled its toothy lips at her medd stepped in and drove his sword through the creatures mouth blackish blood poured from the wound and the gellerac vibrated with pain it heaved medd off his feet and threw him against the wall the respite gave sivi time to slash the tentacle gripping her leg it loosened and she scrambled out of reach with help from garnan the rathi troops had withdrawn more than six yards sivi got to her feet i dont think this monster knows friend from foelets see if it likes fighting them as well as us they retreated to the point where the guards had stopped sivi called out o captain hear me what do you want rebel that beast has no eyesi wonder if your men taste as good to it as mine do whats your point im just wondering what happens after were dead howre you going to stop it more mutterings from the rathi soldiers made all the more urgent as the gellerac rolled rapidly down the passage after them sivi and comrades ran right at the guards who lowered their sword points the gellerac hit the line of guards and caught two in its tentacles they yelled and hacked at the creature with their swords some of their comrades joined in a few at the rear turned and fled this is no warriors fight sivi said your master cares nothing about your lives the rathi captain watched a loathsome look on his face one of his men vanished underneath the gellerac his screams muffled by flabby flesh fall back shouted the captain fall back to the bridge the stronghold troops broke and ran the captain tried to corral the rebels but sivi warned him off with lightning cracks of the totenvec the gellerac had slowed its advance while digesting its first catch sivi medd and garnan backed down the left hand passage you cant escape the rathi captain said surrender to me and ill protect you from the monster youd better worry about your own hide o captain sivi said well take our chances elsewhere she slapped medd on the back and they ran down the open passage halfway around the tower they waited and listened the heavy sliding noise of the gellerac wasnt evident liin what happened to teynel garnan asked in few words she described the bizarre trap theyd fallen into and teynels death garnan covered his face and wept quietly medd looked to sivi when did greven ilvec become a shapeshifter why ask me anything seems possible in this mad fortress soft scraping sounds filtered down the dim corridor time to move on they arrived at the opposite side of the tower and noticed another gate it was standing open so they reconnoitered carefully before going through there was no sign of greven or anyone else medd examined the gate this locks been forced why would the rathi force their own lock said garnan sivi narrowed her eyes they wouldnt come they burst onto the bridge two rathi soldiers stood guard halfway along to the next tower when sivi garnan and medd appeared the sentries drew swords and blocked the path wait muttered sivi under her breath were still friendly soldiers until somebody tells them otherwise they approached slowly the sentries had the visors down on their helmets at a distance of six paces one of them shouted halt sivi saluted sloppily greetings whats the watchword said the sentry eh the sentry flung out his arm pointing his sword at sivi what is the watchword sivi glanced helplessly at medd and garnan they dropped their hands to their sword hilts tell this stupid soldier the watchword the sentry barked the second sentry replied tant jova tant jova who are you sivi demanded up went the visors kireno shamus there was much back slapping as the rebels were reunited at last sivi cut short the celebration teynel and the rest are dead and our presence is known we heard the alarm shamus said we came to find eladamri but we didnt hes with us kireno said he got himself out and rescued another prisoner from the cells theyre hiding in the map room yonder take me there sivi said i have much to tell him the hall filled with dignitaries court functionaries and idlers the array of banners was still in place but so great was the demand for space the flags were pushed back to the walls by the steadily growing crowd belbe stood on the dais beside the empty throne watching people arrive still in her phyrexian armor she fixed the rococo emblem of the hidden one in the plume holder of her helmet shed been unable to find ertai all morning and a cold clutch of fear gripped her inside she could think of nothing else to do but hide the plasma discharger behind the vacant throne a fresh powerstone glowed within it it was an hour past midday the incoming crowd thinned from beyond the open doors came the tramp of men marching in parade step onlookers scampered out of the way as a column of men in bright steel armor and white mantles four abreast marched straight into the convocation hall it was the corps of sergeants two hundred strong in accordance with tradition their scabbards were empty but belbe knew the two hundred toughest men in the army of rath didnt need swords to intimidate their opposition the leading sergeants led by nasser halted the column at the foot of the throne no orders were shouted but the outer two files of men made quarter turns to the right and left respectively the assembly shrank from the line of sergeants who thus formed a glittering lane through the crowd nasser bowed to belbe excellency my lord crovax is coming he said belbe did not reply she nudged the phyrexian weapon with her toe and felt its reassuring weight a tall figure came walking across the antechamber belbes pulse throbbed hard until she recognized the broad shoulders and towering height of greven ilvec he bowed to her from the doorway then tried to find a way outside the human aisle in the end he pushed his way through the crowd and took a place at the wall on belbes right someone else approached a smaller person this timetoo small to be crovax belbe made out his face at a long distance it was the kor furah garbed in gray leather he moved with sinuous grace between the stern unmoving sergeants he took his place beside greven and never took his eyes off the young emissary the timepiece behind belbe silently flickered through some abstruse phyrexian equation then displayed rathi time one hour one minute past midday she saw him a hundred yards away striding confidently down the central corridor toward the antechamber he was wearing his white ensemble again the one belbe would forever associate with the hostage massacre her recognition must have shown on her face for the entire hall fell hushed long before crovax reached the outer chamber his footsteps were loud against the hard walls belbe licked her lips and tried to swallow when crovax reached the top of the steps nasser raised his right foot and stamped down hard steel and stone rang together as he cried lord crovax crovax shouted the sergeants with the skill of an actor crovax waited at the door until his men stopped cheering then in utter silence he ascended the aisle his goldtrimmed mantle rippling with the wind of his passage greven switched his gaze to crovax but belbe noticed furah was still watching her crovax halted at the foot of the throne your excellency sent for me she nodded slowly crovax turned and faced the hall people of rath she began i the emissary of the overlords the lens of abcaldro the chosen representative of the hidden one greet you all power to the hidden one crovax exclaimed all power to the hidden one answered the crowd since arriving here it has been my mission to find a new governor of rath i was charged by our masters to put the crown on the head of the strongest candidate to insure the rule of rath was given to the most powerful most intelligent and most loyal servant of the hidden one belbe lowered her hand behind the throne feeling for the tip of the plasma discharger she found the smooth prongs but before she could finish her ritual declaration or pick up the weapon a small disturbance broke out at the rear of the hall she stepped away from the throne a small bright object about the size of an apple flew into the room people at the back shrank from it or swiped at it with their hats in neither case did anyone touch it crovax was livid without moving he tried to snare the flying object with flowstone pincers called up from the floor or nearby columns the spiny sphere easily dodged the clumsy claws and the only ones caught by them were unfortunate courtiers near the center of the crowd the object danced down the aisle the sergeants watched it but they were unsure whether to break ranks and seize it or not the ball flew past crovaxs head and hovered in front of belbe a friend of yours asked crovax icily she held out her hand charmed by the playful sphere it ran its soft spikes gently over her palm and she was seized with a desire to have this object and keep it with her always it darted away and belbe ran after it the crowd dissolved in frantic gossip crovax grabbed belbes arm as she passed where do you think youre going i must have it what about the ceremony ill come backi willas soon as i catch this thing he shook her none too gently saying you cant leave until you discharge your duty say the words you stupid little greven interrupted she cannot say anything now my lord shes under a magical compulsion what who dares he must have answered his own question and he shut his mouth releasing belbe he spoke in nassers ear crovax went to the steps leading up to the throne and sat down casually crossing his legs nasser shouted for quiet people of rath he said there will be a minor delay in the ceremony lord crovax has asked that no one leave the hall until the emissary returns to make sure of it the sergeants locked arms to keep people away from the doors belbe ran out chasing the glowing ball nasser spoke hastily to the seated crovax then hurried after her chapter survival the cavernous map room was the scene of a somber reunion sivi broke the melancholy news to eladamri that they had failed to destroy predator and half their force including teynel was lost this was countered by eladamris survival and the addition of takara to their group they shared their simple rations with takara she recovered her strength rapidly after eating and drinking and willingly lent her knowledge of the stronghold and its workings to the rebels cause medd who knew something of the healing arts tended eladamris injuries the rebel leaders left arm was broken at the wrist so medd made splints from seats in the map room bound eladamris arm with them and fitted him with a sling his knee though badly bruised did not seem broken sivi described teynels death to eladamri the man in the torture chamber looked exactly like you o eladamri she said it was only when he began to change that we suspected the truth you say he turned into greven asked takara thoughtfully yes i saw greven ilvec when we first arrived and it was definitely him eladamri studied takara closely what does it mean is greven a shapeshifter not unless hes acquired the gift since ive been imprisoned then who killed teynel takara traced a line on her face with a single finger down her nose across her lip to her chin there is a possibility never mind that garnan said we must get out of here agreed said eladamri takara whats the best way takara she looked up from her frowning daydream what out why we have to go through the citadel the young rebels groaned cant we keep going in this direction said shamus pointing away from the fortress that direction is the mogg warrens takara said a maze of tunnels shafts and mogg nests infested with thousands of ugly badtempered creatures we wouldnt get a hundred yards inside before we were attacked lost or eaten the map room fell quiet at length eladamri said we got in by stealth and disguise so its only natural we leave the same way our disguises are wearing a bit thin sivi said well change them if theyre looking for an elf and five soldiers well become something else my face is known said takara you could become a man sivi suggested takara smiled thinly i dont think i could carry it off as well as you my dear sivi reddened and was about to utter a sharp reply but eladamri cut her off our strength lies in staying together and going as quietly as we can ive never run from a fight in my life but there are some odds a wise warrior doesnt test seven of us against the entire stronghold is not a battle its a prolonged execution they did what they could to change their appearance those in rathi uniforms discarded their mantles and tore them into rags to polish their helmets and breastplates kireno slimmest of the rebels took off his breastplate and gave it to eladamri turning his backplate around to wear on his chest medd wrapped eladamris head in makeshift bandages to obscure his elven features takara watched this with considerable amusement you shouldve been actors she said you look like a touring company of bards sivi reached across garnans waist and drew his knife she advanced on takara holding the blade in a threatening manner call her off eladamri im your valued guide remember liin sivi sivi swung the knife in a wide arc takara tried to block by grabbing sivis knife hand the vec woman was far stronger and takara had to use both hands to hold off the knife sivis free hand darted in she snatched hold of takaras long red ponytail and spun her around by tugging on it sharply with her comrades shouting no no sivi she slashed takaras hair off right where it was tied sivi tossed the heavy hunk of hair on the floor and returned gamans knife takara knelt by her shorn locks why did you do that you need to change your appearance too o takara sivi said without that hair and with a little dirt on your face you can be a charwoman enough said eladamri sharply i wont have this bickering medd was nearest takara she went to him and wordlessly demanded his knife sivi stood back and let the totenvec drop from her hand medd wouldnt give the woman his knife so she took it herself sivi flipped the lethal end of her weapon back and prepared to cast it staring at the vec woman with hollow eyes takara used medds knife to saw off even more of her hair when he saw she didnt mean to attack sivi medd gently took the knife away from takara and offered to even up the horrid haircut your problem takara said to sivi is that you dont go far enough laughing sivi recoiled the totenvec ill try to remember that from being five soldiers an elf and an emaciated woman they were now six reasonably tidy soldiers and a crophaired emaciated woman they cleaned up the map room to hide the fact that theyd been there and left the tower by the upper bridge to avoid the gellerac still loose in the prison there were no new sentries on the bridge so they hurried across dont like it sivi declared takara pushed past her to take the lead they dont expect intruders between the citadel and the mogg warrens she said no ones that crazy no one but us kireno said medd and shamus shrugged at each other and followed her kireno and garnan went next leaving eladamri to shoo sivi along dont know if i like that woman or hate her sivi muttered make up your own mind replied eladamri but until were free of this place dont turn your back on her just inches to go ertai could hardly see his eyelids were so swollen but with his minds magical eye he could see the cube now extended over the edge of the furnace cone in another twenty minutes it would be over his last hope the retriever apparently failed belbe had not come facing death he had the odd thought that he would be contributing to the composition of rath in a very literal way all bodies returned to the soil but his would disintegrate in the furnace and be whirled into the flowstone matrix his component atoms would mingle with the substance of rath pass through the factory and be pumped onto the surface along with billions of pounds of flowstone would there be a little patch of rath that was ertai he wondered if his consciousness would survive if so he hoped crovax would walk over him someday hed be sure to trip him ertai he recalled a book hed read in one of the royal libraries about the death pits of rath past evincars had used the black tarry residue left over from the making of flowstone to fill in gaps in the stronghold cavern as it was poisonous and corrosive some evincars had taken to tossing unwanted prisoners into this muck as a result the book claimed the death pits had achieved a kind of collective sentience melded from the souls of the people who died in it ertai it was a real voice calling his name he managed to open his right eye to a tiny slit belbe the retriever worked after all she looked splendid in her black diamond armor and phyrexian headdress she was tearing at the cube with her hands but the surface was too hard and smooth she could make no impression on it tube he said break the tube she jumped down and found the feeder tube on the back no thicker than her little finger she easily snapped it semiliquid flowstone spilled across the platform until she crimped the tube shut tiny silver spheres danced around her feet she heard feet pounding on the ladder coming up the furnace cone a man in bright armor appearednasser the narrow ledge between her and the ladder was speckled with spinning globules of flowstone still not solidified she guessed the radiance of the energy stream was keeping them liquid longer than normal excellency stay where you are i am to bring you back to the coronation nasser shouted above the crackling beam ill come back once ertai is safe my orders are to bring you back immediately let the boy go no he drew his sword you must it is the will of crovax belbe slid her feet along to avoid stepping on the flowstone globules she struck a fighting pose you cannot compel me nasser saw the flowstone droplets and plainly understood the danger he imitated belbes footsliding and inched close the rathi sergeant jabbed tentatively with his sword tip belbe swatted the flat of the blade away with her bare hands this is senseless nasser declared come back with me and complete the ceremony you can save the boy afterward i do not jump to crovaxs bidding go back and tell him ill return when i choose belbe slid closer and unleashed a kick that caught nasser at the waist he was a strong man and though the blow drove the wind from his chest he kept his feet he sheathed his sword and swung a mailed fist belbe blocked one punch but the other hit her solidly on the cheek she staggered back slipping on bright silver pellets of flowstone only the weight of the cube behind her kept her from falling backward into the furnace had enough nasser asked lowering his hands from a sitting position she sprang three feet in the air driven upward by the power of her fingers and toes alone she spun using the centrifugal force of her turn to make her feet into lethal weapons her left foot clipped the tip of nassers nose her right met his jaw which shattered under the impact his hands flew up and he reeled away flowstone greased his tread and he fell face down on the platform on top of more silver globules with a single deep scream he slid feet first into the furnace belbe wasnt much better off completely out of control she too landed face down but because she was astride the platform she was able to grip the edges with her hands and feet avoiding nassers fate even so her right hand forearm leg and calf were singed by the energy beam pain was nothing she carefully got up brushing away the deadly droplets beneath her ertai you won he said vastly relieved can you get me out of here ill try she crouched beside the cube and blew on the scattered silver pellets one by one the frictionless spheres skittered into the furnace when the platform was clean she put her shoulder against the cube and pushed it back from the edge it was enormously heavy but she shifted it back far enough that it wouldnt easily topple over the ledge belbe rattled down the steps to the control dome there were all sorts of implements there and she found a cabinet of heavy tools meant for dealing with accidental spills or accretion problems belbe grabbed an ax a wedge and a sledgehammer with special flowstone cutting heads she tucked these under her arm and ran back up the steps to ertai belbe put down the hammer and wedge and attacked the cube with the ax using both hands she swung the heavy ax in a wide arc from behind her head it struck the cube with a loud clang cutting an inch deep gouge in the surface belbe swung again and without realizing it let out a hoarse angry yell the cube shifted slightly from the blow she hit it again and again after eight terrific hits the ax fell from her hands her shoulders were dislocated wincing from the unsuppressed pain belbe climbed atop the cube she crawled to ertai now resting his chin on the metal i cant do it she gasped not with these tools im sorry ertai its all right im about gone anyway he whispered dont you dare leave me she said grasping his cheeks in her hands youre my friendmy only friend i wont let you go when he didnt answer belbe tried clawing the stone around his neck hed loosened it a bit with his own magic before fatigue had claimed him so there was just enough room for her to hook her fingers inside and pull her shoulders burned and her nervous system sent out insistent warnings for her to stop need help she jerked around and spied crovax on the furnace cone a halo of residual energy was fading around him hed teleported from the coronation ceremony the intense blue glare of the energy beam made his dark skin look gray and his white garments glowed with reflected radiation dont taunt me crovax belbe said i disposed of your man and i can dispose of you threats excellency and here i came to offer my help she slid off the cube her arms were almost useless hanging at her sides like dead weights release ertai she demanded i will on one condition no conditions release him crovax folded his arms you know i can command the cube to squeeze him to jelly from where i stand he said or i can have it throw itself into the furnace breathing hard fighting the pain belbe glared hatefully at crovax she was beaten as long as she cared what happened to ertai he had her all right name your condition ill dissolve the cube and leave the boy here if you return with me to the ceremony directly and do what you promised to do it was too simple is that all asked belbe thats all of course whether or not the boy survives his close exposure to the energy beam is a matter out of my hands belbe made two fists the effort made her shiver ill bring him with us no said crovax you must leave him here thats my condition say yes now or the offer will be withdrawn she lurched toward him and was gratified to see him step back why do you need me so much she said you have the power to rule rath why are you so set on me proclaiming you evincar stupid question youre the emissary of the overlords what i am i owe to them and i need their stamp of approval i can rule rath as i am now but there are factions within the stronghold that will not recognize me as evincar without your declaration time is short excellency our conjunction with dominaria is just days away i dont have time to suppress rebels woo support from the local population and prepare for the invasion of dominaria all at the same time your announcement that i am the true evincar will save me much effort now come theres no more time for banter my crown awaits free ertai crovax nodded the cube promptly began to melt like a pat of butter on a hot griddle silver rivulets of flowstone spilled off the edge into the furnace in seconds ertais shoulders were visible belbe held onto him as the liquefied flowstone sluiced away she kissed him lightly on the forehead he cracked his swollen eyes ertais voice was a hoarse whisper i heard what he said go ill be all right ill come back for you his head lolled to her shoulder ertai whispered in her ear lets use your portal and escape belbe lowered him carefully to the platform that may not be possible she said we must strong arms pulled her away crovax put an arm around her waist and held her close with her injured arms belbe did not fight i hate you crovax he smiled quite pleasantly good a strong ruler should be hated and feared now that ive achieved the one ill see what i can do about the other before belbe could respond he teleported everything was blanked out in a fierce white flashvision hearing all her senses even belbes hatred was extinguished for the duration of the trip the rebels reentered the citadel easily enough but fifty yards inside the palace they ran smack into a cordon manned by a large contingent of rathi soldiers takara dropped back from her lead position to walk beside eladamri what are you going to do she asked bluff what else can we do he whispered to the others im your captainsay nothing but follow my lead a breastwork of boxes had been erected across the circular junction and at least a hundred soldiers milled around behind the barrier at the rebels approach the commander of the cordon came out and ordered them to stop identify yourselves eladamri stepped out from the ranks of his band we were called to the prison a few hours ago he said something about a breakout we caught this one walking around loose he took takara roughly by the arm and shoved her forward some of lord volraths creatures are free in there too so we had to clear out there are rebels at large disguised as royal army soldiers said the commander see anyone suspicious not a soul there was some kind of trouble in the mogg warrens though we got as far as the map tower and we heard a commotion from there the commander laughed harshly ha if the damned rebels went to mogg town thats the end of them he braced a scrap of parchment against his knee and made some notes using a charcoal stick whats your name soldier he asked drannik captain drannik said eladamri the commander who was only a lieutenant stiffened and threw a salute sorry sir i didnt recognize your rank thats understandable if youre through lieutenant we have to take this wandering prisoner to lord greven let em through the officer shouted and the barricade was opened for the rebels takara regarded eladamri sourly but she allowed herself to be guided through the cordon the rebels crossed the junction to the main corridor crates used to create the bulwark on the other side were pulled apart for them just a moment called the lieutenant for my report captain drannikwhat company are you with gaman flashed the elf four fingers eladamri shook his head theyd been claiming to be from the fourth company all along and the rathi troops were on to that ruse were from the tenth company the soldiers taking down the barrier for them suddenly stopped the lieutenants charcoal stick snapped and fell to the floor his smudged hand went to his sword hilt we are the tenth company ive never seen you before theyre the rebels take them sivi and the men tore at their weapons eladamri pushed the bandage back from his eyes and snatched the rathi sword from his hip the way was open but a hundred rathi soldiers surrounded them sivi parried a sword thrust with her stolen blade the totenvec was hidden behind her breastplate and she needed a few free seconds to get it out medd dashed in font of her to ward off any fresh attacks garnan shamus and kireno formed a triangle in front of eladamri with his injured hands the elf was in no shape to fence with the enemy the rebels held their own for several seconds then sivi got her totenvec unleashed in short order she struck down three rathi soldiers clearing a way to escape takara unarmed and not fighting took eladamris arm and drew him to the unguarded opening in the wall of crates once he was through the other rebels slowly retreated sivi whipped her weapon back and forth forcing the soldiers to maintain their distance when they got too bold the whistling blade of the totenvec caught them in the face throat or leg sivi was the last rebel to leave the cordon medd shouted for her to hurry ill be there she replied one of the crates used to block the way was poised atop another sivi retreated through the gap and buried the tip of her blade in the top of the crate with a two handed pull she toppled the box from its place blocking the way yes sivi flicked her wrist to recover the totenvec she tugged in vain the iron blade was hopelessly pinned underneath the heavy crate soldiers were scrambling over the barricade sivi glanced over her shoulder her friends were almost out of sight she threw down the handle of the totenvec and drew the less familiar sword four soldiers dropped to the floor and came at her she parried the first dodged the second mans attack ran through the third man as he lowered his guard prematurely and received the fourth soldiers sword point directly in the chest it slid off her cuirass but got snagged in her belt piercing her side just above her left hipbone sivi backhanded the man whod wounded her turned and tried to run more men poured over the barricade bleeding profusely and limping sivi managed to make it only a few feet before she was overtaken she cut savagely at her attackers but the sword was wrenched from her hand the iron hilt of another connected solidly with her head and she went down takara and kireno hastened eladamri along theyd changed direction twice to throw off pursuit doubling back to a corridor running upward through the citadel into the palace area as they huddled beneath an archway shaped like a monstrous animals ribcage it became plain liin sivi was not going to catch up with them we should go back medd said moving away from the others stop eladamri said youll be taken as well but sivi hes right said takara shes already dead silence ensued medd slammed a fist against the skeletal arch she stayed behind so we could escape it was her choice garnan said putting a hand on his comrades shoulder we should honor her sacrifice by staying together its my fault said eladamri i thought i was being clever by changing what regiment we came from i didnt know we were in the midst of the tenth company if youre all through taking blame i suggest we move on takara scolded there are a lot of passages to cover and now that weve been discovered theyll flood the corridors with troops hunting for us eladamri agreed the direct routearound the factory and out the grand causewaywas likely to be thick with alert enemy soldiers takara suggested they ascend into the palace and go around the factory at a higher level there are flowstone pipes and braces branching out from the factory to the crater wall takara said we can follow those are there openings to the outside asked shamus oh yes she said theres all sorts of vents blowholes and exhaust channels perforating the crater with heavy hearts the four rebels went on climbing the circular ramp into the palace quarter taking up the rear eladamri turned to takara what do you think our chances are she avoided his eyes few or none frankly its astonishing weve gotten this far there must be something else going on here something vital and diverting eladamri explained what he knew about crovax and his claim to the throne takara actually smiled when she heard this whats amusing he said you speak of this crovax as if his elevation were a foregone conclusion she replied nothing is certain especially in the stronghold above and ahead a clash of steel meant the rebels had encountered another hostile patrol eladamri hurried as hard as his battered legs would take him one whole turn of the ramp revealed the rebels hotly engaged with six palace guards takara hung back flattening herself against the wall eladamri drew his sword and entered the fray slipping in beside shamus and garnan he awkwardly traded cuts with a heavily armored guardsmen shamus landed a telling blow to the mans shoulder who dropped his spear while stooping to retrieve it eladamri rapped him smartly on the face with his sword hilt the guard rolled down the ramp out cold he slid to a stop near takara she tugged the ornate dagger from the guards belt and with both hands shoved it through the unconscious mans throat eladamri saw her do it and when she stood up their eyes met takara shrugged another guard fell the victim of a stop thrust by kireno the remaining four began to withdraw but the rebels kept the pressure on them one man tried to run garnan sprang after him but in his haste he forgot the guards nearest compatriot the rathi guard swung his heavy spear sideways the shaft taking garnan in the gut the dal warrior doubled over shocked by his sudden reverse and the fleeing guard turned and speared him through the back his triumph was as short lived as he was for in the next instant medd drove his sword through the guards chin the other guards were boxed in against the wall and cut down by the hardfighting rebels sweat pouring down his face eladamri knelt with medd beside garnan medd tried to find a pulse and failing to find one shook his head eladamri gently pulled his hand away he was a gallant comrade said the elf now we must hide his body why said the anguished medd we cant let the rathi know were losing numbers we couldnt help them taking sivi but we must disguise our losses so they dont know how few we are they dragged garnan to the top of the ramp and pushed him into a small oval opening takara identified as a warmair duct from the flowstone factory kireno and shamus carefully wiped away all traces of blood between the duct and the place where garnan had fallen where are we eladamri asked below the courtiers apartments takara said over there are the dream halls reduced to just four the rebels hurried on the passages already echoed with the sound of massed soldiers the sweat on eladamris neck began to go cold this was the sort of end he feared mosthunted dying by inches like a beast at bay compared to this even the torture chamber was preferable hed resigned himself to death the moment greven and his moggs had chained him to the wall that he survived was a great victory and for a while he allowed himself to hope they might escape now the coils of rathi power were slowly enveloping them his brave fighters were dying one by one and the end seemed inevitable like an animate hedge of spears a wall of guards blocked the passage in front of them refusing several calls to surrender the rebels retraced their steps to the top of the spiral ramp even as they reached the landing they could see a stream of armed men surging up the ramp from below not good not good medd kept repeating we need another place to gonow said kireno takara pointed the only place left is the dream halls but the doors are sealed and only the evincar can open them eladamri urged his friends to follow if im to die id rather do so in a place called the dream halls than in a common crowded corridor like this shamus the fastest of the group overtook the elf chieftain and reached the enormous double doors first he slammed his shoulder against the right panel and to his surprise the door yielded two hundred soldiers and guards pursued the rebels to the very doors of the dream halls some paused to cast spears at the fleeing party but all missed kireno medd takara and eladamri slipped through the open door when their leader was through the warriors threw themselves against the door when it was shut medd slammed the massive foot bolt into the floor locking it shamus and takara slid a huge horizontal bolt into place as well kireno and medd laughed at their near escape shamus paced back and forth in front of the doors takara slumped to the floor eladamri alone walked deeper into the dream halls the vast dimensions the frowning pilasters decorated with busts of volrathit all somehow reminded him of a strange forest clearing lined with lofty black trees he fingered the wooden fetish hanging from his neck his instincts were right again this would be a good place to die chapter trial she vanished in the wink of an eye even against the constant stabbing brightness of the energy stream the flash of crovaxs departure with belbe was intense ertai felt the displaced air and excess power lap over him a whisper against a roar he rolled onto his hands and knees and began to crawl it was a long way from the edge of death to the theater of the living the crowd did not dare leave the convocation hall restless but also afraid of what might happen to them if they didnt bear witness to the ascension of crovax they remained in the hall sweating and itching in their uncomfortable finery an hour passed then another and a third was underway when a silent stroke of lightning blinded everyone and a hot wind stirred the robes and gowns of the assembled court crovax had returned with belbe in his arms the corps of sergeants who had been at ease snapped to attention courtiers old and young struggled to their feet or smoothed their heavy ceremonial robes without a word of explanation crovax sat down on the throne the emissary of the overlords leaned on the arm of the great chair a hand over her tightly shut eyes excellency were here said crovax do your duty he insisted she inhaled people of rath she began in a small voice i ask you all to forgive my weakness the overlords set me the task of finding a new ruler for rath and with due diligence i tried to find the best candidate i didnt realize until this moment the search was a sham that the choice had already been made by the overlords even as i was being dispatched on my mission to rath say what you came to say said crovax growing impatient belbe faced the audience i regret what i am compelled to say now i give you the new evincar stop crovax leaped to his feet who dares interrupt two figures cleaved through the crowdgreven ilvec and the kor chief furah greven ill have your head in an iron cage for this ill roast your brains over a slow fire and even then i wont let you die save your threats my lord said greven there are more important matters to deal with the sergeants tried to bar his way but greven easily broke their linked arms apart more of the corps broke formation to box the hulking warrior in but crovax ordered them to let greven and the kor through why arent you writhing on the floor crovax demanded your spine should be smoking by now youre not the only one who commands the control rod greven said what you order another can countermand nonsense no one dares interfere with my will furah stepped forward he bowed slightly and smiled showing long feline teeth ive long looked forward to meeting you he said greven has told me of your activities who are you demanded crovax i am the one that chair belongs to you crovax of urborg are a usurper crovax lowered his head the flowstone around furahs feet rippled in a series of tiny points but none grew more than an inch and none came close to harming him the kor chief in his turn spread his hands wide a stream of flowstone balls the size of grevens head burst from the walls and pounded crovax the last and largest ball struck him hard in the chest and drove crovax backward over the arms of the throne belbe leaped aside staring at furah in utter disbelief the crowd jostled and elbowed each other for a better look at this unexpected challenge to crovax those in front regretted their eagerness when the pavement beneath their feet erupted in a hedge of spikes dozens were impaled where they stood and the ring of spikes completely walled off furah and greven from the rest of the room crovax appeared from behind the throne blood from a cut lip flecked his once spotless white tunic you command flowstone well crovax said descending the shallow steps who are you i thought you wouldve guessed by now greven said you lacked imagination for anything but killing but id hoped he was mistaken he glanced at his giant companion grevens a stout fighter but he sometimes lacks discernment not in this case it seems enough chatter explain yourself crovax stared hatefully at the kor man rather than a spoken reply furah began to change his shoulders expanded his legs and arms lengthened his skull widened and his features swelled and disappeared in place of the pale slender kor now stood a man with a sculpted body of impossibly perfect proportions taller by a head than crovax he exuded grace and power his face was carved in such a way as to suggest wisdom and strength the crowd spoke his name volrath belbe was impressed to simpler folk volrath might appear to be a god even as she thought this many of the court went down on their knees and bowed their faces to the floor in abject reverence of their evincar so youve come back crovax said why to reclaim what is mine said volrath you forfeited the throne when you abandoned it i am the new evincar he turned to belbe tell him excellency belbe lowered her eyes and said i am the emissary of the overlords of phyrexia i was sent here to appoint your successor that is no longer necessary i have returned said volrath youve returned to your own death crovax shouted the crowd cheered volrath hail volrath crovax spat out at the crowd the next mouth to hail this pretender will breathe its last you can slaughter them all and it wont change the truth i am volrath i am evincar youre just a corpse that hasnt lain down yet crovax drew sword and dagger and advanced volrath unarmed reached out and drew grevens oversized sword as belbe watched volrath enlarged himself to grevens size stop it stop this at once she cried charging between the wouldbe combatants crovax tried to reach around her and cut at volrath with his blackbladed sword belbe caught the blade with her hand the sharp edge bit to her duralumin bone crovax tried to tug his sword free but she held on volrath whirled grevens broadsword around his head as if it were a light stave with crovax encumbered by belbe he stepped sideways and thrust at the usurper the emissary blocked his attack with her other hand the blunt point of grevens weapon bit deeply into her palm but her metal hand closed tightly and would not let the sword go volrath relaxed letting go of his borrowed blade belbe tossed grevens sword away crovax tried to wrench his weapon free but belbe turned and broke his sword blade in two with a single blow of her bleeding right hand youre a formidable construction but this intervention is illtimed said volrath there cant be two evincars i dont propose there be any more than one belbe said throwing the end of crovaxs blade to the floor the crowd pressed against the fence of flowstone spikes trying to see what was happening belbe her hands bleeding copiously mounted the steps and seated herself on the throne this is my last act as emissary she announced i will sit in judgment of a contest between crovax and volrath and the winner shall be the sole rightful governor of rath crovax hurled his sword hilt to the floor with a clang outrageous he roared i had your word i would be named evincar i also object said volrath more mildly i have been evincar for more years than this usurper has lived why should i submit to anyones judgment or to some ridiculous contest she addressed volrath first it is true you were governor of this world and during your reign the overlords were pleased with your rulership however when you abandoned your post to pursue a personal revenge against weatherlight and her crew you forfeited all credit with our phyrexian masters the hidden one himself directed me to come here and find a replacement frankly i am interpreting my orders liberally to even allow this contest but i am sure our masters would approve she said her head swam and she tucked her bleeding oilstreaked hands into her armpits considerconsider it recognition of your past service that i allow you to clear your record of the stain of desertion it was impossible to read volrath his face was a living mask alive yet no more expressive than the statues in his private quarters volrath pondered her words then bowed your excellency is most generous i accept your proposal crovax was boiling with barely contained rage the floor the walls the ceiling closest to him rippled and writhed under the force of his frustration he turned his fearsome gaze from belbe to volrath and his outward anger subsided i see no problem he said to belbe this pathetic weakling presents no challenge to me i will kill him then i will kill you greven having already picked up his sword stood at belbes right hand for the duration of the contest i will defend the emissary so that no unfair advantage will be gained by threatening her he said so saying he offered her a scrap of homespun bandanna she regarded grevens gift blankly until he tore the cloth in two and indicated she should use it to bind the wounds on her hands the doors of the convocation hall were opened and the rearmost spectators were pushed out of the room by the corps of sergeants an open oval space was cleared of carpet flags and bystanders crovaxs sergeants withdrew in a body to the right wall the fence of flowstone spikes was dissolved and those unlucky people slain by crovaxs initial fury were quickly removed steel swords and shields of identical size and length were taken from two palace guards and provided to the combatants volrath pulled on a pair of scalemail gauntlets seeing this crovax did the same he dropped the goldedged mantle from his shoulders neither man wore any other armor volrath walked off a pace or two and started stretching and flexing his artfully carved muscles crovax called for wine and drank a goblet dry watching his opponent preen before the crowd crovax dropped his goblet time is short lets begin i agree what are the rules said volrath belbe folded her bandaged hands in her lap theres only one rulewin crovax promptly lashed out with a wide sideways cut volrath threw himself back and brought up his shield sparks flew as the blade met the polished buckler crovax bored in slashing and thrusting and using his shield to slam against volraths volrath grew visibly taller even as belbe watched he moved so fast most people in the hall couldnt see his true motion but belbes enhanced eyes followed every move volraths arm elongated as he thrust it forward the tip slid off the top of crovaxs shield and kept going an ordinary fighter would have run out of arm by then but volraths reach was preternatural crovax realized his danger and turned away just as the leading edge of volraths thrust clipped his left ear he called on the floor to trip volrath but the flowstone waves broke over the former evincars ankles like water and didnt impede him in turn volrath summoned another barrage of flowstone balls crovax was expecting them instead of liquefying them like his opponent he batted them away with forceful commands the skullsized projectiles mowed down five onlookers volrath retracted his arm to more normal proportions and advanced he feigned an overhand attack but again with amazing swiftness switched the line of his cut to an underhand thrust crovax blocked with his shield and struck out with his booted right foot the hobnails connected with volraths leg below the knee youre fast crovax said grinning but you dont have a true killers instinct ive killed more people in one year as evincar than you have in your entire life barbarian volrath retorted what you call killer instinct is merely a lust for death i am above such feelings they traded four hard cuts that left both their blades deeply nicked for the first time belbe felt volrath was concerned he hadnt expected crovax to last this long emboldened crovax lowered his head and shouted sharply he jabbed at his opponents legs and stomach volrath gave ground grudgingly backing up two steps advancing one with a counterthrust then backing up two more behind crovax the floor humped up in a series of rounded semicircles crovax apparently didnt notice greven nodded approvingly crovaxs sword tip bounced off volraths shield the latter executed a blinding pirouette his blade coming edgeon at the side of crovaxs neck he ducked and his heel caught on the nearest hump with an expression of utter surprise crovax fell volrath let out a triumphant laugh and leaped he landed astride the fallen crovax up went the bright sword crovax vanished in a flare of white light volraths blade went three inches into the floor the flowstone softened allowing him to recover and his partisans in the crowd shouted warnings he turned his head and saw crovax materialize four feet in the air directly behind him there was no time to parry or dodge instead volrath shrank he contracted his body by a fifth crovaxs sword raked down volraths back laying open his skin glistening oil spattered across the front of crovaxs white tunic shrinking saved volraths life but he had a painful wound from his left shoulder blade to his right hip his dropped his hands to the floor and staggered forward on them grinning widely crovax tried trampling his foe into the floor flowstone splashed and flew as the men fought for control volrath rolled on his back crovax tried to overrun him and got a foot planted on his chest the finely proportioned muscles in volraths leg uncoiled hurling crovax into the air his feet didnt touch the ground for five yards then he slammed into the tightly packed crowd he was up in a flash hacking and slashing at anyone within reach of his blade courtiers and soldiers alike climbed over each other to get out of his way but he slew at least ten before it became inconvenient to chase the others belbe knew this wasnt just pointless homicide crovax derived new strength from the death of others he was refreshing himself in the midst of a duel by slaughtering innocent onlookers his back wet with glistening oil volrath went to the foot of the throne belbe could smell the crisp electric odor of the fluid volraths broad shoulders heaved he looked to greven ilvec standing with sword drawn at belbes side how am i doing he asked wryly ertai crawled all the way from the furnace mouth to the flowhot lifts in the outer environs of the palace except for occasional patrols he saw no one guards marched past him without stopping the men idly watching his painful progress he reached the lifts and fell heavily into the closest one it had been far too long since his last infusion without the dark energy to suppress them his old injuries were slowly emerging again the laboratory was a long way away despite his wounds old and new his first thought was to find belbe her life hung in the balancehe was certain crovax would kill her once hed been proclaimed evincar convocation hall he said to the lift the fleshstone flaps closed and the flowbot sank through the floor the lift jerked to a stop when the flaps lowered he saw the antechamber was jammed with people everyone was craning their heads toward the open doors of the hall distantly he heard the sounds of combat punctuated by shouts ertai grasped the leathery hide of the lift and dragged himself to his feet if this was to be his last act he wanted to enter standing and not on his knees he wormed his way through the mass of gawkers some shrank from his fearful swollen visage and let him pass others regarded him with pity and stepped aside when ertai reached the inner edge of the crowd the closely packed ranks of guards and courtiers parted to reveal a wan and worried belbe seated on the throne and guarded by the imposing greven ilvec she was talking to another tall muscular fellow with an improbably handsome facevolrath ertai recognized him from the statues around the stronghold he had an awful wound across his back the flesh exposed was gray not red ertai raised a hand in greeting heedless of the danger belbe pushed past the tall wounded swordsman and met the young sorcerer at the edge of the crowd have i missed much he whispered she lowered him to the floor you shouldnt have come it isnt safe here where is one safe on rath distracted volrath didnt see pinchers form out of the flowstone steps behind him one pierced his right calf he immediately banished them and enraged raised a wall of flowstone six feet high and one inch thick he shouted so loudly the floor trembled and the wall broke into a dense cloud of small pellets volrath flung his hands wide and the mass of pellets hurled themselves at crovax up came the shield with a sound like a thousand nails punching through a hundred tin plates the pellets reduced crovaxs shield to a sieve his tunic was shredded and a score of peasized pellets buried themselves in his face scored and blasted crovax threw down his ruined shield he crossed his forearms fists tightly clenched a growl rose from his throat it began low and guttural but grew louder and stronger as he focused his rage and pain one by one the flowstone pellets worked themselves out of his body falling at his feet at a steady rate soon the floor around him was covered with hundreds of pellets ertai tried to size up the situation volrath was an unknown quantity to him hed seen the exevincars quarters heard commentary from people in the citadel who knew him he was cruel ruthless shrewd and a man of unusual appetites compared to him crovax was a machinesoulless utterly devoid of guilt or feelings of humanity volrath would expect to win because of his superior skills crovax thought he could prevail through brute force and a willingness to do anything to win the battle would go on and on until sheer survival determined a winner with his ability to renew himself with the lives of others crovax would ultimately win nothing ertai could do would help volrath once the former evincar was out of the way retribution would inevitably fall on everyone else crovaxs twohanded stroke tore the shield from volraths grasp the dented buckler caromed off the wall both fighters were reduced to swords alone volrath assumed a sideways stance the pose of a fencer rather than an infantry soldier crovax circled warily trading occasional cuts and jabs as he orbited outside of volraths reach he glanced at ertai and betrayed surprise as seeing the young sorcerer alive volrath sidled forward a step when crovaxs attention strayed his arm lengthened by two inches and he carefully bent his elbow to hide the new growth volrath started his lunge his arm straightened and with the velocity of a striking viper he drove his blade at the junction of crovaxs right arm and chest crovaxs eyes widened in alarm he tried to backpedal out of danger but his response was too slow the nicked dented blade flew at him he brought his own sword up in a desperation parry but the impetus of volraths lunge bore his hilt back against his own face thirty inches of tempered steel slid along crovaxs arm volraths lunge had succeeded and the startled usurper seemed paralyzed by the realization of his imminent defeat time stretched out the normal yellow gleam of the hall lanterns on the bright steel blade became purplish volraths triumphant face fell an unknown force was playing down the length of his onrushing blade someone was tampering with the fight using oldfashioned magic to deflect his weapon a horrified look on his face volrath watched the tip of his sword fall an inch two inches until it passed under crovaxs arm everything came together with a crash volrath and crovax collided chest to chest volraths sword swinging uselessly behind crovaxs back crovaxs own blade was bent backward over his shoulder by the force of volraths attack he twisted dumping the overbalanced volrath and at the same time punching him hard in the face with his free hand volrath hit the floor his sword bounced free and skittered away into the crowd crovax threw himself on volraths back he hooked his left arm around the mans chin and drew his head back arching volraths back as if it were a longbow the ragged edge of his sword came down to slice volraths taut throat volrath blocked the blade with his mailed hand the wall of courtiers and soldiers dissolved to reveal a captain of the palace guard backed by a phalanx of his men the captains face was streaked with blood my lords the rebels he cried theyve barricaded themselves in the dream halls belbe was on her feet she flung a hand at the straining pair of fighters hold they continued to struggle she appealed to greven the vec warrior did not move declare a winner or stand aside excellency he said you heard the captain she said we must defend the citadel that is the job of the evincar it all came down to this moment belbe looked from face to face searching for an answer greven was impassive ertai smiled weakly then sagged to the black pavement courtiers avoided her soldiers pretended to be busy readying themselves to fight the rebels finally she looked down at crovax he had volrath down his head locked and his throat vulnerable only four mailed fingers prevented him from cutting volraths jugular do your duty crovax gasped behold belbe cried behold the evincar of rath crovax the sergeants broke ranks and shouted their masters name most of the assembled notables joined in though a good number quietly fled let him up belbe said above the roar of the crowd he must die crovax replied hes lost his life is forfeit but your first duty is to quell the rebels in your own fortress crovax agreed he ordered his men to secure the former evincar and place him under close guard wrap him in chains of good steel crovax said hang him by his feet so that no part of his body touches the structure of the citadel seat ten men with bare swords around him if the floor so much as trembles strike off his head volrath was buried under a pile of sergeants he didnt resist but they pressed him hard to the floor and wound chains around his legs his hands were wrenched behind his back and chained together a hood was cinched over his head by the time volrath was securely bound the hall was almost empty guards and soldiers under grevens command had already marched off the sergeants bore volrath away crovax turned to belbe excellency this is a great day he dropped his sword and enfolded her roughly in his arms though she resisted crovax kissed her hard smearing his sweat on her face as she stained him with glistening oil still oozing from her injured hands alone lying on the floor a few feet away ertai smiled chapter reunion garnan pressed his ear to the door its quiet out there he whispered shamus listened too they didnt just go away theyre there takara said flatly a company was left to watch the door while the rest retrieve a battering ram shamus blinked battering ram do you think theyll try to starve us out medd filled the relatively quiet moment by inspecting eladamris injuries he dabbed salve on his burns and rewrapped them in strips of cloth torn from their army cloaks eladamri was sitting on the cold black floor leaning against one of volraths monumental pilasters are you in much pain brother asked medd no the burns are superficial i fear some of your nails are lost and wont grow back eladamri nodded medd tied off the last bandage and set the elfs arm gently into a sling do you think well leave here alive eladamri opened his eyes i dont know are you frightened yes im not live or die ive made up my mind not to fall into their hands again i do have regrets though so many unfinished tasks kireno returned from reconnoitering the dream halls everyone but shamus gathered around eladamri to hear the vec warriors scouting report this place is huge but its basically one big room kireno said at the far end is a transom all glass there dont seem to be any other doors what can you see from the transom the windows look down upon the prison and map tower o eladamri could we climb down kireno demolished his idea the citadel is cut away under the dream halls so theres no way to climb down it would require hundreds of feet of rope just to reach the bridge to the prison tower we just left to reach the floor of the crater would take thousands of feet what about up asked medd takara snorted climb hundreds of feet up the outside of the citadel are you mad she shook her cropped head at the rebels leader how is he going to climb any distance up or down with those ruined hands youve made your point eladamri said do you have any useful suggestions takara her eyes glistened write your wills from the doors shamus called people cominglots of them the rebels rushed to the doors weapons drawn takara slumped to the floor in the corner and covered her face with her hands the tramp of many feet was plain even through the massive panels muffled shouts were heard and the floor vibrated under their feet stand back eladamri advised his men he had hardly said so when a tremendous boom reverberated through the hall the doors shook but remained solidly closed the impact was repeated again and again the noise was punishing if the doors dont break the noise will break us medd shouted after many hits the battering ceased more muffled voices and the rebels could hear men scurrying away from the door take cover fire sprayed through the narrow space under the door panels and through the gaps at the top and sides for a few terrifying seconds the rebels waited to see if the tall doors would topple from their hinges admitting a horde of rathi soldiers the doors stood firm ha kireno said slapping a thick black panel thats workmanship for you i guess volrath didnt want anyone to disturb him in his sanctum said eladamri buoyed by the doors resistance the rebels prepared for a siege medd got out his whetstone and sharpened their swords and knives kireno departed on another reconnaissance this time searching for hidden doors or secret passages shamus continued his watch eladamri rummaged through his garments he found a slip of ragged paper and a blunt charcoal stick once the property of the rathi soldier whose uniform this had been he sat down on the floor and began to write in slow carefully formed letters shamus asked him what he was doing following takaras advice he said im writing my will crovax left to lead the attack on the cornered rebels but belbe had to see to ertai before she could join the rathi forces outside the dream halls she managed to round up four terrified servants and ordered them to carry ertai to volraths laboratory the men were frightened to be abroad on their own the whole citadel was in an uproar and the air was rife with tales of cut throats and stabs in the back it was only by considerable bullying that belbe was able to get them to carry ertai to the infuser she left him on his makeshift stretcher these men will get you to the laboratory she told him they know what will happen to them if they fail the bearers shifted nervously until belbe frowned them into stillness i will go to the rebels i must speak to eladamri again he took her hand and how are you he said fingering her bandaged palm i feel no pain youre a liar belbe slipped her hand free when your treatment is done find someplace quiet to rest crovax will come looking for you speaking of that ertai urged her to come closer belbe knelt beside the stretcher we must both escape you have the means shh she covered his mouth with her hand when the time comes the door will open but there is a part i must play here she dismissed the servants and hurried to the dream halls as she neared the entrance she found the corridors clogged with tense eager troops what seemed like the entire garrison was crowded into the outlying passages and it took some time for her to work her way through the mass of heavilyarmed soldiers by the time belbe reached the foyer she found greven supervising the palace guards in setting up a battering ram an iron double aframe had been brought in and a massive bronzeheaded ram hung by chains from the frame kneeling beside greven was a captured rebel soldier a young vec with his arms pinioned behind his back bleeding from untended side and scalp wounds crovax still in his battlesoiled white outfit stood nearby with a contingent of fifty guards ready to storm the dream halls once the doors were breached at the count of three the guards swung the battering ram back then slammed it against the black doors the ram bounced off and the rebound threw the battering crew to the floor greven ground his teeth in disgust again he bellowed twenty stout men grasped the handles on the ram and drew it back prepared for the shock this time none of them fell down but the ram made just as little impression on the door as last time keep going while the guards vainly pounded belbe made her way to grevens side in between the dull booming of the ram she asked him what are the doors made of some metal of volraths making flowstone no excellency the lock mechanism is made of flowstone but the rebels have barred the doors from the inside crovax tried to will the doors open but they are impervious to his commands twentysix fruitless blows were struck then greven ordered the winded guardsmen to stand down a fresh team formed to take their place but crovax had a different idea would your excellency have a go he said im not strong enough to batter down those doors no he said but youre strong enough to use this a soldier passed him the phyrexian plasma discharger shed hidden behind the throne he smiled ironically when she took the weapon from him belbe cradled the heavy gun in her arms crovax fixed her with a stare it wont work on me you know i can absorb the energy of its blast thats how i can handle the powerstones barehanded belbe swung around and fired the discharger at the doors no one was ready and the resulting explosion scattered troops in all directions when the smoke cleared the doors were not even marred crovax seemed impressed a very useful substance he said i wonder if volrath could be persuaded to share the secret of its composition belbe tossed the discharger to him she turned to greven i want you to withdraw your men clear an area ten yards out from the doors leave the rebel prisoner with me he didnt question why she wanted this he simply obeyed and ordered the soldiers back to the mouths of the converging corridors the battering ram was dragged clear and abandoned belbe helped the semiconscious vec warrior to stand a hard knock on the head had not only laid open his scalp it dulled his wits whats your name she asked sivi liin sivi isnt that a female name she raised her head slightly and peered at belbe youre the first one to notice thats all right liin sivi youll soon be reunited with your friends belbe ushered the dazed rebel fighter to crovax your highness she said using his title for the first time take your storming squad back too why i mean to persuade the rebels to come out she said ill give them their wounded comrade as a token of trust but they wont budge if they see your men poised to strike you no longer command here belbe smoothed the hair back from her face her arms felt leaden her fingers were numb her healing capacity was reacting poorly to her many accumulated wounds do this crovax it will cost you nothing theres no way out of the dream halls as you well know this vec woman will be just as much a prisoner inside as she is out here if i can talk the rebels out it will save lives and trouble he looked past her lives are cheap fodder he said but it would be a shame to ruin those fine doors before i can ask volrath how they were made all right belbe he pointedly dropped her title you have my leave to try the storming squad faced about and marched back to the line of flowbot lifts crovax followed the discharger hanging loosely from one hand belbe and sivi approached the imposing black doors cautiously belbe rapped quietly on an ornate panel on the other side shamus flinched at the unexpectedly civil knock brother he hissed someones knocking at the door eladamri shoved the paper scrap in his shirt he stood close to the panel whos there belbe the emissary he flushed with sudden emotion what do you want youre trapped in there theres no way out ive come to help you medd shamus and eladamri exchanged startled expressions takara roused herself from her gloom and quietly joined the group at the door why should you help us eladamri questioned wherever i come from im flesh like you i no longer believe in my masters goals the people of rath deserve to live in freedom eladamri clutched shamuss arm find kireno he hissed get him here at once shamus dashed away can you hear me did you hear what i said i heard you said the elf what proof do you offer of your sincerity ive convinced greven and crovax to withdraw their men from the door i have one of your comrades with me she says her name is sivi if you open the door only the two of us will enter there followed a frantic argument among medd takara and eladamri if it meant saving liin sivi the dal warrior wanted to take the chance the emissary was telling the truth takara would have none of it and eladamri said nothing but brooded over the face he knew was on the other side of the door how will you save us eladamri asked once the arguments cooled if youre relying on safe conduct grants by greven and crovax forget it were not trusting our lives to such faithless villains greven and crovax know nothing of what im doing let me in and ill explain the rebel fighters came running to eladamri he hastily explained the situation do you trust this woman asked kireno no but i intend to face her theres something about her you should know shes my daughter you see or was how did this happen asked takara i dont know its some awful ploy of volraths i believe eladamri belbe called time is short let me in he grasped the floor bolt stand ready there may be treachery the door opened a few inches ten yards away crovax leveled the discharger hed discovered that belbes story about it not firing for anyone but her was a lie his earlier failure was simply a case of not knowing what button to push hed remedied his ignorance since then eladamris eye met belbes send in sivi belbe steadied the vec warrior and eased her into the gap now give me your hand he said belbe raised her right hand crovax squinted through the sight pins at the back of belbes skull greven saw the evincar raise the weapon and take aim at her stop cried the warrior in one smooth motion eladamri jerked belbe through she stumbled which was fortunate in the next second a searing blast of plasma hit the door the substance burst with a loud crackle and glowing fragments showered in all directions yelling with alarm medd and kireno shoved the door shut and shamus snapped the bolts back in place belbe stumbled against eladamri but instead of catching her he tripped her with his outstretched foot she landed hard on her belly i knew thered be treachery eladamri said coldly your marksman missed me belbe got up and the elf backhanded her she fell again eladamri was about to repeat the blow when takara stayed his hand she may have no other value than as a hostage said takara but shes no use at all dead belbe stood and shouted why do you hate me so is it because i represent the overlords whom you fight i dont know your overlords said eladamri all i know is this world and the evil men who rule it those men decreed my family should be extinguished i am the only one of my line who still lives perhaps you really dont know but you were once my daughter her name was avila she was killed on the orders of volrath and her body stolen that was five weeks ago how long have you been here ive been on rath three weeks before that on phyrexia two weeks belbe looked at her hands touched her own face why would the overlords command volrath to do such a thing its very plain by murdering my child they hoped to terrorize me into submission if that failed they counted on me becoming unmanned by the sight of my dear daughter commanding the enemy host you are the instrument of our study the words of abcaldro filled her with sudden loathing i came to help you she said volrath returned without warning he fought crovax and lost crovax is now evincar and as long as he reigns no one is safefriend foe ally or neutral tell them about dominaria said takara tell them whats going to happen when this world and that one join belbe backed away from the rebels you know about the invasion lady takara was kind enough to explain it to us eladamri said i notice you didnt mention it ive taken care of that it wont happen so long as i remain on rath the elf drew his sword his heart was pounding so loudly he thought they must be able to hear it the enemy with his daughters face edged away he could not bear to see her like this her mind empty of memories her face mockingly free of a daughters love that she wore the colors of his blood foes the livery of her own murderers was the most unendurable fact of all wait o eladamri kireno pleaded trying to hold him back he ignored him and raised his sword belbe turned and ran thirty yards down the concourse she stopped and faced the oncoming elf his attack was clumsy and she easily avoided it belbe grasped eladamri by his cuirass and threw him to the floor she planted her foot on the wrist of his sword hand and plucked the weapon from his fingers in one deft motion she snapped the blade over her knee and let the pieces clatter to the floor the time for swords is past she said im not your child eladamri its true i was made in the workshops of phyrexia i dont doubt i was made to resemble your lost child it would suit my masters purpose perfectly to use your loved ones face against you but i had no choice in the matter no more than you chose the face you were born with ive come here to undo the cause for which i was created i can get you out of here safely if you want thats all im offering he sat up stiffly on what conditions no conditions the rest of the rebels including sivi leaning on medds shoulder surrounded them and how do you propose to get us out of here takara asked her voice dripping with venom i have an emergency exit let me show you she slipped by kireno and takara and made her way to the fourth pilaster on the left side of the hall the floor was littered with volraths shattered dreams and belbes feet crushed the brittle shards to dust at the base of the halfcolumn was a row of decorative studs she pressed the third one from the left side and a panel popped open revealing a deep recess four feet high they crowded around two large boxes were stowed inside belbe dragged them out the tall metal carton she tore open with her bare hands exposing an intricately machined device three and a half feet tall and about ten inches thick it had a square base tall cylindrical sides ribbed with metal tubing and a transparent dome on top a weapon asked kireno takaras eyes shone no she said smiling its a portal device youve seen one before belbe said my father has used them in times past this is quite a small one belbe admitted it was it was provided to me for special purposes only if any of weatherlights crew or their equipment came into my hands i was supposed to send them to phyrexia for closer examination the other box contained a single powerstone belbe inserted it into the base of the unit explaining it had just enough power to transmit four hundred pounds of material to another plane four hundred pounds medd protested all of us together weigh a lot more than that im not going belbe explained as for the rest of you youll have to work out your own arrangements she took out the portal control unit from her belt and clicked the activator the dome atop the portal device flickered to life stand back she said it will throw the doorway across this axis the rebels watched in awe as the machine began to drone the air between them and the far end of the dream halls shimmered and thickened gradually losing its normal transparency a square seven feet high slowly formed out of gray mist and flashes of light like lightning in a fogbank medd went around the edge of the square it was as thin as paper and opaque from both sides do we go now asked kireno it hasnt reached travel potential yet belbe said it may take another quarter hour before the door is open then i have to calibrate the transmitter what she smiled choose your destination skyshroud medd said send us to the eye of korai belbe fiddled with the tiny dials on her control unit ripples of color sprayed across the gray square you must understand she said emphatically a portal is a transplanar connection only i cannot send you elsewhere on rath youll be going to another planeanother world she let this astonishing revelation sink in sivi roused herself will we ever be able to come back to rath i dont know what i do know is if you remain here youll die and the cause youve fought for will suffer a terrible loss whatever happens eladamri must go medd said are we agreed on that sivi kireno and shamus solemnly concurred takara chewed her lip and said nothing ill never be able to live with myself if i leave anyone behind said the elf gravely is there no other choice the unit will transmit four hundred pounds no more belbe said anything exceeding the power limit will not go through the consequences for a living being would be disastrous you mean a person might arrive without their legs or head asked shamus exactly so belbe finished her power adjustments the portal square was now brilliant blue free of ripples or fog she announced the portal was stable and all she needed was a destination to align it with a long pause ensued finally eladamri said dominaria takaras eyes widened in surprise why there you told us our ancestors came from there that means there are people there like us including i presume elves dominaria is the target of phyrexian aggression and people there should be warned ill see to it they know whats coming he faced the azure square a strange woman told me things not long ago things i didnt understand prophecies i would be the savior of a world id never been to a door would be offered to me and i must enter it i believe the oracle envec saw me going to dominaria so i will go belbe set the coordinates for raths parallel world the patient blue door began to flash and flicker again as the barrier between the planes was subverted ertai jumped up from the infuser hed dialed in a double dose of dark energy and got off the crystal platform bursting with newfound vigor hed had no time to warn the four servants whod brought him to the laboratory a silent wave of energy washed over them transmuting them in minutes they were now flapping around the room on fleshy wings or clinging to the walls with multiple pairs of legs as he lay on the infuser and the dark glow flooded his anguished mind the truth had burst upon him like a bolt from belbes plasma discharger shed hidden her portal device in the dream halls it was the perfect place to hide it the ordinary inhabitants of the citadel never went there as they feared volrath even in his absence crovax thought the halls were a vain empty monument so he never deigned to go there either by luck or fate the rebels had chosen this room for their last standand belbe was going in to talk to eladamri he had the good fortune to encounter greven first crovax might have slain him on sight dread lord he said actually grasping the fearsome warrior by his broad shoulders has belbe gone into the dream halls yet some time ago its been very quiet since ertai was frantic he could feel the weight of death or permanent exile on rath settling over his shoulders fear and perhaps too much decadent energy warped his morals and loosened his tongue we must do something dread lord he said she has a portal device in there which i need to use was the part he dared not say out loud greven shoved him away youd better not be lying boy why would i lie we have to stop her greven roused his idle troops and had them stand to arms come he said taking ertai roughly by the collar we must report this to the evincar the stir among the soldiers spread ahead of greven and by the time he found crovax sitting in an elaborate chair drawn from the flowstone the new evincar of rath knew something was amiss his expression hardened when he saw ertai whats this corpse doing here he said your highness the emissary brought a portal device with her from phyrexia according to the boy she hid it in the dream halls explained greven crovax bolted from the chair which subsided into the floor a portal are you sure she told me so when we i believe her ertai replied his face burning would she use it to help eladamri crovax stopped himself it doesnt matter everyone in that room is hereby condemned to death he announced lets put an end to this game the chosen storming squad fell in step behind crovax greven and ertai the evincar strode to within a dozen paces of the locked doors will you summon them to surrender said ertai why should i theyre dead as of this moment crovax handed the plasma discharger to a guardsman then pressed his palms together in an awful parody of prayer he slowly raised his hands spreading them wider as they rose a large hump appeared in the floor soldiers fell back as the cubic shape mounted higher so much of the floor was drawn into the rising shape that the floor joists appeared as if shoals around the edges of the room the summoned form took on the shape of a truncated pyramid fifteen feet high and twelve feet wide at the base whats he ertais question was cut off when the pyramid heaved itself forward and slammed against the doors the entire citadel quaked from the shock the sudden impact startled the rebels crovax is tired of waiting eladamri said is the portal ready belbe made some hasty calculations no its not fixed on the destination yet the massive ram hit the doors again loose dream catching machinery rained down and for the first time the huge doors showed damage the center was dented inward eight inches and the gap at the top and bottom was admitting more of the bright light from outside how much longer takara asked anxiously i dont know exactlythe units never been used before it has no settings to compare to eladamri grabbed belbe by the hair and jerked her head back hurry he said if i find out youre delaying youre delaying me now she said he released her the remaining rebel fighters placed themselves between the doors and the portal with drawn swords sivi tried to take her place beside medd but he gently pushed her away im still good enough to fight with you she said her words were slurred and her movements shaky youve had a hard knock on the head sivi medd replied you can hardly stand go with eladamri he needs someone to protect him i wont leave you here to die a third powerful impact caused more debris to shower down from the heights of the dream halls the heavy shocks caused the portal unit to topple over belbe let out a yelp of horror she and takara returned the device upright takara was concerned is it damaged belbe ran the test commands on two sides of her control unit all the responses were normal no but wed better brace it another fall could ruin everything outside crovax was reeling the battle with volrath had depleted his strength and the effort required to raise and move several tons of flowstone strained him to his limits he gathered his power for a fourth attack but he couldnt finish it the giant battering ram froze inches from the doors when crovax passed out he pitched face down on the floor no one attempted to catch him greven closed the visor on his helmet tenth company to the right sixth company on the left at the double charge hurrahing the soldiers swarmed against the doors the feral shouting from the storming troops chilled belbes artificial blood she tapped in the final coordinates and the transplanar unit whined loudly the portal locked onto a destination and an image formed filling the square top to bottom side to side weeping silently takara walked toward the portal is that it is that dominaria the scene through the portal was of a verdant plain green in the lush growth of summer a few trees dotted the rolling savanna the sky was bluenot so blue as the open portal but a warm living shade never seen in raths gray skies eladamri was transfixed by the beauty of the view is that it avila belbe didnt notice what he called her it should be four hundred men pushed and pounded on the sagging doors medd kireno and shamus clasped hands the interlaced hinges of the righthand door began to squeal as the metal was torn apart takara could stand it no longer she pushed eladamri aside and ran at the portal where she touched it the image distorted in concentric ripples like a pool of water after a pebble falls in then she was gone half a second later belbe saw takaras back as she ran through the chest high grass away from the open portal away from rath go eladamri belbe said not yet i have something for you what the upper hinge gave way and crashed to the floor the right hand door slowly fell twisting the lower hinge as it went soldiers and guards fired by their success didnt wait for the door to fall but clambered over it kireno shouted a vec war cry and ran at them shamus followed leaving medd alone to ward off attackers trying to reach the portal kireno stabbed two soldiers before they could leap clear of the door but more poured over the sides and he was soon enveloped in hostile blades he traded cuts with foes on two fronts for several breathtaking seconds then he was cut down from behind a swarm of rathi soldiers trampled the fallen rebel and overran shamus the nimble young dal drew off at least forty guards as he retreated to the wall he fought on killing two and wounding four before the press became too great he was impaled on no less than six swords at once and pinned to the wall the soldiers drew back leaving shamus dead at the base of one of volraths pilasters eladamri hurry belbe cried she wasnt armed but she was prepared to use her considerable skills to safeguard his departure she watched the elf remove the wooden fetish from around his neck it was a knobby little carving of a sprite an ancestral spirit revered by elderly elves eladamri wasnt religious the fetish had another purpose he snapped the figures waist the fetish was hollow inside the cavity was a small glass vial closed with a cut glass plug and sealed with wax it was the vial left in avilas bed the night she died medd shouted several words to sivt who was also unarmed but ready to defend the portal she watched as medd was engulfed in a storm of swords and shields he died as she looked on but he bought his leader a few more precious seconds belbe backed away from the melee until she bumped into eladamri what are you waiting for she cried go will you go after you avila this time she heard him she looked at him with genuine pity i cant go she said he looked quite calm as he pulled the plug from the vial and flung the contents at her there were only a few drops of death elixir in it most of it hit her armor harmlessly but a single droplet landed on her cheek belbes hearing instantly failed her vision blurred and when she wiped her eyes with her hands she smeared the tiny droplet across her face her muscles locked and searing pain shot through her entrails an ordinary person would have died the moment the elixir touched her but belbes powerful systems had more resistance she was doomed and she knew it one by one her bodily functions folded up ceasing to work she was already deaf her vision was contracting to a narrow point sivi lurched into her line of sight and belbe saw eladamri push her backward into the portal the bucolic scene of another world rippled then settled to show sivi on her back in the tall grass she stared back through the portal at the two elves belbes knees failed she slumped to the floor facing the portal she shivered violently as her borrowed life fought with the toxin her lips parted to speak but no sound came out for the peace of my soul and yours this had to be eladamri said with a final knowing nod he stepped through the waiting portal greven and his soldiers had reached the transplanar device one zealous guard tried to follow eladamri by jumping into the portal but there was not enough energy left to effect his transfer sixty pounds of the man landed in the grass beside sivi head shoulders one arm helmet part of a breastplate the rest of him a singed stump fell back on the floor of the dream halls its power exhausted the portal shut down the pristine image of the plain where takara eladamri and sivi had escaped faded into murky gray mist belbe pale as death and with tears streaming down her face could just make out the words on eladamris lips farewell avila coda memorial when order was restored to the dream halls greven had his victorious soldiers line up by companies facing each other there they stood at attention until crovax recovered from his faint entered the hall the dead rebels were laid out for his inspection crovax gave them a cursory glance their souls were long departed and so were not available to him ertai skulked on crovaxs heels anxiously searching for belbe and the portal device looking past the evincar he saw belbe kneeling on the floor a few yards away her head slumped to her chest disdaining the evincars displeasure he ran ahead of him belbe belbe she didnt move and didnt answer he touched the back of her neck and immediately knew why her skin was cold as ice belbe he knelt beside her her eyes were closed her cheeks still wet ertai picked up her hand her fingertips were already turning black dead is she asked crovax ertai nodded dumbly how was it done i dont see a wound i didnt think a phyrexian construct could be killed so easily ertai blinked through his own tears and spotted a tiny glass vial on the floor seamed with cracks and empty it smelled like newly mown hay crovax took the vial from his hand i see ill have this analyzed potent poisons are useful things to have the evincar ordered belbes body removed along with what remained of the portal machinery greven stood by awaiting his new masters pleasure eladamri is gone greven said where asked crovax no one survived to tell us your highness this device of the emissarys may provide information he placed belbes portal control in crovaxs hand as soon as crovax had the vital device greven was stricken with pounding waves of unimaginable pain he bellowed and fell at crovaxs feet this is just the beginning he said i have years of pain in store for you you impeded me thwarted me aided my enemy and on top of all that allowed the archrebel to escape greven flailed helplessly retching and beating his tormented face on the floor the only reason i dont kill you is because youll be needed in the coming war he kicked grevens head besides having eladamri exiled to another plane is almost as helpful as having him deadmaybe more so there will be no martyrs grave no brave example for another generation of troublemakers he sent two guards to bring ertai to him they dragged the young sorcerer before crovax and forced him to lie on his belly at the evincars feet now what shall i do with you i dont care crovax drove a toe into ertais ribs he moaned and doubled over dont play hero with me boy i can make you care about anything his tone relaxed but i do owe you dont i owe gasped ertai dont you think i know you intervened in my duel with volrath could see your childish spell weighing down his blade as easily as he could no one else on rath practices your brand of archaic magic why did you help me i wouldve thought volrath would have been more your sort of patron i knew youd win eventually i thought if i helped youd spare belbe and me its too late for the emissary i suppose her rebel friends did her in he frowned a waste of good phyrexian technology that girl what were they thinking he relented on grevens punishment the suffering warrior couldnt even stand after his treatment as a reward for your unsolicited help ertai ill spare your life in return you will serve me do you agree a faint spark of hope illuminated the profound darkness in ertais heart i have many talents your highness perhaps i can demonstrate them to you well see in the meantime i have use for your influence with the flowstone my influence is nothing compared to yours sire crovax smiled and everyone in the vicinity flushed with fear for my purpose your skills will be enough in a remote part of the stronghold the flowstone factory began a new days production the output accelerator and the flowstone gauge conferred as was their designed custom on the efficiency of the previous days production yesterdays output was tons the accelerator said this is approximately fifty percent of our total capacity it is one hundred percent countered the gauge forty days ago we produced billion tons of flowstone said the accelerator that represented an effort of percent of our capacity how can tons in the previous daily cycle be percent it cannot said the gauge increase production to billion tons in this cycle lava input tubes at the very bottom of the citadel were switched on prodded to full capacity the factory rumbled into high gear the pitch of production increased there were a lot of bodies to dispose of the moggs dragged a heavy cart to the death pits and eased the bodies in one at a time to avoid splashing the deadly black tar on themselves in went dorian ildal former chamberlain of the palace in went tharvello promising young sergeant in went nine young men of the dal and vec still clad in their borrowed rathi uniforms the moggs hooted happily as the last of the bodies sank into the sable ooze though there were many bodies yet to dispose of their shift was done they had a halfday off a holiday had been declared by the new evincar tant jova was dying she was past one hundredtwenty years old and all the skills of her clans healers could no longer stave off the assault of old age it was whispered in camp the real cause of her final illness was the fact that eladamri and liin sivi never returned from their last raid lying in her tent on a hummock in the skyshroud forest tant jova called two people to her bedside darsett endal and gallan the wealthy dal merchant and the young elf warrior stood on either side of jovas simple pallet long life to you tant jova said darsett pressing a hand to his chest rubbish the old woman rasped my time left is measured in heartbeats if i had a long life ahead of me i wouldnt be lying here would i what can we do tant jova asked gallan i want you to pledge to continue the fight against the stronghold i know the night seems dark and long but like all nights it will end lead the free people of rath into the morning well keep the fight going darsett said though i dont know what the point is now we have a new evincar worse than the last the airship flies again raining death on our people from above the stronghold seems mightier than ever and weve lost eladamri and many of our finest young warriors the point is to fight o darsett tant jova said taking his broad hand eladamri started his rebellion twenty years ago you and i have been fighting just five months if we can resist even when the enemy is strongest we will prevail in time our agents report good progress recruiting in the stronghold gallan said they havent forgotten what crovax did to their families the old vec woman closed her eyes he dug his own grave that day she whispered the time will come when all the righteous souls of the murdered will rise up and bring the tyrant crovax to just retribution sleep now gallan urged be at peace darsett and i will continue the battle her sunken eyes closed gallan and darsett slipped out leaving the vec matriarch to dream a last dream of freedom it was dusk the two rebel leaders walked out from under the trees and looked up at the darkening sky have you noticed the odd colors in the sky at daybreak and dusk asked darsett sometimes the sky looks quite blue its strange gallan agreed but no stranger than some other tales ive heard im in contact with elves in other parts of the forest and with vec nomads who range as far away as the sawtooth hills and the weblands they speak of phantom cities appearing on the plain at dusk and ghostly forests and mountains visible just before daybreak what does it mean the young elf shook his head im no seer but these signs must be portents of coming changeschanges that may alter rath forever darsett shoved his hands in his pockets loose coins jingled there i went to eladamris first meeting because i hated the high taxes volrath made me pay he mused five months later i find myself running a damned revolution and puzzling over mysterious omens does that make sense gallan couldnt tell him at that moment he saw the northern sky shot through with vivid blue the low clouds were illuminated from some unknown source and glowed a sanguinary red such colors were unnatural on rath and their sudden radical beauty left both dal and elf speechless for reasons known only to himself crovax chose to give belbe a sumptuous state funeral the stronghold was too confining for the spectacle crovax planned so the funeral pyre was erected outside the crater on the smooth southern plain the entire army of rath was summoned to attend each soldier with a new black mantle and black headbands tied around their helmets delegations from the dal vec and kor were required to attend and they did clad in suitable mourning dress the actual pyre was surrounded by over five thousand civilian onlookers many of the civilians wondered why a sturdy post had been set in the ground alongside the pyre and why it was fitted with heavy chains rumor had it an execution was going to be staged during the phyrexian emissarys funeral the soldiers and civilians arrived at their designated places at the specified time an hour before dusk they waited and watched the causeway for signs of the funeral procession to fill the long minutes conversation turned to the strange colors people were seeing in the sky and to the ghostly visions that appeared with increasing frequency at the start and end of each day it was unsettling but then so was the new evincar unlike volrath crovax made no pretense of royal manners he was brisk and efficient dispensing justice and injustice with equal facility his first act after ordering belbes funeral was to purge over six hundred courtiers from the citadel they simply vanished without trial or trace the first visceral notes of a distant drumbeat filtered down the causeway the restive crowd quieted and the massed ranks of soldiers came to attention a column of palace guards appeared in full regalia bearing flagstaffs instead of their usual polearms each staff carried a black oriflamme hanging limply in the still air behind the guardsmen came a group of drummers fifty strong beating a steady rhythm after the drummers came the torchbearers sixty in all they wore white tabards over black and each carried a fourfoot long blazing brand on the heels of the torchbearers was the emissary herself borne on a bier made of real wood belbe had been wrapped head to toe in sparkling white bandages only her pallid face was exposed her phyrexian armor was piled at her feet the entire bier weighed five hundred pounds and required eight stout guardsmen to carry it so far the spectacle had been impressive but predictable what followed belbes body made everyone gasp with surprise volrathalive and in chains everyone assumed volrath had been killed by crovax soon after his defeat yet here he was in all his lost glory in the weeks since crovaxs ascension to the throne technicians had been working on volrath they had removedwith varying degrees of successmost of his phyrexian grafts and implants until all that was left was a shell of the godlike being volrath had been his beautiful body was gone and vuels short homely one was all that was left dressed only in a loin cloth volrath properly called vuel again still managed to walk with glacial dignity his head held high some people bowed when he passed their names were taken by crovaxs police agents scattered through the crowd respect for the defeated was forbidden and the punishment was death next in the procession came the corps of sergeants in their bright armor swords held rigidly in front of their stern faces a hooded executioner walked in their wake and a final contingent of palace guards brought up the rear but where was greven ilvec where was the evincar the first company of guards dispersed to form a ring around the pyre and post the drummers marched past the site and halted a ring of fire encircled the funeral bed as the torchbearers spread out single file around it the pallbearers entered the circle of fire with swaying step and carefully placed the bier atop the sturdy pyramid of kindling they withdrew outside the cordon of guards vuel entered the ring and paused for a moment at the foot of belbes bier he bowed deeply then walked to the post and snapped the manacles around his own hands the executioner took his place beside vuel he carried no ax or sword just a small leather bag the final contingent of guards halted in the path blocking it the drummers carried on for a short while then finished their march with a flourish of batons silence engulfed the scene overhead the drone of aerial engines announced the arrival of predator greven was now accounted for the airship emerged from the stronghold and slowly circled the funeral site the sky was unusually free of clouds and no wind stirred the pewter dusk there was a flash near the pyre some of the spectators thought the fire had been lit but it was crovaxs arrival most people had never seen him teleport before and he was gratified by the awe rippling through the crowd the evincar was resplendent in new white armor and helmet even his leather gloves were white people of rath he boomed this a solemn occasion we are here to celebrate deathand celebrate we should because death is as essential to life as food warmth or breath death is the great measuring rod against which we gauge our lives and before us today are two whose lives have come to their end the emissary of our overlords accomplished much in her short life she should always be remembered for bridging the awkward and dangerous interregnum between my reign and that of the previous evincar he took a torch from the nearest bearer and raised it high hail belbe emissary of the overlords the guards repeated crovaxs cry and the crowd took it up crovax thrust his flaming brand into the pyre and the other torch bearers followed suit the timbers had been soaked in volatile spirits and caught fire with great speed crovax approached the executioner how are you ertai he asked off came the hood fine sire it is a magnificent evening the once cocky sorcerer had been changed modifications not unlike grevens had made the man taller and wider from under his heavy robe ertai produced not two but four arms and his face was partially concealed from view by a metallic mask and shoulder plating only his forehead eyes and the bridge of his nose could be seen by members of the crowd the upper end of the control rod implanted in ertais spine was also visible the incision was still inflamed but the yellow metal rod clearly showed through the boys livid skin crovax gave the order prepare the injection ertai knelt and opened the bag there were two objects inside a tall vial of silver liquid and a large metal syringe he broke the seal on the vial and dipped the needle into the heavy liquid this will take a few seconds he said apologetically do the job right crovax said he stood face to face with vuel and said any last words go ahead speak your mind hed had vuels tongue cut out the night before nothing to say thats refreshing looking back at your reign i have to say you talked entirely too much ertai stood the preparation is ready sire proceed ertai pushed the syringe plunger to expel any air silver droplets squirted from the needle where the droplets hit the ground they formed tiny spheres that spun madly in place vuels eyes widened ertai jabbed the needle into vuels carotid artery the preparation was too dense to pump into an arm or leg vein vuels bloodshot eyes bulged as ertai forced the plunger down he thrashed against his chains to no avail when the syringe was empty ertai jerked it out your highness it is done will you do the honors crovax folded his arms across his chest and inhaled deeply the task is yours carry out the sentence ertai bowed he stood by vuels side and formed the command in his mind the former evincar trembled his head snapped around and he stared at ertai in abject horror vuel tore against his manacles as convulsions wracked his body one by one his toenails and fingernails sloughed off the skin of his extremities split and red bloodno longer glistening oilran out on the gray ground his joints disintegrated and as he watched his fingers fell off joint by joint liquid flowstone coursed through his veins obeying ertais last command disassemble the nanomachines attacked vuel from the inside dismantling his body at a cellular level his knees dissolved and his lower legs dropped away leaving the former master of rath dangling by his manacled wrists then his wrists came off and he fell to the ground vuel landed face upward as his ears and nose slid from his face as his teeth bubbled out of his mouth on the last breath from his lungs he saw the evergray sky of rath change to perfect cloudless blue it was the sky of dominaria and vuel son of kondo had returned home at last the fire burned out nothing but ashes remained of the flesh of belbe the plain was empty vuel was gone not even bones were left as the implacable flowstone disassembled him down to the last gory mote ertai alone remained he waited under a sky he knew for the fire to die when the last small flames went out he waded into the pile of cinders that had been belbes bier heedless of hot embers her metal skeleton was intact though warped by the pyres intense heat he found her small skull smudged and blackened but with bright alloy gleaming around the eye sockets he tucked the warm skull under his arm his foot dislodged an unfamiliar objecta black sphere about four inches in diameter he picked it up it was cold to the touch not hot and not a speck of ash clung to it the shiny surface was seamless unmarred phyrexian no doubt belbes lens even with a control rod in his spine ertai was terrified he dropped the black orb and kicked it back into the ashes all he wanted was the skull he ran back to the stronghold under the stars of dominaria praying the lens no longer worked
