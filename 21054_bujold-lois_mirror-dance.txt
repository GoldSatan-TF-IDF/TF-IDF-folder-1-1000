lois mcmaster bujold mirror dance chapter one the row of comconsole booths lining the passenger concourse of escobars largest commercial orbital transfer station had mirrored doors divided into diagonal sections by rainbowcolored lines of lights doubtless someones idea of decor the mirrorsections were deliberately set slightly out of alignment fragmenting their reflections the short man in the grey and white military uniform scowled at his divided self framed therein his image scowled back the insignialess mercenary officers undress kitpocketed jacket loose trousers tucked into ankletopping bootswas correct in every detail he studied the body under the uniform a stretchedout dwarf with a twisted spine shortnecked bigheaded subtly deformed and robbed by his short stature of any chance of the disturbing nearrightness passing unnoticed his dark hair was neatly trimmed beneath black brows the grey eyes glower deepened the body too was correct in every detail he hated it the mirrored door slid up at last and a woman exited the booth she wore a soft wrap tunic and flowing trousers a fashionable bandolier of expensive electronic equipment hanging decoratively on a jeweled chain across her torso advertised her status her beginning stride was arrested at the sight of him and she recoiled buffeted by his black and hollow stare then went carefully around him with a mumbled excuse me im sorry he belatedly twisted up his mouth on an imitation smile and muttered something halfinaudible conveying enough allegiance to the social proprieties for him to pass by he hit the keypad to lower the door again sealing himself from sight aloneat last for one last moment if only in the narrow confines of a commercial comm booth the womans perfume lingered cloyingly in the air along with a frisson of station odors recycled air food bodies stress plastics and metals and cleaning compounds he exhaled and sat and laid his hands out flat on the small countertop to still their trembling not quite alone there was another damned mirror in here for the convenience of patrons wishing to check their appearance before transmitting it by holovid his darkringed eyes flashed back at him malevolently then he ignored the image he emptied his pockets out onto the countertop all his worldly resources fit neatly into a space little larger than his two spread palms one last inventory as if counting it again might change the sum a credit chit with about three hundred betan dollars remaining upon it one might live well for a week upon this orbital space station for that much or for a couple of lean months on the planet turning below if it were carefully managed three false identification chits none for the man he was now none for the man he was whoever he was an ordinary plastic pocket comb a data cube that was all he returned all but the credit chit to various pockets upon and in the jacket gravely sorting them individually he ran out of objects before he ran out of pockets and snorted you might at least have brought your own toothbrush too late now and getting later horrors happened proceeding unchecked while he sat struggling for nerve come on youve done this before you can do it now he jammed the credit card into the slot and keyed in the carefully memorized code number compulsively he glanced one last time into the mirror and tried to smooth his features into something approaching a neutral expression for all his practice he did not think he could manage the grin just now he despised that grin anyway the vid plate hissed to life and a womans visage formed above it she wore greyandwhites like his own but with proper rank insignia and name patch she recited crisply comm officer hereld triumph dendarii free corporation in escobaran space a mercenary fleet sealed its weapons at the outside jumppoint station under the watchful eyes of the escobaran military inspectors and submitted proof of its purely commercial intentions before it was even allowed to pass the polite fiction was maintained apparently in escobar orbit he moistened his lips and said evenly connect me with the officer of the watch please admiral naismith sir youre back even over the holovid a blast of pleasure and excitement washed out from her straightened posture and beaming face it struck him like a blow whats up are we going to be moving out soon in good time lieutenant hereld an apt name for a communications officer he managed to twitch a smile admiral naismith would smile yes youll learn in good time in the meanwhile i want a pickup at the orbital transfer station yes sir i can get that for you is captain quinn with you uh no when will she be following later right sir let me just get clearance forare we loading any equipment no just myself clearance from the escobarans for a personnel pod then she turned aside for a few moments i can have someone at docking bay e in about twenty minutes very well it would take him almost that long to get from this concourse to that arm of the station ought he to add some personal word for lieutenant hereld she knew him how well did she know him every sentence that fell from his lips from this point on packed risk risk of the unknown risk of a mistake mistakes were punished was his betan accent really right he hated this with a stomachchurning terror i want to be transferred directly to the ariel right sir do you wish me to notify captain thorne was admiral naismith often in the habit of springing surprise inspections well not this time yes do tell them to make ready to break orbit only the ariel her brows rose yes lieutenant this in quite a perfect bored betan drawl he congratulated himself as she grew palpably prim the undertone had suggested just the right hint of criticism of a breach of security or manners or both to suppress further dangerous questions will do admiral naismith out he cut the comm she vanished in a haze of sparkles and he let out a long breath admiral naismith miles naismith he had to get used to responding to that name again even in his sleep leave the lord vorkosigan part completely out of it for now it was difficult enough just being the naismith half of the man drill what is your name miles miles miles lord vorkosigan pretended to be admiral naismith and so did he what after all was the difference but what is your name really his vision darkened in a rush of despair and rage he blinked it back controlling his breathing my name is what i will and right now i will it to be miles naismith he exited the booth and strode down the concourse short legs pumping both riveting and repelling the sideways stares of startled strangers see miles see miles run see miles get what he deserves he marched headdown and no one got in his way he ducked into the personnel pod a tiny fourman shuttle as soon as the hatch seal sensors blinked green and the door dilated he hit the keypad for it to close again behind him immediately the pod was too little to maintain a grav field he floated over the seats and pulled himself carefully down into the one beside the lone pilot a mail in dendarii grey tech coveralls all right lets go the pilot grinned and sketched him a salute as he strapped in otherwise appearing to be a sensible adult male he had the same look on his face as the comm officer hereld excited breathless watching eagerly as if his passenger were about to pull treats from his pockets he glanced over his shoulder as the pod obediently broke free of the docking clamps and turned they swooped away from the skin of the station into clear space the traffic control patterns made a maze of colored lights on the navigation console through which the pilot swiftly threaded them good to see you back admiral said the pilot as soon as the tangle grew less thick whats happening the edge of formality in the pilots tone was reassuring just a comrade in arms not one of the dear old friends or worse dear old lovers he essayed an evasion when you need to know youll be told he made his tone affable but avoided names or ranks the pilot vented an intrigued hm and smirked apparently contented he settled back with a tight smile the huge transfer station fell away silently behind them shrinking into a mad childs toy then into a few glints of light excuse me im a little tired he settled down further into his seat and closed his eyes wake me up when we dock if i fall asleep yes sir said the pilot respectfully you look like you could use it he acknowledged this with a tired wave of his hand and pretended to doze he could always tell instantly when someone he met thought they were facing naismith they all had that same stupid hyperalert glow in their faces they werent all worshipful hed met some of naismiths enemies once but worshipful or homicidal they reacted as if they suddenly switched on and became ten times more alive than ever before how the hell did he do it make people light up like that granted naismith was a goddamn hyperactive but how did he make it so freaking contagious strangers who met him as himself did not greet him like that they were blank and courteous or blank and rude or just blank closed and indifferent covertly uncomfortable with his slight deformities and his obviously abnormal fourfootnineinch height wary his resentment boiled up behind his eyes like sinus pain all this bloody heroworship or whatever it was all for naismith for naismith and not for me never for me he stifled a twinge of dread knowing what he was about to face bel thorne the ariels captain would be another one friend officer fellow betan yes a tough test well enough but thorne also knew of the existence of the clone from that chaotic encounter two years ago on earth they had never met face to face but a mistake that another dendarii might dismiss in confusion could trigger in thorne the suspicion the wild surmise even that distinction naismith had stolen from him the mercenary admiral publicly and falsely now claimed to be a clone himself a superior cover concealing his other identity his other life you have two lives he thought to his absent enemy i have none im the real done damn it couldnt i have even that uniqueness did you have to take it all no keep his thoughts positive he could handle thorne as long as he could avoid the terrifying quinn the bodyguard the lover quinn he had met quinn face to face on earth and fooled her once for a whole morning not twice he didnt think but quinn was with the real miles naismith stuck like glue he was safe from her no old lovers this trip hed never had a lover not yet it was perhaps not quite fair to blame naismith for that as well for the first twenty years of his life he had been in effect a prisoner though he hadnt always realized it for the last two the last two years had been one continuous disaster he decided bitterly this was his last chance he refused to think beyond no more this had to be made to work the pilot stirred beside him and he slitted open his eyes as the deceleration pressed him against his seat straps they were coming up on the ariel it grew from a dot to a model to a ship the illyricanbuilt light cruiser carried a crew of twenty plus room for supercargo and a commando squad heavily powered for its size an energy profile typical of warships it looked swift almost rakish a good courier ship a good ship to run like hell in perfect despite his black mood his lips curled up as he studied that ship now i take and you give naismith the pilot clearly quite conscious that he was conveying his admiral brought the personnel pod into its docking clamps with a bare click eat and smooth as humanly possible shall i wait sir no i shouldnt be needing you again the pilot hurried to adjust the tube seals while his passenger was till unbuckling and saluted him out with another idiot broad proud mile he twitched a returning smile and salute then grasped the handlebars above the hatch and swung himself into the ariels gravity ield he dropped neatly to his feet in a small loading bay behind him he pod pilot was already resealing the hatch to return himself and iis pod to its vessel of origin probably the flagship triumph he looked up always up into the face of the waiting dendarii officer face he had studied before this only in a holovid captain bel thorne was a betan hermaphrodite a race that was remnant of an early experiment in human genetic and social engineering that had succeeded only in creating another minority homes beardless face was framed by soft brown hair in a short ambiguous cut that either a man or a woman might sport its officers jacket hung open revealing the black tee shirt underneath curving over modest but distinctly feminine breasts the gray dendarii uniform trousers were loose enough to disguise the reciprocal bulge in he crotch some people found hermaphrodites enormously disturbing he was relieved to realize he found that aspect of thorne only slightly disconcerting clones who live in glass houses shouldnt throw what it was the radiant ilovenaismith look on the hermaphrodites face that really bothered him his gut knotted as he returned the ariels captains salute welcome aboard sir the alto voice was vibrant with enthusiasm he was just managing a stiff smile when the hermaphrodite stepped up and embraced him his heart lurched and he barely choked off a cry and a violent defensive lashingout he endured he embrace without going rigid grasping mentally after shattered composure and his carefully rehearsed speeches its not going to kiss me is it the hermaphrodite set him at arms length hands familiarly upon his shoulders without doing so however he breathed relief thorne cocked its head its lips twisting in puzzlement whats wrong miles first names sorry bel im just a little tired can we get right to the briefing you look a lot tired right do you want me to assemble the whole crew no you can rebrief them as needed that was the plan as little direct contact with as few dendarii as possible come to my cabin then and you can put your feet up and drink tea while we talk the hermaphrodite followed him into the corridor not knowing which direction to turn he wheeled and waited as if politely for thorne to lead on he trailed the dendarii officer through a couple of twists and turns and up a level the ships internal architecture was not as cramped as hed expected he noted directions carefully naismith knew this ship well the ariels captains cabin was a neat little chamber soldierly not revealing much on this side of the latched cupboard doors about the personality of its owner but thorne unlatched one to display an antique ceramic tea set and a couple of dozen small canisters of varietal teas of earth and other planetary origins all protected from breakage by custommade foam packing what kind thorne called its hand hovering over the canisters the usual he replied easing into a station chair clamped to the floor beside a small table might have guessed i swear ill train you to be more venturesome one of these days thorne shot a peculiar grin over its shoulder at himwas that intended to be some sort of double entendre after a bit more rattling about thorne placed a delicately handpainted porcelain cup and saucer upon the table at his elbow he picked it up and sipped cautiously as thorne hooked another chair into its clamps a quarter turn around the table produced a cup for itself and sat with a small grunt of satisfaction he was relieved to find the hot amber liquid pleasant if astringent sugar he dared not ask thorne hadnt put any out the dendarii surely would have if it expected naismith to use sugar thorne couldnt be making some subtle test already could it no sugar then teadrinking mercenaries the beverage didnt seem nearly poisonous enough somehow to go with the display no working arsenal of weapons clamped to the wall a couple of stunners a needier a plasma arc a gleaming metal crossbow with an assortment of grenadebolts in a bandolier hung with it thorne was supposed to be good at its job if that was true he didnt care what the creature drank youre in a black study i take it youve brought us a lovely one this time eh thorne prodded after another moments silence the mission assignment yes he certainly hoped that was what thorne meant the hermaphrodite nodded and raised its brows in encouraging inquiry its a pickup not the biggest one weve ever attempted by any means thorne laughed but with its own complications it cant possibly be any more complicated than dagoola four say on oh do he rubbed his lips a patented naismith gesture were going to knock over house bharaputras clone creche on jacksons whole clean it out thorne was just crossing its legs both feet now hit the floor with a thump kill them it said in a startled voice the clones no rescue them rescue them all oh whew thorne looked distinctively relieved i had this horrible vision for a secondthey are children after all even if they are clones just exactly so a real smile tugged up the corners of his mouth surprising him im glad you see it that way how else thorne shrugged the clone braintransplant business is the most monstrous obscene practice in bharaputras whole catalog of slime services unless theres something even worse i havent heard about yet i think so too he settled back concealing his startlement at this instant endorsement of his scheme was thorne sincere he knew intimately none better the hidden horrors behind the clone business on jacksons whole hed lived through them he had not expected someone who had not shared his experiences to share his judgment though house bharaputras specialty was not strictly speaking cloning it was the immortality business or at any rate the life extension business and a very lucrative business it was for what price could one put on life itself all the market would bear the procedure bharaputra sold was medically risky not ideal wagered only against a certainty of imminent death by customers who were wealthy ruthless and he had to admit possessed of unusual cool foresight the arrangement was simple though the surgical procedure upon which it was based was fiendishly complex a clone was grown from a customers somatic cell gestated in a uterine replicator and then raised to physical maturity in bharaputras creche a sort of astonishinglyappointed orphanage the clones were valuable after all their physical conditioning and health of supreme importance then when the time was right they were cannibalized in an operation that claimed a total success rate of rather less than one hundred percent the clones progenitors brain was transplanted from its aged or damaged body into a duplicate still in the first bloom of youth the clones brain was classified as medical waste the procedure was illegal on every planet in the wormhole nexus except jacksons whole that was fine with the criminal houses that ran the place it gave them a nice monopoly a steady business with lots of practice upon the stream of wealthy offworlders to keep their surgical teams at the top of their forms as far as he had ever been able to tell the attitude of the rest of the worlds toward it all was out of sight out of mind the spark of sympathetic righteous anger in thornes eyes touched him on a level of pain so numb with use he was scarcely conscious of it any more and he was appalled to realize he was a heartbeat away from bursting into tears its probably a trick he blew out his breath another naismithism thornes brows drew down in intense thought are you sure we should be taking the ariel last i heardbaron ryoval was still alive its bound to get his attention house ryoval was one of bharaputras minor rivals in the illegal medical end of things its specialty was manufacturing geneticallyengineered or surgically sculptured humans for any purpose including sexual in effect slaves madetoorder evil he supposed but not the killing evil that obsessed him but what had the ariel to do with baron ryoval he hadnt a clue let thorne worry about it perhaps the hermaphrodite would drop more information later he reminded himself to seize the first opportunity to review the ships mission logs this mission has nothing to do with house ryoval we shall avoid them so i hope agreed thorne fervently it paused thoughtfully sipping tea now despite the fact that jacksons whole is long overdue for a housecleaning preferably with atomics i presume we are not doing this just out of the goodness of our hearts whats ah the mission behind the mission this time he had a rehearsed answer for that one in fact only one of the clones or rather one of its progenitors is of interest to our employer the rest are to be camouflage among them bharaputras customers have a lot of enemies they wont know which one is attacking who it makes our employers identity which they very much desire to keep secret all the more secure thorne grinned smugly that little refinement was your idea i take it he shrugged in a sense hadnt we better know which clone were after to prevent accidents or in case we have to cut and run if our employer wants it aliveor does it matter to them if the clone is alive or dead if the real target is the old bugger who had it grown they care alive but for practical purposes let us assume that all the clones are the one were after thorne spread its hands in acquiescence its all right by me the hermaphrodites eyes glinted with enthusiasm and it suddenly smacked its fist into its palm with a crack that made him jump its about time someone took those jacksonian bastards on oh this is going to be fun it bared its teeth in a most alarming grin how much help do we have lined up on jacksons whole safety nets dont count on any hm how much hindrance besides bharaputra ryoval and fell of course house fell dealt mainly in weapons what had fell to do with any of this your guess is as good as mine thorne frowned that was not the usual sort of naismith answer apparently i have a great deal of inside information about the creche that i can brief you on once were en route look bel you hardly need me to tell you how to do your job at this late date i trust you take over the logistics and planning and ill check the finals thornes spine straightened right how many kids are we talking about bharaputra does about one of these transplants a week on average fifty a year say that they have coming along the last year of the clones lives they move them to a special facility near house headquarters for final conditioning i want to take the whole years supply from that facility fifty or sixty kids all packed aboard the ariel itll be tight speed bel speed yeah i think youre right timetable as soon as possible every weeks delay costs another innocent life hed measured out the last two years by that clock i have wasted a hundred lives so far the journey from earth to escobar alone had cost him a thousand betan dollars and four dead clones i get it said thorne grimly and rose and put away its tea cup it switched its chair to the clamps in front of its comconsole that kids slated for surgery isnt it yes and if not that one a crechemate thorne began tapping keypads what about funds that is your department this mission is cash on delivery draw your estimated needs from fleet funds right put your palm over here and authorize my withdrawal then thorne held out a sensor pad without hesitation he laid his palm flat upon it to his horror the red norecognition code glinted in the readout no it has to be right it has to damn machine thorne tapped the sensor pads corner sharply on the table behave try again this time he laid his palm down with a very slight twist the computer digested the new data and this time pronounced him cleared accepted blessed funded his pounding heart slowed in relief thorne keyed in more data and said over its shoulder no question which commando squad you want to requisition for this one eh no question he echoed hollowly go ahead he had to get out of here before the strain of the masquerade made him blow away his good start you want your usual cabin thorne inquired sure he stood soon i gather the hermaphrodite checked a readout in the glowing complexity of logistics displays above the comconsole vid plate the palm lock is still keyed for you get off your feet you look beat its under control good when will elli quinn be along she wont be coming on this mission thornes eyes widened in surprise really its smile broadened quite inexplicably thats too bad its voice conveyed not the least disappointment some rivalry there over what have the triumph send over my kit he ordered yes delegate that thievery too delegate it all and when you get the chance have a meal sent to my cabin will do promised thorne with a firm nod im glad to see youve been eating better by the way even if you havent been sleeping good keep it up we worry about you you know eating better hell with his stature keeping his weight down had become a constant battle hed starved for three months just to get back into naismiths uniform that hed stolen two years ago and now wore another wave of weary hatred for his progenitor washed over him he let himself out with a casual salute that he trusted would encourage thorne to keep working and managed to keep from snarling under his breath till the cabin door hissed shut behind him there was nothing for it but to try every palm lock in the corridor till one opened he hoped no dendarii would come along while he was rattling doors he found his cabin at last directly across from the hermaphrodite captains the door slid open at his touch on the sensor pad without any heartstopping glitches this time the cabin was a little chamber almost identical to thornes only blanker he checked cupboards most were bare but in one he found a set of gray fatigues and a stained tech coverall just his size a residue of halfused toiletries in the cabins tiny washroom included a toothbrush and his lips twisted in an ironical sneer the neatly made bed which folded out of the wall looked extremely attractive and he nearly swooned into it im on my way ive done it the dendarii had accepted him accepted his orders with the same stupid blind trust with which they followed naismiths like sheep all he had to do now was not screw it up the hardest part was over hed grabbed a quick shower and was just pulling on naismiths trousers when his meal arrived his undress state gave him an excuse to wave the attentive traybearing dendarii out again quickly the dinner under the covers turned out to be real food not rations grilled vat steak freshappearing vegetables nonsynthetic coffee the hot food hot and the cold food cold beautifully laid out in little portions finely calculated to naismiths appetite even ice cream he recognized his progenitors tastes and was daunted anew by this rush by unknown people to try to give him exactly what he wanted even in these tiny details rank had its privileges but this was insane depressed he ate it all and was just wondering if the fuzzy green stuff arranged to fill up all the empty space on the plate was edible too when the cabin buzzer blatted again this time it was a dendarii noncom and a float pallet with three big crates on it ah he blinked my kit just set it there in the middle of the floor for now yes sir dont you want to assign a batman the noncoms inviting expression left no doubt about who was first in line to volunteer not this mission were going to be cramped for space later just leave it id be happy to unpack it for you sir i packed it all up quite all right if ive missed anything just let me know and ill run it right over thank you corporal his exasperation leaked into his voice fortunately it acted as a brake upon the corporals enthusiasm the dendarii heaved the crates from the float pallet and exited with a sheepish grin as if to say hey you cant blame me for trying he smiled back through set teeth and turned his attention to the crates as soon as the door sealed he flipped up the latches and hesitated bemused at his own eagerness it must be rather like getting a birthday present hed never had a birthday present in his life so lets make up for some lost time the first lid folded back to reveal clothes more clothes than hed ever owned before tech coveralls undress kit a dress uniformhe held up the grey velvet tunic and raised his brows at the shimmer and the silver buttonsboots shoes slippers pajamas all regulation all cut down to perfect fit and civilian clothes eight or ten sets in various planetary and galactic styles and social levels an escobaran business suit in red silk a barrayaran quasimilitary tunic and piped trousers ship knits a betan sarong and sandals a ragged jacket and shirt and pants suitable for a downonhisluck dockworker anywhere abundant underwear three kinds of chronos with buildin comm units one dendarii regulation one very expensive commercial model one appearing cheap and battered which turned out to be finest military surplus underneath and more he moved to the second crate flipped up the lid and gaped space armor fullbore attack unit space armor power and life support packs fully charged weapons loaded and locked just his size it seemed to gleam with its own dark and wicked glow nested in its packing the smell of it hit him incredibly military metal and plastic energy and chemicals old sweat he drew the helmet out and stared with wonder into the darkened mirror of its visor he had never worn space armor though hed studied it in holovids till his eyes crossed a sinister deadly carapace he unloaded it all and laid the pieces out in order upon the floor strange splashes scars and patches deckled the gleaming surfaces here and there what weapons what strikes had been powerful enough to mar that metalloy surface what enemies had fired them every scar he realized fingering them had been intended death this was not pretend it was very disturbing no he pushed away the cold shiver of doubt if he can do it i can do it he tried to ignore the repairs and mysterious stains on the pressure suit and its soft absorbent underliner as he packed it all away again and stowed the crate blood shit burns oil it was all cleaned and odorless now anyway the third crate smaller than the second proved to contain a set of halfarmor lacking builtin weapons and not meant for space but rather for dirtside combat under normal or nearnormal pressure temperature and atmospheric conditions its most arresting feature was a command headset a smooth duralloy helmet with builtin telemetry and a vid projector in a flange above the forehead that placed any data on the net right before the commanders eyes data flow was controlled by certain facial movements and voice commands he left it out on the counter to examine more thoroughly later and repacked the rest by the time he finished arranging all the clothing in the cabins cupboards and drawers hed begun to regret sending the batman away so precipitously he fell onto the bed and dimmed the lights when he next woke he should be on his way to jacksons whole hed just begun to doze when the cabin comm buzzed he lurched up to answer it mustering a reasonably coherent naismith here in a sleepblurred voice miles said thornes voice the commando squads here uh good break orbit as soon as youre ready then dont you want to see them thorne said sounding surprised inspection he inhaled right ill be along naismith out he hurried back into his uniform trousers taking a jacket with proper insignia this time and quickly called up a schematic of the ships interior layout on the cabins comconsole there were two locks for combat drop shuttles port and starboard which one he traced a route to both the operative shuttle hatch was the first one he tried he paused a moment in shadow and silence at the curve of the corridor before he was spotted to take in the scene the loading bay was crowded with a dozen men and women in grey camouflage flight suits along with piles of equipment and supplies hand and heavy weapons were stacked in symmetrical arrays the mercenaries sat or stood talking noisily loud and crude punctuated with barks of laughter they were all so big generating too much energy knocking into each other in halfhorseplay as if seeking an excuse to shout louder they bore knives and other personal weapons on belts or in holsters or on bandoliers an ostentatious display their faces were a blur animallike he swallowed straightened and stepped among them the effect was instantaneous heads up someone shouted and without further orders they arranged themselves at rigid attention in two neat dead silent rows each with his or her bundle of equipment at their feet it was almost more frightening than the previous chaos with a thin smile he walked forward and pretended to look at each one a last heavy duffle arced out of the shuttle hatch to land with a thump on the deck and the thirteenth commando squeezed through stood up and saluted him he stood paralyzed with panic whatinhell was it he stared at a flashing belt buckle then tilted his head back straining his neck the freaking thing was eight feet tall the enormous body radiated power that he could feel almost like a wave of heat and the facethe face was a nightmare tawny yellow eyes like a wolfs a distorted outslung mouth with fangs dammit long white canines locked over the edges of the carmine lips the huge hands had claws thick powerful razoredgedenamelled with carmine polish what his gaze traveled back up to the monsters face the eyes were outlined with shadow and gold tint echoed by a little gold spangle glued decoratively to one high cheekbone the mahoganycolored hair was drawn back in an elaborate braid the belt was cinched in tightly emphasizing a figure of sorts despite the loosefitting multigrey flight suit the thing was female sergeant taura and the green squad reporting as ordered sir the baritone voice reverberated in the bay thank you it came out a cracked whisper and he coughed to unlock his throat thank you that will be all get your orders from captain thorne you may all stand down they all strained to hear him compelling him to repeat dismissed they broke up in disorder or some order known only to themselves for the bay was cleared of equipment with astonishing speed the monster sergeant lingered looming over him he locked his knees to keep himself from sprinting from ither she lowered her voice thanks for picking the green squad miles i take it youve got us a real plum more first names captain thorne will brief you en route its a challenging mission and this would be the sergeant in charge of it captain quinn have the details as usual she cocked a furry eyebrow at him captain quinn will not be coming on this mission he swore her gold eyes widened the pupils dilating her lips drew back baring her fangs further in what took him a terrifying moment to realize was a smile in a weird way it reminded him of the grin with which thorne had greeted that same news she glanced up the bay had emptied of other personnel aah her voice rumbled like a purr well ill be your bodyguard any time lover just give me the sign what sign what the hell she bent her lips rippling carmine clawed hand grasping his shoulderhe had a flashing vision of her tearing off his head peeling and eating himthen her mouth closed over his his breath stopped and his vision darkened and he almost passed out before she straightened and gave him a puzzled hurt look miles whats the matter that had been a kiss freaking gods nothing he gasped ive been ill i probably shouldnt have gotten up but i had to inspect she was looking very alarmed ill say you shouldnt have gotten upyoure shaking all over you can barely stand up here ill carry you to sickbay crazy man no im all right that is ive been treated im just supposed to rest and recover for a while is all well you go straight back to bed then yes he wheeled she swatted him on the butt he bit his tongue she said at least youve been eating better take care of yourself huh he waved over his shoulder and fled without looking back had that been military cameraderie from a sergeant to an admiral he didnt think so that had been intimacy naismith you bugfuck crazy bastard what have you been doing in your spare time i didnt think you had any spare time youve got to be a freaking suicidal maniac if youve been screwing that he locked his cabin door behind him and stood against it trembling laughing in hysterical disbelief dammit hed studied everything about naismith everything this couldnt be happening with friends like this who need enemies he undressed and lay tensely upon his bed contemplating naismithvorkosigans complicated life and wondering what other boobytraps it held for him at last a faint change in the susurrations and creaks of the ship around him a brief tug of shifting grav fields made him realize the ariel was breaking free of escobar orbit he had actually succeeded in stealing a fully armed and equipped military fast cruiser and no one even knew it they were on their way to jacksons whole to his destiny his destiny not naismiths his thoughts spiraled toward sleep at last but if you claim your destiny his demon voice whispered at the last before the nights oblivion why cant you claim your name chapter two they exited the flex tube from the passenger ship in step arm in arm quinn with her duffle swung over her shoulder miles with his flight bag gripped in his free hand in the orbital transfer stations disembarkation lounge peoples heads turned miles stole a smug sideways glance at his female companion as they strolled on past the mens halfaverted envious stares my quinn quinn was looking particularly tough this morningwas it morning hed have to check dendarii fleet timehaving halfreturned to her normal persona shed managed to make her pocketed grey uniform trousers masquerade as a fashion statement by tucking them into red suede boots the steel caps under the pointed toes eluded notice and topping them with a skimpy scarlet tank top her white skin glowed in contrast to the tank top and to her short dark curls the surface colors distracted the eye from her athleticism not apparent unless you knew just how much that bloody duffle weighed liquid brown eyes informed her face with wit but it was the perfect sculptured curves and planes of the face itself that stopped mens voices in midsentence an obviously expensive face the work of a surgeonartist of extraordinary genius the casual observer might guess her face had been paid for by the little ugly man whose arm she linked with her own and judge the woman too to be a purchase the casual observer never guessed the price shed really paid her old face burned away in combat off tau verde very nearly the first battle loss in admiral naismiths serviceten years ago now god the casual observer was a twit miles decided the latest representative of the species was a wealthy executive who reminded miles of a blond civilian version of his cousin ivan and who had spent much of the twoweek journey from sergyar to escobar under such misapprehensions about quinn trying to seduce her miles glimpsed him now loading his luggage onto a float pallet and venting a last frustrated sigh of defeat before sloping off except for reminding miles of ivan miles bore him no illwill in fact miles felt almost sorry for him as quinns sense of humor was as vile as her reflexes were deadly miles jerked his head toward the retreating escobaran and murmured so what did you finally say to get rid of him love quinns eyes shifted to identify the man and crinkled laughing if i told you youd be embarrassed no i wont tell me i told him you could do pushups with your tongue he must have decided he couldnt compete miles reddened i wouldnt have led him on so far except that i wasnt totally sure at first that he wasnt some kind of agent she added apologetically you sure now yeah too bad it might have been more entertaining not to me i was ready for a little vacation yes and you look the better for it rested i really like this marriedcouple cover for travel he remarked it suits me he took a slightly deeper breath so weve had the honeymoon why dont we have the wedding to go with it you never give up do you she kept her tone light only the slight flinch of her arm under his told him his words had given pain and he silently cursed himself im sorry i promised id keep off that subject she shrugged her unburdened shoulder incidentally unlinking elbows and let her arm swing aggressively as she walked trouble is you dont want me to be madame naismith dread of the dendarii you want me to be lady vorkosigan of barrayar thats a downside post im spacerborn even if i did marry a dirtsucker go down into some gravity well and never come up again barrayar is not the pit id pick not to insult your home why not everyone else does my mother likes you he offered and i admire her ive met her what four times now and every time im more impressed and yet the more impressed the more outraged i am at the criminal waste barrayar makes of her talents shed be surveyorgeneral of the betan astronomical survey by now if shed stayed on beta colony or any other thing she pleased she pleased to be countess vorkosigan she pleased to be stunned by your da whom i admit is pretty stunning she doesnt give squat for the rest of the vor caste quinn paused before they came into the hearing of the escobaran customs inspectors and miles stood with her they both gazed down the chamber and not at each other for all her flair shes a tired woman underneath barrayar has sucked so much out of her barrayar is her cancer killing her slowly mutely miles shook his head yours too lord vorkosigan quinn added somberly this time it was his turn to flinch she sensed it and tossed her head anyway admiral naismith is my kind of maniac lord vorkosigan is a dull and dutiful stick by contrast ive seen you at home on barrayar miles youre like half yourself there damped down muted somehow even your voice is lower its extremely weird i cant i have to fit in there scarcely a generation ago someone with a body as strange as mine would have been killed outright as a suspected mutant i cant push things too far too fast im too easy to target is that why barrayaran imperial security sends you on so many offplanet missions for my development as an officer to widen my background deepen my experience and someday theyre going to hook you out of here permanently and take you home and squeeze all that experience back out of you in their service like a sponge im in their service now elli he reminded her softly in a grave and level voice that she had to bend her head to hear now then and always her eyes slid away rightoh so when they do nail your boots to the floor back on barrayar i want your job i want to be admiral quinn someday fine by me he said affably the job yes time for lord vorkosigan and his personal wants to go back into the bag he had to stop masochistically rerunning this stupid marriage conversation with quinn anyway quinn was quinn he did not want her to be notquinn not even for lord vorkosigan despite this selfinflicted moment of depression anticipation of his return to the dendarii quickened his step as they made their way through customs and into the monster transfer station quinn was right he could feel naismith refilling his skin generated from somewhere deep in his psyche right out to his fingertips goodbye dull lieutenant miles vorkosigan deep cover operative for barrayaran imperial security and overdue for a promotion hello dashing admiral naismith space mercenary and allaround soldier of fortune or misfortune he slowed as they came to a row of commercial comconsole booths lining the passenger concourse and nodded toward their mirrored doors lets see how red squad is cooking first if theyre recovered sufficiently for release id like to go downside personally and spring them rightoh quinn dumped her duffle dangerously close to miless sandaled feet swung into the nearest empty booth jammed her card into the slot and tapped out a code on the keypad miles set down his flight bag sat on the duffle and watched her from outside the booth he caught a sliced reflection of himself on the mosaic of mirror on the next booths lowered door the dark trousers and loose white shirt that he wore were ambiguously styled as to planetary origin but as fit his travelcover very civilian relaxed casual not bad time was he had worn uniforms like a turtleshell of highgrade social protection over the vulnerable peculiarities of his body an armor of belonging that said dont mess with me i have friends when had he stopped needing that so desperately he was not sure for that matter when had he stopped hating his body it had been two years since his last serious injury on the hostage rescue mission that had come right after that incredible mess with his brother on earth hed been fully recovered for quite some time he flexed his hands full of plastic replacement bones and found them as easily his own as before they were last crunched as before they were ever crunched he hadnt had an osteoinflammatory attack in months im feeling no pain he realized with a dark grin and it wasnt just quinns doing though quinn had been very therapeutic am i going sane in my old age enjoy it while you can he was twentyeight years old and surely at some sort of physical peak he could feel that peak the exhilarating float of apogee the descending arc was a fate for some future day voices from the comm booth brought him back to the present moment quinn had sandy hereld on the other end and was saying hi im back hi quinnie i was expecting you what can i do for you sandy had been doing strange things to her hair again miles noted even from his offsides vantage i just got off the jumpship here at the transfer station planning a little detour i want transport downside to pick up the red squad survivors then back to the triumph whats their current status hold tight ill have it in a second lieutenant hereld punched up data on a display to her left in the crowded concourse a man in dendarii greys walked past he saw miles and gave him a hesitant cautious nod perhaps uncertain if the admirals civilian gear indicated some sort of cover miles returned a reassuring wave and the man smiled and strode on miless brain kicked up unwanted data the mans name was travis gray he was a field tech currently assigned to the peregrine a sixyearman so far expert in communications equipment he collected classic prejump music of earth origin how many such personnel files did miles carry in his head now hundreds thousands and here came more hereld turned back and rattled off ives was released to downside leave and boyd has been returned to the triumph for further therapy the beauchene life center reports that durham vifian and aziz are available for release but they want to talk to someone in charge first rightoh kee and zelaski they also want to talk about quinns lips tightened right she agreed flatly miless belly knotted just a little that was not going to be a happy conversation he suspected let them know were on our way then quinn said yes capn hereld shuffled files on her vid display will do which shuttle do you want the triumphs smaller personnel shuttle will do unless you have some cargo to load on at the same time from the beauchene shuttleport none from there no all right hereld checked her vid according to escobaran flight control i can put shuttle two into docking bay j in thirty minutes youll be cleared for immediate downside departure thanks pass the wordtherell be a captain and captainowners briefing when we get back what time is it at beauchene hereld glanced aside out of a hour day morning great whats the weather down there lovely shirtsleeves good i wont have to change well advise when were ready to depart port beauchene quinn out miles sat on the duffle staring down at his sandals awash in unpleasant memories it had been one of the dendarii mercenaries sweatier smuggling adventures putting military advisors and material down on marilac in support of its continuing resistance to a cetagandan invasion combat drop shuttle a from the triumph had been hit by enemy fire on the last trip upandout with all of red squad and several important marilacans aboard the pilot lieutenant durham though mortally injured and in shock himself had brought his crippled and burning shuttle into a sufficiently lowvelocity crunch with the triumphs docking clamps that the rescue team was able to seal on an emergency flex tube slice through and retrieve everyone aboard theyd managed to jettison the damaged shuttle just before it exploded and the triumph itself broke orbit barely ahead of serious cetagandan vengeance and so a mission that had started out simple smooth and covert ended yet again in the sort of heroic chaos that miles had come to despise the chaos not the heroism the score after heartbreaking triage twelve seriously injured seven beyond the triumphs resources for resuscitation cryogenically frozen in hope of later help three permanently and finally dead now miles would find out how many of the second category he must move to the third the faces names hundreds of unwanted facts about them cascaded through his mind he had originally planned to be aboard that last shuttle but instead had gone up on an earlier flight to deal with some other forest fire maybe they wont be so bad quinn said reading his face she stuck out her hand and he pulled himself up off the duffle and gathered up his flight bag ive spent so much time in hospitals myself i cant help identifying with them he excused his dark abstraction one perfect mission what he wouldnt give for just one perfect mission where absolutely nothing went wrong maybe the one upcoming would finally be it the hospital smell hit miles immediately when he and quinn walked through the front doors of the beauchene life center the cryotherapy specialty clinic the dendarii dealt with on escobar it wasnt a bad smell not a stench by any means just an odd edge to the airconditioned atmosphere but it was an odor so deeply associated with pain in his experience he found his heart beating faster fight or flight not appropriate he breathed deeply stroking down the visceral throb and looked around the lobby was much in the current style of technopalaces anywhere on escobar clean but cheaply furnished the real money was all invested upstairs in the cryoequipment regeneration laboratories and operating theaters one of the clinics senior partners dr aragones came down to greet them and escort them upstairs to his office miles liked aragones office crammed with the sort of clutter of info disks charts and journalflimsie offprints that indicated a technocrat who thought deeply and continuously about what he was doing he liked aragones himself too a big bluff fellow with bronze skin a noble nose and graying hair friendly and blunt dr aragones was unhappy not to be reporting better results it hurt his pride miles judged you bring us such messes and want miracles he complained gently shifting in his station chair after miles and quinn settled themselves if you want to assure miracles you have to start at the very beginning when my poor patients are first prepared for treatment aragones never called them corpsicles or any of the other nervous nicknames coined by the soldiers always my patients that was another thing miles liked about the escobaran physician in generalunfortunatelyour casualties dont arrive on a scheduled orderly onebyone basis miles halfapologized in turn in this case we had twentyeight people hit sickbay with every degree and sort of injuryextreme trauma burns chemical contaminationall at once triage got brutal for a little while till things sorted out my people did their best he hesitated do you think it would be worth our while to recertify a few of our medtechs in your latest techniques and if so would you be willing to lead the seminar aragones spread his hands and looked thoughtful something might be worked out talk with administrator margara before you go quinn caught miless nod and made a note on her report panel aragones called up charts on his comconsole the worst first we could do nothing for your mr kee or ms zelaski i saw kees head injury im not surprised smashed like a melon but we had the cryochamber available so we tried aragones nodded understanding ms zelaski had a similar problem though less externally obvious so much of her internal cranial circulation was broken during the trauma her blood could not be properly drained from her brain nor the cryofluids properly perfused between the crystalline freezing and the hematomas the neural destruction was complete im sorry their bodies are presently stored in our morgue waiting your instructions kee wished his body to be returned for burial to his family on his homeworld have your mortuary department prepare and ship him through the usual channels well give you the address he jerked his chin at quinn who made another note zelaski listed no family or next of kinsome dendarii just dont or wont and we dont insist but she did once tell some of her squad mates how she wanted her ashes disposed of please have her remains cremated and returned to the triumph in care of our medical department very well aragones signed off the charts on his vid display they disappeared like vanishing spirits he called up others in their place your mr durham and ms vifian are both presently only partially healed from their original injuries both are suffering from what i would call normal neuraltraumatic and cryoamnesia mr durhams memory loss is the more profound partly because of complications due to his pilots neural implants which we alas had to remove will he ever be able to have another headset installed its too early to tell i would call both their longterm prognoses good but neither will be fit to return to their military duties for at least a year and then they will need extensive retraining in both cases i highly recommend they each be returned to their home and family environments if that is possible familiar surroundings will help facilitate and trigger reestablishment of their access to their own surviving memories over time lieutenant durham has family on earth well see he gets there tech vifian is from kline station well see what we can do quinn nodded vigorously and made more notes i can release them to you today then weve done all we can here and ordinary convalescent facilities will do for the rest now that leaves your mr aziz my trooper aziz miles agreed to the claim aziz was three years in the dendarii had applied and been accepted for officers training twentyone years old mr aziz is alive again that is his body sustains itself without artificial aids except for a slight ongoing problem with internal temperature regulation that seems to be improving on its own but aziz didnt have a head wound what went wrong asked miles are you telling me hes going to be a vegetable im afraid mr aziz was the victim of a bad prep his blood was apparently drained hastily and not sufficiently completely small freezing hemocysts riddled his brain tissue with necrotic patches we removed them and started new growth which has taken hold successfully but his personality is permanently lost everything he may perhaps retain a few frustrating fragments of memories dreams but he cannot reaccess his neural pathways through new routes or subroutines because the tissue itself is gone the new man will start over as a nearinfant hes lost language among other things will he recover his intelligence in time aragones hesitated for too long before answering in a few years he may be able to do enough simple tasks to be selfsupporting i see miles sighed what do you want to do with him hes another one with no next of kin listed miles blew out his breath transfer him to a longterm care facility here on escobar one with a good therapy department ill ask you to recommend one ill set up a small trust fund to cover the costs till hes out on his own however long that takes aragones nodded and both he and quinn made notes after settling further administrative and financial details the conference broke up miles insisted on stopping to see aziz before picking up the other two convalescents he cannot recognize you dr aragones warned as they entered the hospital room thats all right at first glance aziz did not look as much like death warmed over as miles had expected despite the unflattering hospital gown there was color and warmth in his face and his natural melanin level saved him from being hospitalpale but he lay listlessly gaunt twisted in his covers the beds sides were up unpleasantly suggesting a crib or a coffin quinn stood against the wall and folded her arms she had visceral associations about hospitals and clinics too azzie miles called softly bending over him azzie can you hear me azizs eyes tracked momentarily but then wandered again i know you dont know me but you might remember this later you were a good soldier smart and strong you stood by your mates in the crash you had the sort of selfdiscipline that saves lives others not your own tomorrow youll go to another sort of hospital where theyll help you keep on getting better among strangers more strangers dont worry about the money im setting it up so itll be there as long as you need it he doesnt know what money is ill check back on you from time to time as i get the opportunity miles promised promised who aziz aziz was no more himself his voice softened to inaudibility as he ran down the aural stimulation made aziz thrash around and emit some loud and formless moans he had no volume control yet apparently even through a filter of desperate hope miles could not recognize it as an attempt at communication animal reflexes only take care he whispered and withdrew to stand a moment trembling in the hallway why do you do that to yourself quinn inquired tartly her crossed arms hugging herself added silently and to me first he died for me literally and second he attempted to force his voice to lightness dont you find a certain obsessive fascination in looking in the face of what you most fear is death what you most fear she asked curiously no not death he rubbed his forehead hesitated loss of mind my game plan all my life has been to demand acceptance of this a vague wave down the length or shortness of his body because i was a smartass little bastard who could think rings around the opposition and prove it time after time without the brains without the brains im nothing he straightened against the aching tension in his belly shrugged and twitched a smile at her march on quinn after aziz durham and vifian were not so hard to deal with they could walk and talk if haltingly and vifian even recognized quinn they took them back to the shuttleport in the rented groundcar and quinn tempered her usual gotohell style of driving in consideration of their halfhealed wounds upon reaching the shuttle miles sent them forward to sit with the pilot a comrade and by the time reached the triumph durham had recalled not only the mans name but some shuttle piloting procedures miles turned both convalescents over to the medtech who met them at the shuttle hatch door who escorted them off to sickbay to bed down again after the exhaustion of their short journey miles watched them exit and felt a little better costly quinn observed reflectively yes miles sighed rehabilitation is starting to take an awfully bite out of the medical departments budget i may have fleet accounting split it off so medical doesnt find itself dangerously shortchanged but what would you have my troops were loyal beyond measure i cannot betray them besides he grinned briefly the barrayaran imperium is paying your impsec boss was on about your bills i thought at your mission briefing illyan has to explain why enough cash to fund a private army keeps disappearing in his department budget every year without ever admitting to the private armys existence certain imperial accountants tend to accuse him of departmental inefficiency which gives him great anguish the dendarii shuttle pilot having shut down his ship ducked into the corridor and sealed the hatch he nodded to miles while i was waiting for you at port beauchene sir i picked up another story on the local news net that you might be interested in local news here on escobar that is the man was bouncing lightly his toes say on sergeant lajoie miles cocked an eyebrow up at him the cetagandans have just announced their withdrawal from marilac theyre calling itwhat was that nowdue to great progress in the cultural alliance we are turning police matters over to local control miless fists clenched joyously in other words theyre abandoning their puppet government ha he hopped from foot to foot and pounded quinn on the back you hear that elli weve won i mean theyve won the marilacans our sacrifices are redeemed he regained control of his tightening throat before he burst into song or some like foolishness do me a favor lajoie pass the word through the fleet tell them i said you folks do good work eh yes sir my pleasure the grinning pilot saluted cheerfully and loped off up the corridor miless grin stretched his face see elli what simon illyan just bought would have been cheap at a thousand times the cost a fullscale cetagandan planetary invasionfirst impededthen boggedthen founderedfailed and in a fierce whisper i did it i made the difference quinn too was smiling but one perfect eyebrow curved in a certain dry irony its lovely but if i was reading between the lines correctly i thought what barrayaran imperial security really wanted was for the cetagandan military to be tied up in the guerilla war on marilac indefinitely draining cetagandan attention away from barrayaran borders and jump points they didnt put that in writing miless lips drew back wolfishly all simon said was help the marilacans as opportunity presents that was the standing order in so many words but you knew damn well what he really wanted four bloody years was enough i have not betrayed barrayar nor anyone else yeah so if simon illyan is so much more machiavellian than you are how is it that your version prevailed someday miles you are going to run out of hairs to split with those people and then what will you do he smiled and shook his head evading answer his elation over the news from marilac still made him feel like he was walking in halfgravity when he arrived at his cabin aboard the triumph after a surreptitious glance to be sure the corridor was unpeopled he embraced and kissed quinn a deep kiss that was going to have to last them for a long while and she went off to her own quarters he slipped inside and echoed the doors closing sigh with his own home again it was home for half his psyche he reflected tossing his flight bag onto his bed and heading directly for the shower ten years ago lord miles vorkosigan had invented the cover identity of admiral naismith out of his head in a desperate moment and frantically faked his way to temporary control of the hastily renamed dendarii mercenaries barrayaran imperial security had discovered the cover to be useful no credit where it was due he had persuaded schemed demonstrated and coerced impsec into finding use for this cover be careful what you pretend to be you might become it when had admiral naismith stopped being a pretense gradually surely but mostly since his mercenary mentor commodore tung had retired or perhaps the wily tung had recognized before miles had that his services in propping miles up to his prematurely exalted rank were no longer required colored vid arrays of dendarii free mercenary fleet organization bloomed in miless head as he showered personnelequipmentadministrationlogisticshe knew every ship every trooper every shuttle and piece of ordnance now he knew how they fit together what had to be done first second third twentieth how to place a precisely calculated force at any point on the tactical field this was expertise to he able to look at a ship like the triumph and see with his minds eye right through the walls to every engineering detail every strength and vulnerability to look at a commando raid or a briefing table ringed with captains and captainowners and know what each one would do or say before they knew it themselves im on top finally im on top of it all with this lever i can move worlds he switched the shower to dry and turned in the blast warm air he left the bathroom still chortling under his breath i like it his chortle died away in puzzlement when he unlatched the door to his uniform cupboard and found it bare had his batman taken them all off for cleaning or repairs his bewilderment grew as he looked other drawers and found only a residue of the wildly assorted virilian togs he wore when he stretched the chain of his identity one link further and played spy for the dendarii plus some of his shabbier underwear was this some sort of practical joke if so hed have have the last laugh naked and irritated he snapped open the locker where his space armor dwelt empty that was almost shocking somebodys taken it down to engineering to recalibrate it or add tactics programs or something his batman should have returned it by now though what if he needed it in a hurry time his people would be gathering quinn had once claimed he could carry on naked and only make those around him feel overdressed he was momentarily tempted to test her assertion but overcame the mordant vision and put the shirt and trousers and sandals hed been wearing back on he didnt need a uniform in order to dominate a briefing room not any more on the way to the meeting he passed sandy hereld in the corridor coming off duty and gave her a friendly nod she wheeled and walked backward in startlement youre back sir that was quick he would hardly describe his severalweek journey to imperial hq barrayar as quick she must mean the trip downside it only took two hours what her nose wrinkled she was still walking backwards reached the end of the corridor he had a briefing room full of senior officers waiting he waved and swung down a lift tube the briefing room was comfortingly familiar right down to the array of faces around the darkly shining table captain auson of the triumph elena botharijesek recently promoted captain of the peregrine her husband commodore baz jesek fleet engineer and in charge in miless absence of all the repair and refit activities of the dendarii fleet in escobar orbit the couple barrayarans themselves were with quinn among the handful of dendarii apprised of miless double identity captain truzillo of the jayhawk and a dozen more all tested and true his people bel thorne of the ariel was late that was unusual one of thornes driving characteristics was an insatiable curiosity a new mission briefing was like a winterfair gift to the betan hermaphrodite miles turned to elena botharijesek to make small talk while they waited did you get a chance to visit your mother downside on escobar yes thanks she smiled it was nice to have a little time we had a chance to talk about some things wed never talked about the first time we met it had been good for both of them miles judged some of the permanent strain seemed gone from elenas dark eyes better and better bit by bit good he glanced up as the doors hissed open but it was only quinn blowing in with the secured files in hand she was back in full officers undress kit and looking very comfortable and efficient she handed the files to miles and he loaded them into the comconsole and waited another minute still no bel thorne talk died away his officers were giving him attentive letsgetonwithit looks hed better not stand around much longer with his thumb in his ear before bringing the console display to life he inquired is there some reason captain thorne is late they looked at him and then at each other there cant be something wrong with bel it would have been reported to me first thing still a small leaden knot materialized in the pit of his stomach where is bel thorne by eye they elected elena botharijesek as spokesperson that was an extremely bad sign miles she said hesitantly was bel supposed to be back before you back where did bel go she was looking at him as though hed lost his mind bel left with you in the ariel three days ago quinns head snapped up thats impossible three days ago we were still en route to escobar miles stated the leaden knot was transmuting into neutron star matter he was not dominating this room at all well in fact it seemed to be tilting you took green squad with you it was the new contract bel said elena added this is the new contract miles tapped the comconsole a hideous explanation was beginning to suggest itself to his mind rising from the black hole in his stomach the looks on the faces around the table were also beginning to divide into two uneven camps appalled surmise from the minority who had been in on that mess on earth two years agooh they were right with himtotal confusion from the majority who had not been directly involved where did i say i was going miles inquired his tone was he thought gentle but several people flinched jacksons whole elena looked him straight in the eye with much the steady gaze of a zoologist about to dissect a specimen a sudden lack of trust jacksons whole that tears it bel thorne the ariel taura within ten jumps of jacksons whole miles choked dear god but if youre you said truzillo who was that three days ago if youre you said elena darkly the initiate crowd were all getting that same frowning look you see miles explained in a hollow voice to the whatthehellaretheytalkingabout portion of the room some people have an evil twin i am not so lucky what i have is an idiot twin your clone said elena botharijesek my brother he corrected automatically little mark pierre said quinn oh shit chapter three his stomach seemed to turn inside out the cabin wavered and shadow darkened his vision the bizarre sensations of the wormhole jump were gone almost as soon as they began but left an unpleasant somatic reverberation as if he were a struck gong he took a deep calming breath that had been the fourth jump of the voyage five jumps to go on the tortuous zigzag through the wormhole nexus from escobar to jacksons whole the ariel had been three days en route almost halfway he glanced around naismiths cabin he could not continue to hide out in here much longer pretense of illness or naismithian black mood or not thorne needed every bit of data he could supply to plan the dendarii raid on the clonecreche he had used his hibernation well scanning the ariels mission logs back through time all the way past his first encounter with the dendarii two years ago he now knew a great deal more about the mercenaries and the thought of casual conversation with the ariels crew was far less terrifying unfortunately there was very little in the mission log to help him reconstruct what his first meeting with naismith on earth had looked like from the dendarii point of view the log had concentrated on rehabilitation and refit reports dickerings with assorted ships chandlers and engineering briefings hed found exactly one order pertinent to his own adventures embedded in the data flow advising all ship masters that admiral naismiths clone had been seen on earth warning that the clone might attempt to pass himself off as the admiral giving the incorrect information that the clones legs would show up on a medical scan as normal hone and not plastic replacements and ordering use of stunnersonly in apprehending the imposter no explanations no later revisions or updates all of naismithvorkosigans highestlevel orders tended to be verbal and undocumented anyway for securityfrom the dendarii not for thema habit that had just served him well he leaned back in his station chair and glowered at the comconsole display the dendarii data named him mark thats another thing you dont get to choose miles naismith vorkosigan had said mark pierre you are lord mark pierre vorkosigan in your own right on barrayar but he was not on barrayar nor ever would be if he could help it you are not my brother and the butcher of komarr was never a father to me his thought denied for the thousandth time to his absent progenitor my mother was a uterine replicator but the power of the suggestion had ridden him ever after sapping his satisfaction with every pseudonym hed ever tried though hed stared at lists of names till his eyes ached dramatic names plain names exotic strange common silly jan vandermark was the alias hed used the longest the closest sideways skittish approach to identity mark miles had shouted being dragged away for all he knew to his own death your name is mark i am not mark i am not your damned brother you maniac the denial was hot and huge but when its echoes died away in the hollow chamber left inside his skull he seemed not to be anyone at all his head was aching a grinding tightness that crawled up his spine through his shoulders and neck and spread out under his scalp he rubbed hard at his neck but the tension just circulated around through his arms and back into his shoulders not his brother but to be strictly accurate naismith could not be blamed for forcing him to life in the same way as the other house bharaputran clones progenitors oh they were genetically identical yes it was a matter of intent perhaps and where the money came from lord miles naismith vorkosigan had been just six years old when the tissue sample from a biopsy was stolen from some clinical laboratory on barrayar during the last gasp of komarran resistance to barrayaran imperial conquest no one neither barrayaran nor komarran was intrinsically interested in the crippled child miles the focus had all been on his father admiral count aral vorkosigan regent of barrayar conqueror or butcher of komarr aral vorkosigan had supplied the will and the wit which had made komarr into barrayars first offplanet conquest and made himself the target of komarran resistance and revenge hope for successful resistance had faded in time hope for revenge lived on in exiled bitterness stripped of an army arms support one komarran hate group plotted a slow mad vengeance to strike at the father through the son upon whom he was known to dote like a sorcerer in an old tale the komarrans dealt with a devil to have a simulacrum made a bastard clone he thought with a silent humorless laugh but things went wrong the crippled original boy poisoned before birth by yet another murderous enemy of his fathers grew strangely unpredictably his genetic duplicate grew straight that had been his first clue that he was different from the other clones he reflected when the other clones went to the doctors for treatment they came back stronger healthier growing everfaster every time he went and he went often their painful treatments seemed to make him sicklier more stunted the braces they put on his bones neck back never seemed to help much they had made him into this hunchbacked dwarfling as if molding him in a press diecut from a cast of his progenitor i could have been normal if miles vorkosigan had not been crippled when he first began to suspect the true purpose of his fellow clones for rumors passed among the children in wild ways even their careful handlers could not totally control his growing somatic deformations brought him silent suppressed joy surely they could not use this body for a brain transplant he might be discardedhe might yet escape his pleasant smiling jailerservants his real escape when his komarran owners came to collect him at age fourteen was like a miracle and then the training had begun the endless harsh tutoring drill indoctrination at first a destiny any destiny at all seemed glorious compared to his crechemates end he determinedly took up the training to replace his progenitor and strike a blow for dear komarr a place he had never seen against evil barrayar a place he had never seen either but learning to be miles vorkosigan turned out to be like running the race in zenos paradox no matter how much he learned how frantically he drilled how harshly his mistakes were punished miles learned more faster by the time he arrived his quarry had always moved on intellectually or otherwise the symbolic race became literal once his komarran tutors actually moved to effect the substitution they chased the elusive young lord vorkosigan halfway around the wormhole nexus never realizing that when he vanished he utterly ceased to exist and admiral naismith appeared the komarrans had never found out about admiral naismith not planning but chance had finally brought them together two years ago on earth right back where the whole stupid race had started in pursuit of a vengeance gone twenty years cold the timedelay had been critical in a way the komarrans had not even noticed when they first began chasing vorkosigan their customized clone had been at the peak of his mental conditioning committed to the goals of the revolt unreflectingly eager had they not saved him from the fate of clones eighteen months of watching them screw up eighteen months of travel observation exposure to uncensored news views even a few people had planted secret doubts in his mind and bluntly one could not duplicate even an imitation of a galacticclass education like vorkosigans without inadvertently learning something about how to think in the middle of it all the surgery to replace his perfectly sound leg bones with synthetics just because vorkosigan had smashed his had been stunningly painful what if vorkosigan broke his neck next time realization had crept over him stuffing his head full of lord vorkosigan in bits over time was just as much of a brain transplant as anything done with vibrascalpels and living tissue he who plots revenge must dig two graves but the komarrans had dug the second grave for him for the person he never had a chance to become the man he might have been if he had not been forced at shockstick point to continually struggle to be someone else some days he was not sure who he hated more house bharaputra the komarrans or miles naismith vorkosigan he shut off the comconsole with a snort and rose to pick out his precious data cube from the uniform pocket in which it was still hidden upon reflection he cleaned up and depilated again before donning fresh dendarii officers undress greys that was as regulation as he could make himself let the dendarii see only the polished surface and not the man inside the man inside he steeled himself exited the cabin stepped across the corridor and pressed the buzzer to the hermaphrodite captains quarters no response he pressed it again after a short delay thornes blurred alto voice came yes naismith here oh come in miles the voice sharpened with interest the door slid aside and he stepped within to realize that the reason for the delay was that hed woken thorne from sleep the hermaphrodite was sitting up on one elbow in bed brown hair tousled its free hand falling away from the keypad which had released the door excuse me he said stepping backward but the door had already sealed again no its all right the hermaphrodite smiled sleepily curled its body in a c and patted the bed invitingly in front of its sheeted lap for you anytime come sit would you like a back rub you look tense it was wearing a decidedly frilly nightgown flowing silk with lace trim edging a plunging vee neckline that revealed the swelling pale flesh of its breasts he sidled to a station chair instead thornes smile took on a peculiarly sardonic tinge even while remaining perfectly relaxed he cleared his throat i thought it was time for that more detailed mission briefing i promised i should have checked the dutyroster would admiral naismith have known the captains sleepcycle time and past time im glad to see you come up out of the fog what the hell have you been doing wherever you went for the past eight weeks miles who died no one well eight clones i suppose hm thorne nodded wry acknowledgment the seductive sinuosity faded from its posture and it sat up straight and rubbed the last of the sleep from its eyes tea sure or uh i could come back after your sleepshift or after youre dressed it swung its silkswathed legs from the bed no way id be up in an hour anyway ive been waiting for this seize the day it padded across the cabin to do its tearitual again he set up the data cube in the comconsole and paused both polite and practical for the captain to take its first sips of the hot black liquid and come fully awake he wished it would put its uniform on he keyed up the display as thorne wandered close i have a detailed holomap of house bharaputras main medical complex this data is not more than four months old plus guard schedules and patrol patternstheir security is much heavier than a normal civilian hospital more like a military laboratory but its no fortress their everyday concern is more against individual local intruders intent on theft and of course in preventing certain of their less voluntary patients from escaping a significant chunk of his former fortune had gone into that map cube the colorcoded image spread itself in lines and sheets of light above the vid plate the complex was truly that a vast warren of buildings tunnels therapygardens labs minimanufacturing areas flyer pads warehouses garages and even two shuttle docks for direct departure to planetary orbit thorne put down its cup leaned over the comconsole and stared with interest it took up the remote control and turned the mapimage shrank and expanded and sliced it so do we want to start by capturing the shuttle bays no the clones are all kept together over here on the west side in this sort of hospice area i figure if we land here in this exercise court well be damn near on top of their dormitory naturally im not overly concerned about what the drop shuttle damages coming down naturally a brief grin flickered over the captains face timing i want to make it a night drop not so much for cover because heres no way were going to make a combat drop shuttle inconspicuous but because thats the one time all the clones are together in a mall area in the day theyre all spread out in the exercise and play areas the swimming pool and whatnot and classrooms no not exactly they dont teach em much beyond the minimum necessary for socialization if a clone can count to twenty and read signs thats all they need throwaway brains that had been the other way hed known he was different from the rest a real human tutor had introduced him to a vast array of virtual learning programs hed lost himself for days at a time in the computers patient praise unlike his komarran tutors later they repeated themselves endlessly and never punished him never swore or raged or struck or forced him to physical exertion till he grew sick or passed out the clones pick up a surprising amount of information despite it all though a lot from their holovid games bright kids damn few of these clones have stupid progenitors or they wouldnt have amassed a sufficient fortune to buy this form of lifeextension ruthless maybe but not stupid thornes eyes narrowed as it dissected the area on the vid taking apart the buildings layer by later studying the layout so a dozen fullkit dendarii commandos wake fifty or sixty kids out of a sound sleep in the middle of the night do they know were coming no by the way make sure the troops realize they wont look exactly like kids were taking them in their last year of development theyre mostly ten or eleven years old but due to the growth accelerators they will appear to have the bodies of late teenagers gawky not really they get great physical conditioning healthy as hell thats the whole point of not just growing them in a vat till transplant time do they know know whats going to happen to them thorn e asked with an introspective frown theyre not told no theyre told all kinds of lies variously theyre told theyre in a special school for security reasons to save them from some exotic danger that theyre all some kind of prince or princess or rich mans heir or military scion and someday very soon their parents or their aunts or their ambassadors are going to come and take them away to some glamorous future and then of course at last some smiling person comes and calls them away from their playmates and tells them that today is the day and they run he stopped swallowed and snatch up their things and brag to their friends thorne was tapping the vid control unconsciously in its palm and looking pale i get the picture and walk out handinhand with their murderers eagerly you can stop with the scenariospinning unless youre trying to make me lose my last meal what youve known for years that this was going on he mocked why get all squeamish about it now he bit off his bitterness naismith he must be naismith thorne shot him a sharp glare i was ready to fry them from orbit the last time as you may recall you wouldnt let me what last time no time in the last three years hed have to scan the mission logs back even further dammit he shrugged ambiguously so said thorne are these big kids all going to decide were their parents enemies kidnapping them just before they go home i see trouble here he clenched and spread the fingers of his right hand maybe not children have a culture of their own passed down from year to year there are rumors boogeyman stories doubts i told you they arent stupid their adult handlers try to stamp out the stories or make fun of them or mix them up with other obvious lies and yet they had not fooled him but then he had lived in the creche much longer than the average hed had time to see more clones come and go time to see stories repeated pseudobiographies duplicated time for their handlers tiny slips and mistakes to accumulate in his observation if its the same if its the same as it was in my time he almost said but saved himself i should be able to persuade them leave that part to me gladly thorne swung a console chair into clamps close beside his settled down and rapidly entered some notes on logistics and angle of attack pointmen and backups and traced projected routes through the buildings two dormitories it pointed curiously thornes fingernails were cut blunt undecorated yes the boys are kept segregated from the girls rather carefully the femaleusually femalecustomers expect to wake up in a body with the seal of virginity still on it i see so we get all these kids loaded by some miracle before the bharaputrans arrive in force speed is of the essence yes as usual but the bharaputrans will be all over us if there is any little hitch or holdup unlike with the marilacans at dagoola iv i havent had weeks and weeks to drill these kids on shuttleloading procedures what if then once the clones are loaded into the shuttle they become in effect our hostages well be safe from lethal fire with them aboard the bharaputrans wont risk their investment as long as any chance of recovery remains once they decide all chance is lost theyll seek vigorous retribution to discourage imitators though true we must cloud their minds with doubt then their next moveif we get the shuttle airbornemust be to try to blow up the ariel in orbit before we get there cutting off our escape speed he repeated doggedly contingencies miles dear wake up i dont usually have to restart your brain in the morningdo you want some more tea no i suggest if we suffer dangerous delay downside that the ariel take refuge at fell station and we rendezvous with it there fell station the orbital one he hesitated why baron fell is still in a state of vendetta with bharaputra and ryoval isnt he jacksonian internecine house politics he was not as current on them as he should be he had not even thought of looking for an ally among the other houses they were all criminal all evil tolerating or sabotaging each other in shifting patterns of power and here was ryoval mentioned again why he took refuge in another wordless shrug getting pinned trapped on fell station with fifty young clones while bharaputra hustles for control of the jumppoint stations would not improve our position no jacksonian is to be trusted run and jump as fast as we can is still the safest strategy bharaputra wont swing jumpstation five into line its fellowned yes but i want to return to escobar the clones can all get safe asylum there look miles the jump back on this route is held by the consortium already dominated by bharaputra well never get back out the way we jump in unless youve got something up your sleeveno then may i suggest our best escape route is via jumppoint five do you really see fell as so reliable an ally he inquired cautiously not at all but he is the enemy of our enemies this trip but the jump from five leads to the hegen hub we cant jump into cetagandan territory and the only other route out of the hub is to komarr via pol roundabout but much safer not for me thats the damned barrayaran empire he swallowed a wordless shriek the hub to pol to komarr to sergyar and back to escobar thorne recited happily you know this could really work out it made more notes leaning across the comconsole its nightgown shifting and shimmering in the candy lights of the vid display then it put its elbows on the console and rested its chin in its hands breasts compressing shifting beneath the thin fabric its expression grew gently introspective it glanced up at him at last with an odd rather sad smile have any clones ever escaped thorne asked softly no he answered quickly automatically except for your own clone of course a dangerous turn in the conversation my clone did not escape either he was simply removed by his purchasers he should have tried to escape what life might he have led had he succeeded fifty kids thorne sighed yknowi really approve of this mission it waited watching him with sharp and gleaming eyes acutely uncomfortable he suppressed an idiocy such as saying thank you but found himself with no remark to put in its place resulting in an awkward silence i suppose said thorne thoughtfully after the toolong moment it would be very difficult for anyone brought up in such an environment to really trust anyone else anyones word their good will i suppose was this casual conversation or something more sinister a trap thorne still with that weird mysterious smile leaned across their station chairs caught his chin in one strong slender hand and kissed him he did not know if he was supposed to recoil or respond so did neither in crosseyed panicked paralysis thornes mouth was warm and tasted of tea and bergamot silky and perfumed was naismith screwingthistoo if so who did what to whom or did they take turns and would it really be that bad his terror heightened with an undeniable stirring of arousal i believe i would die for a lovers touch he had been alone forever thorne withdrew at last to his intense relief though only a little way its hand still trapping his chin after another moment of dead silence its smile grew wry i shouldnt tease you i suppose it sighed there is a sort of cruelty in it all things considered it released him and stood the sensuous langour abruptly switched off back in a minute it strode to its cabin washroom sealing the door behind it he sat unstrung and shaking what the hell was that all about and from another part of his mind you could lose your damned virginity this trip i bet and from another no not with that had that been a test but had he passed or failed thorne had not cried out in accusation nor called for armed backup perhaps the captain was arranging his arrest right now by comm link from the washroom there was no place to run away aboard a small ship in deep space his crossed arms hugged his torso with effort he uncrossed them placed his hands on the console and willed his muscles to uncoil they probably wont kill me theyd take him back to the fleet and let naismith kill him but no security squad broke down the door and soon enough thorne returned nattily dressed in its uniform at last it plucked the data cube from the comconsole and closed its palm over it ill sit down with sergeant taura and this and do some serious planning then ah yes its time he hated to let the precious cube out of his sight but it seemed he was still naismith in thornes eyes thorne pursed its lips now that its time to brief the crew dont you think it would be a good idea to put the ariel on a communications blackout an outstanding idea though one hed been afraid to suggest as too suspicious and strange maybe it wasnt so unusual on these covert ops hed had no certain idea as to when the real naismith was supposed to return to the dendarii fleet but from the mercenaries easy acceptance of him it had to have been expected soon hed lived for the past three days in fear of frantic orders arriving by tightbeam and jumpcourier from the real admiral telling the ariel to turn around give me a few more days just a few more days and ill redeem it all yes do so very good sir thorne hesitated how are you feeling now everybody knows these black miasmas of yours can run for weeks but if only youll rest properly i trust youll be your usual energetic self in time for the drop mission shall i pass the word to leave you alone i would appreciate that bel what luck but keep me informed eh oh yes you can count on me its a straightforward raid except for handling that herd of kids in which i defer to your superior expertise right with a smile and a cheery salute he fled across the corridor to the safe isolation of his own cabin the pulsing combination of elation and his tension headache made him feel as if he were floating when the door sealed behind him he fell across his bed and gripped the coverings to hold himself in place its really going to happen later diligently scanning ships logs on his cabin comconsole he finally found the fouryearold records of the ariels previous visit to jacksons whole such as they were they started out with utterly boring details about an ordnance deal inventory entries regarding a cargo of weapons to be loaded from house fells orbital transfer station completely without preamble thornes breathless voice made a cryptic entry murkas lost the admiral hes being held prisoner by baron ryoval im going now to make a devils bargain with fell then records of an emergency combat drop shuttle trip downside followed by the ariels abrupt departure from fell station with cargo only half loaded these events were succeeded by two fascinating unexplained conversations between admiral naismith and baron ryoval and baron fell respectively ryoval was raving sputtering exotic death threats he studied the barons contorted handsome face uneasily even in a society that prized ruthlessness ryoval was a man whom other jacksonian powerbrokers stepped wide around admiral naismith appeared to have stepped right in something fell was more controlled a cold anger as usual all the really essential information including the reason for the visit in the first place was lost in naismiths verbal orders but he did manage to gather the surprising fact that the eightfoottall commando sergeant taura was a product of house bharaputras genetics laboratories a geneticallyengineered prototype supersoldier it was like unexpectedly meeting someone from ones old home town in a weird wash of homesickness he longed to look her up and compare notes naismith had apparently stolen her heart or at least stolen her away although that did not seem to be the offense ryoval was foaming about it was all rather incomprehensible he did garner one other unpleasant fact baron fell was a wouldbe clone consumer his old enemy ryoval in a move of vendetta had apparently arranged to have fells clone murdered before the transplant could take place trapping fell in his aging body but the intent was there regardless of bel thornes contingency planning he resolved he would have nothing to do with baron fell if he could help it he blew out his breath shut down the comconsole and went back to practicing simulations with the command headset helmet a manufacturers training program that happily had never been deleted from its memory im going to bring this off somehow chapter four no reply from the ariel from this courierhop either sir lieutenant hereld reported apologetically miless fists clenched in frustration he forced his hands flat again along his trouser seams but the energy only flowed to his feet and he began to pace from wall to wall in the triumphs nav and com room thats the thirdthird you have been repeating the message with every courier yes sir the third noreply dammit whats holding bel up lieutenant hereld shrugged helplessly at this rhetorical question miles recrossed the room frowning fiercely damn the timelag he wanted to know what was happening right now tightbeam communications crossed a localspace region at the speed of light but the only way to get information through a wormhole was to physically record it put it on a jumpship and jump it through to the next relay station where it was beamed to the next wormhole and jumped again if it was economically worthwhile to maintain such a service in regions of heavy message traffic such couriers jumped as often as every halfhour or even oftener between escobar and jacksons whole the couriers maintained an everyfourhours schedule so on top of the delay from the speed of light limitation was added this other arbitrary human one such a delay could be quite useful sometimes to people playing complex games with interstellar finances exchange rates and futures or to independentminded subordinates wishing to conceal excess information about their activities from their superior officersmiles had occasionally used the lag for that purpose himself a couple of clarification requests and their replies could buy enough time to bring off all sorts of events that was why hed made certain his recall order to the ariel was personal forceful and crystalclear but bel had not returned some counterfeitdemure what do you mean by that sir bel had not replied at all its not some fault in the couriersystem is it other trafficis other traffic on the route getting their messages through yes sir i checked information flow is normal all the way through to jacksons whole they did file a flight plan to jacksons whole they did actually jump through that exitpoint yes sir four bleeding days ago now he considered his mental picture of the wormhole nexus no mapped jumps leading off this standard shortest route from escobar to jacksons whole had ever been discovered to go anywhere of interest he could not imagine bel choosing this moment to play betan astronomical survey and go exploring there was the very rare ship that jumped through some perfectly standard route but never materialized on the other side converted to an unrecoverable smear of quarks in the fabric of spacetime by some subtle malfunction in the ships necklin rods or the pilots neurological control system the jump couriers kept track of traffic on such a heavily commercialized route as this though and would have reported such a disappearance promptly he camewas drivento decision and that alone heated his temper a few more degrees he had grown unaccustomed of late to being chivvied into any action by events not under his own control this was not in my plans for the day blast it all right sandy call me a staff meeting captain quinn captain botharijesek commodore jesek in the triumphs briefing room as soon as they can assemble hereld raised her brows at the list of names even as her hands moved over the comconsole interface to comply inner circle all serious shit sir he managed an edged smile and tried to lighten his voice seriously annoying only lieutenant not quite what had his idiot baby brother mark in mind to do with that commando squad hed requisitioned a dozen fullyequipped dendarii troopers were not trivial firepower yet compared to the military resources of say house bharaputra enough force to get into a hell of a lot of trouble but not enough force to shoot their way back out the thought of his peopletaura godblindly following the ignorant mark into some tactical insanity trustingly thinking it was him drove him wild inside klaxons howled and red lights flashed in his head bel why arent you answering miles found himself pacing in the triumphs main briefing room too around and around the big main tac display table until quinn raised her chin from her hands to growl will you please sit down quinn was not as anxious as he she was not biting her fingernails yet the ends remained neat uneclipsed halfmoons he found that faintly reassuring he swung into a station chair one of his booted feet began tapping on the friction matting quinn eyed it frowned opened her mouth closed it and shook her head he stilled the foot and bared his teeth at her in a quick false grin happily before his nervous energy could materialize into some even more irritating compulsive twitch baz jesek arrived elena is podding over from the peregrine right now baz reported seating himself in his usual station chair and by habit calling up the fleet engineering ops interface from the comconsole she should be along in just a few minutes good thanks miles nodded the engineer had been a tall thin darkhaired tensely unhappy man in his late twenties when miles had first met him almost a decade ago at the birth of the dendarii mercenaries the outfit had then consisted only of miles his barrayaran bodyguard his bodyguards daughter one obsolete freighter slated for scrap and its suicidally depressed jump pilot and an illconceived getrichquick armssmuggling scheme miles had sworn baz in as a liegeman to lord vorkosigan before admiral naismith had even been invented now in his late thirties baz remained just as thin with slightly less dark hair and just as quiet but possessed of a serene selfconfidence he reminded miles of a heron stalking in some reedy lakemargin all long stillnesses and economical motions as promised elena botharijesek entered the chamber shortly thereafter and seated herself beside her engineerhusband both being on duty they limited the demonstration of their reunion to the exchange of a smile and a quick handtouch under the table she spared a smile for miles too secondly of all the dendarii inner circle who knew him as lieutenant lord vorkosigan elena was surely the deepest inside her father the late sergeant bothari had been miless liegesworn armsman and personal protector from the day miles had been born age mates miles and elena had been practically raised together since countess vorkosigan had taken a maternal interest in the motherless girl elena knew admiral naismith lord vorkosigan and justplainmiles as thoroughlyperhaps more thoroughlyas anyone in the universe and had chosen to marry baz jesek instead miles found it comforting and useful to think of elena as his sister fostersister she nearly was in truth she was as tall as her tall husband with cropped ebony hair and pale ivory skin he could still see the echo of borzoifaced sergeant bothari in the aquiline bones of her features botharis leaden ugliness transmuted to her golden beauty by some genetic alchemy elena i still love you dammit he clipped off the thought he had quinn now or anyway the admiral naismith half of him did as a dendarii officer elena was his finest creation hed watched her grow from a shy angry offbalance girl barred from military service on barrayar by her gender to squad leader to covert operative to staff officer to shipmaster the retired commodore tung had once named her his secondbest military apprentice ever miles sometimes wondered how much of his ongoing maintenance of the dendarii mercenaries was really service to imperial security how much was the wild selfindulgence of a very questionable aspect of his own facetedor fracturedpersonality and how much was a secret gift to elena bothari botharijesek the true springs of history could be murky indeed theres still no word from the ariel miles began without preamble no formalities required with this group deep insiders all he could dare to think out loud in front of them he could feel his mind relax reblending admiral naismith and lord vorkosigan he could even let his accent waver from naismiths strict betan drawl and allow a few barrayaran gutterals to slip in with the swear words there were going to be swear words this staff meeting he was fairly sure i want to go after them quinn drummed her nails on the table once i expected you would therefore could little mark be expecting it too hes studied you hes got your number could this be a trap remember how he diddled you the last time miles winced i remember the possibility that this is some kind of setup has crossed my mind thats one reason i didnt take off after them twenty hours ago right after the embarrassing hastilydismissed full staff meeting hed been in the mood for fratricide on the spot assuming as seems reasonable that bel was fooled at firstand i dont see why not everybody else wasthe timelag might have given mark a chance to slip up and bel to see the light but in that case the recall order should have brought the ariel back mark does do an awfully good you quinn observed from personal experience or at least he did two years ago if youre not expecting the possibility of a double he seems just like you on one of your off days his exterior appearance was perfect but bel does know of the possibility elena put in yes said miles so maybe bel hasnt been fooled maybe bels been spaced mark would need the crew or a crew to run the ship said baz though he might have had a new crew waiting farside if hed been planning such outright piracy and murder hed hardly have taken a dendarii commando squad along to resist it reason could be very reassuring sometimes sometimes miles took a breath or maybe bel has been suborned baz raised his brows quinn unconsciously closed her teeth upon but did not bite through the little fingernail of her right hand suborned how said elena not by money her smile twisted up dyou figure bels finally given up trying to seduce you and is looking for the next best thing thats not funny miles snapped baz converted a suspicious snort into a careful cough and met his glare blandly but then lost it and sniggered at any rate its an old joke miles conceded wearily but it depends upon what mark is up to on jacksons whole the kind of hell outright slavery practiced by the various jacksonian bodysculptors is a deep offense to bels progressive betan soul if mark is thinking of taking some kind of bite out of his old home planet he just might talk bel into going along with it at fleet expense baz inquired that does verge on mutiny miles agreed reluctantly im not accusing im just speculating trying to see all the possibilities in that case is it possible marks destination isnt jacksons whole at all said baz there are four other jumps out of jacksonian local space maybe the ariel is just passing through physically possible yes said miles psychologically ive studied mark too and while i cant say that i have his number i know jacksons whole looms large in his life its only a gutfeeling but its a strong gutfeeling like a bad case of indigestion how did we get blindsided by mark this time elena asked i thought impsec was supposed to be keeping track of him for us they are i get regular reports from illyans office miles said the last report which i read at impsec headquarters not three weeks ago put mark still on earth but its the damn timelag if he left earth say four or five weeks ago that report is still in transit from earth to illyan on barrayar and back to me ill bet you betan dollars to anything you please that we get a coded message from hq in the next few days earnestly warning us that mark has dropped out of sight again again said elena has he dropped out of sight before a couple of times three actually miles hesitated you see every once in a whilethree times in the last two yearsive tried to contact him myself invited him to come in come to barrayar or at least to meet with me every time hes panicked gone underground and changed his identityhes rather good at it from all the time he spent as a prisoner of the komarran terroristsand it takes illyans people weeks or months to locate him again illyans asked me not to try to contact mark any more without his authorization he brooded mother wants him to come in so much but she wont have illyan order him kidnapped at first i agreed with her but now i wonder as your clone he began baz brother miles corrected instantly brother i reject the term clone for mark i forbid it clone implies something interchangeable a brother is someone unique and i assure you mark is unique in guessing marks next moves baz began again more carefully can we even use reason is he sane if he is its not the komarrans fault miles rose and began pacing again around the table despite quinns exasperated look he avoided her eyes and watched his boots grey on grey against the friction matting instead after we finally discovered his existence illyan had his agents do every kind of background check on him they could partly to make up for the acute embarrassment of impsecs having missed him all these years i think ive seen all the reports trying and trying to get inside marks mind around the corner down the other side and back his life in bharaputras clonecreche didnt seem too badthey coddle those bodiesbut after the komarran insurgents picked him up i gather it got pretty nightmarish they kept training him to be me but every time they thought theyd got it id do something unexpected and they had to start over they kept changing and elaborating their plans the plot dragged on for years after the time theyd first hoped to bring it off they were a small group operating on a shoestring anyway their leader ser galen was halfmad himself i think around and around part of the time galen would treat mark like the great hope for a komarran uprising or pet him and set him up with the idea that they were going to make him emperor of barrayar in a coup but part of the time galen would slip a cog and see mark as the personal genetic representative of our father and make him whippingboy for all his hatred of the vorkosigans and barrayar disguising the most ferocious punishments tortures reallyfrom himself and maybe even from markas training discipline illyans agent had some of this from a rather illegal fastpenta interrogation of an exsubordinate of galens so its flat truth around and around for example apparently marks and my metabolisms are not the same so whenever marks weight exceeded my parameters instead of doing the intelligent thing and having marks appetite medically adjusted galen would first withhold food for days then let him gorge and then force him at shockstick point to exercise till he vomited weird stuff like that really disturbing galen apparently had a hairtrigger temper at least where mark was concerned or maybe he was deliberately trying to make mark crazy create a mad emperor miles to replay mad emperor yuris reign and destroy the barrayaran government from the top down oncethis fellow reportedmark tried to get a night out just a night out and actually got away for a while till galens goons brought him back galen went nuts accused him of trying to escape took his shockstick and his eye caught elenas paling face and he hastily edited his nervous outburst and did some ugly things which couldnt have helped marks sexual adjustment any it had been so bad that galens own goons had begged him to stop according to the informant no wonder he hated galen said quinn softly elenas glance was rather sharper theres nothing you could have done you didnt even know mark existed back then we should have known right so to what extent is this retroactive guilt distorting your thinking right now admiral some i suspect he admitted thats why i called you all here i feel the need of a crosscheck on this he paused and forced himself to sit again thats not the only reason however before this mess with the ariel leaped out of the wormhole i had started out to give you a real bona fide mission assignment ah ha said baz with satisfaction at last the new contract despite his distractions he smiled before mark showed up i had it figured for a mission where nothing could possibly go wrong an allexpensespaid vacation what a nocombatspecial quipped elena i thought you always looked down on old admiral oser for those ive changed he felt as ever a brief flash of regret for the late admiral oser his command philosophy looks better all the time im growing old i guess or up suggested elena they exchanged a dry look in any case miles continued barrayaran high command wishes to supply a certain independent deepspace transfer station with a better grade of weaponry than they presently own vega station is not coincidentally just off one of the cetagandan empires back doors however said vacuumrepublic is in an awkward junction in the wormhole nexus quinn the map please quinn keyed up a threedimensional holovid schematic of vega station and its neighbors the jump routes were represented by sparkling jagged lines between hazy spheres of local space systems of the three jump points vega station commands one leads into the cetagandan sphere of influence via its satrapy ola three one is blocked by a sometimescetagandanally sometimesenemy toranira and the other is held by zoave twilight politically neutral with respect to cetaganda but wary of its big neighbor as he spoke of it quinn highlighted each system vega station is outright blockaded through ola three and toranira against the import of any kind of major spacebased offensive or defensive weapons systems zoave twilight under pressure from cetaganda is reluctantly cooperating with the arms embargo so where do we come in asked baz literally through toranira were smuggling packhorses what said baz though elena caught the reference and suddenly smirked youve never heard that story from barrayaran history it goes count selig vorkosigan was at war with lord vorwyn of hazelbright during the first bloody century the town of vorkosigan vashnoi was besieged twice a week lord vorwyns patrols would stop this crazy motley fellow with a train of pack horses and search his packs for contraband food or supplies but his packs were always filled with rubbish they poked and prodded and emptied themhed always gather it carefully back upshook him down and searched him and finally had to let him go after the war one of vorwyns border guards met count seligs leigeman no longer motley by chance in a tavern what were you smuggling he asked in frustration we know you were smuggling something what was it and count seligs leigeman replied horses were smuggling spaceships to wit the triumph the d and the ariel all fleetowned we enter vega station local space through toranira on a throughflight plan bound for illyrica which we really will be we exit through zoave still with every trooper but minus three aging ships we then continue on to illyrica and pick up our three brandnew warships which are being completed even as we speak in the illyrican orbital shipyards our happy winterfair gift from emperor gregor baz blinked will this work no reason it shouldnt the spadeworkpermits visas bribes and so onis all being completed by impsec agents onsite all we have to do is waft through without alarming anybody theres no war on not a shot should be fired the only problem is that onethird of my tradeinventory just left for jacksons whole miles concluded with a descending snort how much time do we have to recover it asked elena not as much as we need the timewindow impsec has set up for this smuggling scenario is flexible in terms of a few days but not weeks the fleet must leave escobar before the end of this week id originally scheduled it for tomorrow so do we go without ariel asked baz were going to have to but not emptyhanded i have an idea for a substitution quinn shunt those illyrican specs to baz quinn bent her head to the secured data cube in her comconsole interface and released a burst of code to bazs station the engineer began keying through advertising displays descriptions specifications and plans from the illyrican shipbuilders his thin face lit in a rare smile father frost is generous this winterfair he murmured his lips parted with delight as the ships powerplant specs came up and his eyes moved avidly miles let him wallow for a few minutes more now he said when baz selfconsciously came up for air the nextup ship in the fleet from the ariel in terms of function and firepower is truzillos jayhawk unfortunately truzillo was a captainowner under independent contract to the fleet corporation not a fleet employee do you think he could be persuaded to trade his replacement ship would be newer and faster but while its definitely a step up in firepower from the ariel its a slight step down from the jayhawk id meant us all to trade up not even when we first cooked up this deal elena raised her eyebrows and grinned this is one of your scenarios isnt it he shrugged illyan asked me to solve the arms embargo problem yes he accepted my solution oh baz purred still awash in data waitll truzillo sees this and this and so do you think you can persuade him asked miles yes said baz with certainty he glanced up so could you except ill be headed the other way though if things go well its not impossible that i might catch up with you later im putting you in charge of this mission baz quinn will give you the complete orders all the codes and contactpeopleeverything illyan gave me baz nodded very good sir im taking the peregrine to go after the ariel miles added baz and elena exchanged only one quick sideways glance very good sir echoed elena with scarcely a pause i shifted the peregrine from twentyfourhour to onehour alert status yesterday when shall i schedule our departure with escobaran flight control in one hour and though no one had asked for explanations he added the peregrine is the nextfastest thing we have that packs significant firepower besides the jayhawk and the ariel itself i think that speed is going to be of the essence if we can overtake the arielwell its a lot easier to prevent a mess than to try to clean up after one im sorry now i didnt leave yesterday but i had to give it a chance to be simple im assigning quinn to myself as floating staff because shes had valuable previous experience with intelligencegathering on jacksons whole quinn rubbed her arm house bharaputra is damn dangerous if thats where marks headed they have heavy money heavy shit and a sharp memory for revenge why dyou think i avoid the place thats another danger that certain jacksonians will mistake mark for admiral naismith baron ryoval for example baron ryoval was a persistent danger the dendarii had disposed of the latest bountyhunter ryoval had sent seeking admiral naismiths scalp only three months ago he had been the fourth to appear so far it was shaping up to an annual event maybe ryoval dispatched an agent on each anniversary of their first encounter as a memorial tribute ryoval did not command great powers nor possess a long reach but he had undergone lifeextension treatments he was patient and could keep this up for a long long time have you considered another possible solution to the problem said quinn slowly send ahead to jacksons whole and warn them have say house fell arrest mark and impound the ariel till you arrive to retrieve them fell hates ryoval enough to protect mark from him for the annoyancefactor alone miles sighed i have considered it he traced a formless pattern on the polished tabletop with his fingertip you asked for a crosscheck miles elena pointed out whats wrong with that idea it might work but if mark has really convinced bel hes me they might resist arrest maybe fatally mark is paranoid about jacksons whole mark is paranoid period i dont know what hed do in a panic you are awfully tender of marks sensibilities said elena im trying to get him to trust me i can hardly start the process by betraying him have you considered how much this little sidejaunt is going to cost once the bill for it arrives on simon illyans desk quinn asked impsec will pay without question quinn said you sure whats mark to impsec anyway now that hes only a leftover from the exploded plot there is no danger any more to barrayar of him being secretly substituted for you i thought they only watched him for us as a courtesy a rather expensive courtesy miles replied carefully it is impsecs explicit task to guard the barrayaran imperium that includes not only protecting gregors person and running a certain amount of galactic espionage a wave of his hand included the dendarii fleet and illyans farflung if thinly stretched network of agents military attaches and informants but also keeping watch over gregors immediate heirs keeping watch not only to protect them but to protect the imperium from any little plot got up by them or by others seeking to use them i am acutely conscious that the question of just who is gregors heir is rather tangled at present i wish to hell hed marry and get us all off the hook soon miles hesitated for a long moment by one interpretation lord mark pierre vorkosigan has a place as heirclaimant to the barrayaran imperium second only to my own that makes him not only impsecs business it makes him our primary business my personal pursuit of the ariel is fully justified justifiable quinn corrected dryly whatever if barrayaras you have often claimedwould not accept you as emperor because of suspicion of mutation i should think itd go into spasms at the thought of your clone installed in the imperial residence said baz twin brother he amended hastily as miles opened his mouth it doesnt require the probability of success at gaining the imperium to make the possibility of an attempt to do so into an impsec problem miles snorted its funny all the time the komarrans thought of their fauxmiles as an imposterclaimant i dont think either they or mark realized theyd made a real claimant well id have to be dead first anyway so from my point of view the question is moot he rapped the table and rose lets get moving people on the way out the door elena lowered her voice to ask him milesdid your mother see those horrific investigationreports of illyans about mark too he smiled bleakly who dyou think ordered them done chapter five he began donning the halfarmor first next to his skin a piece of the hottest new technology on the market a nervedisrupter shieldnet the fieldgenerating net was worked into the fabric of a closefitting grey bodysuit and a hood that protected skull neck and forehead leaving only his eyes nose and mouth peeping from the hole and so the threat of one of the most fearsome antipersonnel weapons the brainkilling nerve disrupter was rendered null as an added bonus the suit stopped stunnerfire too trust naismith to have the best and newest and custommade to fit was the elastic fabric supposed to be this bloody tight over the netsuit went a flexible torsoarmor that would stop any projectile up to small handmissiles and down to deadly needier spines fortunately for his ability to breathe its catches were adjustable he let them out to their fullest extension rendering the valuable protection merely comfortably and correctly snug over it went blessedly loose camouflagegrey fatigues made of a combatrated fabric that would neither melt nor burn then came belts and bandoliers with stunner nerve disrupter plasma arc grenades power cells a rappelharness and spool emergency oxygen on his back he shrugged the harness holding a neat flat power pack that generated at the first touch of enemy fire a onemansized plasma arc mirror field with so miniscule a time lag one barely had time to cook much it was good for absorbing thirty or forty direct hits before the power cell and its porter died it seemed almost a misnomer to call it all halfarmor triple armor was more like it over the nervedisruptor net covering his feet he pulled thick socks then naismiths combat boots at least the boots fit without any embarrassing adjustments a mere week of inactivity and his body fought him thickening naismith was a damned anorectic that was it a hyperactive anorectic he straightened properly distributed the formidible array of equipment was surprisingly light on the countertop next to his cabin comconsole the command helmet sat waiting the empty shadow beneath its forehead flange made him think for whatever morbid reason of an empty skull he raised the helmet in his hands and turned it in the light and stared hungrily at its elegant curves his hands could control one weapon two at most this through the people it commanded controlled dozens potentially hundreds or even thousands this was naismiths real power the cabin buzzer blatted he jumped nearly dropping the helmet he could have pitched it against the wall and not harmed it but still he set it down carefully miles came captain thornes voice on the intercom you about ready yes come in he touched the keypad to release the door lock thorne entered attired identically to himself but with hood temporarily pushed back the formless fatigues rendered thorne not bisexed but neuter a genderless thing a soldier thorne too bore a command helmet under its arm of a slightly older and different make thorne walked around him eyes flicking over every weapon and belthook and checking the readouts of his plasmashield pack good did captain thorne normally inspect its admiral before combat was naismith in the habit of wandering into battle with his boots unfastened or something thorne nodded to the command helmet sitting on the countertop thats quite a machine sure you can handle it the helmet appeared new but not that new he doubted naismith supplied himself with used military surplus for his personal use regardless of what economies he practiced in the fleet at large why not he shrugged i have before these things thorne lifted his own can be pretty overwhelming at first its not a data flow its a damn data flood you have to learn to ignore everything you dont need otherwise it can be almost better to switch the thing off you now thorne hesitated have that same uncanny ability as old tung did of appearing to ignore everything as it goes by and yet being able to remember and yank it out instantly if its needed of somehow always being on the right channel at the right time its like your mind works on two levels your commandresponse time is incredibly fast when your adrenalin is up its kind of addictive people who work with you a lot come to expectand relyon it thorne stopped waited what was it expecting him to say he shrugged again i do my best if youre still feeling ill you know you can delegate this whole raid to me do i look ill youre not yourself you dont want to make the whole squad sick thorne seemed tense almost urgent im fine now bel back off yes sir thorne sighed is everything ready out there the shuttle is fueled and armed green squad is kitted up and is doing the final loading right now we have it timed so we come into parking orbit just at midnight downside at bharaputras main medical facility we drop instantly no waiting around for people to start asking questions hit and go the whole operation should be over in an hour if things run to plan good his heart was beating faster he disguised a deep breath in a strungout sigh lets go lets do our helmet communication checks first huh said thorne that was a good idea here in the quiet cabin rather than in the noise and excitement and tension of the drop shuttle all right he said and added slyly take your time there were over a hundred channels in use in the command headset even for this limited raid in addition to direct voice contact with the ariel thorne and every trooper there were battle computers on the ship in the shuttle and in the helmet itself there were telemetry readouts of every sort weapon power checks logistics updates all the troopers helmets had vid pickups so he could see what they were seeing in infrared visual and uv bands full sound their medical readouts holovid map displays the holomap of the clonecreche had been specially programmed in and the plan of attack and several contingencies preloaded there were channels to be dedicated on the fly to eavesdropping upon enemy telemetry thorne already had bharaputras security guards comm links locked in they could even pick up commercial entertainment broadcasts from the planet they were approaching tinny music filled the air momentarily as he switched past those channels they finished and he found himself and thorne staring at each other in an awkward silence thorne was hollowfaced apprehensive as if struggling with some suppressed emotion guilt strange perception surely not thorne couldnt be on to him or it would have called a halt to this whole operation precombat nerves bel he said lightly i thought you loved your work thorne came out of its lipsucking abstraction with a start oh i do it took a breath lets do it go he agreed and led the way at last out of his isolated cabincave into the light of the corridor and the peopled reality his actions his actionshad created the shuttlehatch corridor resembled his first view of it reversed the hulking dendarii commandos were filing out not spilling in they seemed quieter this time not as much clowning and joking more businesslike they had names now too all filed in his command headset which would keep them straight for him all wore some variety of halfarmor and helmet with an array of heavier equipment in addition to such handweapons as he bore he found himself looking at the monster sergeant with new eyes now that he knew her history the log had said she was only nineteen years old though she looked older shed been only sixteen four years ago when naismith had stolen her away from house ryoval he squinted trying to see her as a girl he had been taken away at age fourteen eight years ago their mutual time as genetic products and prisoners of house bharaputra must have overlapped though he had never met her the genetic engineering research labs were in a different town from the main surgical facility house bharaputra was a vast organization in its strange jacksonian way almost a little government except jacksons whole didnt have governments eight years no one you knew then is still alive you know that dont you if i cant do what i want ill at least do what i can he stepped up to her sergeant taura she turned and his brows climbed in startlement what is that around your neck actually he could see what it was a large fluffy pink bow he supposed his real question was why was it around her neck shesmiled he guessed that repellent grimace was at him and fluffed it out a bit more with a huge clawed hand her clawpolish was bright pink tonight dyou think itll work i wanted something to not scare the kids he looked up at eight feet of halfarmor camouflage cloth boots bandoliers muscle and fang somehow i dont think itll be enough sergeant its certainly worth a try he choked so she was conscious of her extraordinary appearance fool how could she not be are you not conscious of yours he was almost sorry now he had not ventured out of his cabin earlier in the voyage and made her acquaintance my hometown girl what does it feel like to be going back he asked suddenly a nod in no particular direction indicated the house bharaputra dropzone coming up strange she admitted her thick brows drawing down do you know this landingsite ever been there before not that medical complex i hardly ever left the genetics facility except for a couple of years that i lived with hired fosterers which was in the same town her head turned her voice dropped an octave and she barked an order about loading equipment at one of her men who gave a halfwave and hustled to obey she turned back to him and her voice resoftened to conscious careful lightness in no other way did she display any inappropriate intimacy while on duty it seemed she and naismith were discreet lovers if lovers they were the discreetness relieved him she added i didnt get out much his own voice lowered do you hate them as do a different kind of intimate question her outslung lips twisted in thought i suppose i was terribly manipulated by them when i was growing up but it didnt seem like abuse to me at the time there were a lot of uncomfortable tests but it was all science there wasnt any intent to hurt in it it didnt really hurt till they sold me to ryovals after the supersoldier project was cancelled what ryovals wanted to do to me was grotesque but that was just the nature of ryovals it was bharaputra bharaputra that didnt care that threw me away that hurt but then you came she brightened a knight in shining armor and all that a familiar surly wave of resentment washed over him bugger the knight in shining armor and the horse he rode in on and i can rescue people too dammit she was looking away fortunately and didnt catch the spasm of anger in his face or perhaps she took it for anger at their former tormentors but for all that she murmured i would not have even existed without house bharaputra they made me i am alive for however long shall i return death for life her strange distorted face grew deeply introspective this was not the ideal gungho frame of mind to inculcate in a commando on a drop mission he realized belatedly not necessarily were here to rescue clones not kill bharaputran employees we kill only if forced to eh this was good naismithery her head came up and she grinned at him im so relieved youre feeling better i was terribly worried i wanted to see you but captain thorne wouldnt allow it her eyes warmed like bright yellow flames yes i was very ill thorne did right but maybe we can talk more on the way home when this was over when hed earned the right earned the right to what you got a date admiral she winked at him and straightened ferociously joyous what have i promised she bounded forward happily sergeantly again to oversee her squad he followed her into the combatdrop shuttle the light level was much lower in here the air colder and of course there was no gravity he floated forward from handgrip to handgrip after captain thorne mentally dividing up the floor space for his intended cargo twelve or fifteen rows of kids seated four across there was plenty of room this shuttle was equipped to carry two squads plus armored hovercars or a whole field hospital it had a firstaid station at the back including four folddown bunks and a portable emergency cryochamber the dendarii commandomedic was rapidly organizing his area and battening down his supplies everything was being fastened down by quietlymoving fatigueclad soldiers with very little fuss or conversation a place for everything and everything in its place the shuttle pilot was at his post thorne took the copilots seat he took a communication station chair just behind them out the front window he could see distant hardedged stars nearby the winking colored lights of some human activity and at the very edge of the field of view the bright slice of the planets curvature almost home his belly fluttered and not just from zerogee bands of tightness throbbed around his head beneath his helmetstraps the pilot hit his intercom gimme a bodycheck back there taura weve got a fiveminute thrust to match orbit then we blow bolts and drop after a moment sergeant tauras voice returned check all troops tied down hatch sealed we are ready gorepeatgo thorne glanced over its shoulder and pointed hastily he fastened his seat straps and just in time the straps bit deeply and he lurched from side to side as the ariel shuddered into its parking orbit accelerative effects that would have been compensated for and nullified by the artificial gravity generated between the decks of the larger ship the pilot poised his hands and abruptly dropped them as if he were a musician playing some crescendo loud startling clanks reverberated through the fuselage ululating whoops keened in response from the compartment behind the flight deck when they say drop he thought wildly they mean it stars and the planet turned nauseatingly in the forward window he closed his eyes his stomach tried to climb his esophagus he suddenly realized a hidden advantage to full space armor if you shit yourself with terror going down the suits plumbing would take care of it and no one would ever know air began to scream over the outer hull as they hit the ionosphere his seat straps tried to slice him like an egg fun huh yelled thorne grinning like a loon its face distorted and lips flapping with deceleration they were pointed straight down or so the shuttles nose was aimed although his seat was attempting to eject him into the cabin ceiling with neckbreaking and skullsmashing force i sure hope theres nothing in our way the pilot yelled cheerfully this hasnt been cleared with anybodys flight control yknow he pictured a midair collision with a large commercial passenger shuttle five hundred women and children aboard vast yellow and black explosions and arcing bodies they crossed the terminator into twilight then darkness whipping clouds bigger clouds shuttle vibrating and bellowing like an insane tuba still pointed straight down he swore though how the pilot could tell in this screaming fog he did not know then suddenly they were level as an airshuttle clouds above lights of a town like jewels spilled on a carpet below an airshuttle that was dropping like a rock his spine began to compress harder harder more hideous clanks as the shuttles feet extended an array of halflit building bulked below a darkened playingcourt shit thats it thats it the buildings loomed up beside them above them thudcrunchcrunch a solid sixlegged landing the silence stunned him all right lets go thorne swung up out of its seat face flushed eyes lit with bloodlust or fear or both he could not tell he tramped down the ramp in the wake of a dozen dendarii his eyes were about half darkadapted and there were enough lights around the complex diffused by the cool and misty midnight air that he had no trouble seeing though the view was drained of color the shadows were black and sinister sergeant taura with silent hand signals divided her squad no one was making noise silent faces were gilded by brief staccato flashes of light as their helmet vids supplied some data bit or another projected to the side of their vision one dendarii with extra scopes on her helmet rolled out a personal floatbike mounted it and rose quietly into the darkness air cover the pilot stayed aboard and taura counted off four other dendarii two vanished into the shadows of the perimeter two stayed with the shuttle as rearguard he and thorne had argued about that thorne had wanted more perimeter his own gutfeel was that they would need as many troopers as possible at the clonecreche the civilian hospital guards were little threat and it would take time for their betterarmed backup to arrive by then the dendarii would be gone if they could move the clones along fast enough he cursed himself in retrospect for not ordering two commando squads instead of one back at escobar he could have done so just as easily but hed been caught up in calculations about the ariels passenger capacity and fancied himself conserving life support for the final escape so many factors to balance his own helmet framed his vision with a colored clutter of codes numbers and graphs hed studied them all but they flicked by too fast by the time hed taken one in and interpreted it to himself it was gone replaced by another he took thornes advice and with a whispered word reduced the light intensity to a bare hallucinatory murmur the helmets audio pickup was not so bad no one was doing any unnecessary chatter he thorne and the other seven dendarii followed taura at a trother stridebetween two adjacent buildings there was activity on the bharaputran security guards comm links he found by keying his helmet to their audio bands the first what the hell did you hear that joe check sector four stirrings of response more to follow he was sure though he had no intention of waiting around for it around a corner there a threestory pleasant white building with lots of plants and landscaping big windows balconies not quite a hospital not quite a dormitory vague ambiguous discreet the life house it was labelled in jacksonian doublespeak the death house my dear old home it was terribly familiar and terribly strange once it had seemed quite splendid to him now it seemed smaller than he remembered taura raised her plasma arc adjusted its beam to wide and removed the locked glass front doors in an orange white and blue spray of flying spattering melt dendarii bounded through splitting right and left before the glow of the spattered globs of glass died one took up station patrolling the ground floor alarms and fire alarms went off dendarii killed the noisy speakers they passed with more plasma fire on the fly but units in more distant parts of the building kept up a muted clamor automatic sprinklers made steam and a mess in their trail he ran to catch up a uniformed bharaputran security guard in brown trimmed with pink lurched into the corridor ahead three dendarii stunners simultaneously downed him as his own stunner beam was absorbed harmlessly by the ceiling taura and two female dendarii took the lift tube toward the third floor another trooper passed them in hope of gaining the roof he led thorne and the remaining troopers out into the second floor foyer and to the left two unarmed adults one a nightgowned woman pulling on a robe were felled the instant they appeared there through those double doors they were locked and someone was beating on them from the inside were going to break the door open thorne bellowed through it back away or youll get hurt the pounding stopped thorne nodded a trooper adjusted his plasma arc to narrow beam and sliced through a metal bolt thorne kicked the doors wide a blond young man fell back a pace and stared at thorne with bewilderment youre not the firemen a crowd of other men tall boys filled the corridor behind the blond he did not have to remind himself that these were a bunch of tenyearolds but he wasnt sure about the perceptions of the troopers every variation of height and racial mix and build was represented much more motley than the greekgod look one might have anticipated from their gardenandfountain setting personal wealth not personal beauty had been the ticket for their creation still each was as glowingly healthy as the particularities of his genetics permitted they all wore uniform sleepwear bronzebrown tunics and shorts front thorne hissed and shoved him forward start talking get me a headcount he ripped out of the corner of his mouth as thorne pulled him past right hed practiced the speech for this supreme moment in his mind ten thousand times every possible variation the only thing he knew for certain that he was not going to start with was im miles naismith his heart was racing he inhaled a huge gulp of air were the dendarii mercenaries and were here to save you the boys expression was repelled scared and scornful all mixed you look like a mushroom he said blankly it was so so offscript of his thousand rehearsed second lines not one followed this actually with the command helmet and all he probably did look a bit like a big gray not the heroic image hed hoped to he tore off his helmet ripped back his hood and bared his teeth the boy recoiled listen up you clones he yelled the secret you may have heard whispered is true every single one of you is waiting in line to be murdered by house bharaputra surgeons theyre gonna stick somebody elses brain in your head and throw your brain away thats where your friends have been going one by one to their deaths were here to take you to escobar where youll be given sanctuary not all the boys had assembled in the corridor in the first place and now ones at the rear of the mob began to break away and retreat into individual rooms a babble started to rise from them and yells and cries one darkhaired boy tried to dart past them to the corridor beyond the big double doors and a trooper grabbed him in a standard armlock he screamed in pain and surprise and the sound and shock seemed to blow the others back in a wave the boy struggled without effect in the troopers iron grip the trooper looked exasperated and uncertain and stared at him as if expecting some direction or order get your friends and follow me he yelled desperately to the retreating boys the blond turned on his heel and sprinted i dont think they bought us said thorne the hermaphrodites face was pale and tense it might actually be easier to stun them all and carry them we cant afford to lose time in here not with that iamned thin perimeter no his helmet was calling him he jammed it back on commlink babble burst in his ears but sergeant tauras deep voice penetrated selectively enhanced by her channel sir we need your help up here what is it her answer was lost in an override from the woman riding the floatbike sir theres three or four people climbing down the outside balconies of the building youre in and theres a group of four bharaputran security people approaching you from the north he sorted frantically through channels till he found the one outgoing to the airguard dont let any get away how should i stop em sir her voice was edged stunner he decided helplessly wait dont stun any that are hanging off the balcony waitll they reach the ground i may not have a clear shot do your best he cut her off and found taura again what do you want sergeant i want you to come talk to this crazy girl you can convince her if anyone can things arenot quite under control down here thorne rolled its eyes the captured boy was drumming his bare heels against the dendarii troopers shins thorne set its stunner to the lightest setting and touched it to the back of the squirming boys neck he convulsed and hung more limply still conscious eyes blearing and wild the boy began to cry in a burst of cowardice he said to throne get them rounded up any way you can im going to help sergeant taura you do that growled thorne in a distinctly insubordinate tone it wheeled gathering its men you and you take that sideyou take the other get those doors down he retreated ignominiously to the sound of shattering plastic upstairs things were quieter there were fewer girls than boys altogether a disproportion that had also prevailed in his time hed often wondered why he stepped over the stunned body of a heavyset female security guard and followed his vid map projected by his helmet to sergeant taura a dozen or so girls were seated crosslegged on the floor their hands clasped behind their necks under the waving threat of one dendariis stunner their sleeptunics and shorts were pink silk otherwise identical to the boys they looked frightened but at least they sat silent he stepped into a side room to find taura and the other trooper confronting a tall eurasian girlwoman who sat at a comconsole with her arms aggressively crossed where the vid plate should have been was a smoking hole hot and recent from plasma fire the eurasian girls head turned her long black hair swinging from taura to himself and back my lady what a circus her voice was a whip of contempt she refuses to budge said taura her tone was strangely worried girl he nodded curtly you are dead meat if you stay here you are a clone your body is destined to be stolen by your progenitor your brain will be removed and destroyed perhaps very soon i know that she said scornfully as if he were a babbling idiot what his jaw dropped i know it i am perfectly aligned with my destiny my lady required it to be so i serve my lady perfectly her chin rose and her eyes rested in a moment of dreamy distant worship of what he could not guess she got a call out to house security reported taura tightly with a nod at the smoking holovid described us our geareven reported an estimate of our numbers you will not keep me from my lady the girl affirmed with a short cool nod the guards will get you and save me im very important what the hell had the bharaputrans done to turn this girls head insideout and could he undo it in thirty seconds or less he didnt think so sergeant he took a deep breath and said in a high light voice on the outgoing sigh stun her the eurasian girl started to duck but the sergeants reflexes worked at lightning speed the stunner beam took her precisely between the eyes as she leapt taura vaulted the comconsole and caught the girls head before it could strike the floor do we have them all he asked at least two went down the back stairs before we blocked them taura reported with a frown theyll be stunned if they try to escape the building he reassured her but what if they hide downstairs itll take time to find em her tawny eyes flicked sideways to take in some chrono display from her helmet we should all be on our way back to the shuttle by now just a second laboriously he keyed through his channels till he found thorne again off in the distance carried thinly by the audio someone was yelling nofabitch you little what thorne snapped in a harried voice you got those girls rounded up yet had to stun one taura can carry her look did you get that headcount yet yes took it off a comconsole in a keepers roomthirtyeight boys and sixteen girls were missing four boys who apparently went over the balcony trooper philippi accounted for three of them but says she didnt spot a fourth how about you sergeant taura says two girls went down the back stairs watch for them he glanced up peering out of his vid display which was swirling like an aurora captain thorne says there should be sixteen bodies here taura stuck her head out into the corridor lips moving then returned and eyed the stunned eurasian girl were still short one kesterton make a pass around this floor check cupboards and under the beds right sergeant the dendarii trooper ran to obey he followed her thornes voice urging in his ears move it up there this is a smashandgrab remember we dont have time to round up strays wait dammit in the third room the trooper checked she bent to look under a bed and said ha got her sergeant she swooped grabbed a couple of kicking ankles and yanked her prize slid into the light a short girlwoman in the pink crossover tunic and shorts she emitted little helpless muted noises distress with no hope of her cries bringing help she had a cascade of platinum curls but her most notable feature was a stunning bustline huge fat globes that the strained pink silk of her tunic failed to contain she rolled to her knees buttocks on heels her upraised hands vaguely pushing and cradling the heavy flesh as if it still shocked and unaccustomed to finding it there ten years old shit she looked twenty and such monstrous hypertrophy couldnt be natural the progenitorcustomer must have ordered bodysculpture prior to taking possession that made sense let the clone do the surgical and metabolic suffering tiny waist flare of hip from her exaggerated physically mature femininity he wondered if she might be one of the changeofsex transfers almost certainly she must have been slated for surgery very soon no go away she was whimpering go away leave me alone my mother is coming for me my mother is coming for me tomorrow go away leave me alone im going to meet my mother her cries and her heaving chest would shortly make him crazy he thought stun that one too he croaked theyd have to carry her but at least they wouldnt have to listen to her the troopers face was flushed as transfixed and embarrassed as he by the girls grotesque build poor doll she whispered and put her out of her misery with a light touch of stunner to her neck she slumped forward splayed on the floor his helmet was calling him he wasnt sure which troopers voice sir we just drove back a crew of house bharaputra firefighters with our stunners they didnt have antistun suits but the security people who are coming on now do theyre sending new teams carrying heavier weapons the stunnertag game is about over he keyed through helmet displays trying to place the trooper on the mapgrid before he could the airguards breathless voice cut in a bharaputran heavyweapons team is circling around your building to the south sir youve got to get the hell out of there its about to turn real nasty out here he waved the dendarii trooper and her dollwoman burden out of the bedroom ahead of him sergeant taura he called did you pick up those outside reports yes sir lets move it sergeant taura slung the eurasian girl over one broad shoulder and the blonde over the other apparently without noticing their weight and they herded the mob of frightened girls down the end stairs taura made them walk twobytwo holding hands keeping them rather better organized than he would have expected the girls hushed voices burbled in shock when they were directed into the boys dormitory section were not allowed down here one tried to protest in tears well get in trouble thorne had six stunned boys laid out faceup on the corridor floor and another twentyodd lined up leaning against the wall legs spread arms extended prisonercontrol posture with a couple of nervous troopers yelling at them and keeping them in their places some clones looked angry some were crying and all looked scared to death he looked with dismay at the pile of stunner victims how are we going to carry them all have some carry the rest taura said it leaves your hands free and ties up theirs she gently laid down her own burdens at the end of the row good said thorne jerking its gaze with difficulty from fascinated fixation on the dollwoman worley kesterton lets its voice stopped as the same staticladen emergency message overrode channels in both their command helmets it was the biketrooper screaming sonofabitch the shuttlewatch out guys on your left a hot wash of static and oh holy fuckin shit then a silence filled only with the hum of an empty channel he keyed frantically for a readout any readout at all from her helmet the locator still functioned plotting her on the ground between two buildings in back of the playcourt where the shuttle was parked her medical readouts were flatline blanks dead surely not there should at least still be blood chemistry the static empty view being transmitted upward at an angle into the night fog at last found him phillipi had lost her helmet what else shed lost he couldnt tell thorne called the shuttle pilot over and over alternated with the outerguards no replies it swore you try he found empty channels too the other two perimeter dendarii re tied up in an exchange of fire with the bharaputran heavyweapons squad to the south that the biketrooper had reported earlier we gotta reconnoiter snarled thorne under its breath sergeant taura take over here get these kids ready to march you this is to his address apparently why did thorne no longer call him admiral or miles come with me trooper sumner cover us thorne departed at a flatout run he cursed his short legs as he fell steadily farther behind down the lifttube out the stillhot front doors around one dark building between two others he caught up with the hermaphrodite who was flattened against a corner of the building at the edge of the playingcourt the shuttle was still there apparently undamagedsurely no handweapon could penetrate its combathardened shell the ramp was drawn up the door closed a dark shapedowned dendarii or enemyslumped in the shadow beneath its wingflanges thorne whispering curses jabbed codes into a computer control plate bound to its left forearm the hatch slid aside and the ramp tongued outward with a whine of servos still no human response im going in said thorne captain standard procedure says thats my job said the trooper thorne had detailed to cover them from his vantage behind a large concrete treetub not this time said thorne grimly not continuing the argument dashed forward in a zigzag then straight up the ramp hurtling aside plasma arc drawn after a moment its voice came over the mm now sumner uninvited he followed trooper sumner the shuttles interior was pitchdark they all turned on their helmet lights white fingers darting and touching nothing inside appeared disturbed but the door to the pilots compartment was sealed silently thorne motioned the trooper to take up a firing stance opposite him bracketing the door in the bulkhead between fuselage and flightdeck he stood behind thorne thorne punched another code into its arm controlpad the door slid open with a tortured groan then shuddered and jammed a wave of heat boiled out like the breath of a blast furnace a soft orange explosion followed as enough oxygen rushed into the steering compartment to reignite any flammables that were left the trooper fastened his emergency oxygen mask grabbed a chemical fireextinguisher from a clamp on the wall and aimed it into the flight deck after a moment they followed in his wake everything was slagged and burned the controls were melted communications equipment charred the compartment stank chokingly of toxic oxidation products from all the synthetic materials and one organic odor carbonized meat what was left of the pilothe turned his head and swallowed bharaputra doesnt haveisnt supposed to have heavy weapons onsite thorne hissed beyond swearing it pointed they threw a couple of our own thermal mines in here closed the door and ran pilot had to have been stunned first one smart goddamn bharaputran sonofabitch didnt have heavy weapons so they just used ours drew off or ganged up on my guards got in and grounded us didnt even stick around to ambush us they can do that at their leisure now this beast wont fly again thornes face looked like a chiseled skullmask in the white light from their helmets panic clogged his throat what do we do now bel fall back to the building set a perimeter use our hostages to negotiate some kind of surrender no you got a better idea miles thornes teeth gritted i thought not the shocked trooper stared at thorne captain he glanced back and forth between them the admiral will pull us through weve been in tighter spots than this not this time thorne straightened voice drawn with agony my faulttake full responsibility thats not the admiral thats his clonebrother mark he set us up but ive known for days tumbled to him before we dropped before we ever made jacksonian locals pace i thought i could bring this off and not get caught eh the troopers brows wavered disbelieving a clone going under anesthetic might have that same stunned look on his face we cantwe cant betray those children back into bharaputras hands mark grated begged thorne dug its bare hand into the carbonized blob glued to what used to be the pilots station chair who is betrayed it lifted its hand rubbed a black crumbling smear across his face from cheek to chin who is betrayed thorne whispered do you have a better idea he was shaking his mind a whiteout blank the hot carbon on his face felt like a scar fall back to the building said thorne on my command chapter six no subordinates said miles firmly i want to talk to the head an once and done and then get out of here ill keep trying said quinn she turned back to her comconsole the peregrines tac room which was presently transmitting the face of a highranking bharaputran security officer and began the argument again miles sat back in his station chair his boots flat to the deck his hands held deliberately still along the controlstudded armrests calm and control that was the strategy that was at this point the only strategy left to him if only hed been nine hours sooner hed methodically cursed every delay of the past five days in four languages till hed run out of invective theyd wasted fuel profligately pushing the peregrine at max accelerations and had nearly made up the ariels lead nearly the delays had given mark just enough time to take a bad idea and turn it into a disaster but not mark alone miles was no longer a proponent of the herotheory of disaster a mess this complete required the full cooperation of a cast of dozens he very much wanted to talk privately with bel thorne and very very soon he had not counted on bel proving as much of a loose cannon as mark himself he glanced around the tac room taking in the latest information from the vid displays the ariel was out of it fled under fire to dock at fell station under thornes secondincommand lieutenant hart hey were now blockaded by half a dozen bharaputran security vessels lurking outside fells zone two more bharaputran ships presently escorted the peregrine in orbit a token force so far the peregrine outgunned them that balance of power would shift when all their bharaputran brethren arrived topside unless he could convince baron bharaputra it wasnt necessary he called up a view of the downside situation on his vid display insofar as it was presently understood by the peregrines battle computers the exterior layout of the bharaputran medical complex was plain even from orbit but he lacked the details of the interiors hed have liked if he were planning a clever attack no clever attack negotiation and bribery he winced in anticipation of the upcoming costs bel thorne mark green squad and fifty or so bharaputran hostages were presently pinned down in a single building separated from their damaged shuttle and had been for the last eight hours the shuttle pilot dead three troopers injured that would cost bel its command miles swore to himself it would be dawn down there soon the bharaputrans had evacuated all the civilians from the rest of the complex thank god but had also brought in heavy security forces and equipment only the threat of harm to their valuable clones held back an overwhelming bharaputran onslaught he would not be negotiating from a position of strength alas cool quinn without turning around raised her hand and flashed him a high sign get ready he glanced down checking his own appearance his officers undress grays were borrowed from the next smallest person aboard the peregrine a fivefoottall female from engineering and fit him sloppily he only had half his proper insignia aggressively messy was a possible command style but he really needed more props to bring it off adrenalin and suppressed rage would have to power his appearance if not for the biochip on his vagus nerve his old ulcers would be perforating his stomach about now he opened his comconsole to quinns communications shunt and waited with a sparkle the image of a frowning man appeared over the vid plate his dark hair was drawn back in a tight knot held by a gold ring emphasizing the strong bones of his face he wore a bronzebrown silk tunic and no other jewelry olivebrown skin he looked a healthy forty or so appearances were deceiving it took more than one lifetime to scheme and fight ones way to the undisputed leadership of a jacksonian house vasa luigi baron bharaputra had been wearing the body of a clone for at least twenty years he certainly took good care of it the vulnerable period of another brain transplant would be doubly dangerous for a man whose power so many ruthless subordinates coveted this man is not for playing games with miles decided bharaputra here the man in brown stated and waited indeed the man and the house were one for practical purposes naismith here said miles commanding dendarii free mercenary fleet apparently not completely said vasa luigi blandly miles peeled back his lips on set teeth and managed not to flush just so you do understand this raid was not authorized by me i understand you claim so personally i should not be so anxious announce my failure of control over my subordinates hes baiting you cool we need to have our facts straight i have not yet established if captain thorne was actually suborned or merely taken in by my fellowclone in any case it is your own product for whatever sentimental reasons who has returned to attempt to extract some personal revenge upon you im just an innocent bystander trying to straighten things out you baron bharaputra blinked like a lizard are a curiosity we not manufacture you where did you come from does it matter it might then it is information for sale or trade not for free that was old jacksonian etiquette the baron nodded unoffended they were entering the realm of deal if not yet a deal between equals good the baron did not immediately pursue miless family history though so what is it you want from me admiral i wish to help you i can if given a free hand extract my people from that unfortunate dilemma downside with a minimum of further damage to bharaputran persons or property quiet and clean i would even consider paying reasonable costs of physical damages thus far incurred i do not require your help admiral you do if you wish to keep your costs down vasa luigis eyes narrowed considering this is that a threat miles shrugged quite the reverse both our costs can be very lowor both our costs can be very high i would prefer low the barons eyes flicked right at some thing or person out of range he vid pickup excuse me a moment admiral his face was laced with a holdingpattern quinn drifted over think well be able to save any of those poor clones he ran his hands through his hair hell elli im still trying to green squad out i doubt it thats a shame weve come all this way look i have crusades a lot closer to home than jacksons whole if you want em a hell of a lot more than fifty kids are killed each year in the barrayaran backcountry for suspected mutation for starters i cant afford to get quixotic like mark i dont know where he picked up those ideas it couldnt have been from the bharaputrans or the komarrans quinns brows rose she opened her mouth then shut it as if on some second thought and smiled dryly but then she said its mark i was thinking about you keep saying you want to get him to trust you make him a gift of the clones i wish i could right after i finish strangling him with my bare hands which will be right after i finish hanging bel thorne mark is mark he owes me nothing but bel should have known better his teeth clenched aching her words shook him with galloping visions both ships with every clone aboard jumping triumphantly from jacksonian local space thumbing their noses at the bad bharaputrans mark stammering gratitude admiring bring them all home to mother madness not possible if hed planned it all himself from beginning to end maybe his plans certainly would not have included a midnight frontal assault with no backup the vid plate sparkled again and he waved quinn out of range vasa luigi reappeared admiral naismith he nodded i have decided to allow you to order your mutinous crew to surrender to my security forces i would not wish to put your security to any further trouble baron theyve been up all night after all tired and jumpy ill collect all my people myself that will not be possible but i will guarantee their lives the individual fines for their criminal acts will be determined later ransoms he swallowed rage this is a possibility but the fines must be determined in advance you are hardly in a position to add conditions admiral i only wish to avoid misunderstandings baron vasa luigi pursed his lips very well the troopers ten thousand betan dollars each officers twentyfive thousand your hermaphrodite captain fifty thousand unless you wish us to dispose of it ourselvesno i do not see that you have any use for your ah fellow clone so well retain custody of him in return i shall waive property damage charges the baron nodded in satisfaction at his own generosity upwards of a quarter of a million miles cringed inwardly well it could be done but i am not without interest in the clone what price do you put on his head what possible interest vasa luigi inquired surprised miles shrugged id think it was obvious my profession is full of hazards i am the only survivor of my cloneclutch the one i call mark was as much a surprise to me as i was to him i think neither of us knew there was a second cloning project where else would i find such a perfect ah organdonor and on such short notice vasa luigi opened his hands we might arrange to keep him safe r you if i needed him at all id need him urgently in the circumstances id fear a sudden rise in the market price besides accidents happen look at the accident that happened to poor baron fells clone in your keeping the temperature seemed to drop twenty degrees and miles cursed is tongue that episode was apparently still classified information in these parts or at least some kind of hot button the baron studied him if not with more respect then with increased suspicion if you wish another clone made for transplant purposes admiral youve come to the right place but this clone is not for sale this clone does not belong to you miles snapped out too quickly nosteady on keep it cool keep his real thoughts buried deep maintain that smarmy surface persona that could actually cut a deal with baron bharaputra without vomiting cool besides theres that tenyear lead time its not some longanticipated death from old age that concerns me its the abrupt surprise sort after a pause and with a heroic effort he choked out you need not waive the property damage charges of course i need not do anything at all admiral the baron pointed out coolly dont bet on it you jacksonian bastard why do you want this particular clone baron considering how readily you could make yourself another not that readily his medical records reveal he was quite a challenge vasa luigi tapped the side of his aquiline nose with one forefinger and smiled without much humor do you plan punishment a warning to other malefactors he will doubtless regard it so so there was a plan for mark or at least an idea that smelled of some profit nothing in the direction of our barrayaran progenitor i trust that plot is long dead they know about us both i admit his barrayaran connections interest me your barrayaran connections interest me too it is obvious from the name that you took for yourself that youve long known where you came from just what is your relationship with barrayar admiral queasy he admitted they tolerate me i do them a favor now and then for a price beyond that mutual avoidance barrayaran imperial security has a longer arm even than house bharaputra you dont want to attract their negative attention i assure you vasa luigis brows rose politely skeptical a progenitor and two clones three identical brothers and all so short among you i suppose you make a whole man not to the point the baron was casting for something information presumably three but hardly identical said miles the original lord vorkosigan is a dull stick i am assured the limitations of marks capacities he has just demonstrated i fear i was the improved model my creators planned higher things for me but they did their job too well and i began planning for myself a trick neither of my poor siblings seems to have mastered i wish i could talk with your creators i wish you could too they are deceased the baron favored him with a chill smile youre a cocky little fellow arent you miles stretched his lips in return and said nothing the baron sat back tenting his fingers my offer stands the clone is not for sale but every thirty minutes the fines will double i advise you to close your deal quickly admiral you will not get a better i must have a brief consultation with my fleet accountant miles temporized i will return your call shortly how else vasa luigi murmured with a small smile at his own wit miles cut the comm abruptly and sat his stomach was shaking hot red waves of shame and anger radiating outward through his whole body from the pit of his belly but the fleet accountant isnt here quinn pointed out sounding slightly confused lieutenant bone had indeed departed with baz and the rest of the dendarii from escobar i dont like baron bharaputras deal cant impsec rescue mark later i am impsec quinn could hardly disagree she fell silent i want my space armor he growled petulantly hunching in his station chair mark has it said quinn i know my halfarmor my command headset mark has those too i know his hand slapped down hard on the arm of the chair the harsh crack in the quiet chamber making quinn flinch a squad leaders helmet then what for said quinn in a flat unencouraging tone no crusades here you said im cutting myself a better deal he swung to his feet his blood beat in his ears hotter and hotter come on the seat straps bit into his body as the drop shuttle blew its clamps and accelerated away from the side of the peregrine miles glanced up over the pilots shoulder for a quick check of the planets curvature sliding across the window and a glimpse of his two fightershuttles falling away from the mothership to cover them they were followed the peregrines second combat drop shuttle the other half of his twopronged attack his faint feint would the bharaputrans take it seriously you hope he turned his attention back to the glittering digital dataworld supplied by his command headset glad he was not stuck with a squad leaders helmet after all hed commandeered elena botharijeseks downsideteam captains gear while she rode the tactics room back aboard the peregrine bring it back without any unsightly holes through it damn you shed told him her face pale with unexpressed anxiety practically everything he wore was liberated an oversized nervedisruptor shieldnet suit had its cuffs turned up and held with elastic bands at wrists and ankles quinn had insisted on it and as nervedisruptor damage was his particular nightmare he hadnt argued sloppy fatigues held ditto the plasmamirror field pack straps cinched the extra fabric around his body reasonably well two pairs of thick socks kept his borrowed boots from sliding around it was all very annoying but hardly his greatest concern while trying to pull together a downside raid on thirty minutes notice his greatest concern was their landing site on top of thornes building would have been his first choice but the shuttle pilot claimed that the whole building would collapse if they tried to set the shuttle down on it and anyway the roof was peaked not flat the next closest possible site was occupied by the ariels dead and abandoned shuttle the thirdchoice site looked like it was going to a long walk especially on the return journey when bharaputras security would have had time to set up counter measures straight up the slot was not his preferred attack style well maybe sergeant kimura and yellow squad in the second drop shuttle would give baron bharaputra something more urgent to think about take care your shuttle kimura its our only backup now i should have brought the whole damned fleet he ignored his own shuttles clanks and screams of deceleration as they hit the atmosphereit was an excellent helldrop but it couldnt go fast enough to suit himand watched the progress of his high cover in the colored codes and patterns of his helmet data display the startled bharaputran fightershuttles that had been guarding the peregrine now found their attention suddenly divided they wasted a few futile shots against the peregrine itself wavered after kimura then turned to pursue miless attack formation one bharaputran was blown to bits for its attempt almost immediately and miles whispered a pithy commendation for his dendarii fighter pilot into his recorder on the spot the other bharaputran unnerved broke away to await reinforcements well that had been easy it was the trip back that was going to be maximum fun he could feel the adrenalin high starting already stranger and sweeter than a drugrush through his body it would last for hours then depart abruptly leaving him a burntout husk with hollow eyes and voice was it worth it it will be if we win we will win as they rounded the planet to lineofsight to their target he tried contacting thorne again the bharaputrans were jamming the main command channels he tried dropping down and broadcasting a brief query on commercial bands but got no response someone should have been assigned to monitor those well hed be able to punch through once they were onsite he called up the holoview of the medical complex ghost images dancing before his eyes speaking of straight up the slot he was briefly tempted to order his fightershuttles to lay down a line of fire and blast a trench from his proposed landing site to thornes refuge removing those inconvenient buildings from his path but the trench would take too long to cool and besides the cover might benefit his own as much as bharaputras forces not quite as much the bharaputrans knew the layout better he considered the probability of tunnels utility tunnels and ducts he snorted at the thought of ducts and frowned at the thought of taura led blindly into this meat grinder by mark the wild jerking decelerations ended at last as buildings rose around them sniper vantagepointsand the shuttle thumped to the ground quinn whod been trying to raise communication channels from the station chair opposite his behind the copilot looked up and said simply ive got thorne try setting j audio only no vids so far with a flick of his eyes and a controlled blink he keyed in his erstwhile subordinate bel were down and coming for you get ready to break out is anyone left alive down here he didnt have to see bels face to sense the wince but at least bel didnt waste time on excuses or apologies two nonwalking wounded trooper phillipi died about fifteen minutes ago we packed her head in ice if you can bring the portable cryochamber we might save something will do but we dont have much time to fool with her start prepping her now well be there as fast as we can he nodded to quinn and they both rose and exited the flightdeck he had the pilots seal the door behind them quinn passed the word to the medic on what he was going to be dealing with and the first half of orange squad swarmed from the shuttle to take up defensive positions two small armored hovercars went up immediately behind them to clear any vantage points of bharaputran snipers and replace them with dendarii when they reported a temporary clear miles and quinn followed blue squad down the ramp into the chill damp dawn he left the entire second half of orange squad to guard the shuttle lest the bharaputrans try to repeat their previous successful ploy morning mist roiled faintly around the shuttles hot skin the sky was pearly with the slowgrowing light but the medical complexs structures still loomed in blotted shadow a floatbike soared aloft two troopers took the point at a dead run and blue squad followed miles concentrated forcing his short legs to pump fast enough to keep up he wanted no longlegged trooper to temper his stride for his sake ever this time at least none did and he grunted satisfaction under his remaining breath a scattered roar of smallarms fire echoing all around told him his orange squad perimeterpeople were already hard at work they streamed around one building under the cover of a seconds portico then past a third the halfsquads leapfrogging and covering each other it was all too easy the complex reminded miles of those carnivorous flowers with the nectarcoated spines that all faced inwards slipping in was simple for little bugs like him it was the attempt to get out that would exhaust and kill it was therefore almost a relief when the first sonic grenade went off the bharaputrans werent saving it all for dessert the explosion was a couple of buildings away and rocked and reverberated strangely around the walkways not dendarii issue its deafening timbre was a tad off he keyed his command helmet to follow the fire fight halfsubliminally as orange squad rooted out a nest of bharaputran security it wasnt the bharaputrans his people could smoke out that worried him it was the ones they overlooked he wondered if the enemy had brought in more massprojectile weapons in addition to sonic grenades and was coldly conscious of the missing element in his borrowed halfarmor quinn had tried to make him take her torsoarmor but hed convinced her its oversized loose sliding around as he moved would just make him crazy crazier hed thought hed heard her mutter but he hadnt asked for an amplification he wasnt planning on leading any cavalry charges this trip that was certain he blinked away the distracting ghostly data flow as they rounded a final corner scared off three or four lurking bharaputrans and approached the clonecreche big blocky building it looked like a hotel shattered glass doors led into a foyer where shadowy graycamouflaged defenders moved among hastilyraised shielding metal doors torn from hinges and propped up a quick exchange of countersigns and they were in half of blue squad scattered instantly to reinforce the buildings weary green squad defenders the other half guarded him the medic warped the float pallet containing the portable cryochamber through the doors and was hurriedly directed down a hallway by his comrades intelligently they were prepping phillipi in a side room out of sight of their clone hostages step one was to remove as much as possible of the patients own blood under these hasty combat conditions without any attempt to recover and store it rough ready and extremely messy it was not a sight for the fainthearted nor the unprepared mind admiral said a quiet alto voice he wheeled to find himself face to face with bel thorne the hermaphrodites features were almost as gray as the shieldnet hood that framed them an oval of lined and puffy fatigue plus another look one he hated seeing there despite his anger defeat bel looked beaten looked like it had lost it all and so it has they did not exchange a single word of blame or defense they didnt need to it was all plain in bels face and he suspected his own he nodded in acknowledgment of bel of it all beside bel stood another soldier the top of his helmet my helmetnot quite level with the top of bels shoulder he had halfforgotten how startling mark was do i really look like that you miless voice cracked and he found he had to stop and swallow later you and i are going to have a long talk theres a lot you dont seem to understand marks chin came up defiantly surely my face is not that round it must be an illusion from the hood what about these kids said mark these clones what about them a couple of young men in brown silk tunics and shorts appeared to be actually helping the dendarii defenders scared and excited rather than surly another group boys and girls mixed sat in a plainscared bunch on the floor under the watchful eye of a stunnerarmed trooper crap they really are just kids weveyouve got to take them along or im not going marks teeth were set but miles saw him swallow dont tempt me snarled miles of course were taking them along how the hell else would we get out of here alive marks face lit torn between hope and hatred and then what he demanded suspiciously oh miles carolled sarcastically were just going to waltz right over to bharaputra station and drop them off and thank vasa luigi kindly for the loan idiot what dyou think we load up and run like hell the only place to put them would be out the airlock and i guarantee youd go first mark flinched but took a deep breath and nodded all right then it is not all right miles bit out it is merely merely he could not come up with a word to describe what it merely was aside from the most screwedup mess hed ever encountered if you were going to try and pull a stupid stunt like this you might at least have consulted the expert in the family you come to you for help dyou think im crazy demanded mark furiously yes they were interrupted by a staring blond clone boy whod walked up to them openmouthed you really are clones he said in wonderment no were twins born six years apart snapped miles yes were just as much clones as you are thats right go back and sit down and obey orders dammit the boy retreated hastily whispering its true dammit mark howled under his breath if that squeezed sotto vioce could be so described how come they believe you and not me its not fair quinns voice through his helmet derailed the family reunion if you and don quixote junior are done greeting each other medic norwood has phillipi prepped and loaded and the wounded ready to transport form up lets get the first batch out the door then he responded he called up blue squads sergeant framingham take the first convoy you ready to roll ready sergeant taura has marshalled them for me go and dont look back half a dozen dendarii about three times that many bewildered and exhausted clones and the two wounded troopers on float pallets assembled in the foyer and filed out the ruined doors framingham did not look too happy to be using a couple of young girls as a projectileweapon shield his chocolatedark face was grim but any bharaputran snipers were going to have to take aim very very carefully the dendarii forced the kids forward if not at a run then at least at a steady jog a second group followed the first within a minute miles ran both noncoms helmet transmissions down either side of his peripheral vision while his ears strained for the deadly whine of smallarms fire were they going to bring this off sergeant taura shepherded the final gaggle of clones into the foyer she greeted him with a demisalute without even pausing to puzzle between himself and mark glad to see you sir she rumbled you too sergeant he replied heartfelt if mark had managed to get taura killed he didnt know how it could ever have been made right between them at some more convenient moment he urgently wanted to find out how mark had managed to fool her and how intimately later taura moved closer and lowered her voice we lost four kids escaped back to the bharaputrans makes me kinda sick any chance regretfully he shook his head no way no miracles this time weve got to take what we can get and go or well lose it all she nodded understanding the tactical situation perfectly well understanding didnt cure the gutchurning nausea of regret unfortunately he offered her a brief im sorry smile and her long lips twisted up on one side in wry response the blue squad medic brought in the big float pallet containing the cryochamber a blanket tossed over the transparent part of the gleaming cylinder to shield his comradeandpatients naked and cooling body from uncomprehending or horrified outsiders eyes taura urged the clones to their feet bel thorne glanced around i hate this place it said levelly maybe we can bomb it this time on the way out miles returned equally levelly finally bel nodded the mob of them the fifteen or so last clones the float pallet the dendarii rearguard taura and quinn mark and bel oozed out the front door miles glanced up feeling like he had a bullseye painted on the top of his helmet but the moving shape crossing the roof of the building opposite wore dendarii grays good the holovid on the right side of his field of view informed him framingham and his group had made it to the shuttle without incident even better he cut framinghams helmet transmissions squelched the second squad leaders to a bare murmur and concentrated on the present moment his concentration was broken by kimuras voice the first hed heard from yellow squad across town in their own drop zone sir resistance is soft theyre not buying us how far should i go to make them take us seriously all the way kimura youve got to draw bharaputran attention off us draw them away but dont risk yourselves and especially dont risk your shuttle miles hoped lieutenant kimura was too busy to reflect upon the slightly schizoid logic of that order if the first sign of bharaputran sharpshooters arrived with a bang literally a sonic grenade put down about fifteen meters ahead of them it blew a hole in the walkway which returned a few moments later in obedience to gravity as a sharp hot patter of raining fragments startling but not very dangerous the clonechildrens screams were muffled in his stunned ears gotta go kimura use your initiative huh the miss hadnt been accidental miles realized as plasma fire struck a potted tree to the right and a wall to the left of them exploding both they were being deliberately bracketed to panic the clones it was working quite nicely toothey were ducking dropping clutching each other and screaming and showing every sign of getting ready to bolt off in all directions there would be no rounding them up after that a plasma arc beam hit a dendarii square on just to prove the bharaputrans could do it miles supposed the beam was absorbed by his mirrorfield and reemitted with the usual hellish blue snap further terrifying the nearby kids the more experienced troopers fired back coolly while miles yelled into his headset for his air cover the bharaputrans were above them mostly judging by the angle of fire taura studied the hysterical clones glanced around raised her plasma arc and blew apart the doors of the nearest building a big windowless warehouse or garagelooking structure inside she bellowed it was good in that if they were going to bolt at least it had them all bolting in the same direction as long as they didnt stop inside if they got pinned down and penned up again thered be no big brother to rescue him move miles seconded the idea but keep moving out the other side she waved an acknowledgement as the kids stampeded out of the firezone into what no doubt looked like safety to them to him it looked like a trap but they needed to stay together if there was anything worse than being pinned down it was being scattered and pinned down he waved the squad through and followed a couple of blue squad troopers took rear guard firing plasma arcs upward at their herders miles feared he figured it for keepyourheadsdown warning shots but one trooper got lucky his plasma arc beam hit a bharaputran who unwisely attempted to dart along the roofedge on the building opposite the bharaputrans shielding absorbed the shot but then he unbalanced and fell screaming miles tried not to hear the sound when he hit the concrete but did not quite succeed even with grenadestunned ears the screaming stopped miles turned and dashed down the corridor and through some big double doors beckoned anxiously onward by thorne who waited to help cover him ill take rear guard thorne volunteered was thorne entertaining thoughts of dying heroically thus avoiding the inevitable courtmartial for a moment miles entertained thoughts of letting it do so it would be the vorish thing to do the old vor could be a bunch of assholes at times you get those clones to the shuttle miles snapped in turn finish the job you took on if im paying this much i want to get what im paying for thornes teeth bared but it nodded they both galloped after the squad the double doors opened onto an enormous concretefloored room which obviously nearly filled the big building red and greenpainted catwalks ran around a girdered ceiling high above festooned with looping cables of mysterious function a few harsh pale lights shone down casting multiple shadows he blinked in the gloom and almost lowered his infrared visor it appeared to be an assembly area for large projects of some kind though at the moment there seemed to be nothing in progress quinn and mark hesitated waiting for them to catch up despite miless urgent gesture for them to hurry on what are you stopping for he barked in furious fear he skidded to a halt beside them look out someone yelled quinn spun raising her plasma arc seeking aim marks mouth opened the o foolishly echoing the circle of his gray hood around his face miles saw the bharaputran because they were looking square at each other in that frozen moment a team of brownclad bharaputran snipers probably come up through the tunnels they were scrambling along the girders barely more prepared than the dendarii they pursued the bharaputran had a handsized projectile weapon launcher of some kind pointed straight at him its muzzle bright with flare miles could not of course see the projectile not even as it entered his chest only his chest bursting outward like a flower and a sound not heard but only felt a hammerblow launching him backward dark flowers bloomed too in his eyes covering everyone he was astonished not by how much he thought for there was no time for thought but by how much he felt in the time it took for his last heartburst of blood to finish flowing through his brain the chamber careening around him pain beyond measure rage and outrage and a vast regret infinitesimal in duration infinite in depth wait i havent chapter seven mark was standing so close the report of the exploding projectile was like a silence pressing in his ears obliterating all other sounds it happened too fast for understanding too fast to close the eyes and defend the mind against the sight the little man who had been yelling and gesturing them onward fluttered backward like a gray rag arms outflung face contorted a spray of blood spattered across mark with stinging force part of a wide halfcircle of blood and tissuebits quinns whole left side was scarlet so you are not perfect was his first absurd thought this sudden absolute vulnerability shocked him unbearably i didnt think you could be hurt damn you i didnt think you could be quinn was screaming everyone was recoiling only he stood still paralyzed in his private earstunned silence miles lay on the concrete with his chest blown out openmouthed unmoving thats a dead man hed seen a dead man before there was no mistaking it quinn her face wild fired her plasma arc at the bharaputrans shot after shot till hot ceiling fragments started to fall lethally back down around them and a dendarii knocked her weapon aside taura get them quinn pointed upward with her free hand the monster sergeant fired a rappelhook upward which wrapped around a girder she rose upon it at full acceleration like a mad spider between the lights and the shadows mark could scarcely follow her progress leaping at inhuman speed along the catwalks until brokennecked bharaputran security personnel began raining down all their hightech halfarmor was no protection at all against those huge enraged clawed hands three men fell in a welter of their own blood their throats torn out an insane bombardment one dendarii trooper running across the chamber was almost smashed beneath an enemy body modern warfare wasnt supposed to have this much blood in it the weapons were supposed to cook everyone neatly like eggs in their shells quinn paid no attention scarcely seeming to care about the results of her order she knelt by miless side her shaking hands outspread hesitating then they dove and pulled off miless command helmet she flung her own squad leaders helmet to the floor and replaced it on her smooth gray hood with miless her lips moved establishing contact checking channels the helmet was undamaged apparently she yelled orders to perimeterpeople queries to the drop shuttle and one other norwood get back here get back here yes bring it bring it now on the double norwood her head swivelled away from miles only long enough to shout taura get this building secured from above the sergeant in turn bellowed orders to her scurrying troopers quinn pulled a vibraknife from her belt sheath and began cutting away miless fatigues ripping through belts and the nervedisruptor shieldsuit tossing the bloody fragments aside mark looked up following her glance to see the medic with the floatpallet returning hauling his burden across the concrete the floatpallet counteracted gravity but not mass the inertia of the heavy cryochamber fought his attempts to run and fought him again as he braked and lowered the pallet to the floor near his dead commander half a dozen confused clones followed the medic like baby ducks clustering together and staring around in horror at the ghastly aftermath of the brief sharp firefight the medic looked back and forth from miless body to the loaded cryochamber captain quinn its no good it wont hold two the hell its not quinn staggered to her feet her voice grating like gravel she seemed unaware of the tears running down her face tracking pinkly through the spatter the hell its not she stared bleakly at the gleaming cryochamber dump her quinn i cant on my order on my hands quinn the medics voice was anguished would he have ordered this he just lost his damn vote all right she took a deep breath ill do it you start prepping him teeth clenched the medic moved to obey he flipped open a door at the end of the chamber and removed a tray of equipment it was all in disarray having been used once already and hastily repacked he rolled out some big insulated bottles keyed open the chamber its lid popped breaking the seal i rose she reached within unfastening things that mark could not did not wish to see she hissed as instantlyfrozen skin tore from r hands but reached again with a grunt she heaved a womans greenish empurpled nude body from the chamber and laid it on the floor it was the smashedup biketrooper phillipi thornes patrol ring bharaputran fire had finally found her near her downed floater some two buildings away from her lost helmet broken back broken limbs shed taken hours to die against all the green squad medics heroic efforts to save her quinn looked up and saw mark ring at her her face was ravaged you you useless wrap her she pointed to phillipi then hurried around the cryochamber to where the blue squad medic now sit beside miles mark broke his paralysis at last to scuttle around and find a thin foil heat wrap among the medical supplies frightened of the body but too terrified by quinn to disobey he laid out the silver wrap and led the cold dead woman up in it she was stiff and heavy under his cringing touch he rose to hear the medic muttering with his ungloved hands plunged deep into the gory mess that had been miles vorkosigans chest i cant find an end where the hells an end at least the damned aorta something its been over four minutes snarled quinn pulled out her vibrablade again and cut miless corpses throat two neat slashes bracketing but not touching the windpipe her fingers scrabbled in the cut the medic glanced up only to say be sure you get the carotid and not the jugular im trying theyre not colorcoded she found something pale and rubbery she pulled tubing from the top of one of the insulated lines and jammed its plastic endnozzle into the presumed artery she switched the power on the tiny pump hummed pushing translucent greencryofluid through the transparent tubing she pulled out a second piece of tubing from the jug and inserted it on the other side of miless neck blood began to flow from the slashed exit veins over her hands over everything not spurting as from a heartbeat but in steady inhuman mechanical fashion it spread on the floor in a shimmering pool then began to flow away across some subtle drainslope a little carmine creek an impossible quantity of blood the clustered clones were weeping marks own head throbbed pain so great it darkened his vision quinn kept the pumps going till what came out ran greenishclear the medic meanwhile had apparently found the ends he was looking and attached two more tubes more blood mixed with cryofluid welled up and spilled from the wound the creek became a river the medic pulled miless boots and socks off and ran sensors over his paling feet almost there damn were nearly dry he hastened to his jug which had switched itself off and was blinking a red indicator light i used all i had said quinn its probably enough they were both small people clamp those ends he tossed her something glittering which she snatched out of the air they bent over the little body into the chamber then said the medic quinn cradled the head the medic took the torso and hips the arms and legs dangled down hes light they swung their stripped burden hastily into the cryochamber leaving the bloodsoaked uniform on the floor in a sodden heap quinn left the medic to make the last connections and turned away blindeyed talking to her helmet she did not look down at the long silver package at her feet thorne appeared crossing the chamber at a jog where had it been thorne caught quinns eye and with a jerk of its head at the dead bharaputrans reported they came up through the tunnels all right i have the exits secured for now thorne glowered bleakly at the cryochamber the hermaphrodite looked suddenly middleaged old quinn acknowledge this with a nod key to channel c we got trouble outside a kind of dreary curiosity winkled through marks numb shock he turned his own headset back on hed had it helplessly and hopelessly turned off for hours ever since thorne had snatched back its command he followed the captains transmissions the blue and orange squad perimeter teams were under heavy pressure from beefedup bharaputran security forces quinns delay in this building was drawing bharaputrans like flies to carrion with a buzzing excitement with over twothirds of the clones now packed aboard the shuttle the enemy had stopped directing heavy fire toward it but airborne reinforcements were gathering fast hovering like vultures quinn and company were in imminent danger of being surrounded and cut off got to be another way muttered quinn she switched channels lieutenant kimura hows it going with you resistance still soft its hardened up beautifully i kinda got my hands full right now quinnie kimuras thin weirdly cheerful voice came back cut by a wash of static indicating plasma fire and the activation of his plasma mirror field weve achieved our objective and are pulling out now trying to chat later huh more static which objective take care of your damn shuttle yhear boy you may yet have to come for us report to me the second youre back in the air right a slight pause why isnt the admiral on this channel quinnie quinns eyes squeezed shut in pain hes temporarily out of contact move it kimura kimuras reply whatever it was broke up in another wash of static a program regarding kimura and his objective was loaded in marks helmet but the lieutenant seemed to be transmitting from somewhere other than the medical complex a feint if so kimura wasnt drawing nearly enough enemy troops away from them sergeant framinghams sentinel from the drop shuttle broke in urging quinn to hurry almost simultaneously with an orange squad perimeter team reporting themselves forced off another vantage point could the shuttle land on top of this building and pick us up quinn inquired gazing at the girders overhead thorne frowned following her eyes i think it would cave in the roof hell other ideas down said mark suddenly both dendarii jerked catching themselves from flattening to the floor as they realized what he meant through the tunnels the bharaputrans got in we can get back out its a blind warren objected quinn i have a map said mark all of green squad does loaded programs green squad can lead why didnt you say so earlier snapped quinn illogically ignoring fact that there had hardly been an earlier thorne nodded confirmation and began hastily tracing through its nets holovid map can do theres a routeputs us up inside a building beyond your shuttle quinn bharaputran defenses are there and all facing the other way and their superior numbers t help them down below quinn stared down i hate dirt i want vacuum and elbow room right lets do it sergeant taura a flurry of organization a few more doors blown away and the party was on the march once more down a lift tube and into utility tunnels troopers scouted ahead of the main group taura and half a dozen clones carry phillipis wrapped body laid across the metal bars shed torn from the catwalk railings as if the biketrooper still had some forlorn hope of preservation and revival mark found himself pacing beside the cryochamber on its float pallet tugged along by the anxious medic he glanced from the corner is eye through the transparent cover his progenitor lay opentried pale and graylipped and still frost formed feathers along seals and a blast of waste heat flowed from the refrigeration units motor it would burn like a bonfire on an enemys infrared sensor mark shivered and crouched in the heat he was hungry and terribly cold damn you miles vorkosigan there was so much i wanted to say to you and now youre not listening the straight tunnel they were traversing passed under another building giving way through double doors to a wide foyer full of multiple crossconnections several lift tubes emergency stairs other tunnels and utility closets all the doors were opened or blown open by the pointmen looking for bharaputran resistance the air was pungent with smoke and the harsh lingering tang from plasma arc fire unfortunately at this juncture the point men found what they were looking for the lights went out dendarii helmet visors snapped shut all around mark as they switched to infrared he followed suit and stared disoriented into a world drained of color his helmet crackled with voice communications stepping on each other as two pointmen came running backwards into the foyer from separate corridors firing plasma arcs that blared blindingly on his heatenhanced vision four halfarmored bharaputran security personnel swung out of a lift tube cutting quinns column in half so confined was the confusion they found themselves fighting handtohand mark was knocked down by accident by a swinging dendarii and crouched near the floatpallet this isnt shielded the medic groaned slapping the cryochamber as arcs of fire whipped by close overhead one square hit and into the lift tube then yelled mark at him the medic nodded and swung the pallet around into the nearest dark opening free of bharaputrans the lifttube was switched off or the conflicting grav fields might have blown circuits on both tube and pallet the medic scrambled aboard the cryochamber as if it were a horse and began to sink from sight another trooper followed hand over hand down the emergency ladder on the tubes interior plasma arc fire struck mark three times in rapid succession as he scrambled to his feet knocking him down again his mirrorfield shed a roar of blue crackles as he rolled toward the tube through waves of heat he swung down the ladder after the trooper out of the line of fire but not for long a bharaputran helmet flashed above them in the entrance then plasma arc fire followed them downward with a glare like lightning in the tube the trooper helped the medic yank and heave the floatpallet out of this sudden shooting gallery and through the lowest entrance and ducked after mark scrambled in their wake feeling like a human torch netted and entwined with racketing blue incandescence how many shots had that been hed lost count how many more could his shielding take before it gave way and burned out the trooper took a firing stance aimed back into the lift tube but no bharaputran followed them they stood in a pocket of dark and quiet shouts and shots echoing faintly down the tube from the battle overhead this was a much smaller foyer with only two exits dim low emergency lighting along the floor gave a falsely cozy sense of warmth hell said the medic staring upward i think weve just cut ourselves off not necessarily said mark neither the medic nor the trooper were green squad but marks helmet of course had green squad programming he called up the holomap found their current location and let the helmets computer sketch a route you can get there from this level too its a bit more roundabout but youre less likely encounter bharaputrans for that very reason let me see demanded the medic halfreluctant halfrelieved mark gave his helmet up to him the medic jammed it on his head and studied the red line snaking through the d schematic grid of the medical complex projected before his eyes mark risked a darting glance up the lift tube no bararaputrans loomed overhead and the sounds of combat were muffled as if growing more distant he ducked back to find the trooper looking at him unsettling glints of his eyes gleaming through his visor im not your damned admiral mores the pity eh the trooper probably was of the opinion that the bharaputrans had shot the wrong short man mark didnt even need words to get that message he ached yeah the medic decided his jaw tightened behind his visor if you hurry you might even get there ahead of captain quinn said mark he still held the medics helmet there were no more sounds from overhead should he run after quinns moving firefight stay and try to help guide and guard the floatpallet he was not sure if he was more afraid of quinn or of the bharaputran fire her party drew either way hed probably be safer with the cryochamber he took a deep breath you keep my helmet ill take yours th medic and the trooper were both glowering at him with disfavor tellingly ill go after quinn and the clones his clones would quinn have any regard at all for their lives go then said the medic he and the trooper aimed the floatpallet out the doors and didnt look back they obviously had him judged as more of a liability than an asset and felt wellrid of him grimly he climbed the ladder back up the lift tube he peeked cautiously across the foyer floor as it came to his eye level a lot of property damage a sprinkler system had added steam to the choking smoke one brownclad body lay prone unmoving the floor was wet and slippery he swung out of the tube and darted skittishly out the corridor the dendarii company must have taken if they were sticking heir planned route more plasma arc damage assured him he was the right track he rounded a corner skidded to a halt and flung himself backward out of sight the bharaputrans hadnt seen him theyd been facing the other way he retreated back down the corridor while awkwardly keying through the channels of the unfamiliar helmet till he made contact with quinn captain quinn uh mark here where the hell are you wheres norwood hes got my helmet hes taking the cryochamber through by another route im behind you but i cant close up there are at least four bharaputrans in full space armor between us coming up on your rear watch out hell now were outgunned that tears it quinn paused no i can take care of them mark get the hell away follow norwood run what are you going to do drop the roof on those bastards lotta good space armorll do em then run he ran realizing what she was planning at the first lift tube he came to he took to the ladder climbing wildly regardless of where it led he didnt want to be any further underground than he had to when it was like an earthquake he clung as the tube cracked and buckled and the felt sound beat through his body it was over in a moment but for an echoing rumble and he resumed his climb daylight ahead reflecting silver down a tube entrance he came out on the ground floor of a building furnished like a fancy office its windows were cracked and starred he knocked a hole in one and climbed through and flipped up his infrared visor to his right half of another building had fallen away into an enormous crater dust still rose in choking clouds the bharaputrans in their sturdy deadly space armor were possibly still alive under all that but it would take an excavation crew hours to dig them out he grinned despite his terror panting in the daylight the medics helmet did not have nearly the eavesdropping capacity of the command headset but he found quinn again all right norwood keep on going she was saying go like hell framingham got that lock on norwood start pulling in your perimeter people lift as soon as norwood and tonkin are aboard kimura you in the air a pause mark could not get kimuras reply whoever and wherever he was but he could fill in the sense of it from quinns continuation well weve just made you a new drop zone its a bit lumpy but itll do follow my signal come straight down into the crater youll just fit yes you will too ive laserscoped it you do too have clearance you can risk the shuttle now kimura come on he made for the crater too scuttling along close to the side of the building taking advantage of overhangs till the patter of falling concrete chips made him realize that the blastdamaged balcony above his head was losing its structural integrity stay under and get mashed or step out in the open and get shot whichever he did would prove the wrong choice he was certain what was that line vorkosigans military textbooks were so fond of quoting no battle in survives first contact with the enemy quinns tactics and dispositions shifted with bewildering speed she was exploiting a quite literal new openingthe roar of a drop shuttle grew in his ears and he sprinted out from under the balcony as the vibrations weakened it the end gave way and fell with a crash he kept on sprinting let the bharaputran snipers try to hit a moving target quinn and her group ventured into the open just as the drop shuttle feet extended like an enormous insect felt its way carefully into the crater a few last bharaputrans were in position on a roof opposite to offer harrying fire but they had only plasma arcs and were still being careful of the clones though one pinkclad girl screamed caught in the backwash of a dendarii plasma mirror field light burns painful but not fatal she was crying and panicked but a dendarii trooper nevertheless caught her and aimed her at the shuttle hatch now opening and extruding a ramp the few bharaputrans hopeless of bringing the shuttle down with there snipers weapons changed their tactics they began concentrating their fire on quinn shot after shot pumping into her overloading mirror field she shimmered in a haze of blue fire staggering under the impact clones and dendarii pelted up the ramp command helmets draw fire he could see no other way but to run in front of her the air around him lit as his mirror field spilled energy but in the brief respite quinn regained her balance she grabbed him by the hand and together they sprinted up the ramp the last to board the shuttle was lurching back into the air and the ramp withdrawing even as they fell through the hatch the hatch sealed behind them the silence felt like a song mark rolled over on his back and lay gasping for air lungs on fire quinn sat up her face red in its circle of gray just a sunburn she cried hysterically for three breaths then clamped her mouth shut tearfully her fingers touched her hot cheeks and mark remembered at this was the woman who had had her face burned entirely away by plasma fire once but not twice not twice she scrambled to her knees and began keying through command channels on her almostfatal headset again she then yanked herself to her feet and ricocheted forward in the jinking accelerations of the shuttle mark sat up and stared around disoriented sergeant taura thorne the clones he recognized the rest were strange dendarii lieutenant kimuras yellow squad presumably some in the usual gray fatigues some in full space armor they looked rather the worse for wear all four bunks for wounded in the hack were folded down and filled and a fifth man was laid out on the floor but the attending medic moved smoothly not frantically her patients were clearly stabilized able to wait for further treatment under more favorable conditions yellow squads cryochamber was recently occupied though the prognosis was now so bad for the foilwrapped phillipi mark wondered if they would even attempt to continue freezing her once they were back aboard the peregrine but except for the biketrooper and the cryochamber there were no more covered forms no body bagskimuras squad seemed to have made it through their mission whatever it had been fairly lightly the shuttle banked they were circling not boosting to orbit yet mark moaned under his breath and rose to follow quinn and find out what was going on when he came in sight of the prisoner he stopped short the man sat with his hands bound behind him securely strapped into a seat and guarded by two yellow squad troopers a big fellow and a thin woman who made mark think of a snake all sinuous muscle and unblinking beady eyes the prisoner looked a striking forty or so years of age and wore a torn brown silk tunic and trousers loose strands of dark hair escaped from a gold ring on the back of his head and fell about his face he did not struggle but sat calmly waiting with a cold patience that quite matched the snakewomans bharaputra the bharaputra baron bharaputra vasa luigi himself the man hadnt changed a hair in the eight years since mark had last glimpsed him vasa luigis face rose and his eyes widened slightly seeing mark so admiral he murmured just so mark responded automatically with a naismithphrase he swayed as the shuttle banked more sharply concealing weakkneed terror concealing exhaustion he hadnt slept the night before this mission either bharaputra here the baron cocked an eyebrow who is that on your shirt mark glanced down at himself the bandolier of blood had not yet turned brown and was still damp sticky and cold he found himself actually wanting to answer my brother for the shock value but he wasnt sure the baron was shockable he fled forward avoiding more intimate conversation baron bharaputra did quinn and company plan to ride this tiger and how but at least he now understood why the shuttle could circle the combat zone without apparent fear of enemy fire he found quinn and thorne both in the pilots compartment along with kimura the yellow squad commander quinn had taken over the shuttles communication station her gray hood pushed back sweatsoaked dark curls in disarray framingham report she was crying into the comm youve got to get into the air bharaputran airborne reinforcements are almost on top of you across the flight deck at the station opposite quinns thorne monitored a tactical holovid two dendarii colored dots fighter shuttles set upon but failed to break up an array of enemy shuttles passing a ghost city astral projection of the live city turning below them mark glanced out the window past the pilots shoulders but could not spot the originals in the sunlit morning smog we have a downedman recovery in progress maam framings voice returned one minute till the squad gets back do you have everyone else do you have norwood i cant raise his helmet there was a short delay quinns fists clenched opened her fingerwere bitten to red stumps framinghams voice at last weve got him now maam got everyonethe quick and the dead alike except for phillipi i dont want to leave anyone for those bloody bastards if i can help it we have phillipi thank god then everyones accounted for we have liftoff now captain quinn thats precious cargo framingham said quinn we rendezvous in the perigrines umbrella of fire the fighter shuttles will guard your ass in the tac display the dendarii dots peeled away from the faltering enemy and left them behind what about your wings well be right behind you yellow squad bought us a firstclass ticket home free home free is fell station and then we head out no the ariel took some damage earlier were docking understood see you there the dendarii formation came together at last and began to boost hard mark fell into a station chair and hung on the fighter shuttles were more at risk from enemy fire than the drop shuttles he feared watching the tac display one fighter shuttle was distinctly lagging it clung close to the yellow squads craft the formation slowed itself to its wounded member but for once things ran to plan bharaputran harriers dropped reluctantly behind as they broke f the atmosphere and into orbit quinn rested her elbows for a weary moment on her console and hid her redandwhite face in her hands rubbing tender eyelids thorne sat silent quinn thorne himself all bore broken segments of that ribbon of blood like a red ribbon binding them one to another fell station was coming up at last it was a huge structure the largest of the orbital transfer stations circling jacksons whole and house fells headquarters and homei city baron fell liked holding the high ground in the delicate interlocking network of the great houses house fell probably held the most raw power in terms of capacity for destruction but raw destruction was seldom profitable and coup was counted in coins here what coin were the dendarii using to buy fell stations help or at least neutrality the person of baron bharaputra now secured in the cargo bay what kind of bargaining chips were the clones then small change and to think hed despised the jacksonians for being dealers in flesh fell station was just now passing out of the planets eclipse the advancing line of sunlight dramatically unveiling its vast extent they decelerated toward one arm giving up direction to fells traffic controllers and some heavily armed tugs which appeared out of nowhere to escort them and there was the peregrine coasting in the drop shuttles and the fighter shuttles all gavotted around their mother ship coming meekly to their docking clamps the peregrine itself eased delicately toward its assigned mooring with a clank of the portside clamps and the hiss of flextube seals they were home in the cargo bay the dendarii expedited removal of the wounded to the peregrines infirmary then turned much more slowly and wearily to tiedown and cleanup chores quinn shot past them thorne close on her heels as if pulled by that mortal red ribbon mark followed the goal of quinns mad dash was the starboard side shuttle hatch where framinghams shuttle was coming to dock they arrived there just as the flextube seals were secured then had to stand out of the way as the wounded were rushed out first mark was disturbed to recognize trooper tonkin who had accompanied norwood the medic among them tonkin had reversed roles from guard to patient his face was dark and still unconscious as eager hands hustled him past and shifted him onto a float pallet somethings very wrong here quinn shifted impatiently from foot to foot other dendarii troopers started to exit herding clones quinn frowned and shouldered upstream past them through the flex tube and into the shuttle thorne and mark went after her into free fall chaos there were cloneyouths everywhere some crying some violently sickdendarii were attempting to catch them and get them towed to the exit one harried trooper with a handvac was chasing floating globs of some childs last meal before everyone had to breathe it the shouts and screams and babble were like a blow to the mind framinghams bellows were failing to speed a return to military order any faster than the terrorized clones could be removed from the cargo bay framingham quinn floated over and grabbed him by the ankle framingham where the hells the cryochamber norwood was escorting he glanced down frowning but you said you had it captain what you said you had phillipi his lips stretched in a fierce grimace goddammit if weve left her behind ill we have phillipi yes but shesshe was no longer in the cryochamber norwood was supposed to be getting it to you norwood and tonkin they didnt have it when my rescue patrol pulled them out we them both what was left of em norwood was killed hit through eye with one of those frigging projectile spinegrenades blew his head apart but i didnt leave his body its in the bag over there command helmets draw fire oh yes i knew that no wonder quinn hadnt been able to raise norwoods comm channels the cryochamber framingham quinns voice held a high pitch anguish mark had never heard before we didnt see any goddamn cryochamber quinn norwood and tonkin didnt have it when we got to them whats so frigging important about the cryochamber if phillipi wasnt even in it quinn released his ankle and floated in a tightening ball arms and legs drawing in her eyes were dark and huge she bit off a string of inadequate foul words grinding her teeth so hard her gums went white thorne looked like a chalk doll thorne quinn said when she could speak again get on the comm to elena i want both ships on a total security blackout as of now no leaves no passes no communications with fell station or anybody else that isnt cleared by me tell her to get lieutenant hart over here from the ariel i want to meet with them both at once do not over comm channels go thorne nodded rotated in air and launched itself forward toward the flight deck what is this demanded sergeant framingham quinn took a deep slow breath framingham we left the admiral downside have you lost your mind hes right there framinghams finger sagged in midpoint at mark his hand closed into a fist oh he realized thats the clone quinns eyes burned mark could feel them boring through to the back of his skull like laserdrills maybe not quinn said heavily not as far as house bharaputra needs to know ah framinghams eyes narrowed in speculation no mark screamed inside silently very silently chapter eight it was like being trapped in a locked room with half a dozen serial killers with hangovers mark could hear each ones breathing from where they sat in a ring around the officers conference table they were in the briefing chamber off the peregrines main tactics room quinns breath was the lightest and fastest sergeant tauras was the deepest and most ominous only elena botharijesek at her captains place at the head of the table and lieutenant hart on her right were shipboardclean and natty the rest had come as they were from the drop mission battered and stinking taura sergeant framingham lieutenant kimura quinn on botharijeseks left and himself of course lonely at the far end of the oblong table captain botharijesek frowned and wordlessly handed around a bottle of painkiller tablets sergeant taura took six only lieutenant kimura passed taura handed them across to framingham without offering any to mark he longed for the tablets as a thirsty man might yearn after a glass of water poured out and sinking into desert sand the bottle went back up the table and disappeared into the captains pocket marks eyes throbbed in time to his sinuses and the back of his head felt tight as drying rawhide botharijesek spoke this emergency debriefing is called to deal with just two questions and as quickly as possible what the hell happened and what are we going to do next are those helmet recorders on their way yes maam said sergeant framingham corporal abromov is bringing them unfortunately we are missing the most pertinent one said quinn correct framingham im afraid so maam i suppose its embedded in a wall somewhere at bharaputras along with most of the rest of norwoods helmet friggin grenades hells quinn hunched in her seat the briefing room door slid open and corporal abromov entered at a jog he carried four small clear plastic trays stacked and labeled green squad yellow squad orange squad and blue squad each tray held an array of ten to sixteen tiny buttons helmet recorders each troopers personal records of the past hours tracking every movement every heartbeat every scan shot hit and communication events that had passed too rapidly for comprehension in realtime could be slowed analyzed teased apart errors of procedure detected and correctednext time abromov saluted and handed the trays to captain botharijesek she dismissed him with thanks and passed the trays on to captain quinn who in turn inserted them into the simulators data slot and downloaded them she also encoded the file top secret her rawtipped fingers darted over the vid control panel the nowfamiliar ghostly threedimensional holomap of bharaputras medical facility formed above the table top ill jump forward to the time we were attacked in the tunnel quinn said there we are blue squad part of green squad a spaghettitangle of lines of green and blue colored light appeared deep inside a misty building tonkin was blue squad number six and kept his helmet throughout what follows she made tonkins number six maptrack yellow for contrast norwood was still wearing blue squad number ten mark her lips pinched was wearing helmet one that track of course was conspicuously missing she made norwoods number ten track pink at what point did you change helmets with norwood mark she did not look at him as she asked this question please let me go he was sure he was sick because he was still shivering a small muscle in the back of his neck spasmed tiny twitches in a prickling underlayer of pain we went to the bottom of that lift tube his voice came out a dry whisper when when helmet ten comes back up im wearing it norwood and tonkin went on together and thats the last i saw of them the pink line indeed crawled back up the tube and wormed after the mob of blue and green lines the yellow track went on alone quinn fastforwarded voice contacts tonkins baritone came out in a whine like an insect on amphetamines when i last contacted them they were here quinn marked the spot with a glowing dot of light in an interior corridor deep inside another building she fell silent and let the yellow line snake on down a lift tube through yet another utility tunnel under a structure up and through yet another there said framingham suddenly is the floor they were trapped on we picked up contact with em there quinn marked another dot then the cryochamber has to be somewhere near the line of march between here and here she pointed to the two bright dots it has to be she stared eyes narrowed two buildings two and a half i suppose but theres not a damn thing on tonkins voice transmissions that gives me a clue the insectvoice described bharaputran attackers and cried for help over and over but did not mention the cryochamber marks throat contracted in synchrony quinn turn him off please the program ran to its end all the dendarii around the table stared at it as if willing it to yield up something more there was no more the door slid aside and captain thorne entered mark had never seen a more exhaustedlooking human being thorne too was still dressed in dirty fatigues only the plasma mirror pack discarded from its half armor its gray hood was pushed back brown hair plastered flat to its head a circle of grime in the middle of thornes pale face marked the hood opening gray twin to the circle of red on quinns face from her mirrorfield overload burn thornes movements were hurried and jerky will overriding a fatigue close to collapse thorne leaned hands on the conference table mouth a grim horizontal line so could you get anything at all out of tonkin asked quinn of thorne what the computer has we just saw and i dont think its enough the medics got him waked up briefly reported thorne he did talk i was hoping the recorders would make sense of what he said but what did he say he said when they reached this building thorne pointed they were cut off not yet surrounded but blocked from a line to the shuttle and the enemy closing the ring fast tonkin said norwood yelled he had an idea hed seen something back there he had tonkin create a diversion with a grenade attack and guard a particular corridormust be that one there norwood took the cryochamber and ran back along their route he returned a few minutes laternot more than six minutes tonkin said and he told tonkin its all right now the admiral will get out of here even if we dont about two minutes later he was killed by that projectile grenade and tonkin was knocked loopy by the concussion framingham nodded my crew got there not three minutes after that they drove off a pack of bharaputrans who were searching the bodieslooting looking for intelligence or both corporal abromov wasnt surethey picked up tonkin and norwoods body and ran like hell nobody in the squad reported seeing a cryochamber anywhere quinn chewed absently on a fingernail stump mark did not think he was even conscious of the gesture thats all tonkin said norwood was laughing thorne added laughing quinn grimaced hell captain botharijesek was sunk in her station chair everyone around the table appeared to digest this last tidbit staring at the holomap he did something clever said botharijesek or something that he thought was clever he only had about five minutes how clever could he be in five minutes quinn complained gods damn the clever jerk to sixteen hells for not reporting he was doubtless about to botharijesek sighed i dont think we need to waste time rationing blame theres going to be plenty to go around thorne winced as did framingham quinn and taura then they all glanced at mark he cringed back in his seat its only been quinn glanced at her chrono less than two hours whatever norwood did the cryochamber has to still be down there it has to so what do we do lieutenant kimura asked dryly mount mother drop mission quinn thinned her lips in nonappreciation of the weary sarcasm you volunteering kimura kimura flipped up his palms in surrender and subsided in the meantime botharijesek said fell station is calling us pretty urgently we have to start dealing i presume this will involve our hostage a short nod of thanks in kimuras direction acknowledged the only wholly successful part of the drop mission and kimura nodded back does anyone here know what the admiral intended to do with baron bharaputra a circle of negative headshakes dont you know quinnie asked kimura surprised no there wasnt time to chat im not even sure if the admiral seriously expected your kidnapping expedition to succeed kimura or whether it was only for the diversionary value that would be more like his strategizing not to let the whole mission turn on one unknown outcome i expect he planned her voice faded in a sigh to use his initiative she sat up straight but i sure as hell know what i intend to do the deal this time is going to be in our favor baron bharaputra could be the ticket out of here for all of us and the admiral too but we have to work it just right in that case said botharijesek i dont think we should let on to house bharaputra just how valuable a package we left downside botharijesek thorne quinn all of them turned to look at mark coldly speculative ive thought of that too said quinn no he whispered no his scream emerged as a croak you cant be serious you cant make me be him i dont want to be him any more god no he was shaking shivering his stomach turning and knotting im cold quinn and botharijesek glanced at each other botharijesek nodded some unspoken message quinn said you are all dismissed to your duties except you captain thorne you are relieved of command of the ariel lieutenant hart will take over thorne nodded as if this were entirely expected am i under arrest quinns eyes narrowed in pain hell we dont have the time or the personnel and youre not debriefed yet and besides i need your experience this situation could change rapidly at any moment consider yourself under house arrest and assigned to me you can guard yourself take a visiting officers cabin here on the peregrine and call it your cell if it makes you feel any better thornes face went very bleak indeed yes maam it said woodenly quinn frowned go clean up well continue this later except for quinn and botharijesek they all filed out mark tried to follow them not you said quinn in a voice like a death bell he sank back into his station chair and huddled there as the last dendarii cleared the chamber quinn reached over and turned off all recording devices miless women elenathechildhoodsweetheart now captain botharijesek mark had studied back when the komarrans had tutored him to play lord vorkosigan yet she was not quite what he had expected quinn the dendarii had taken the komarran plotters by surprise the two women had a coincidental resemblance in coloration both with short dark hair fine pale skin liquid brown eyes or was it so coincidental had vorkosigan subconsciously chosen quinn as botharijeseks substitute when he couldnt have the real thing even their first names were similar elli and elena botharijesek was the taller by a head with long aristocratic features and was more cool and reserved an effect augmented by her clean officers undress grays quinn fatigueclad and combatbooted was shorter though still a head taller than himself rounder and hotter both were terrifying marks own taste in women if ever he should live to exercise it ran more to something like that little blonde clone theyd pulled from under the bed if only shed been the age looked to be somebody short soft pink timid somebody who wouldnt kill and eat him after they mated elena botharijesek was watching him with a sort of appalled fascination so like him yet not him why are you shivering im cold muttered mark youre cold quinn echoed in outrage youre cold you godsdamned little sucker she turned her station chair abruptly around and sat with her back to him botharijesek rose and walked around to his end of the table willowwood woman she touched his forehead which was clammy he flinched almost explosively she bent and stared into his eyes quinback off hes in psychological shock he doesnt deserve my consideration quinn choked hes still in shock regardless if you want results you have to take it into account hell quinn turned back new clean wet tracks ran down from eyes across her redandwhite dirtanddriedbloodsmudged face you didnt see you didnt see miles lying there with his heart blown all over the room quinnie hes not really dead is he hes just frozen and and placed was there the faintest tinge of uncertainty denial in her voice oh hes really dead all right very really frozen dead and hes going to stay that way forever if we dont get him back the blood all over her fatigues caked in the grooves of her hands smeared across her face was finally turning brown botharijesek took a breath lets focus on the business to hand the immediate question is can mark fool baron fell fell met the real miles once thats one of the reasons i didnt put bel thorne under close arrest bel was there and can advise i hope yes and thats the curious thing she hitched a hip over the tabletop and let one long booted leg swing shock or no shock mark hasnt blown miless deepcover the name vorkosigan hasnt passed lips has it no quinn admitted botharijesek twisted up her mouth and studied him why not she asked suddenly he crouched down a little further in his station chair trying to ape the impact of her stare i dont know he muttered she tried implacably for more and he mustered in an only slightly louder mumble habit i guess mostly ser galens habit of beating the shit of him whenever hed screwed up back in the bad old days when i do the part i do the part miles would never have slipped that one so i dont either who are you when youre not doing the part botharijeseks gaze was narrowed calculating i hardly know he swallowed and tried again for more volume in his voice whats going to happen to myto the clones as quinn began to speak botharijesek held up her hand stopping her botharijesek said instead what do you want to have happen to them i want them to go free to be set free somewhere safe where house bharaputra cant kidnap them back a strange altruism i cant help wondering why why this whole mission in the first place what did you hope to gain his mouth opened but no sound came out he couldnt answer he was still clammy weak and shaking his head ached blackly as though draining of blood he shook his head peh snorted quinn what a loser what a a damned antimiles snatching defeat from the jaws of victory quinn said botharijesek quietly there was a profound reproof in her voice just in that single word which quinn heard and acknowledged with a shrug of her shoulder i dont think either one of us knows quite what we have hold of here botharijesek continued but i know when im out of my depth however i know someone who wouldnt be who countess vorkosigan hm quinn sighed thats another thing whos going to tell her about a downward jerk of her thumb indicated jacksons whole and the fatal events that had just passed there and gods help me if im really in command of this outfit now im gonna have to report all this to simon illyan she paused do you want to be in command elena as senior shipmaster present now that bels under quasiarrest and all that i just grabbed cause i had to under fire youre doing fine said botharijesek with a small smile ill support you she added youve been more closely involved with intelligence all along youre the logical choice yes i know quinn grimaced youll tell the family if it comes to that for that botharijesek sighed i am the logical choice ill tell the countess yes its a deal but they both looked as if they wondered who had the better or worse half of it as for the clones botharijesek eyed mark again how would you like to earn their freedom elena said quinn warningly dont make promises we dont know what were going to have to trade yet to get out of here to get another gesture downward him back no mark whispered you cant cant send them back down there after all this i traded phillipi said quinn grimly id trade you in a heartbeat except that he do you know why we came downside on this bloody drop mission in the first place she demanded wordlessly he shook his head it was for you you little shit the admiral had a deal halfcut with baron bharaputra we were going to buy out green squad for quarter of a million betan dollars it wouldnt have cost much more than the drop mission counting all the equipment we lost along with thornes shuttle and the lives but the baron refused to throw you into the pot why he wouldnt sell you i dont know youre worthless to everybody else but miles wouldnt leave you mark stared down at his hands which plucked at each other he lanced up to see botharijesek studying him again as if he were some vital cryptogram as the admiral would not leave his brother said botharijesek lowly so mark will not leave the clones will you eh he would have swallowed but hed run out of spit youll do anything to save them eh anything we ask his mouth opened and closed it might have been a hollow soundless yes youll play the part of the admiral for us well coach you of course he halfnodded but managed to blurt out what promise well take all the clones with us when we go well put them down somewhere house bharaputra cant reach elena objected quinn i want he did swallow this time i want the barrayaran womans word your word he said to botharijesek quinn sucked on her lower lip but did not speak after a long muse botharijesek nodded all right you have my word on it but you give us your total cooperation understood your word as what just my word yes all right quinn rose and stared down at him but is he even fit to play the part right now botharijesek followed her look not in that condition no i suppose not let him clean up eat rest then well see what can be lone baron fell may not give us time to coddle him well tell baron fell hes in the shower thatll be true enough a shower food he was so ravenous as to be almost beyond hunger numb in the belly listless in the flesh and cold all i can say said quinn is that hes a damn poor imitation of the real miles vorkosigan yes thats what ive been trying to tell you botharijesek shook her head in presumably exasperated agreement come on she said to him she escorted him to an officers cabin small but thankgod private it was disused blank and clean militaryaustere the air a little stale he supposed thorne must now be similarly housed nearby ill get some clean clothes sent over for you from the ariel and send some food food firstplease sure why are you being nice to me his voice came out plaintive and suspicious making him sound weak and paranoid he feared her aquiline face went introspective i want to know who you are what you are you know im a manufactured clone manufactured right here on jacksons whole i dont mean your body he hunched in an automatic defensive posture though he knew it emphasized his deformities you are very closed she observed very alone thats not at all like miles usually hes not a man hes a mob hes got a whole damned army trailing around after him not to mention the harrowing harem i suppose he likes it like that her lips curved in an unexpected smile it was the first time hed seen her smile it changed her face he does i think her smile faded did youre doing this for him arent you treating me like this because you think hed want it not in his own right no never but all for miles and his damned brotherobsession partly right but mostly she said because someday countess vorkosigan will ask me what i did for her son youre planning to trade baron bharaputra for him arent you mark her eyes were dark with a strange pity irony he could not read her eyes shell mean you she turned on her heel and left him by himself sealed in the cabin he showered in the hottest water the tiny unit would yield and stood for long minutes in the heat of the dryerblast till his skin flushed red before he stopped shivering he was dizzy with exhaustion when he finally emerged he found someone had been and gone and left clothes and food he hastily pulled on underwear a black dendarii tshirt and a pair of his progenitors shipknit grey trousers and fell upon the dinner it wasnt a dainty naismithspecialdiet this time but rather a tray of standard readytoeat rations designed to keep a large and physically active trooper going strong it was far from gourmet fare but it was the first time hed had enough food on s plate for weeks he devoured it all as if whatever fairy had delivered it might reappear and snatch it away again stomach aching he crawled into bed and lay on his side he no longer shivered as if from cold nor felt drained and sweating and shaky from low blood sugar yet a kind of psychic reverberation still rolled like a black tide through is body at least you got the clones out no miles got the clones out dammit dammit dammit this halfbaked disaster was not the glorious redemption of which hed dreamed yet what had he expected the aftermath to be in all is desperate plotting hed planned almost nothing past his projected return to escobar with the ariel to escobar grinning with the clones under his wing hed imagined himself dealing with an enraged miles then but then it would have been too late for miles to stop him too late to take his victory from him hed halfexpected to be arrested but to go willingly whistling what had he wanted to be free of survivor guilt to break that old curse nobody you knew back then is still alive that was the motive hed thought of as driving him when he thought at all maybe it wasnt so simple hed wanted to free himself from something in the last two years reed of ser galen and the komarrans by the actions of miles vorkosigan freed again altogether by miles on a london street at dawn he had not found the happiness hed dreamed of during his slavery to he terrorists miles had broken only the physical chains that bound him others invisible had cut so deep that flesh had grown around hem what did you think that if you were as heroic as miles theyd lave to treat you like miles that they would have to love you and who were they the dendarii miles himself or behind stiles those sinister fascinating shadows count and countess vorkosigan his image of miless parents was blurred uncertain the unbalanced galen had presented them his hated enemies as black villains he butcher of komarr and his virago wife yet with his other hand hed required mark to study them using unedited source materials heir writings their public speeches private vids miless parents were nearly complex people hardly saints but just as clearly not the foaming sadistic sodomite and murderous bitch of galens raving paranoias in the vids count aral vorkosigan appeared merely a greyhaired thickset man with oddly intent eyes in his rather heavy face with a rich raspy level voice countess cordelia vorkosigan spoke less often a tall woman with redroan hair and notable grey eyes too powerful to be called pretty yet so centered and balanced as to seem beautiful even though strictly speaking she was not and now botharijesek threatened to deliver him to them he sat up and turned on the light a quick tour of the cabin revealed nothing to commit suicide with no weapons or bladesthe dendarii had disarmed him when hed come aboard nothing to hang a belt or rope from boiling himself to death in the shower was not an option a sealed failsafe sensor turned it off automatically when it exceeded physiological tolerances he went back to bed the image of a little urgent shouting man with his chest exploding outward in a carmine spray replayed in slow motion in his head he was surprised when he began to cry shock it had to be the shock that botharijesek had diagnosed i hated the little bugger when he was alive why am i crying it was absurd maybe he was going insane two nights without sleep had left him ringingly numb yet he could not sleep now he only dozed drifting in and out of neardreams and recent searing memories he halfhallucinated about being in a rubber raft on a river of blood bailing frantically in the red torrent so that when quinn came to get him after only an hours rest it was actually a relief chapter nine whatever you do said captain thorne dont mention the betan rejuvenation treatment mark frowned what betan rejuvenation treatment is there one no then why the hell would i mention it never mind just dont mark gritted his teeth swung around in his station chair square to he vid plate and pressed the keypad to lower his seat till his booted feet were flat to the floor he was fully kitted in naismiths officers greys quinn had dressed him as though he were a doll or an idiot child quinn botharijesek and thorne had then preceded to fill his lead with a mass of sometimesconflicting instructions on how to play miles in the upcoming interview as if i didnt know the three captains now each sat in station chairs out of range of the vid pickup in he peregrines tac room ready to prompt him through an earbug and hed thought galen was a puppet master his ear itched and he wriggled the bug in irritation earning a frown from botharijesek quinn had never stopped scowling quinn had never stopped she still wore her bloodsoaked fatigues her sudden inheritance of command of this debacle had allowed her no rest thorne had cleaned up and changed to ship greys but obviously had not slept yet both their faces stood out pale in the shadows too sharply lined quinn had made mark take a stimulant when getting him dressed shed found him too muzzymouthed for her taste and he did not quite like its effects his head and eyes were almost too clear but his body felt beaten all the edges and surfaces of the tac room seemed to stand out with unnatural clarity sounds and voices in his ears seemed to have a painful serrated quality sharp and blurred at once quinn was on the stuff too he realized watching her wince at a high electronic squeal from the comm equipment all right youre on said quinn through the earbug as the vid plate in front of him began to sparkle they all shut up at last the image of baron fell materialized and frowned at him too georish stauber baron fell of house fell was unusual for the leader of a jacksonian great house in that he still wore his original body an old mans body the baron was stout pink of face with a shiny liverspotted scalp fringed by white hair trimmed short the silk tunic he wore in his houses particular shade of green made him look like a hypothyroid elf but there was nothing elfin about his cold and penetrating eyes miles was not intimidated by a jacksonian barons power mark reminded himself miles was not intimidated by any power backed by less than three entire planets his father the butcher of komarr could eat jacksonian great houses for breakfast he of course was not miles screw that im miles for the next fifteen minutes anyway so admiral rumbled the baron we meet again after all quite mark managed not to let his voice crack i see you are as presumptuous as ever and as illinformed quite start talking dammit quinns voice hissed in his ear mark swallowed baron fell it was not a part of my original battle plan to involve fell station in this raid i am as anxious to decamp with my forces as you are to have us leave to that end i request your help as a gobetween you know that weve kidnapped baron bharaputra i trust so im told one of fells eyelids ticd youve rather overreached your available backup have you not have i mark shrugged house fell is in a state of vendetta with house bharaputra are you not not exactly house fell was on the verge of ending the vendetta with house bharaputra weve found it mutually unprofitable of late im now suspected of collusion in your raid the barons frown deepened uh his thought was interrupted by thorne whispering tell him bharaputras alive and well baron bharaputra is alive and well said mark and can remain so for all i care as a gobetween it seems to me you would be wellplaced to demonstrate your good faith to house bharaputra by helping to get him back i only wish to trade himintactfor one item and then well be gone you are optimistic fell said dryly mark plowed on a simple advantageous trade the baron for my clone brother thorne quinn and botharijesek all corrected in unison in his earbug brother mark continued edged he unset his teeth unfortunately my brother was shot in the melee downside fortunately he was successfully frozen in one of our emergency cryochambers um unfortunately the cryochamber was accidentally left behind in the scramble to get off a live man for a dead one i fail to see the difficulty the baron barked a laugh which he muffled in a cough the three dendarii faces across from mark in the shadows were chill and stiff and not amused youve been having an interesting visit admiral what do you want with a dead clone brother quinn said again miles insists always yes seconded thorne thats how i first knew you werent miles back on the ariel when i called you a clone and you didnt jump down my throat brother mark repeated wearily there was no headwound and the cryotreatment was begun almost instantly he has good hope of revival as such things go only if we get him back quinn growled i have a brother remarked baron fell he inspires no such emotions in me im right with you baron mark thought thorne piped up in marks ear hes talking about his halfbrother baron ryoval of house ryoval the original axis of this vendetta was between fell and ryoval bharaputra got dragged in later i know who ryoval is mark wanted to snap but could not in fact baron fell went on my brother will be quite excited to learn you are here after you so reduced his resources on your last visit he is alas limited to smallscale attacks but i suggest you watch your back oh do ryovals agents operate so freely on fell station mark purred thorne approved good one just like miles fell stiffened hardly thorne whispered yes remind him you helped him with his brother what the hell had miles done here four years ago baron i helped you with your brother you help me with mine and we can call it square hardly that the apples of discord you threw among us on your last departure took far too much time to sort out still its true you dealt ry a better blow that i could have was there a tiny glint of approval in fells eye he rubbed his round chin therefore i will give you one day to complete your business and depart youll act as gobetween the better to keep an eye on both parties yes mark explained the dendariis best guess as to the approximate location of the cryochamber and gave its description and serial numbers tell the bharaputrans we think it may have been hidden or disguised in some way please emphasize we wish it returned in good condition and their baron will be too good botharijesek encouraged let em know its too valuable to destroy without letting em guess they could hold us up for more ransom fells lips thinned admiral you are an acute man but i dont think you altogether understand how we do things on jacksons whole but you do baron thats why wed like to have you on our side i am not on your side that is perhaps the first thing you dont understand mark nodded slowly miles would have he thought fells attitude was strange faintly hostile yet he acts like he respects me no he respected miles hell your neutrality is all i ask fell shot him a narrow glance from under his white eyebrows what about the other clones what about them house bharaputra will be inquiring they do not enter into this transaction vasa luigis life should be sufficient and more yes the trade seems uneven what is so valuable about your late clone three voices chorused in his ear brother mark yanked the earbug out and slapped it to the counter beside the vid plate quinn nearly choked i cannot trade back fractions of baron bharaputra snapped mark tempted as i am to start doing so baron fell raised a placating plump palm calm admiral i doubt it will be necessary to go so far i hope not mark trembled itd be a shame if i had to send him back without his brain like the clones baron fell apparently read the absolute personal sincerity of his threat for he opened both palms ill see what i can do admiral thank you whispered mark the baron nodded his image dissolved by some trick of the holovid or the stimulant fells eyes seemed to linger for one last unsettling stare mark sat frozen for several seconds till he was certain they were gone huh said botharijesek sounding surprised you did that rather well he did not bother to answer that one interesting said thorne why didnt fell ask for a fee or a cut dare we trust him asked botharijesek not trust exactly quinn ran the edge of her index finger along her white teeth nibbling but we must have fells cooperation to transit jumppoint five we dare not offend him not for any money i thought he would be more pleased with our bite out of bharaputra at the strategic situation seems to have changed since your last visit here bel thorne sighed agreement quinn continued i want you to see what you can find out about the current balance of power here anything that may affect our operations anything we can use to help houses fell bharaputra and ryoval and anything coming up on the blindside theres something bout all this thats making me feel paranoid as hell though it may be just the drugs im on but im too damned tired to see it right now ill see what i can do thorne nodded and withdrew when the door hissed shut behind thorne botharijesek asked quinn have you reported all this to barrayar yet no any of it no i dont want to send this one over any commercial comm channel not even in code illyan may have a few deep cover agents here but i dont know who they are or how to access them miles would have known and and botharijesek raised an eyebrow and id really like to have the cryochamber back first to shove under the door along with the report quinnie it wouldnt fit quinn shrugged one defensive shoulder after a moment botharijesek offered i agree with you about not sending anything through the jacksonian jumpcourier system though yes from what illyans said its riddled with spies and not just the great houses checking up on each other either theres nothing barrayar could do to help us in the next daycycle anyway how long mark swallowed is that how long i have to go on laying miles i dont know said quinn sharply she gulped back control of her voice a day a week two weeksat least till we can deliver you and the cryochamber to impsecs galactic affairs hq on komarr then it will be out of my hands how the hell do you think youre going to keep all this under wraps mark asked scornfully dozens of people know what really happened two can keep a secret if one of them is dead quinn grimaced i dont know the troops will be all right they have the discipline the clones i can keep incommunicado anyway were all going to be bottled up on this ship till we reach komarr later ill deal with later i want to see my the my clones what youve done with them mark demanded suddenly quinn looked like she was about to explode but botharijesek cut in ill take him down quinnie i want to check on my passengers too well as long as you escort him back to his cabin when youre done and put a guard on his door we cant have him wandering around the ship will do botharijesek chivvied him out quickly before quinn decided to have him bound and gagged as well the clones had been housed in three hastilycleared freight storage chambers aboard the peregrine two assigned to the boys and one to the girls mark ducked through a door behind botharijesek into one of the boys chambers and looked around three rows of bedrolls which must have been podded over from the ariel filled the floor space a selfcontained field latrine was strapped into one corner and a field shower hastily connected in the other to keep any need for the clones to move about the ship to a minimum half jail half refugee camp crowdedas he walked down a row between bedrolls the boys glowered up at him with the hollow faces of prisoners i freed you all dammit dont you know i freed you it had been a rough rescue true during that hideous night of siege the dendarii had been liberal with the most dire threats to keep their charges under control some clones now slept exhausted the stunned ones were waking up sick and disoriented a female dendarii medic moved among them administering synergine and soothing words things were under control suppressed silent not jubilant not grateful if they believed our threats why dont they believe our promises even the active boys who had cooperated enthusiastically in the excitement of siege and firefight now stared at him with renewed doubt the blond boy was one of them mark stopped by his bedroll and hunkered down botharijesek waited watching them all this mark waved vaguely at the chamber is temporary you know its going to get better later were going to get you out of here the boy propped on his elbow shrank slightly away he chewed on his lip which one are you he asked suspiciously the live one he thought of answering but did not dare in front of botharijesek she might mistake it for flippancy it doesnt matter were going to get you out of here just the same truth or not he had no control over the dendarii now still less over the barrayarans if indeed as quinn threatened that was their new destination dreary depression washed over him as he stood and followed botharijesek into the girls chamber across the corridor the physical setup was identical with bedrolls and sanitary facilities though with only fifteen girls it was slightly less crowded a dendarii was passing out a stack of packaged meals which lent the chamber a moment of positive activity and interest the trooper was sergeant taura unmistakable even from the back and dressed in clean grey shipknits and frictionslippers she sat crosslegged to reduce her intimidating height the girls overcoming fear crept up to her and even touched her with apparent fascination of all the dendarii taura had never even in the most frantic moments addressed the clones with anything but politelyworded requests she now had all the air of a fairytale heroine trying to make pets of wild animals and succeeding as mark came up two of the clone girls actually skittered around behind the seated sergeant to peek at him over the protection of her broad shoulders taura frowned at him and looked at botharijesek who returned a short nod its all right hes with me ssurprised to see you here sergeant mark managed i volunteered to babysit rumbled taura i didnt want anybody bothering them is that likely to be a problem fifteen beautiful virgins well maybe sixteen counting yourself came a tiny jeer from the back of his brain not now said botharijesek firmly good he said faintly he waffled up the row of mats for a moment it was all as comfortable and secure as possible under the circumstances he supposed he found the short platinum blonde clone asleep on her side the soft masses of her body sculpture spilling out of her pink tunic embarrassed by his own arrested eye he knelt and drew her cover up to her chin his hand halfunwilled stole a touch of her fine hair in passing guiltily he glanced up at taura has she had a dose of synergine yes were letting her sleep it off she should feel all right when she wakes up he took one of the sealed meal trays and set it down by the blondes head for when she did wake her breathing was slow and steady there seemed not much else he could do for her he looked up to catch the eurasian girl watching him with knowing malicious eyes and he turned hastily away botharijesek completed her inspection and exited and he followed in her trail she paused to speak with the stunnerarmed guard in the corridor wide dispersal she was saying shoot first and ask questions later theyre all young and healthy you dont have to worry about hidden heart conditions with this lot i dont think but i doubt theyll give you much trouble with one exception mark put in theres this darkhaired girl slim very strikingshe appears to have undergone some special mental conditioning not quite sane watch out for her yes sir said the trooper automatically then caught himself glancing at botharijesek uh sergeant taura confirms the report on that one said botharijesek anyway i dont want any of them loose on my ship theyre totally untrained their ignorance could be as dangerous as any hostility this is not an ornamental guard post stay awake they exchanged parting salutes the trooper overcoming reflex managed not to include mark in his directed courtesy mark trotted after botharijeseks long stride so she said after a moment does our treatment of your clones meet with your approval he could not quite tell if her tone was ironic its as good as anyone could do for them for now he bit his tongue but the too selfrevealing outburst escaped it anyway dammit its not fair botharijeseks brows rose as she paced along the corridor whats not fair i saved these kidsor we did you didand they act like were some kind of villains kidnappers monsters theyre not happy at all perhaps it will have to be enough for you just to have saved them to demand that they be happy about it too may exceed your mandate little hero her tone was unmistakably ironic now though oddly devoid of scorn youd think thered be a little gratitude belief acknowledgement something trust she said in a quiet voice yes trust at least from some of them cant any of them tell were on the level theyve been rather traumatized i wouldnt expect too much if i were you till they get a chance to see more evidence she paused in speech and stride and swung to face him but if you ever figure it outfigure out how to make an ignorant traumatized paranoid stupid kid trust youtell miles he urgently wants to know mark stood nonplussed was that directed to me he demanded drymouthed she glanced over his head around the empty corridor and smiled i bitter maddening smile youre home she nodded pointedly toward his cabin door stay there he slept at last for a long time though when quinn came to wake him it seemed like not long enough mark wasnt sure if quinn had slept at all though she had finally cleaned up and changed back into her officers undress greys hed been starting to imagine her planning to wear the bloodstained fatigues till they retrieved the cryochamber as some sort of vow even without the fatigues she radiated an unsettling edginess redeyed and strained come on she growled i need you to talk to fell again hes been giving me a runaround im starting to wonder if he could be in collusion with bharaputra i dont understand it doesnt add up she hauled him off to the tac room again though this time she did not rely on the earbug but stood aggressively at his elbow to the outside eye shed ranged herself as bodyguard and chief assistant all mark could think of was how conveniently placed she was to grab him by the hair and slit his throat captain botharijesek sat in occupying a spare station chair as before watching quietly she eyed quinns frazzled demeanor with a look of concern but said nothing when fells face appeared above the vid plate again its pinkness was decidedly more irate than jolly admiral naismith i told captain quinn that when i had firm information would contact you baron captain quinn serves me please forgive any importunity on her part she only ah faithfully reflects my own anxieties miless typical overflowing vocabulary filled his mouth like flour quinns fingers bit into his shoulder silent painful warning that he had better not let his invention carry him too far what shall we say lessthanfirm information can you give us fell settled back frowning but placated to put it bluntly the bharaputrans say they cannot find your cryochamber it has to be there hissed quinn now now quinnie mark patted her hand it clamped like a vise her nostrils flared murderously but she achieved a faint false smile for the holovid mark turned back to fell baronin your best judgmentare the bharaputrans lying i dont think so do you have some independent corroboration for your opinion agents on site or anything of the sort the barons lips twisted really admiral i cannot say naturally not he rubbed his face a naismiththoughtful gesture can you say anything specific about what the bharaputrans are doing they are in fact turning their medical complex inside out right now all the employees and all the security forces they brought in to contain your raid have been engaged in the search could it be an elaborate charade to mislead us the baron paused no he said flatly at last theyre really scrambling on all levels are you aware he took a decisive breath of what your kidnapping of baron bharaputra if it should prove more than a brief interlude could do to the balance of power among the great houses of jacksons whole no what the barons chin went up and he checked mark sharply for signs of sarcasm the vertical lines between his eyes deepened but he answered seriously you should realize the value of your hostage may go down with time no powervacuum at the top of a great house or even a house minor can last long there are always factions of younger men waiting perhaps in secret to rush in and fill it even supposing lotus manages to get vasa luigis chief loyalist lieutenant to fill and retain his placeas time goes on it can only dawn on him that the return of his master will involve demotion as well as reward think of a great house as the hydra of mythology chop off its head and seven more arise on the stump of neckand begin biting each other eventually only one will survive in the meantime the house is weakened and all its old alliances and deals are thrown into doubt the turmoil expands in a widening ring to associate houses such abrupt changes are not welcomed here not by anyone least of all by baron fell himself mark gathered except maybe by your younger colleagues mark suggested a wave of fells hand dismissed the concerns of his younger colleagues if they wanted power the wave implied let them plot and scramble and kill for it as he had well i have no desire to keep baron bharaputra till he grows old and moldy said mark i have no personal use for him at all out of this context please urge house bharaputra to speed in finding my brother eh they need no urging fell regarded him coldly be aware admiral if this situation is not brought to a satisfactory conclusion quickly fell station will not be able to harbor you uh define quickly very soon within another daycycle fell station surely had enough force to evict the two small dendarii ships whenever it willed or worse than evict understood uh what about unimpeded passage out at jumppoint five if things did not go well that you may have to deal for separately deal how if you still had your hostage i would not desire that you carry vasa luigi out of jacksonian local space and i am positioned to see that you do not quinns fist slammed down beside the vid plate no she cried no way baron bharaputra is the only card we have to get my get the cryochamber back we will not give him up fell recoiled slightly captain he reproved we will take him with us if were forced out quinn threatened and you can all hang out to dry or he can walk back from jumppoint five without a pressure suit if we dont get that cryochamberwell we have better allies than you and with fewer inhibitions they wont care about your profits or your deals or your balances the only question theyll be asking is whether to start at the north pole and burn down or at the south pole and burn up fell grimaced angrily dont be absurd captain quinn you speak of a planetary force quinn leaned into the vid pickup and snarled baron i speak of a multiplanetary force botharijesek startled made an urgent throatslicing gesture across her neck cut it quinn fells eyes went hard and bright as glass glints youre bluffing he said at last i am not youd best believe i am not no one would do all that for one man still less for one corpse quinn hesitated marks hand closed on hers upon his shoulder and squeezed hard to say control yourself dammit she was on the verge of giving away what shed practically threatened him with death not to reveal you may be right baron she said finally youd better pray youre right after a long moment of silence fell inquired mildly and just who is this uninhibited ally of yours admiral after an equally long pause mark looked up and said sweetly captain quinn was bluffing baron fells lips drew back on an extremely dry smile all betans are liars he said softly his hand moved to cut the comm his image faded in the usual haze of sparkles this time it was his cold smile that seemed to linger bodiless good job quinn mark snarled into the silence youve just let baron fell know how much he could really get for that cryochamber and maybe even who from now we have two enemies quinn was breathing hard as though shed been running hes not our enemy hes not our friend fell serves fell remember that cause he will but was fell lying or was he merely passing on house bharaputras lies botharijesek asked slowly what independent line of profit could fell possibly have on all this or are they both lying said quinn what if neither of them are asked mark in irritation have you thought of that remember what norwood a comm beeper interrupted him quinn leaned on her hands on the comconsole to listen quinn this is bel that contact i found agrees to meet us at the ariels docking bay if you want to be in on the interrogation you need to pod over now yes right ill be there quinn out she turned haggard and started for the door elena see that he a jerk of her thumb is confined to quarters yeah well after you talk with whatever bel dragged in get yourself some rest huh quinnie youre unstrung you almost lost it back there quinns ambiguous parting wave acknowledged the truth of this without making any promises as quinn exited botharijesek turned to her station console to order up a personnel pod to be ready for quinn by the time she arrived at the hatch mark rose and wandered around the tactics room his hands thrust carefully into his pockets a dozen realtime and holoschematic display consoles sat dark and still communication and encoding systems lay silent he pictured the tactics nerve center fully staffed alive and bright and chaotic heading into battle he imagined enemy fire peeling the ship open like a meal tray all that life smashed and burned and spilled into the hard radiation and vacuum of space fire from house fells station at jumppoint five say as the peregrine fought for escape he shuddered nauseated he paused before the sealed door to the briefing chamber botharijesek was now engaged in some other communication some decision having to do with the security of their fell station moorings curious he laid his palm upon the lockpad somewhat to his surprise the door slid demurely open somebody had some reprogramming to do if all topsecured dendarii facilities were keyed to admit a dead mans palm print a lot of reprogrammingmiles doubtless had it fixed so he could just waft right through anywhere in the fleet that would be his style botharijesek glanced up but said nothing taking that as tacit permission mark walked into the briefing room and circled the table lights came up for him as he paced thornes words spoken here echoed in his head norwood said the admiral will get out of here even if we dont how carefully had the dendarii examined their recordings of the drop mission surely someone had been over them all several times by now what could he possibly see that they hadnt they knew their people their equipment but i know the medical complex i know jacksons whole he wondered how far his palm would take him he slipped into quinns station chair sure enough files bloomed for him opened at his touch as no woman ever had he found the downloaded records of the drop mission norwoods data was lost but tonkin had been with him part of the time what had tonkin seen not colored lines on the map but realtime realeye realear was there such a record the command helmet had kept such he knew if trooperhelmets did too thenah ha tonkins visuals and audio came up on the console before his fascinated eyes trying to follow them gave him an almost instant headache this was no ballasted and gimballed vid pickup no steady pan but rather the jerky snatching glances of real head movements he slowed the replay to watch himself in the lifttube foyer a short agitated fellow in grey camouflage glittering eyes in a set face do i really look like that the deformities of his body were not so apparent as hed imagined under the loose uniform he sat behind tonkins eyes and walked with him through the hurried maze of bharaputras buildings tunnels and corridors all the way to the last firefight at the end thorne had quoted norwood correctly it was right there on the vid though hed been wrong on the time norwood was gone eleven minutes by the helmets unsubjective clock norwoods flushed face reappeared panting the urgent laugh soundedand moments later the grenadestrike the explosionalmost ducking mark hastily shut off the vid and glanced down at himself as if halfexpecting to be branded with another mortal splattering of blood and brains if theres any clue it has to be earlier he started the program again from the parting in the foyer the third time through he slowed it down and took it step by step examining each the patient finicky selfforgetful absorption was almost pleasurable tiny detailsyou could lose yourself in tiny details an anesthetic for brainpain got you he whispered it had flashed past so fast as to be subliminal if you were running the vid in realtime the briefest glimpse of a sign on the wall an arrow on a crosscorridor labeled shipping and receiving he looked up to find botharijesek watching him how long had she been sitting there she slumped relaxed long legs crossed at booted ankles long fingers tented together what have you got she asked quietly he called up the holomap of the ghostly buildings with norwood and tonkins line of march glowing inside not here he pointed but there he marked a complex well offsides from the route the dendarii had traveled with the cryochamber thats where norwood went through that tunnel im sure of it ive seen that facilitybeen all over that building hell i used to play hide and seek in it with my friends till the babysitters made us stop i can see it in my head as surely as if i had norwoods helmet vid playing right here on the table he took that cryochamber down to shipping and receiving and he shipped it botharijesek sat up is that possible he had so little time not just possible easy the packing equipment is fully automated all he had to do was put the cryochamber in the casing machine and hit the keypad the robots would even have delivered it to the loading dock its a busy placereceives supplies for the whole complex ships everything from data disks to frozen body parts for transplants to genetically engineered fetuses to emergency equipment for search and rescue teams such as reconditioned cryochambers all sorts of stuff it operates around the clock and it would have had to be evacuated in a hurry when our raid hit while the packing equipment was running norwood could have been generating the shipping label on the computer slapped em together gave it to the transport robotand then if he was as smart as i think erased the file record then he ran like hell back to tonkin so the cryochamber is sitting packed on a loading dock downside waitll i tell quinn i suppose wed better tell the bharaputrans where to look i he held up a restraining hand i think she looked at him and sank back into the station chair eyes narrowing think what its been almost a full day since we lifted its been a halfday and more since we told the bharaputrans to look for the cryochamber if that cryochamber was still sitting on a loading dock i think the bharaputrans would have found it by now the automated shipping system is efficient i think the cryochamber already went out maybe within the first hour i think the bharaputrans and fell are telling the truth they must be going insane right now not only is there no cryochamber down there they havent got a clue in hell where it went botharijesek sat stiff do we she asked my god if youre rightit could be on its way anywhere freighted out from any of two dozen orbital transfer stationsit could have been jumped by now simon illyan is going to have a stroke when we report this no not anywhere mark corrected intently it could only have been addressed to somewhere that medic norwood knew someplace he could remember even when he was surrounded and cut off and under fire she licked her lips considering this right she said at last almost anywhere but at least we can start guessing by studying norwoods personnel files she sat back and looked up at him with grave eyes you know you do all right alone in a quiet room youre not stupid i didnt see how you could be youre just not the fieldofficer type im not any kind of officertype i hate the military miles loves field work hes addicted to adrenalin rushes i hate them i hate being afraid i cant think when im scared i freeze when people shout at me yet you can think how much of the time are you scared most of it he admitted grimly then why do you she hesitated as if choosing her words very cautiously why do you keep trying to be miles im not youre making me play him i didnt mean now i mean generally i dont know what the hell you mean chapter ten twenty hours later the two dendarii ships undocked from fell station and maneuvered to boost toward jumppoint five they were not alone an escort of half a dozen house fell security vessels paced and policed them the fell vessels were dedicated local space warships lacking necklin rods and wormhole jump capacity the power thus saved was shunted into a formidible array of weapons and shielding muscleships the convoy was trailed at a discreet distance by a bharaputran cruiser more yacht than warship prepared to accept the final transfer of baron bharaputra as arranged in space near fells jumppoint five station unfortunately miless cryochamber was not aboard it quinn had come close to a breakdown before accepting the inevitable botharijesek had literally backed her against the wall at their last private conference in the briefing room i wont leave miles quinn howled ill space that bharaputran bastard first look botharijesek hissed quinns jacket bunched in her fist if shed been an animal mark thought her ears would have been flat to her head he huddled in a station chair and tried to make himself small smaller i dont like this any better than you do but the situation has gone way beyond our capacity miles is clearly out of bharaputran hands heading god knows where we need reinforcements not warships but trained intelligence agents a pile of em we need illyan and impsec we need them bad and we need them as fast as possible its time to cut and run the faster we get out of here the faster we can return i will be back quinn swore thatll be between you and simon illyan i promise you hell be just as interested as we are in retrieving that cryochamber illyans just a barrayaran quinn sputtered for a word bureaucrat he cant care the way we do dont bet on that whispered botharijesek in the end botharijesek quinns downward duty to the rest of the dendarii and the logic of the situation had prevailed and so mark found himself dressing in officers greys for what he earnestly prayed would be his last public appearance ever as admiral miles naismith observing the transfer of their hostage onto a house fell shuttle whatever happened to vasa luigi after that would be up to baron fell mark could only hope it would be something unpleasant botharijesek came to escort mark personally from his cabinprison to the shuttle hatch corridor where the fell ship was scheduled to clamp on she looked cool as ever if weary and unlike quinn she limited her critique of the fit of his uniform to a pass of her hand to straighten his collar insignia the pocketed jacket was roomy and came down far enough to cover and so disguise the tight bite of the trouser waistband and the way his flesh was beginning to burgeon over the belt he yanked the jacket down firmly and followed the peregrines captain through her ship why do i have to do this he asked her plaintively its our last chance to provefor certainto vasa luigi that you are miles naismith and that thing in the cryochamber is just a clone just in case the cryochamber didnt go offplanet and just in case by whatever chance wherever it went bharaputra finds it again before we do they arrived at the shuttle hatch corridor at the same time as a couple of heavilyarmed dendarii techs who took up station at the docking clamp controls baron bharaputra appeared shortly thereafter escorted by a wary captain quinn and two edgy dendarii guards the guards mark decided were mainly ornamental the real power and the real threat the heavy pieces on this chessboard were jumppoint station five and the house fell ships that supported it he pictured them arrayed in space around the dendarii ships check was baron bharaputra king mark felt like a pawn masquerading as a knight vasa luigi ignored the guards kept half an eye on quinn the red queen but mostly watched the shuttle hatch quinn saluted mark admiral he returned the salute captain he stood at parade rest as if overseeing his operation was he supposed to bandy words with the baron he waited for vasa luigi to open the conversation the baron merely waited with a disturbingly controlled patience as if he did not even perceive time the same way mark did regardless of how outgunned they were the dendarii were only minutes from escape as soon as the transfer was complete the peregrine and the ariel could jump and the clones would be beyond house bharaputras lethal reach that much he had accomplished assbackwards and screwed up beyond repair but done small victories at last came the clanking of the shuttle hatch clamps grasping and positioning their prey and the hiss of the flextube sealing the dendarii oversaw the dilation of the hatch portal and stood to attention on the other side of the portal a man dressed in house fell green with captains insignia and flanked by two ornamental guards of his own nodded sharply and identified himself and his vessel of origin he spotted mark as the highest ranking officer present and saluted baron fells compliments admiral naismith sir and he is returning to you something you accidentally left behind quinn went pale with hope mark could swear her heart stopped beating the fell captain stepped back from the hatch but through it swung not the ardentlydesired cryochamber on a float pallet but a file of three men and two women civilianclothed looking variously sheepish angry and grim one man was limping and supported by another quinns spies the group of dendarii volunteers she had attempted to slip onto fell station to continue the search quinns face flushed red with chagrin but she raised her chin and said clearly tell baron fell we thank him for his care the fell captain acknowledged the message with a salute and a sour smirk meet you all in debriefing soonest she breathed and dismissed the unhappy mob with a nod they clattered off botharijesek went with them the fell captain announced we are ready to board our passenger punctilliously he did not set foot aboard the peregrine but waited equally punctilliously the dendarii guards and quinn stood away from baron bharaputra who raised his square chin and began to stride forward my lord wait for me the high cry from behind them made marks head snap around the barons eyes too widened in surprise the eurasian girl her hair swinging slipped out of a crosscorridor and ran forward she held hands with the platinum blonde clone she darted like an eel around the dendarii guards who had better sense than to draw weapons in this dicey moment but not quite enough speed of reflex to catch her the smallfooted blonde was not so athletic half outofbalance with her other arm crossed under her breasts and she was pulled along gasping for breath blue eyes wide with fear mark saw her in his minds eye laid out on some operating table lightcrowned scalp peeled carefully backthe whine of a surgical saw cutting through bone the slow teasing apart of living neurons in the brain stem then at last the liftingout of brain like a gift mind memory person an offering to some dark god in the masked monsters gloved hands he tackled her around the knees her fineboned hand jerked out of the darkhaired girls grip and she fell forward on the deck she cried out then just cried and kicked at him rocking and bucking and twisting onto her back terrified he would lose his clutch he worked upward till he lay across her with his full weight she squirmed beneath him ineffectually she didnt even know enough to try to knee him in the groin stop stop for gods sake i dont want to hurt you he mumbled in her ear around a mouthful of sweetsmelling hair the other girl meanwhile had succeeded in diving through the shuttle hatch the house fell guard captain was confused by her arrival but not by the dendarii hed drawn a nerve disrupter instantly repelling the first reflexive lurch of quinns men stop right there baron bharaputra what is this my lord the eurasian girl cried take me with you please i will be united with my lady i will stay on that side the baron advised her calmly they cannot touch you there you try me began quinn starting forward but the baron raised a hand fingers delicately crooked neither fist nor obscenity yet somehow faintly insulting captain quinn surely you do not wish to create an incident and delay your departure do you clearly this girl chooses of her own free will quinn hesitated no screamed mark he scrambled to his feet hauled the blonde girl up and jammed her into the grip of the biggest dendarii guard hold her he wheeled to pass baron bharaputra admiral the baron raised a faintly ironic brow youre wearing a corpse mark snarled dont talk to me he staggered forward hands out to face the darkhaired girl across that little dreadful politically significant gap girl he did not know her name he did not know what to say dont go you dont have to go theyll kill you growing more certain of her security though still positioned behind the fell captain and well out of reach of any dendarii lunge she smiled triumphantly at mark and tossed back her hair her eyes were alight ive saved my honor all by myself my honor is my lady you have no honor pig my life is an offering greater than you can imagine being i am a flower on her altar you are frigging crazy flowerpot quinn opined bluntly her chin rose and her lips thinned baron come she ordered coolly she held out a theatric hand baron bharaputra shrugged as if to say what would you and walked toward the hatch no dendarii raised a weapon quinn had not ordered them to mark had no weapon he turned to her anguished quinn she was breathing hard if we dont jump now we could lose it all stand still vasa luigi paused in the hatchway hand on the seal one foot still on the peregrines deck and turned back to face mark in case you are wondering admiralshe is my wifes clone he purred he raised his right hand licked his index finger and touched it to marks forehead it left a cool spot counting coup one for me fortynine for you if you ever dare to return here i promise you ill even up that score in ways that will make your death something youll beg for he slipped the rest of the way through the shuttle hatch hello captain thank you for your patience the hatch seals closed on the rest of his greeting to his rivals or allys guards the silence was broken only by the releasing clank of the clamps and the blonde clones hopeless abandoned weeping the spot on marks forehead itched like ice he rubbed at it with the back of his hand as if halfexpecting it to shatter frictionslippered footsteps were nearly silent but these were heavy enough to vibrate the deck sergeant taura pelted into the shuttle hatch corridor she saw the blonde clone and yelled over her shoulder heres another one just two to go another trooper came panting in her wake what happened taura sighed quinn that girl that ringleader the really smart one said taura skidding to a halt her eyes checked the crosscorridors as she spoke she told all the girls some bullshit story about how we were a slave ship she persuaded ten of them to try for a breakout at once stunner guard got three the other seven scattered weve recaptured four mostly just hiding but i think that longhaired girl actually had a coherent plan to try to get to the personnel pods before we jumped from local space ive put a guard on them to cut her off quinn swore bleakly good thinking sergeant your cutoff must have succeeded because she came up here unfortunately she ran smack into baron bharaputras exchange she got out with him we were able to grab the other one before she made it across quinn nodded at the blonde whose weeping had choked down to snivels so youre only looking for one more how did the sergeants eyes flicked over the shuttle hatch corridor puzzled how did you let that happen maam quinns face was set in an expressionless mask i chose not to start a firefight over her the sergeants big clawed hands twitched in bewilderment but no verbal criticism of her superior escaped those outslung lips wed better find the last one then before something worse happens carry on sergeant you four help her quinn gestured to her nowunemployed guards report to me in the briefing room when you have them all resecured taura taura nodded motioned the troopers down the various crosscorridors and herself loped toward the nearest lift tube her nostrils flared she seemed to be almost sniffing for her quarry quinn turned on her heel muttering ive got to get to the debriefing find out what happened to ill take her back to the clone quarters quinn mark volunteered with a nod at the blonde quinn looked doubtfully at him please i want to she glanced at the hatch where the eurasian girl had gone and back at his face he didnt know what his face looked like but she inhaled you know ive been over the drop records a couple of times since we left fell station i hadnt had a chance to tell you did you realize when you stepped in front of me when we were scrambling to board kimuras drop shuttle just what your plasma mirror field power was down to no i mean i knew id taken a lot of hits in the tunnels one hit if it had absorbed one more hit it would have failed two more hits and youd have fried oh she frowned at him as if still trying to decide whether to credit him with courage or simply with stupidity well i thought it was interesting something youd want to know she hesitated longer my power pack was down to zero so if youre really comparing scores with baron bharaputra you can raise yours back to fifty he didnt know what she expected him to say at last quinn sighed all right you can escort her if itll make you feel better she strode off toward the debriefing her own face very anxious he turned and took the blonde by the arm very gently she flinched blinking through big tearsheened blue eyes even though he knew very wellnone betterhow intentionally her features and body were sculptured and designed the effect was still overwhelming beauty and innocence sexuality and fear mixed in an intoxicating draught she looked a ripe twenty at fresh physical peak a perfect match to his own age and only a few centimeters taller than himself she might have been designed to be the heroine in his drama except that his life had dissolved into some subheroic puddle chaotic and beyond control no rewards only more punishments whats your name he asked with false brightness she looked at him suspiciously maree clones had no surnames thats pretty come on maree ill take you back to your uh dormitory youll feel better when youre back with your friends she perforce began to walk with him sergeant taura is all right you know she really wants to take care of you you just scared her running off like that she was worried youd get hurt youre not really afraid of the sergeant are you her lovely lips pressed closed in confusion im not sure her walk was a dainty swaying thing though her steps made her breasts wobble most distractingly halfbagged in the pink tunic she ought to be offered reduction treatment though he was not sure such was in the peregrines ships surgeons range of expertise and if her somatic experiences at bharaputras were anything like his had been she was probably sick of surgery right now he certainly had been after all the bodily distortions theyd laid on him were not a slave ship he began again earnestly were taking you the news that their destination was the barrayaran empire might not be so reassuring at that our first stop will probably be komarr but you might not have to stay there he had no power to make promises about her ultimate destination none one prisoner could not rescue another she coughed and rubbed her eyes are you all right i want a drink of water her voice was hoarse from the running and the crying ill get you one he promised his own cabin was just a corridor away he led her there the door hissed open at the touch of his palm upon the pad come in i never had a chance to talk with you maybe if i had that girl wouldnt have fooled you he guided her within and settled her on the bed she was trembling slightly so was he did she fool you i dont know admiral he snorted bitterly im not the admiral im a clone like you i was raised at bharaputras one floor down from where you live lived he went to his washroom drew a cup of water and carried it to her he had half an impulse to offer it to her on his knees she had to be made toi have to make you understand understand who you are whats happened to you so you wont he fooled again you have a lot to learn for your own protection indeedin that body youll have to go to school she swallowed water dont want to go to school she said muffled into the cup didnt the bharaputrans ever let you into the virtual learning programs when i was there it was the best part better even than the games though i liked the games of course did you play zylec she nodded that was fun but the history the astrography showsthe virtual instructor was the funniest program a whitehaired old geezer in twentiethcentury clothes this jacket with patches on the elbowsi always wondered if he was based on a real person or was a composite i never saw them what did you do all day we talked among ourselves we did our hair swam the proctors made us do calesthenics every day us too till they did this to me she touched a breast then they only made me swim he could see the logic of that your last bodysculpture was pretty recent i take it about a month ago she paused you really dont think my mother was coming for me im sorry you dont have a mother neither do i what was coming for you was a horror almost beyond imagining except he could imagine it all too vividly she frowned at him obviously reluctant to part with her beloved dreamfuture were all beautiful if youre really a clone why arent you im glad to see youre beginning to think he said carefully my body was sculpted to match my progenitors he was crippled but if its trueabout the brain transplantswhy not you i was part of another plot my purchasers took me away whole it was only later that i learned all the truth for sure about bharaputras he sat beside her on the bed the smell of herhad they genetically engineered some subtle perfume into her skin it was intoxicating the memory of her soft body squirming under his on the hatch corridor deck perturbed him he could have dissolved into it i had friendsdont you she nodded mutely by the time i could do anything for themlong before i could do anything for themthey were gone all killed so i rescued you instead she stared doubtfully at him he could not tell what she was thinking the cabin wavered and a flash of nausea that had nothing to do with suppressed eroticism twisted his stomach what was that maree gasped her eyes widening unconsciously she grasped his hand his hand burned at her touch its all right its more than all right that was your first wormhole jump from his vantage of well several wormhole jumps he made his tone heartily reassuring were away the jacksonians cant get us now much better than die doublecross hed been halfanticipating in some reserved part of his mind from baron fells forces the moment he had vasa luigi hostage in his own fat hands not the roar and rock of enemy fire just a nice little tame jump youre safe were all safe now he thought of the mad eurasian girl almost all he so wanted maree to believe the dendarii the barrayarans hed scarcely expected them to understand but this girlif only he could shine in her eyes he wanted no reward but a kiss he swallowed you sure its only a kiss you want there was an uncomfortable hot knot growing in his belly beneath that ghastly constricted waistband an embarrassing stiffening in his loins maybe she wouldnt notice understand judge will you lass me he asked humbly very drymouthed he took the cup from her and tossed back the last trickle of water it was not enough to unlock the tension in his throat why she asked brow wrinkling for pretend that was an appeal she understood she blinked but willingly enough leaned forward and touched her lips to his her tunic shifted oh he breathed his hand went round her neck and stopped its retreat please again he drew her face to his she neither resisted nor responded but her mouth was amazing nonetheless i want i want it couldnt hurt to touch her just to touch her her hands went around his neck automatically he could feel each cool finger tipped by a tiny bite of nail her lips parted he melted his head was pounding hot he shrugged off his jacket stop stop now dammit but she should have been his heroine miles had a damned harem full of them he was certain might she let him do more than kiss her not penetration definitely not nothing to hurt her nothing invasive a rub between those vast breasts could not hurt her though it would doubtless bewilder her he might bury himself in that soft flesh and find release as effectively more effectively than between her thighs she might think he was crazy but it wouldnt hurt her his mouth sought hers again hungrily he touched her skin more he slipped her tunic down off her shoulders freeing her body to his starving hand her skin was velvet soft his other hand shaking dove to release the stranglingtight waistband of his trousers that was a relief he was dreadfully excruciatingly aroused but he would not touch her below the waist no he rolled her backwards on the bed pinning her kissing frantically down her body she emitted a startled gasp his breath deepened then suddenly stopped a spasm reached deep into his lungs as if all his bronchia had constricted at once with a snap like a trap closing no not again it was happening again just like the time hed tried last year he rolled off her icy sweat breaking out all over his body he fought his locked throat he managed one asthmatic shuddering indrawn breath the flashbacks of memory were almost hallucinatory in their clarity galens angry shouting lars and mok pinning him at galens command pulling off his clothes as if the beating hed just taken at their hands was not punishment enough theyd sent the girl away before theyd started shed run like a rabbit he spat saltandiron blood the shockstick pointing touching there there pop and crackle galen going even more redfaced accusing him of treason worse raving on about aral vorkosigans alleged sexual proclivities turning up the power far too high flip him knotting terror deep in his gut the visceral memory of pain humiliation burning and cramps a weird shortcircuited arousal and horribly shameful release despite it all the stink of searing flesh he pushed back the visions and almost passed out before he managed to inhale and exhale one more time somehow he was sitting not on the bed but on the floor beside it arms and legs spasmodically drawn up the astonished blonde girl crouched halfnaked on the rumpled mattress staring down at him whats the matter with you why did you stop are you dying no just wishing i were it wasnt fair he knew exactly where this conditioned reflex came from it wasnt a memory buried in his subconscious mores the pity nor from some distant blurred childhood it was barely four years ago wasnt that sort of clear insight supposed to free one from such demons of the past was he going to go into selfinduced spasms every time he tried to have sex with a real girl or was it just the extreme tension of the occasion if ever the situation was less tense less consciencethwarted if ever he really had time to make love instead of a hasty sweaty scramble then maybe he might overcome memory and madness or maybe i wont he fought for another shuddering inhalation another his lungs began to work again was he really in danger of choking to death presumably once he actually passed out his autonomic nervous system would take over again his cabin door slid open taura and botharijesek stood silhouetted in the aperture peering into the dimness what they saw made botharijesek swear and sergeant taura shoulder forward now he wanted to pass out now but his singleminded demon did not cooperate he continued to breathe curled up with his trousers around his knees what are you doing sergeant taura growled a dangerous truly wolflike timbre her fangs gleamed at the corners of her mouth in the soft light hed seen her tear mens throats out with one hand the little clone sat up on her knees on the bed looking terribly worried her hands as usual trying to cover and support her most notable features as usual only drawing more attention to them i only asked for a drink of water she whimpered im sorry sergeant taura hastily dropped her eightfoot height to one knee and turned out her palms to indicate to the girl that she wasnt angry with her mark wasnt sure if maree caught that subtlety then what happened botharijesek asked sternly he made me kiss him botharijeseks eye raked his huddled disarray and glinted furiously she was stiff and tense as a drawn bow she wheeled to face him her voice went very low did you just try to rape her no i dont know i only sergeant taura rose grasped him by the shirt and some skin pulled him to his feet and beyond and pinned him against the nearest wall the floor was a meter beyond his stretching toes answer straight damn you the sergeant snarled he closed his eyes and took a deep breath not for any threat from miless women no not for them but for the second half of galens humiliation of him in its own way a more excruciating rape than the first when lars and mok alarmed had finally persuaded galen to stop mark had been in shock so deep as to be skirting cardiac arrest galen had been forced to take his valuable clone to his pet physician in the middle of the night the one hed somehow strongarmed into supplying him with the drugs and hormones to keep marks body growth on track matching miless galen had explained the burns by telling the physician that mark had been secretly masturbating with the shockstick accidentally powered it up and been unable to turn it off for the muscle spasms it caused till his screams brought help the doctor had actually barked a shocked laugh thinvoiced mark had concurred too afraid to gainsay galen even when he was alone with the physician yet the doctor saw his bruises must have known there was more to the story but said nothing did nothing it was his own weak concurrence that he regretted most in hindsight the black laugh that burned the deepest he could not would not let maree exit bearing any such burden of proof in short blunt phrases he described exactly what he had just tried to do it all came out sounding terribly ugly though it had been her beauty that had overwhelmed him he kept his eyes shut he did not mention his panic attack or try to explain galen he writhed inside but spoke flat truth slowly as he spoke the wall bumped up his spine till his feet were on the deck again the pressure on his shirt released and he dared to open his eyes he almost closed them again scorched by the open contempt in botharijeseks face hed done it now she who had been almost sympathetic almost kind almost his only friend here stood rigidly enraged and he knew he had alienated the one person who might have spoken for him it hurt a killing hurt to have so little and then lose it when taura reported she was one clone short botharijesek bit out quinn said youd insisted on taking her now we know why no i didnt intend anything she really only wanted a drink of water he pointed to the cup lying on its side on the deck taura turned her back on him and knelt on one knee by the bed and addressed the blonde in a deliberately gentle voice are you hurt im all right she quavered she pulled her tunic back up over her shoulders with a shrug but that man was real sick she stared at him in puzzled concern obviously muttered botharijesek her chin went up and her eyes nailed mark still clinging to the wall youre confined to quarters mister im putting the guard back on your door dont even try to come out i wont i wont they marched maree away the door seals hissed closed like a falling guillotine blade he rolled onto his narrow bed shaking two weeks to komarr he very seriously wished he were dead chapter eleven mark spent the first three days of his solitary confinement lying in a depressed huddle he had meant his heroic mission to save lives not destroy them he added up the body count one by one the shuttle pilot phillipi norwood kimuras trooper and the eight seriously wounded all those people hadnt had names back when he had first been planning this and all the anonymous bharaputrans too the average jacksonian security guard was just a joe scrambling for a living he wondered bleakly if any of the dead bharaputrans were people he had once met or joked with when hed lived in the clone creche as ever the little people were ground up like meat while those with enough power to really be held responsible escaped walking out free like baron bharaputra did the lives of fortynine clones outweigh four dead dendarii the dendarii did not seem to think so those people were not volunteers you tricked them to their deaths he was shaken by an unwelcome insight lives did not add as integers they added as infinities i didnt mean it to come out this way and the clones the blonde girl he of all men knew she was not the mature woman her general physique and particular augmentations so stunningly advertised her as being the sixtyyearold brain which had been planning to move in doubtless would have known how to handle such a body but mark had seen her so clearly in his mind that tenyearold on the inside he hadnt wanted to hurt or frighten her yet hed managed to do both hed wanted to please her make her face light the way they all lit up for miles the internal voice mocked none of the clones could possibly respond as he so ached to have them do he must let that fantasy go ten years from now twenty years from now they might thank him for their lives or not did all could im sorry somewhere around the second day he became obsessed with the thought of himself as braintransplant bait for miles oddly enough or perhaps logically enough he did not fear it from miles but miles was hardly in a position to veto the plan what if it occurred to someone that it would be easier to transplant miless brain into marks warm and living body than to attempt the tedious repair of that gaping mortal chest wound and all the cryotrauma on top of it it was so frightening a possibility that he halfwanted to volunteer just to get it over with the only thing that kept him from total gibbering breakdown was the reflection that with the cryochamber lost the threat was moot until it was found again in the dark of his cabin his head buried in his pillow it came to him that the face hed most desired to see transformed with respect for him by his daring clonerescue was miless youve rather eliminated that possibility havent you the only surcease from his mental treadmill came with food and sleep forcing down an entire fieldration tray left him bloodstunned enough to actually doze in inadequate snatches desiring unconsciousness above all things he cajoled the glowering dendarii who shoved the trays through his door three times a day to bring him extras since the dendarii apparently did not regard their disposablecontainer field rations as treats they were willing enough to do so another dendarii brought and shoved through the door a selection of miless clean clothing from the stores on the ariel this time all the insignia were carefully removed on the third day he gave up even attempting to fasten naismiths uniform trousers and switched to loose ship knits at this point the inspiration struck him they cant make me play miles if i dont look like miles after that things grew a little foggy in his head one of the dendarii became so irritated by his repeated requests for extra rations that he lugged in a whole case dumped it in a corner and told mark roughly not to pester him again mark was left alone with his selfrescue and cunning calculation he had heard of prisoners tunneling out of their cells with a spoon might not he still loony as it was and on some level he knew that it was it gave his life a focus from too much time endless hours on the multijump boost through to komarr suddenly there seemed to be not enough he read the nutrition labels if he maintained maximum inactivity a single tray provided all the daily fuel he required everything he consumed after that must be converted directly into notmiles every four trays ought to produce a kilo of extra body mass if he had the numbers right too bad they were all the same menu there were scarcely enough days to make the project work still on his body any extra kilos had no place to hide toward the end panicked at the thought of time running out he ate continuously till the sheer gasping pain forced him to stop thus combining pleasure rebellion and punishment into one weirdly satisfying experience quinn entered without knocking flipping up the lights with brutal efficiency from pitchdark to full illumination agh mark recoiled and held his hands over his eyes ripped from his uncomfortable doze he rolled over in bed he blinked at the chrono on the wall quinn had come for him a half daycycle earlier than hed expected the dendarii ships must have been putting on maximum accelerations if this meant they were about to arrive in komarr orbit oh help get up said quinn she wrinkled her nose get washed put on this uniform she laid something forestgreen with gold gleams across the foot of the bed from her general air hed have expected her to fling things from the reverent care she bestowed mark deduced the uniform must be one of miless ill get up said mark and ill get washed but i wont put on the uniform or any uniform youll do as youre told mister thats a barrayaran officers uniform it represents real power and they guard it accordingly they hang people who wear fake uniforms he tossed off the covers and sat up he was a little dizzy my gods said quinn in a choked voice what have you done to yourself i suppose he allowed you can still try to stuff me into the uniform but you might want to consider the effect he staggered to the washroom while washing and depiliating he inventoried the results of his escape attempt there just hadnt been enough time true hed regained the kilos hed had to lose to play admiral naismith at escobar plus maybe a slight bonus and in a mere fourteen days instead of the year it had taken them to creep on in the first place a hint of a double chin his torso was notably thickened though his abdomenhe moved carefullyachingly distended not enough not enough to be safe yet quinn being quinn she had to convince herself and she tried the barrayaran uniform on him anyway he made sure to slump the effect was very unmilitary she gave up snarling and let him dress himself he chose clean shipknit pants soft frictionslippers and a loose barrayaran civilianstyle tunic of miless with big sleeves and an embroidered sash it took him a moment of careful consideration to decide whether it would annoy quinn more to see the sash positioned across his rounding belly equatorially or under the bulge like a sling judging from the lemonsucking look on her face under it was and he left it that way she sensed his fey mood enjoying yourself she inquired sarcastically its the last fun ill get today isnt it her hand opened in dry acquiescence where are you taking me for that matter where are we komarr orbit we are about to pod over secretly to one of the barrayaran military space stations there we are going to have a very private meeting with chief of imperial security captain simon illyan he came by fast courier all the way from impsec headquarters on barrayar on the basis of a rather ambiguous coded message i sent him and hes going to be extremely hot to know why ive interrupted his routine hes going to demand to know what the hell was so important and her voice wavered in a sigh im going to have to tell him she led him out of his cabincell through the peregrine she had evidently dismissed his door guard when shed first come in but in fact all the corridors seemed deserted no not deserted cleared they came to a personnel pod hatch and ducked through to find captain botharijesek herself at the controls botharijesek and no one else a very private party indeed botharijeseks usual coolness seemed particularly frigid today when she glanced over her shoulder at him her eyes widened and her dark winged brows drew down in startled disapproval of his pasty bloated appearance hell mark you look like a drowned corpse thats floated to the surface after a week i feel like one thank you he intoned blandly she snorted whether with amusement disgust or derision he was not sure and turned her attention back to the pod control interface hatches sealed clamps retracted and they sped silently away from the side of the peregrine between the zerogee and the accelerations he found his attention centered on his stretched stomach again and he swallowed against the nausea why is the impsec head man only ranked as captain mark inquired to take his mind off his queasiness it cant be for secrecy everybody knows who he is another barrayaran tradition botharijesek said her tone put a slightly bitter spin on the term tradition at least she was speaking to him illyans predecessor in the post the late great captain negri never took a promotion beyond captain that kind of ambition was apparently irrelevant to emperor ezars familiar everybody knew negri spoke with the emperors voice and his orders cut across all ranks illyan was always a little shy of promoting himself over the rank of his former boss i guess hes paid a viceadmirals salary though whatever poor sucker heads impsec next after illyan retires is probably going to be stuck with the rank of captain forever they approached a midsized high orbital space station mark finally glimpsed komarr turning far below shrunken by the distance to a halfmoon botharijesek kept strictly to the flight path assigned to her by an extremely laconic station traffic control after a nervous pause while they exchanged codes and countersigns they locked onto a docking hatch they were met by two silent expressionless armed guards very neat and trim in barrayaran green who ushered them through the station and into a small windowless chamber set up as an office with a comconsole desk three chairs and no other decoration thank you leave us said the man behind the desk the guards exited as silently as they had done everything else alone the man seemed to relax slightly he nodded to botharijesek hullo elena its good to see you his light voice had an unexpected warm timbre like an uncle greeting a favorite niece the rest of him seemed exactly as mark had studied in galens vids simon illyan was a slight aging man gray rising in a tide from his temples into his brown hair a rounded face with a snub nose was too etched with faint lines to look quite youthful he wore on this military installation correct officers undress greens and insignia like the ones quinn had tried to foist on mark with the horuseye badge of imperial security winking from his collar mark realized illyan was staring back at him with the most peculiar suffused look on his face my god miles you he began in a strangled voice then his eye lit with comprehension he sat back in his chair ah his mouth twisted up on one side lord mark greetings from your lady mother and i am most pleased to meet you at last he sounded perfectly sincere not for long thought mark hopelessly and lord mark he cant be serious also pleased to know where you are again i take it captain quinn that my departments message about lord marks disappearance from earth finally caught up with you not yet its probably still chasing us from our last stop illyans brows rose so did lord mark come in from the cold on his own or did my erstwhile subordinate send him to me neither sir quinn seemed to have trouble speaking botharijesek wasnt even trying to illyan leaned forward growing more serious though still tinged with a slight irony so what halfcocked insubordinate ithoughtyouwantedmetousemyinitiativesir scam has he sent you to try to con me into paying for this time no scam sir muttered quinn but the bill is going to be huge the coolly amused air faded altogether as he studied her grey face yes he said after a moment quinn leaned on the desk with both hands not for emphasis mark fancied but for support illyan we have a problem miles is dead illyan took this in with a waxen stillness abruptly he turned his chair around mark could see only the back of his head his hair was thin when he turned back the lines had sprung out on his set face like a figureground reversal like scars thats not a problem quinn he whispered thats a disaster he laid his hands down flat very carefully across the smooth black surface of the desk so thats where miles picked up that gesture mark who had studied it thought irrelevantly hes frozen in a cryochamber quinn licked her dry lips illyans eyes closed his mouth moved whether on prayers or curses mark could not tell but he only said mildly you might have said that first the rest would have followed as a logical supposition his eyes opened intent so what happened how bad were his woundsnot a head wound pray god how wellprepped was he i helped do the prep myself under combat conditions i i think it was good you cant know until well he took a very bad chest wound as far as i could tell he was untouched from the neck up illyan breathed carefully youre right captain quinn not a disaster only a problem ill alert the imperial military hospital at vorbarr sultana to expect their star patient we can transfer the cryochamber from your ship to my fast courier immediately was the man babbling just a little with relief uh said quinn no illyan rested his forehead gingerly in his hand as if a headache was starting just behind his eyes finish quinn he said in a tone of muffled dread we lost the cryochamber how could you lose a cryochamber it was a portable she intercepted his burning stare and hurried up her report it was left downside in the scramble to get off each of the combat drop shuttles thought the other one had it it was a miscommunicationi checked i swear it turned out the medic in charge of the cryochamber had been cut off from his shuttle by enemy forces he found himself with access to a commercial shipping facility we think he shipped the cryochamber from there you think i will ask what combat drop mission in a moment where did he ship it thats just it we dont know he was killed before he could report the cryochamber could be on its way literally anywhere by now illyan sat back and rubbed his lips which were set in a thin ghastly smile i see and all this happened when and where two weeks and three days ago on jacksons whole he sent you all to illyrica via vega station how the hell did you end up on jacksons whole quinn stood at parade rest and took it from the top a stiff clipped synopsis of the events of the last four weeks from escobar onward i have a complete report with all our vid records and miless personal log here sir she laid a data cube on his comconsole illyan eyed it like a snake his hand did not move toward it and the fortynine clones still aboard the peregrine sir wed like to offload them my clones what would illyan do with them mark dared not ask miless personal log tends to be a fairly useless document in my experience observed illyan distantly he is quite canny about what to leave out he grew introspective and fell silent for a time then he rose and walked from side to side across the little office the cool facade cracked without warning face contorted he turned and slammed his fist into the wall with bonecrunching force shouting damn the boy for making a fucking farce out of his own funeral he stood with his back to them when he turned again and sat down his face was stiff and blank when he looked up he addressed botharijesek elena its clear im going to have to stay here at komarr for the moment to coordinate the search from impsecs galactic affairs hq i cant afford to put an extra five days of travel time between myself and the action i will of course compose the formal missinginaction report on lieutenant lord vorkosigan and forward it immediately to count and countess vorkosigan i hate to think of it delivered by some subordinate but it will have to be but will you as a personal favor to me escort lord mark to vorbarr sultana and deliver him to their custody no no no mark screamed inside i would rather not go to barrayar sir the prime minister will have questions that only one who was on the spot can answer you are the most ideal courier i can imagine for a matter of such complex delicacy i grant you the task will be painful botharijesek was looking trapped sir im a senior shipmaster im not free to leave the peregrine andfranklyi do not care to escort lord mark ill give you anything you ask in return she hesitated anything he nodded she glanced at mark i gave my word that all the house bharaputra clones would be taken somewhere safe somewhere humane where the jacksonians cant reach will you redeem my word for me illyan chewed his lip impsec can launder their identities readily enough of course no difficulty there appropriate placement might be trickier but yes well take them on take them on what did illyan mean for all their other flaws the barrayarans at least did not practice slavery theyre children mark blurted you have to remember theyre only children its hard to remember he wanted to add but couldnt under botharijeseks cold eyes illyan averted his glance from mark i shall seek countess vorkosigans advice then anything else the peregrine and the ariel must remain for the moment in komarr orbit and communications quarantine my apologies to your troops but theyll have to tough it out youll cover the costs for this mess illyan grimaced alas yes and and look hard for miles oh yes he breathed then ill go her voice was faint her face pale thank you said illyan quietly my fast courier will be at your disposal as quickly as you can make ready to depart his eye fell reluctantly on mark he had been avoiding looking at mark for the whole last half of this interview how many personal guards do you wish he asked botharijesek ill make it clear to them that they are under your command till they see you safe to the count i dont want any but i suppose i have to sleep sometime two botharijesek decided and so he was officially made a prisoner of the barrayaran imperial government mark thought the end of the line botharijesek rose and motioned mark to his feet come on i want to get a few personal items from the peregrine and tell my exec hes got the command and explain to the troops about being confined to quarters thirty minutes good captain quinn please remain yes sir illyan stood to see botharijesek out tell aral and cordelia he began and paused time stretched i will said botharijesek quietly mutely illyan nodded the door seals hissed open for her stride she didnt even look back to see if mark was following he had to break into a run every five steps to keep up his cabin aboard the impsec fast courier proved to be even tinier and more celllike than the one hed occupied aboard the peregrine botharijesek locked him in and left him alone there was not even the time marker and limited human contact of threetimesaday ration delivery the cabin had its own computercontrolled food dispensing system pneumatically connected to some central store he overate compulsively no longer sure why or what it could do for him besides provide a combination of comfort and selfdestruction but death from the complications of obesity took years and he only had five days on the last day his body switched strategies and he became violently ill he managed to keep this fact secret until the trip downside in the personnel shuttle where it was mistaken for zerogravity and motion sickness by a surprisingly sympathetic impsec guard who apparently suffered from some such slight weakness himself the man promptly and cheerfully slapped an antinausea patch from the med kit on the wall onto the side of marks neck the patch also had some sedative power marks heart rate slowed an effect which lasted till they landed and transferred to a sealed groundcar a guard and a driver took the front compartment and mark sat across from botharijesek in the rear compartment for the last leg of his nightmare journey from the military shuttleport outside the capital into the heart of vorbarr sultana the center of the barrayaran empire it wasnt until he found himself having something resembling an asthma attack that botharijesek looked up from her own glum selfabsorption and noticed what the hells the matter with you she leaned forward and took his pulse which was racing he was clammy all over sick he gasped and then at her irritated icouldhavefiguredthatoutformyself look admitted scared he thought hed been as frightened as a human being could be under bharaputran fire but that was as nothing compared to this slow trapped terror this drawnout suffocating helplessness to affect his destiny what do you have to be afraid of she asked scornfully nobodys going to hurt you captain theyre going to kill me who lord aral and lady cordelia hardly if for any reason we fail to get miles back you could be the next count vorkosigan surely youve figured on that at this point he satisfied a longheld curiosity when he passed out his breathing did indeed begin again automatically he blinked away black fog and fended off botharijeseks alarmed attempt to loosen his clothes and check his tongue to be sure he hadnt swallowed it she had pocketed a couple of antinausea patches from the shuttle medkit just in case and she held one uncertainly he motioned urgently for her to apply it it helped who do you think these people are she demanded angrily when his breathing grew less irregular i dont know but theyre sure as hell going to be pissed at me the worst was the knowledge that it need not have been this bad any time before the jacksons whole debacle he could in theory have walked right in and said hello but hed wanted to meet barrayar on his own terms like trying to storm heaven his attempt to make it better had made it infinitely worse she sat back and regarded him with slow bemusement you really are scared to death arent you she said in a tone of revelation that made him want to howl mark lord aral and lady cordelia are going to give you the benefit of every doubt i know they will but you have to do your part what is my part im not sure she admitted thanks youre such a help and then they were there the groundcar swung through a set of gates and into the narrow grounds of a huge stone residence it was the preelectric timeofisolation design that gave it such an air of fabulous age mark decided the architecture hed seen like it in london all dated back well over a millenium though this pile was only a hundred and fifty standard years old vorkosigan house the canopy swung up and he struggled out of the groundcar after botharijesek this time she waited for him she grasped him firmly by the upper arm either worried he would collapse or fearing he would bolt they stepped through a pleasantlyhued sunlight into the cool dimness of a large entry foyer paved in black and white stone and featuring a remarkable wide curving staircase how many times had miles stepped across this threshold botharijesek seemed an agent of some evil fairy which had snatched away the beloved miles and replaced him with this pallid pudgy changeling he choked down an hysterical giggle as the sardonic mocker in the back of his brain called out hi mom and dad im home surely the evil fairy was himself chapter twelve they were met in the entry hall by a pair of liveried servants wearing vorkosigan brown and silver in a high vor household even the staff played soldier one of them directed botharijesek away to the right mark could have wept she despised him but at least she was familiar stripped of all support and feeling more utterly alone than when locked in the darkness of his cabin he turned to follow the other manservant through a short arched hallway and a set of doors on the left he had memorized the layout of vorkosigan house under galens tutelage long ago so he knew they were entering a room dubbed the first parlor an antechamber to the great library that ran from the front of the house to the back by the standards of vorkosigan houses public rooms he supposed it was relatively intimate though its high ceiling seemed to lend it a cool disapproving austerity his consciousness of the architectural detail was instantly obliterated when he saw the woman sitting on a padded sofa quietly awaiting him she was tall neither thin nor stout a sort of middleaged solid in build red hair streaked with natural gray wound in a complex knot on the back of her head leaving her face free to make its own statement of cheekbone line of jaw and clear grey eye her posture was contained poised rather than resting she wore a soft silky beige blouse a handembroidered sash that he suddenly realized matched the pattern on his own stolen one and a calflength tan skirt and buskins no jewelry he had expected something more ostentatious elaborate intimidating the formal icon of countess vorkosigan from the vids of reviewing stands and receptions or was her sense of power so fully encompassed that she didnt need to wear it she was it he could see no physical similarity whatsoever between her and himself well maybe eye color and the paleness of their skins and the bridge of the nose perhaps the line of the jaw had a certain congruence not apparent from vids lord mark vorkosigan milady the manservant announced portentously making mark flinch thank you pym she nodded to the middleaged retainer dismissing him the armsmans disappointed curiosity was wellconcealed except for one quick glance back before closing the doors after himself hello mark countess vorkosigans voice was a soft alto please sit she waved at an armchair set at a slight angle opposite her sofa it did not appear to be hinged and sprung to snap closed upon him and it was not too close to her he lowered himself into it gingerly as instructed unusually it was not too high for his feet to touch the floor had it been cut down for miles i am glad to meet you at last she stated though im sorry the circumstances are so awkward so am i he mumbled glad or sorry and who were these is sitting here lying politely to each other about their gladness and sorrow who are we lady he looked around fearfully for the butcher of komarr where is your husband ostensibly greeting elena actually he funked out and sent me into the front line first most unlike him i dont understand maam he didnt know what to call her hes been drinking stomach medicine in beverage quantities for the past two days you have to understand how the information has been trickling in from our point of view our first hint that there was anything amiss came four days ago in the form of a courier officer from impsec hq with a brief standard message from illyan that miles was missing in action details to follow we were not at first inclined to panic miles has been missing before sometimes for quite extended periods it was not until illyans full transmission was relayed and decoded several hours later together with the news that you were on your way that it all came clear weve had three days to think it through he sat silent struggling with the concept of the great admiral count vorkosigan the feared butcher of komarr that massive shadowy monster even having a point of view let alone one that low mortals such as himself were casually expected to understand illyan never uses weaselwords the countess continued but he made it through that whole report without once using the term dead killed or any of their synonyms the medical records suggest otherwise correct um the cryotreatment appeared successful what did she want from him and so we are mired in an emotional and legal limbo she sighed it would be almost easier if he she frowned fiercely down into her lap her hands clenched for the first time you understand were going to be talking about a lot of possible contingencies much revolves around you but i wont count miles as dead till hes dead and rotted he remembered that tide of blood on the concrete um he said helplessly the fact that you could potentially play miles has been a great distraction to some people she looked him over bemusedly you say the dendarii accepted you he cringed into the chair bodyconscious under her sharp grey gaze feeling the flesh of his torso roll and bunch under miless shirt and sash the tightness of the trousers ive put on some weight since then all that in just three weeks yes he muttered flushing one brow rose on purpose sort of huh she sat back looking surprised that was extremely clever of you he gaped realized it emphasized his doubling chin and closed his mouth quickly your status has been the subject of much debate i voted against any security ploy to conceal miless situation by having you pose as him in the first place its redundant lieutenant lord vorkosigan is often gone for months at a time his absence is more normal than not these days its strategically more important to establish you as yourself lord mark if lord mark is indeed who you are to be he swallowed in a dry throat do i have a choice you will but a reasoned one after youve had time to assimilate it all you cant be serious im a clone im from beta colony kiddo she said tartly betan law is very sensible and clear on the topic of clones its only barrayaran custom that finds itself at a loss barrayarans she pronounced it like a swear word barrayar lacks a long experience of dealing with all the technological variants on human reproduction no legal precedents and if its not a tradition she put the same sour spin on the word as had botharijesek they dont know how to cope what am i to you as a betan he asked nervously fascinated either my son or my son once removed she answered promptly unlicensed but claimed by me as an heir those are actual legal categories on your homeworld you bet now if i had ordered you cloned from miles after getting an approved childlicense first of course you would be my son pure and simple if miles as a legal adult had done the same he would be your legal parent and i would be your motheronceremoved and bear claims upon you and obligations to you approximately the equivalent of a grandparent miles was not of course a legal adult at the time you were cloned nor was your birth licensed if you were still a minor he and i could go before an adjudicator and your guardianship would be assigned according to the adjudicators best judgment of your welfare you are no longer of course a minor in either betan or barrayaran law she sighed the time for legal guardianship is past lost the inheritance of property will mostly be tangled in the barrayaran legal confusions aral will discuss barrayaran customary law or the lack of it with you when the time comes that leaves our emotional relationship do we have one he asked cautiously his two greatest fears that she would either pull out a weapon and shoot him or else throw herself upon him in some totally inappropriate paroxysm of maternal affection both seemed to be fading he was left facing a levelvoiced mystery we do though exactly what it is remains to be discovered realize this though half my genes run through your body and my selfish genome is heavily evolutionarily preprogrammed to look out for its copies the other half is copied from the man i admire most in all the worlds and time so my interest is doubly riveted the artistic combination of the two shall we say arrests my attention put like that it actually seemed to make sense logically and without threat he found his stomach unknotting his throat relaxing he promptly felt hungry again for the first time since planetary orbit now whats between you and me has nothing to do with whats between you and barrayar thats arals department and hell have to speak for his own views its all so undecided except for one thing while you are here you are yourself mark miless sixyearsyounger twin brother and not an imitation or a substitute for miles so the more you can establish yourself as distinct from miles from the very beginning the better oh he breathed please yes i suspected youd already grasped that good we agree but just notbeingmiles is no more than the inverse of being an imitation miles i want to know who is mark lady i dont know his prodded honesty had an edge of anguish she watched him sapiently there is time she said calmly miles wanted you to be here you know he talked about showing you around imagined teaching you to ride horseback she gave a furtive shudder galen tried to have me taught in london mark recalled it was terrifically expensive and i wasnt very good at it so he finally told me just to avoid horses when i got here ah she brightened slightly hm miles you see has had has these onlychild romantic notions about siblings now i have a brother so i have no such illusions she paused glanced around the room and leaned forward with a suddenly confidential air lowering her voice you have an uncle a grandmother and two cousins on beta colony who are just as much your relatives as aral and myself and your cousin ivan here on barrayar remember you have more than one choice ive given one son to barrayar and watched for twentyeight years while barrayar tried to destroy him maybe barrayar has had its turn eh ivans not here now is he mark asked diverted and horrified hes not staying at vorkosigan house no if thats what you mean he is in vorbarr sultana assigned to imperial service headquarters perhaps her eye lit in speculation he could take you out and show you some of the things miles wanted you to see ivan may still be angry for what i did to him in london mark jittered hell get over it the countess predicted confidently i have to admit miles would have positively enjoyed unsettling people with you a quirk miles inherited from his mother clearly ive lived almost three decades on barrayar she mused weve come such a long way and yet there is still so terribly far to go even arals will grows weary maybe we cant do it all in one generation time for the changing of the guard in my opinion ah well he sat back in his chair for the first time letting it support him starting to watch and listen instead of just cower an ally it seemed he had an ally though he was still not sure just why galen had not spent much time on countess cordelia vorkosigan being totally obsessed with his old enemy the butcher galen it appeared had seriously underestimated her she had survived twentynine years here might he for the first time it seemed something humanly possible a brief knock sounded on the hinged double doors to the hallway at countess vorkosigans yes they swung open partway and a man poked his head around the frame and favored her with a strained smile is it all right for me to come in now dear captain yes i think so said countess vorkosigan he let himself through and closed the doors again marks throat closed he swallowed and breathed swallowed and breathed with frighteningly fragile control he would not pass out in front of this man or vomit he hadnt more than a teaspoon of bile left in his gut by now anyway it was him unmistakably him prime minister aral count aral vorkosigan formerly regent of the barrayaran dire and de facto dictator of three worlds conqueror of komarr military genius political mastermindaccused murderer torturer hit man too many impossible things to be contained in that stocky form now striding toward mark mark had studied vids of him taken at every age perhaps it was somewhat odd that his first coherent thought was he looks older than i expected count vorkosigan was ten standard years older than his betan wife but he looked twenty or thirty years older his hair was lighter shade of grey than in the vids from even two years ago he was short for a barrayaran eye to eye with the countess his face was heavy intense weathered he wore green uniform trousers but no jacket just the cream shirt with the long sleeves rolled up and open at the round collar which if it was an attempt at a casual look failing utterly the tension in the room had risen to choking levels at his entrance elena is settled count vorkosigan reported seating himself beside the countess his posture was open hands on knees but he did not lean back comfortably the visit seems to be stirring up more memories than she was ready for shes rather disturbed ill go talk to her in a bit promised the countess good the counts eyes inventoried mark puzzled repelled well the practiced diplomat whose job it was to talk three planets along the road to progress sat speechless at a loss as if unable to address mark directly he turned instead to his wife he passed as miles a tinge of dark amusement flashed in countess vorkosigans eyes hes put on weight since then she said blandly i see the silence stretched for excruciating seconds mark blurted out the first thing i was supposed to do when i saw you was try to kill you yes i know count vorkosigan settled back on the sofa eyes on marks face at last they made me practice about twenty different backup methods could do them in my sleep but the primary was to have been use a patch with a paralyzing toxin that left evidence on autopsy pointing to heart failure i was to get alone with you touch it to any part of your body i could reach it was strangely slow for an assassination drug i was to wait in your sight for twenty minutes while you died and never let on that i was not miles the count smiled grimly i see a good revenge very artistic it would have worked as the new count vorkosigan i was then to go on and spearhead a drive for the imperium that would have failed ser galen expected it to it was merely the chaos of its failure during which komarr was supposed to rise that he desired you were to be another vorkosigan sacrifice then he actually seemed to grow more at ease professional discussing these grotesque plots killing you was the entire reason for my existence two years ago i was all primed to do it i endured all those years of galen for no other purpose take heart advised the countess most people exist for no reason at all the count remarked impsec assembled a huge pile of documentation on you after the plot came to light it covers the time from when you were a mere mad gleam in galens eye to the latest addition about your disappearance from earth two months ago but theres nothing in the documentation that suggests your er late adventure on jacksons whole was some sort of latent programming along the lines of my projected assassination was it a faint doubt colored his voice no said mark firmly ive been programmed enough to know its not something you can fail to notice not the way galen did it anyway i disagree said countess vorkosigan unexpectedly you were set up for it mark but not by galen the count raised his brows in startled inquiry by miles im afraid she explained quite inadvertently i dont see it said the count mark felt the same way i was only in contact with miles for a few days on earth im not sure youre ready for this but here goes you had exactly three role models to learn how to be a human being from the jacksonian bodyslavers the komarran terroristsand miles you were steeped in miles and im sorry but miles thinks hes a knighterrant a rational government wouldnt allow him possession of a pocketknife let alone a space fleet and so mark when you were finally forced to choose between two palpable evils and a lunaticyou upped and ran after the lunatic i think miles does very well objected the count agh the countess buried her face in her hands briefly love we are discussing a young man upon whom barrayar laid so much unbearable stress so much pain he created an entire other personality escape into he then persuaded several thousand galactic mercenararies to support his psychosis and on top of that conned the barrayaran imperium into paying for it all admiral naismith is one hell of a lot more than just an impsec cover identity and you know it i grant you hes a genius but dont you dare try to tell me hes sane she paused no thats not fair miless safety valve works i wont really begin to fear for his sanity till hes cut off from the little admiral its extraordinary balancing act all in all she glanced at mark and a nearly impossible act to follow i should think mark had never thought of miles as seriously crazed hed only thought of him as perfect this was all highly unsettling the dendarii truly function as a covert operations arm of impsec said the count looking a bit unsettled himself spectacularly well occasion of course they do you wouldnt let miles keep them if they didnt so he makes sure of it i merely point out that their official function is not their only function andif miles ever ceases to need them it wont be a year before impsec finds reason to cut that tie and youll earnestly believe you are acting perfectly logically why werent they blaming him he mustered the courage to say it aloud why arent you blaming me for killing miles with a glance the countess fielded the question to her husband ne nodded and answered for them both illyans report stated miles was shot by a bharaputran security trooper but he wouldnt have been in the line of fire if i hadnt count vorkosigan held up an interrupting hand if he hadnt foolishly chosen to be dont attempt to camouflage your real blame by taking more than your share ive made too many lethal errors myself be fooled by that one he glanced at his boots we have also considered the long view while your personality and persona are nearly distinct from miless any children you sire would be genetically indistinguishable not you but your son may be what barrayar needs only to continue the vor system countess vorkosigan put in lightly a dubious goal love or are you picturing yourself as a grandfatherly mentor to marks theoretical children as your father was to miles god forbid muttered the count fervently beware your own conditioning she turned to mark the trouble she looked away looked back if we fail to recover miles at you will be facing is not just a relationship its a job at a minimum youd be responsible for the welfare of a couple of million people in your district you would be their voice in the council of counts its a job miles was trained for literally from birth im not sure its possible to send in a lastminute substitute surely not oh surely not i dont know said the count thoughtfully i was such a substitute until i was eleven years old i was the spare not the heir i admit after my older brother was murdered the rush of events made the shift in destinies easy for me we were all so intent on revenge in mad yuris war by the time i looked up and drew breath again id fully assimilated the fact i would be count someday though i scarcely imagined that someday would be another fifty years its possible you too mark could have many years to study and train but its also possible my countship could land in your lap tomorrow the man was seventytwo standard years old middleaged for a galactic old for harsh barrayar count aral had used himself hard had he used himself nearly up his father count piotr had lived twenty years more than that a whole other lifetime would barrayar even accept a clone as your heir he asked doubtfully well its past time to start developing laws one way or the other yours would be a major test case with enough concentrated will i could probably ram it down their throats mark didnt doubt that but starting a legal war is premature till things sort themselves out with the missing cryochamber for now the public story is that miles is away on duty and you are visiting for the first time all true enough i need scarcely emphasize that the details are classified mark shook his head and nodded in agreement feeling dizzy butis this necessary suppose id never been created and miles was killed in the line of duty somewhere ivan vorpatril would be your heir yes said the count and house vorkosigan would come to an end after eleven generations of direct descent whats the problem with that the problem is that it is not the case you do exist the problem is that i have always wanted cordelias son to be my heir note were discussing rather a lot of property by ordinary standards i thought most of your ancestral lands glowed in the dark after the destruction of vorkosigan vashnoi the count shrugged some remain this residence for example but my estate is not just property as cordelia puts it it comes with a fulltime job if we allow your claim upon it you must allow its claim upon you you can keep it all said mark sincerely ill sign anything the count winced consider it orientation mark said the countess some of the people you may encounter will be thinking much about these questions you simply need to be aware of the unspoken agendas the count acquired an abstracted look he let out his breath in a long trickle when he looked up again his face was frighteningly serious thats true and theres one agenda that is not only unspoken unspeakable you must be warned so unspeakable count vorkosigan was having trouble spitting it out self apparently what now asked mark warily there is a false theory of descent one of six possible lines puts me next in line to inherit the barrayaran imperium should emperor gregor die without issue cripes said mark impatiently of course i knew galens plot turned exploiting that legal argument you then miles then ivan well now its me then miles then you then ivan and miles technicallydead at the moment that leaves only me between and being targeted not as an imitation miles but in your own right thats rubbish exploded mark thats even crazier than the idea of my becoming count vorkosigan hold that thought advised the countess hold it hard and never even hint that you could think otherwise i am fallen among madmen if anyone approaches you with a conversation on the subject report it to me cordelia or simon illyan as soon as possible the count added mark had retreated as far back into his chair as he could go all right youre scaring him dear the countess remarked on that topic paranoia is the key to good health said the count carefully he watched mark silently for a moment you look tired ill show you to your room you can wash up and rest a bit they all rose mark followed them out to the paved hallway the countess nodded to an archway leading straight back under the arched stairway im going to take the lift tube up and see elena right the count agreed mark perforce followed him up the steps two flights let him know how out of shape he was by the time they reached the second landing he was breathing as heavily as old man the count turned down a third floor hallway mark asked in some dread youre not putting me in miless room are you no though the one youre getting was mine once when i was a child before the death of his older brother presumably the second sons room that was almost as unnerving its just a guest room now the count swung open another blank wooden door on hinges beyond it lay a sunny chamber obviously handmade wooden furniture of uncertain age and enormous value included a bed and chests a domestic console to control lighting and the mechanized windows sat incongruously beside the carved headboard mark glanced back and collided with the counts deeply questioning stare it was a thousand times worse than even the dendariis ilovenaismith look he clenched his hands to his head and grated miles isnt in here i know said the count quietly i was looking for myself i suppose and cordelia and you uncomfortably compelled mark looked for himself in the count reciprocally he wasnt sure hair color formerly he and miles shared the same dark hair he had seen on vids of the younger admiral vorkosigan intellectually hed known aral vorkosigan was the old general count piotr vorkosigans younger son but that lost older brother had been dead for sixty years he was astonished the present count remembered with such immediacy or made of it a connection with himself strange and frightening i was to kill this man i still could hes not guarding himself at all your impsec people didnt even fastpenta me arent you at all worried that i might still be programmed to assassinate you or did he seem so little threat i thought you shot your fatherfigure once already catharsis enough a bemused grimace curved the counts mouth mark remembered galens surprised look when the nervedisruptor beam had taken him full in the face whatever aral vorkosigan would look like dying mark fancied it would not be surprised you saved miless life then according to his description of the affray the count said you chose your side two years ago on earth very effectively i have many fears for you mark but my death at your hand is not one of them youre not as onedown with respect to your brother as you imagine evenall by my count progenitor not brother said mark stiff and congealed cordelia and i are your progenitors said the count firmly denial flashed in marks face the count shrugged whatever miles is we made him you are perhaps wise to approach us with caution we may not be good for you either his belly shivered with a terrible longing restrained by a terrible fear progenitors parents he was not sure he wanted parents at this late date they were such enormous figures he felt obliterated in their shadow shattered like glass annihilated he felt a sudden weird wish to have miles back somebody his own size and age somebody he could talk to the count glanced again into the bedchamber pym should have arranged your things i dont have any things just the clothes im wearing sir it was impossible to keep his tongue from adding that honorific you must have had something more to wear what i brought from earth i left in a storage locker on escobar the rents up by now its probably confiscated the count looked him over ill send someone to take your measurements and supply you with a kit if you were visiting under more normal circumstances we would be showing you around introducing you to friends and relatives a tour of the city getting you aptitude tests making arrangements for furthering your education well do some of that in any case a school what kind assignment to a barrayaran military academy was very close to marks idea of a descent into hell could they make him there were ways to resist he had successfully resisted being lent miless wardrobe if you want anything ring for pym on your console the count instructed human servants so very strange the physical fear that had turned him inside out was fading to be replaced by a more formless general anxiety can i get something to eat ah please join cordelia and me for lunch in one hour pym will show you to the yellow parlor i can find it down one floor one corridor south third door on the right the count raised an eyebrow correct ive studied you you see thats all right weve studied you too weve all done our homework so whats the test ah thats the trick of it its not a test its real life and real death im sorry mark blurted for miles for himself he scarcely knew the count looked like he was wondering too a brief ironic smile twitched one corner of his mouth well in a strange way its almost a relief to know that its as bad as it can be before when miles was missing one didnt know where he was what he might be doing to er magnify the chaos at least this time we know he cant possibly get into any worse trouble with a brief wave the count walked away not entering the room after mark not crowding him in any way three ways to kill him flashed through marks mind but that training seemed ages stale he was too out of shape now anyway climbing the stairs had exhausted him he pulled the door shut and fell onto the carved bed shivering with reaction chapter thirteen ostensibly to allow mark to recover from jumplag the count and countess set no tasks for him the first two days indeed except for the rather formal mealtimes mark did not see count vorkosigan at all he wandered the house and grounds at will with no apparent guard but the countesss discreet observation of him there were uniformed guards at the gates he did not yet have the nerve to test and discover if they were charged to keep him in as well as unauthorized persons out he had studied vorkosigan house yes but the immediacy of actually being here took some getting used to it all seemed subtly askew from his expectations the place was a warren but for all the antiques with which vorkosigan house was cluttered every original window had been replaced with modern highgrade armorglass and automatic shutters even the ones high up on the wall in the basement kitchen it was like a shell if a vast one of protection palacefortressprison could he slide into this shell ive been a prisoner all my life i want to be a free man on the third day his new clothing arrived the countess came to help him unpack it all the morning light and cool air of early autumn streamed into his bedchamber through the window which he had mulishly opened wide to the mysterious dangerous unknown world he opened one bag on a hanger to reveal a garment in a disturbingly military style a highnecked tunic and sidepiped trousers in vorkosigan brown and silver very like the counts armsmens liveries but with more glitter on the collar and epaulettes whats this he asked suspiciously ah said the countess gaudy isnt it its your uniform as a lord of house vorkosigan his not miless all the new clothes were computercut to generous fit his heart sank as he calculated how much hed have to eat to escape this one the countesss lips curved up at the dismayed expression on his face the only two places you actually have to wear it are if you tend a session of the council of counts or if you go to the emperors birthday ceremonies which you might theyre coming up in a w weeks she hesitated her finger tracing over the vorkosigan logo embroidered on the tunics collar miless birthday isnt very long after that well miles wasnt aging at the moment wherever he was birthdays are sort of a nonconcept for me what do you call it when you take someone out of a uterine replicator when i was taken out of my uterine replicator my parents called my birthday she said dryly she was betan right i dont even know when mine is you dont its in your records what records your bharaputran medical file havent you ever seen it ill have get you a copy its um fascinating reading in a sort of horrifying way your birthday was the seventeenth of last month in point of fact i missed it anyway then he closed the bag and stuffed the uniform far back in his closet not important its important that someone celebrate our existence she objected amiably people are the only mirror we have to see ourselves in the domain of all meaning all virtue all evil are contained only in people there is none in the universe at large solitary confinement is a punishment in every human culture thats true he admitted remembering his own recent imprisonment hm the next garment he shook out suited his mood solid black though on closer examination it proved to be almost the same design as the cadet lords uniform the logos and piping muted in black silk instead of glowing in silver thread almost invisible against the black cloth thats for funerals commented the countess her voice was suddenly rather flat oh taking the hint he tucked it away behind the vor cadets uniform he finally chose the least militaryflavored outfit available soft loose trousers low boots without buckles steel toe caps or any other aggressive decorations and a shirt and vest in dark colors blues greens redbrowns it felt like a costume but it was all extremely wellmade camouflage did the clothes represent the man inside or disguise him is it me he asked the countess upon emerging from the bathroom for inspection she halflaughed a profound question to ask of ones clothing even i cant answer that one on the fourth day ivan vorpatril turned up at breakfast he wore an imperial lieutenants undress greens neatly setting off his tall physicallyfit frame with his arrival the yellow parlor seemed suddenly crowded mark shrank down guiltily as his putative cousin greeted his aunt with a decorous kiss on the cheek and his uncle with a formal nod ivan nailed a plate from the sideboard and piled it precariously with eggs meat and sugared breads juggled a mug of coffee hooked back a chair with his foot and slid into a place at the table opposite mark hello mark ivan acknowledged his existence at last you look like hell when did you get so bloated he shoved a forkful of fried meat into his mouth and started chewing thank you ivan mark took what refuge he could in faint sarcasm you havent changed i see implying no improvement he hoped ivans brown eyes glinted he started to speak but was stopped by his aunts ivan in a tone of cool reproof mark didnt think it was for trying to talk with his mouth full but ivan swallowed before replying not to mark but to the countess my apologies aunt cordelia but i still have a problem with closets and other small unvented dark areas because of him sorry muttered mark hunching but something in him resisted being cowed by ivan and he added i only had galen kidnap you to fetch miles so that was your idea it worked too he came right along and stuck his head in the noose for you ivans jaw tightened a habit he has failed to break i understand he returned in a tone halfway between a purr and a snarl it was marks turn to be silent yet in a way it was almost comforting ivan at least treated him as he deserved a little welcome punishment he felt himself reviving under the rain of scorn like a parched plant ivans challenge almost brightened his day why are you here it wasnt my idea believe me said ivan i am to take you out for an airing mark glanced at the countess but she was focused on her husband already she asked it is by request said count vorkosigan ah ha she said as if enlightened no light dawned for mark it wasnt his request good perhaps ivan can show him a bit of the city on the way thats the idea said the count since ivan is an officer it eliminates the need for a bodyguard why so they could talk frankly a terrible idea and who would protect him from ivan there will be an outer perimeter i trust said the countess oh yes the outer perimeter was the guard no one was supposed to see not even the principals mark wondered what prevented the outer perimeter people from just taking the day off and claiming theyd been there invisible men you could get away with the scam for quite a long time between crises he suspected lieutenant lord vorpatril had his own groundcar mark discovered after breakfast a sporty model featuring lots of red enamel reluctantly mark slid in beside ivan so he said in an uncertain voice do you still want to scrag me ivan whipped the car through the residences gates and out into vorbarr sultana city traffic personally yes practically no i need all the bodies i can get to stand between me and uncle arals job i wish miles had a dozen children he could have by now if only hed startedin a way you are a godsend theyd have me clamped in as heir apparent right now if not for you he hesitated in speech only the groundcar he accelerated through an intersection weaving narrowly past four other vehicles bearing down in collision courses how dead is miles really uncle aral was pretty vague on the vid telling me about it i wasnt sure if it was for security orive never seen him so stiff the traffic was worse than londons and if possible even more disorderly or ordered according to some rule involving survival of the fittest mark gripped the edges of his seat and replied i dont know he took a needlegrenade in the chest almost as bad as it could be without actually blowing him in half did ivans lips ripple in suppressed horror if so the breezy facade reclosed again almost instantly it will take a topnotch revival facility to put his torso back together right mark continued for the brain you never know till revivals over and then its too late but thats not the problem or not the problem yet yeah ivan grimaced that was a real screwup yknow how could you lose he turned so sharply he trailed an edge which struck sparks from the pavement and swore cheerfully at a very large hovertruck which nearly lunged through marks side of the groundcar mark crouched down and shut his mouth better the conversation should die than him his life could depend on not distracting the driver his first impression of the city of miless birth was that half the population was going to be killed in traffic before nightfall or maybe just the ones in ivans path ivan did a violent uturn and skidded sideways into a parking space cutting off two other groundcars maneuvering toward it and coming to a halt so abruptly mark was nearly launched into the front panel vorhartung castle ivan announced with a nod and a wave as the engines whine died away the council of counts is not in session today so the museum is open to the public though we are not the public how cultural said mark warily peering out through the canopy vorhartung castle really looked like a castle a rambling antiquated pile of featureless stone rising out of the trees it perched on a bluff above the river rapids that divided vorbarr sultana its grounds were now a park beds of cultivated flowers grew where men and horses had once dragged seige engines through icy mud in vain assaults what is this really you are to meet a man and i am not to prediscuss it ivan popped the canopy and clambered out mark followed ivan whether by plan or perversity really did take him to the museum which occupied one whole wing of the castle and was devoted to the arms and armor of the vor from the time of isolation as a soldier in uniform ivan was admitted free though he dutifully paid marks way in with a few coins for a cover mark guessed for members of the vor caste were also admitted free ivan explained in a whisper there was no sign to that effect if you were vor you were presumed to know or maybe it was ivans subtle slur on marks vorness or lack of same ivan played the upperclass lout with the same cultivated thoroughness with which he played the imperial lieutenant or any other role his world demanded of him the real ivan was rather more elusive mark gauged it would not do to underestimate his subtlety or mistake him for a simpleton so he was to meet a man what man if it was another impsec debriefing why couldnt he have met the man at vorkosigan house was it someone in government or prime minister count arals centrist coalition party again why not come to him ivan couldnt be setting him up for an assassination the vorkosigans could have had him killed in secret anytime these past two years maybe he was being set up to be accused of some staged crime even more arcane plot ideas twisted through his mind all sharing the same fatal flaw of being totally lacking in motivation or logic he stared at a crammed array of dual sword sets in a chronological row on a wall displaying the evolution of the barrayaran smiths art over two centuries then hurried to join ivan in front of a case of chemicalexplosivepropelled projectile weapons highly decorated largebore muzzle loaders that had once the card proclaimed belonged to emperor vlad vorbarra the bullets were peculiar in being solid gold massive spheres the size of marks thumbtip at short range it must have been like being hit by a terminalvelocity brick at long range they probably missed so what poor peasant or squire had been stuck with the job of going around retrieving the misses or worse the hits several of the bright balls in display were flattened or misshapen and to marks intense bemusement one card informed the museum patron that this very distorted blob had killed lord vor soandso during the battle of suchandsuch taken from his brain after death mark presumed hoped yech he was only surprised someone had cleaned the ancient gore from the spent bullet before mounting it given the bloodthirsty gruesomeness of some of the other displays the tanned and cured scalp of mad emperor yuri for instance on loan from some vor clans private collection lord vorpatril it was not a question the man speaking had appeared so quietly mark was not even sure from what direction he had come he was dressed as quietly middleaged intelligentlooking he might have been a museum administrator come with me please without question or comment ivan fell in behind the man gesturing mark ahead of him thus sandwiched mark trod in his wake torn between curiosity and nerves they went through a door marked no admittance which the man unlocked with a mechanical key and then locked again behind them went up two staircases and down an echoing woodfloored corridor to a room occupying the top floor of a round tower at the buildings corner once a guard post it was now furnished as an office with ordinary windows cut into the stone walls in place of arrow slits a man waited within perched on a stool gazing pensively down at the grounds falling away to the river and the sprinkling of brightlydressed people strolling or climbing the paths he was a thin darkhaired fellow in his thirties pale skin set off by loose dark clothing entirely lacking in pseudomilitary detailing he looked up with a quick smile at their guide thank you kevi both greeting and dismissal seemed combined for the guide nodded and exited it wasnt until ivan nodded and said sire that recognition clicked emperor gregor vorbarra shit the door behind mark was blocked by ivan mark controlled his surge of panic gregor was only a man alone apparently unarmed all the rest was propaganda hype illusion his heart beat faster anyway hullo ivan said the emperor thank you for coming why dont you go study the exhibits for a while seen em before said ivan laconically nevertheless gregor jerked his head doorward not to put too fine a point on it said ivan but this is not miles not even on a good day and despite appearances he was trained as an assassin once isnt this a touch premature well said gregor softly well find out wont we do you want to assassinate me mark no mark croaked there you have it take a hike ivan ill send kevi for you in a bit ivan grimaced in frustration and mark sensed not a little frustrated curiosity he departed with an ironic salaam that seemed to say on your head be it so lord mark said gregor what do you think of vorbarr sultana so far it went by pretty fast mark said cautiously dear god dont tell me you let ivan drive i didnt know i had a choice the emperor laughed sit down he waved mark into the station chair behind the comconsole desk the little room was otherwise sparsely furnished though the antique military prints and maps cluttering the walls might be spillover from the nearby museum the emperors smile faded back into his initial pensive look as he studied mark it reminded mark a little of the way count vorkosigan looked at him that who are you look only without the counts ravenous intensity a bearable wonder is this your office asked mark cautiously settling himself in the imperial swivelchair the room seemed small and austere for the purpose one of them this whole complex is crammed with various offices in some of the oddest niches count vorvolk has one in the old dungeons no head room i use this as a private retreat when attending the council of counts meetings or when i have other business here why do i qualify as business besides not being pleasure is this personal or official i cant spit without being official on barrayar the two are not very separable miles was gregors tongue tripped over that past tense too in no particular order a peer of my caste an officer in my service the son of an extremely if not supremely important official and a personal friend of lifelong standing and the heir to the countship of a district and the counts are the mechanism whereby one man he touched his chest multiplies to sixty and then to a multitude the counts are the first officers of the imperium i am its captain you do understand that i am not the imperium an empire is mere geography the imperium is a society the multitude the whole bodyultimately down to every subject that is the imperium of which i am only a piece an interchangeable part at that did you notice my greatuncles scalp downstairs um yes it was uh prominently displayed this is the home of the council of counts the fulcrum of the lever may fancy itself supreme but it is nothing without the lever mad yuri forgot that i dont the count of the vorkosigans district is another such living piece also interchangeable he paused a link in a chain mark offered carefully to prove he was paying attention a link in a chainmail in a web so that one weak link is not fatal many must fail at once to achieve a real disaster still one wants as many sound reliable links as possible obviously obviously why are you looking at me so tell me what happened on jacksons whole as you saw it gregor sat up on his perch hooking one heel and crossing his booted ankles apparently centered and comfortable like a raven on a branch id have to start the story back on earth feel free his easy brief smile implied mark had all the time in the world and one hundred percent of his attention haltingly mark began to stammer out his tale gregors questions were few only interjected when mark hung up on the difficult bits few but searching gregor was not in pursuit of mere facts mark quickly realized he had obviously already seen illyans report the emperor was after something else i cannot argue with your good intentions said gregor at one point the brain transplant business is a loathsome enterprise but you do realizeyour effort your raid is hardly going to put a dent in it house bharaputra will just clean up the broken glass and go on it will make a permanent difference to the fortynine clones mark asserted doggedly everybody makes that same damned argument i cant do it all so im not going to do any and they dont and it goes on and on and anyway if i had been able to go back via escobar as id planned in the first placethere would have been a big news splash house bharaputra might even have tried to reclaim the clones legally and then there would really have been a public stink id have made sure of it even if id been in escobaran detention where by the way the house bharaputra enforcers would have had a hard time getting at me and maybe maybe it would have interested some more people in the problem ah said gregor a publicity stunt it was not a stunt mark grated excuse me i did not mean to imply your effort was trivial quite the reverse but you did have a coherent longrange strategy after all yeah but it went down the waste disintegrator as soon as i lost control of the dendarii as soon as they knew who i really was he brooded on the memory of that helplessness at gregors prodding mark went on to recount miless death the screwup with the lost cryochamber their aborted efforts to retrieve it and their humiliating ejection from jacksonian local space he found himself revealing far more of his real thoughts than he was comfortable doing yet gregor almost put him at his ease how did the man do it the soft almost selfeffacing demeanor camouflaged a consummately skillful peoplehandler in a garbled rush mark described the incident with maree and his halfinsane time in solitary confinement then trailed off into inarticulate silence gregor frowned introspectively and was quiet for a time hell the man was quiet all the time it seems to me mark that you devalue your strengths you have been battletested and proved your physical courage you can take an initiative and dare much you do not lack brains though sometimes information its not a bad start on the qualities needed for a countship someday not any day i dont want to be a count of barrayar mark denied emphatically it could be the first step to my job gregor said suggestively with a slight smile no thats even worse theyd eat me alive my scalp would join the collection downstairs very possibly gregors smile faded yes ive often wondered where all my body parts are going to end up and yeti understand you were set to try it just two years ago including arals countship fake it yes now youre talking about the real thing not an imitation im just an imitation dont you know ive only studied the outsides the inner surface i can barely imagine but you see said gregor we all start out that way faking it the role is a simulacrum into which we slowly grow real flesh become the machine some do thats the pathological version of a count and there are a few others become more human the machine the role then becomes a handilyworked prosthetic which serves the man both types have their uses for my goals one must simply be sure where on the range of selfdelusion the man youre talking to falls yes countess cordelia had surely had a hand in training this man mark sensed her trail like phosphorescent footsteps in the dark what are your goals gregor shrugged keep the peace keep the various factions from trying to kill each other make bloody sure that no galactic invader ever puts a boot on barrayaran soil again foster economic progress lady peace is the first hostage taken when economic discomfort rises here my reign is unusually blessed with the terraforming of the second continent and the opening of sergyar for full colonization finally now that that vile subcutaneous worm plague is under control settling sergyar should absorb everyones excess energies for several generations ive been studying various colonial histories lately wondering how many of the mistakes we can avoid well so i still dont want to be count vorkosigan without miles you dont exactly have a choice rubbish at least he hoped it was rubbish you just said its an interchangeable part they could find someone else just fine if they had to ivan i guess gregor smiled bleakly i confess ive often used the same argument though in my case the topic is progeny bad dreams about the destiny of my body parts are nothing compared to the ones i have about my theoretical future childrens and im not going to marry some high vor bud whose family tree crosses mine sixteen times in the last six generations he contained himself abruptly with an apologetic grimace and yet the man was so controlled mark fancied even this glimpse of the inner gregor served a purpose or could be made to mark was getting a headache without miles with miles all these barrayaran dilemmas would be miless and mark would be free to face his own dilemmas anyway his own demons not these adopted ones this is not my gift talent interest destiny something i dont know he rubbed his neck passion said gregor yes thatll do a countship is not my passion after a moment gregor asked curiously what is your passion mark if not government or power or wealthyou have not even mentioned wealth enough wealth to destroy house bharaputra is so far beyond my reach it just doesnt apply its not a solution i can have i i some men are cannibals house bharaputra its customersi want to stop the cannibals that would be worth getting out of bed for he became aware his voice had grown louder and slumped down again in the soft chair in other words you have a passion for justice or dare i say it security a curious echo of your um progenitor no no well maybe in a sense i suppose there are cannibals on barrayar too but they havent riveted my close personal interest i dont think in terms of law enforcement because the transplant business isnt illegal on jacksons whole so a policeman isnt the solution either or it would have to be a damned unusual policeman like an impsec covert ops agent mark tried to imagine a detectiveinspector bearing a letter of marque and reprisal for some reason a vision of his progenitor kept coming up damn gregors unsettling suggestion not a policeman a knighterrant the countess had it deadon but there was no place for knightserrant any more the police would have to arrest them gregor sat back with a faintly satisfied air thats very interesting his abstracted look resembled that of a man assimilating the codekey to a safe he slid from his stool to wander along the windows and gaze down from another angle face to the light he remarked it seems to me your future access to your passion depends rather heavily on getting miles back mark sighed in frustration its out of my hands theyll never let me what can i do that impsec cant maybe theyll turn him up any day now in other words said gregor slowly the most important thing in your life at this moment is something you are powerless to affect you have my profound sympathies mark slipped unwilled into frankness im a virtual prisoner here i cant do anything and i cant leave gregor cocked his head have you tried mark paused well no not yet actually ah gregor turned away from the window and took a small plastic card from his inner jacket pocket he handed it across the desk to mark my voice carries only to the borders of barrayars interests he said nevertheless here is my private vidcom number your calls will be screened by only one person youll be on their list simply state your name and you will be passed through uh thank you said mark in cautious confusion the card bore only the codestrip no other identification he put it away very carefully gregor touched an audiocom pin on his jacket and spoke to kevi in a few moments there came a knock and the door swung open to admit ivan again mark who had started to rock in gregors station chairit did not squeakselfconsciously climbed out of it gregor and ivan exchanged farewells as laconically as they had exchanged greetings and ivan led mark out of the tower room as they rounded the corner mark looked back at the sound of footsteps kevi was already ushering in the next man for his imperial appointment so how did it go ivan inquired i feel drained mark admitted ivan smiled grimly gregor can do that to you when hes being emperor being or playing oh not playing he gave me his number and i think he got mine ivans brows rose welcome to the club i can count the number of people who have that access without even taking both boots off was miles one of them of course chapter fourteen ivan apparently acting under ordersfrom the countess was marks first guesstook him out to lunch ivan followed a lot of orders mark noticed with a slight twinge of sympathy they went to a place called the caravanserai a stretched walking distance from vorhartung castle mark escaped another groundcar ride with ivan by virtue of the narrowness of the streetsalleysin the ancient district the caravanserai itself was a curious study in barrayaran social evolution its oldest core was cleaned up renovated and converted into a pleasant maze of shops cafes and small museums frequented by a mixture of city workers seeking lunch and obvious provincial tourists come up to the capital to do the historic shrines this transformation had spread from the clusters of old government buildings like vorhartung castle along the river toward the districts center on the fringes to the south the renovation petered out into the kind of shabby faintly dangerous areas that had given the caravanserai its original risky reputation on the way ivan proudly pointed out a building in which he claimed to have been born during the war of vordarians pretendership it was now a shop selling overpriced handwoven carpets and other antique crafts supposedly preserved from the time of isolation from the way ivan carried on mark halfexpected there to be a plaque on the wall commemorating the event but there wasnt he checked after lunch in one of the small cafes ivan his mind now running on his family history was seized with the notion of taking mark to view the spot on the pavement where his father lord padma vorpatril had been murdered by vordarians security forces during that same war feeling it fit in with the general gruesome historic tenor of the rest of the morning mark agreed and they set out again on foot to the south a shift in the architecture from the low tan stucco of the first century of the time of isolation to the high red brick of its last century marked the marches of the caravanserai proper or improper this time by god there was a plaque a cast bronze square set right in the pavement groundcars ran past and over it as ivan gazed down youd think theyd at least have put it on the sidewalk said mark accuracy said ivan mmother insisted mark waited a respectful interval to allow ivan whoknewwhat inward meditations eventually ivan looked up and said brightly dessert i know this great little keroslav district bakery around the corner mother always took me there after when we came here to burn the offering each year its sort of a hole in the wall but good mark had not yet walked down lunch but the place proved as delectable on the inside as it was derelict on the outside and he somehow ended up possessed of a bag of nut rolls and traditional brillberry tarts for later while ivan lingered over a selection of delicacies to be delivered to lady vorpatril and possibly some sweeter negotiation with the pretty countergirlit was hard to tell if ivan was serious or just running on spinal reflexmark stepped outside galen had placed a couple of komarran underground spy contacts in this area once mark remembered doubtless picked up two years ago in the postplot sweep by barrayaran imperial security still he wondered if he could have found them if galens dreams of revenge had ever come real should be one street down and two over ivan was still chatting up the bakery girl mark took a walk he found the address in a couple of minutes to his sufficient satisfaction he decided he didnt need to check inside he turned back and took what looked like a short cut toward the main street and the bakery it proved to be a culdesac he turned again and started for the alleys mouth an old woman and a skinny youth who had been sitting on a stoop and watched him go in now watched him coming out the old womans dull eye lit with a faint hostility as he came again into her shortsighted focus thats no boy thats a mutie she hissed to the youth grandson she nudged him pointedly a mutie come on our street thus prodded the youth slouched to his feet and stepped in front of mark mark stopped the kid was taller than hewho wasntbut not much heavier greasyhaired and pale he spread his legs aggressively blocking marks dodge oh god natives in all their surly glory shouldnt ought to be here mutie he spat in imitationbullymode mark almost laughed youre right he agreed easily he let his accent go midatlantic earth nonbarrayaran this place is a pit offworlder the old woman whined in even sharper disapproval you can take a wormhole jump to hell offworlder i seem to have already mark said dryly bad manners but he was in a bad mood if these slumlouts wanted to bait him he would bait them right back barrayarans if theres anything worse than the vor its the fools under em no wonder galactics despise this place for a hole he was surprised at how easily the suppressed rage vented and how good it felt better not go too far gonna get you mutie the boy promised hovering on the balls of his feet in nervous threat the hag urged her bravo on with a rude gesture at mark a peculiar setup little old ladies and punks were normally natural enemies but these two seemed in it together comrades of the imperium no doubt uniting against a common foe better a mutie than a moron mark intoned with false cordiality the louts brows wrinkled hey is that backchat to me huh do you see any other morons around here at the boys eyeflicker mark looked over his shoulder oh excuse me there are two more i understand your confusion his adrenalin pumped turning his late lunch into a lump of regret in his belly two more youths taller heavier older but only adolescents possibly vicious but untrained still where was ivan now where was that bloody invisible supposed outer perimeter guard on break arent you late for school your remedial drooling class perhaps funny mutie said one of the older ones he wasnt laughing the attack was sudden and almost took mark by surprise he thought etiquette demanded they exchange a few more insults first and he was just working up some good ones exhilaration mixed strangely with the anticipation of pain or maybe it was the anticipation of pain that was exhilarating the biggest punk tried to kick him in the groin he caught the foot with one hand and boosted it skyward flipping the kid onto his back on the stones with a wham that knocked the wind out of him the second one launched a blow with his fist mark caught his arm they whirled and the punk found himself stumbling into his skinny companion unfortunately now they both were between mark and the exit they scrambled to their feet looking astonished and outraged what kind of easy pickings had they expected for gods sake easy enough his reflexes were two years stale and he was already getting winded yet the extra weight made him harder to knock off his feet three toone on a crippledlooking fat little lost stranger eh you like those odds come to me baby cannibals the bakery bag was still clutched absurdly in his fist as he grinned and opened his arms in invitation they jumped him both together telegraphing every move the purely defensive katas continued to work charmingly they flowed into and out of his momentumgate to end up both on the ground shaking their heads dizzily victims of their own aggression mark wriggled his jaw which had taken a clumsy blow hard enough to sting and wake him up the next round was not so successful he ended up rolling out of reach finally losing his grip on the bakery bag which promptly got stomped and then one of them caught up with him in a grapple and they took some of their own back pounding unscientific blows of clenched fists he was getting seriously out of breath he planned an armbar and a sprint to the street it might have ended there a good time having been had by all if one of the idiot punks crouching hadnt pulled out a battered old shockstick and jabbed it toward him mark almost killed him instantly with a kick to the neck he pulled his punch barely in time and the blow landed slightly offcenter even through his boot he could feel the tissues crush a sickening sensation richoceting up through his body mark recoiled in horror as the kid lay gurgling on the ground no i wasnt trained to fight i was trained to kill oh shit hed managed not to quite smash the larynx he prayed the kick hadnt snapped a major internal blood vessel the other two assailants paused in shock ivan pounded around the corner what the hell are you doing he cried hoarsely i dont know mark gasped bent over with his hands on his knees his nose was bleeding all over his new shirt in delayed reaction he was beginning to shake they jumped me i baited them why the hell was he doing this it had all happened so fast is the mutie with you soldier the skinny lad demanded in a mixture of surprise and dread mark could see the struggle in ivans face with the urge to disavow all connection with him yes ivan choked out at last the big punk who was still on his feet faded backward turned and ran the skinny kid was glued to the scene by the presence of the injured man and the old woman though he looked like he wanted to run too the hag who had risen and hobbled over to her downed champion screamed accusations and threats at mark she was the only one present who seemed undismayed by the sight of ivans officers greens then the municipal guards arrived once he was sure the injured punk was going to be taken care of mark shut up and let ivan handle it ivan lied like a trooper to keep the name of vorkosigan from ever coming up the municipal guards in turn realizing who ivan was dampened the old womans hysteria and extricated them with speed mark declined to press assault charges even without ivans urgent advice to that effect thirty minutes later they were back in ivans ground car this time ivan drove much more slowly residual terror mark judged from having almost lost his charge where the hell was that outer perimeter guy who was supposed to be my guardian angel mark asked gingerly probing the contusions on his face his nose had finally stopped bleeding ivan hadnt let him in his ground car until it had and hed made sure mark wasnt going to throw up who dyou think called the municipal guards the outer perimeters supposed to be discreet oh his ribs hurt but nothing was broken mark decided unlike his progenitor hed never had a broken bone mutie was did miles have to deal with this kind of crap all hed done to those people was walk past them if miles had been dressed as he was been alone as he was would they have attacked him miles wouldnt have been stupid enough to wander in there by himself in the first place mark frowned hed gained the impression from galen that miless rank made him immune to barrayars mutagenic prejudices did miles actually have to run a constant safetycalculation in his head editing where he could go what he could do and if he had ivan continued hed have talked his way out of it slid on by why the hell did you mix in with three guys if you just want somebody to beat the shit out of you come to me id be glad to mark shrugged uncomfortably is that what hed been secretly seeking punishment was that why things went so bad so fast i thought you all were the great vor why should you have to slide on by cant you just stomp the scum ivan groaned no and am i ever glad im not going to be your permanent bodyguard im glad too if this is a sample of your work mark snarled in return he checked his left canine tooth his gum and lips were puffy but it wasnt actually loose ivan merely growled mark settled back wondering how the kid with the damaged throat was doing the municipal guards had taken him away for treatment mark should not have fought him hed come within a centimeter of killing him he might have killed all three the punks were only little cannibals after all which was why mark realized miles would have talked and slid away not fear and not noblesse oblige but because those people werent up to his weight class mark felt ill barrayarans god help me ivan swung by his apartment which was in a tower in one of the citys better districts not far from the entirely modern government buildings housing the imperial service command headquarters there he allowed mark to wash up and remove the bloodstains from his clothing before his return to vorkosigan house tossing marks shirt back to him from the dryer ivan remarked your torso is going to be piebald tomorrow miles would have been in hospital for the next three weeks over that id have had to cart him out of there on a board mark glanced down at the red blotches just starting to turn purple he was stiffening up all over half a dozen pulled muscles protested their abuse all that he could conceal but his face bore marks that were going to have to be explained telling the count and countess that hed been in a groundcar wreck with ivan would be perfectly believable but he doubted theyd get away with the lie for long in the event ivan did the talking again delivering him back to the countess with a true but absolutely minimized account of marks adventure aw he wandered off and got pushed around a little by the local residents but i caught up with him before anything much could happen bye aunt cordelia mark let him escape without impediment the whole report had certainly caught up with the count and countess by dinner mark sensed the cool faint tension even as he slid into his place at the table opposite elena botharijesek who was back at last from her lengthy and presumably grueling debriefing at impsec hq the count waited until the first course had been served and the human servant had departed the dining room before remarking im glad your learning experience today was not lethal mark mark managed to swallow without gagging and said in a subdued voice for him or me either do you wish a report on your ah victim no yes please the physicians at the municipal hospital expect to release him in two days he will be on a liquid diet for a week he will recover his voice oh good i didnt mean to what was the point of excuses apologies protests none surely i looked into picking up his medical bill privately only to discover that ivan had been in ahead of me upon reflection i decided to let him stand for it oh ought he to offer to repay ivan then did he have any money or any right to any legally morally tomorrow stated the countess elena will be your native guide and pym will accompany you elena looked very much less than thrilled i spoke with gregor count vorkosigan continued you apparently impressed him enough somehow that he has given his approval for my formal presentation of you as my heir house vorkosigans cadet member of the council of counts at a time of my discretion if and when miless death is confirmed obviously this step is still premature im not sure myself whether it would be better to get your confirmation pushed through before the counts get to know you or after they have had time to get used to the idea a swift maneuver hit and run or a long tedious siege for once i think a siege would be better if we won your victory would be far more secure can they reject me mark asked is that a light i see at the end of this tunnel they must accept and approve you by a simple majority vote for you to inherit the countship my personal property is a separate matter normally such approval is routine for the eldest son or lacking a son whatever competent male relative a count may put forward it doesnt even have to be a relative technically though it almost always is there was the famous case of one of the counts vortala back in the time of isolation who had fallen out with his son young lord vortala had allied with his fatherinlaw in the zidiarch trade war vortala disinherited his son and somehow managed to maneuver a rump session of the counts into approving his horse midnight as his heir claimed the horse was just as bright and had never betrayed him what a hopeful precedent for me mark choked how did count midnight do compared to the average count lord midnight alas no one found out the horse predeceased the vortala the war petered out and the son eventually inherited after all but it was one of the zoological high points of the councils varied political history right up there with the infamous incendiary cat plot count vorkosigans eye glinted with a certain skewed enthusiasm relating all this his eye fell on mark and his momentary animation faded weve had several centuries to accumulate any precedent you please from absurdities to horrors and a few sound saving graces the count did not make further inquiries into marks day and mark did not volunteer further details the dinner went down like lead and mark escaped as soon as he decently could he slunk off to the library the long room at the end of one wing of the oldest part of the house the countess had encouraged him to browse there in addition to a reader accessing public data banks and a codelocked and secured government comconsole with its own dedicated comm links the room was lined with bound books printed and even handcalligraphed on paper from the time of isolation the library reminded mark of vorhartung castle with its modern equipment and functions awkwardly stuffed into odd corners of an antique architecture that had never envisioned nor provided place for them as he was thinking about the museum a large folio volume of woodcuts of arms and armor caught his eye and he carefully pulled it from its slipcase and carried it to one of a pair of alcoves flanking the long glass doors to the back garden the alcoves were luxuriously furnished and a little table pulled up to a vast wingchair provided support for the in both senses heavy volume bemused mark leafed through it fifty kinds of swords and knives with every slight variation possessing its own name and names for all the parts as well what an absolutely fractal knowledgebase the kind created by and in turn creating a closedin group such as the vor the librarys door swung open and footsteps sounded across the marble and carpeting it was count vorkosigan mark shrank back in the chair in the alcove drawing his legs up out of sight maybe the man would just take something and go out again mark did not want to get trapped into some intimate chat which this comfortable room so invited he had conquered his initial terror of the count yet the man managed still to make him excruciatingly uncomfortable even without saying a word unfortunately count vorkosigan seated himself at one of the comconsoles reflections of the colored lights of its display flickered on the glass of the windows marks chair faced the longer he waited mark realized lurking like an assassin the more awkward it was going to be to reveal himself so say hello drop the book blow your nose something he was just working up the courage to try a little throatclearing and pagerustling when the door hinges squeaked again and lighter footsteps sounded the countess mark huddled into a ball in the wingchair ah said the count the lights reflecting in the window died away as he shut down the machine in favor of this new diversion and swung around in his station chair did she lean over for some quick embrace fabric whispered as she seated herself well mark is certainly getting a crashcourse about barrayar she remarked effectively spiking marks last frantic impulse to make his presence known its what he needs sighed the count he has twenty years of catching up to do if he is to function must he function i mean instantly no not instantly good i thought you might be setting him an impossible task and as we all know the impossible takes a little longer the count vented a short laugh which faded quickly at least hes had a glimpse of one of our worst social traits we must be sure he gets a thorough grounding in the history of the mutagen disasters so hell understand where the violence is coming from how deeply the agony and the fear are embedded which drive the visible anxieties and ah as you betans would see it bad manners im not sure hell ever be able to duplicate miless native ability to dance through that particular minefield he seems more inclined to plow through it murmured the count dryly and hesitated his appearance miles took enormous pains to move act dress so as to draw attention away from his appearance to make his personality overpower the evidence of the eye a kind of wholebody sleightofhand if you will mark almost seems to be willfully exaggerating it what the surly slump that and i confess i find his weight gain disturbing particularly judging from elenas report its rapidity perhaps we ought to have him medically checked it cant be good for him the countess snorted hes only twentytwo its not an immediate health problem thats not whats bothering you love perhaps not entirely he embarrasses you my bodyconscious barrayaran friend mm the count did not deny this mark noticed score one for his side would you care to clarify that marks actions are a language a language of desperation mostly theyre not always easy to interpret that one is obvious though not to me analyze please its a threepart problem in the first place theres the purely physical side i take it you did not read the medical reports as carefully as i did i read the impsec synopsis i read the raw data all of it when the jacksonian bodysculptors were cutting mark down to match miless height they did not genetically retrofit his metabolism instead they brewed up a concoction of timerelease hormones and stimulants which they injected monthly tinkering with the formula as needed cheaper simpler more controlled in result now take ivan as a phenotypic sample of what miless genotype should have resulted in without the soltoxin poisoning what we have in mark is a man physically reduced to miless height who is genetically programmed for ivans weight and when the komarrans treatments stopped his body again began to try to carry out its genetic destiny if you ever bring yourself to look at him square on youll notice its not just fat his bones and muscles are heavier too compared to miles or even to himself two years ago when he finally reaches his new equilibrium hes probably going to look rather lowslung you mean spherical mark thought listening with horror and intensely conscious of having overeaten at dinner heroically he smothered an incipient belch like a small tank suggested the count evidently entertaining a somewhat more hopeful vision perhaps it depends on the other two aspects of his um bodylanguage which are rebellion and fear as for rebellionall his life other people have made free with his somatic integrity forcibly chosen his bodyshape now at last its his turn and fear of barrayar of us but most of all fear frankly of being overwhelmed by miles who can be pretty overwhelming even if youre not his little brother and marks right its actually been something of a boon the armsmen and servants are having no trouble distinguishing him taking him as lord mark the weight ploy has that sort of halfcocked halfconscious brilliance that reminds me of someone else we both know but where does it stop the count was now picturing something spherical too mark decided the metabolismwhen he chooses he can march himself to a physician and have it adjusted to maintain any weight he wants hell choose a more average bodytype when he no longer needs rebellion or feels fear the count snorted i know barrayar and its paranoias you can never be safe enough what do we do if he decides he can never be fat enough then we can buy him a float pallet and a couple of muscular bodyservants orwe can help him conquer his fears eh if miles is dead he began if miles is not recovered and revived she corrected sharply then mark is all we have left of miles no her skirts rustled as she rose stepped turned paced god dont let her walk over this way thats where you take the wrong turn aral mark is all we have left of mark the count hesitated all right i concede the point but if mark is all we havedo we have the next count vorkosigan can you accept him as your son even if he isnt the next count vorkosigan or is that the test he has to pass to get in the count was silent the countesss voice went low do i hear an echo of your fathers voice in yours is that him i see looking out from behind your eyes it is impossible that he not he there the counts voice was equally low disturbed but defiant of apology on some level despite it all i yes i understand im sorry she sat again to marks frozen relief although surely it isnt that hard to qualify as a count of barrayar look at some of the odd ducks who sit on the council now or fail to show up in some cases how long did you say its been since count vortienne cast a vote his son is old enough to hold down his desk now said the count to the great relief of the rest of us the last time we had to have a unanimous vote the chambers sergeantatarms had to go collect him bodily from his residence out of the most extraordinary scene of well he finds some unique uses for his personal guard unique qualifications too i understand there was a grin in countess cordelias voice where did you learn that alys vorpatril im not even going to ask how she knows wise of you but the point is mark would really have to work at it to be the worst count on the council they are not so elite as they pretend vortienne is an unfairly horrible example its only because of the extraordinary dedication of so many of the counts that the council functions at all it consumes men butthe counts are only half the battle the sharper edge of the sword is the district itself would the people accept him the disturbed clone of the deformed original they came to accept miles theyve even grown rather proud of him i think butmiles creates that himself he radiates enough loyalty they cant help but reflect some of it back im not sure what mark radiates mused the count he seems more of a human black hole light goes in nothing comes out give him time hes still afraid of you guilt projection i think from having been your intended assassin all these years mark breathing through his mouth for silence cringed did the damned woman have xray vision she was a most unnerving ally if ally she was ivan said the count slowly would certainly have no trouble with popularity in the district and however reluctantly i think he would rise to the challenge of the countship neither the worst nor the best but at least average thats exactly the system hes used to slide through his schooling the imperial service academy and his career so far the invisible average man said the countess its frustrating to watch hes capable of so much more standing as close to the imperium as he does how brightly does he dare shine hed attract wouldbe conspirators the way a searchlight attracts bugs looking for a figurehead for their faction and a handsome figurehead hed make he only plays the fool he may in fact be the least foolish one among us its an optimistic theory but if ivan is so calculating how can he have been like this since he could walk the count asked plaintively youd make of him a fiendishly machiavellian fiveyearold dear captain i dont insist on the interpretation said the countess comfortably the point is if mark were to choose a life on say beta colony barrayar would contrive to limp along somehow even your district would probably survive and mark would not be one iota less our son but i wanted to leave so much more you keep coming back to that idea beta colony yes do you wonder why no his voice grew smaller but if you take him away to beta colony ill never get a chance to know him the countess was silent then her voice grew firmer id be more impressed by that complaint if you showed any signs of wanting to get to know him now youve been avoiding him almost as assiduously as hes been ducking you i cannot stop all government business for this personal crisis said the count stiffly as much as i might like to you did for miles as i recall think back on all the time you spent with him here at vorkosigan surleau you stole time like a thief to give to him snatches here and there an hour a morning a day whatever you could arrange all the while carrying the regency at a dead run through about six major political and military crises you cannot deny mark the advantages you gave miles and then turn around and decry his failure to outperform miles oh cordelia the count sighed i was younger then im not the da miles had twenty years ago that man is gone burned up i dont ask that you try to be the da you were then that would be ludicrous mark is no child i only ask that you try to be the father you are now dear captain his voice trailed off in exhaustion after a thoughtful silence the countess said pointedly youd have more time and energy if you retired gave up the prime ministership at long last now cordelia think i dare not lose control now as prime minister illyan and impsec still report to me if i step down to a mere countship i am out of that chain of command ill lose the very power to prosecute the search nonsense miles is an impsec officer son of the prime minister or not theyll hunt for him just the same loyalty to their own is one of impsecs few charms theyll search to the limits of reason only as prime minister can i compel them to go beyond reason i think not i think simon illyan would still turn himself inside out for you after you were dead and buried love when the count spoke again at last his voice was weary i was ready to step down three years ago and hand it off to quintillan yes i was all excited if only he hadnt been killed in that stupid flyer accident such a pointless tragedy it wasnt even an assassination the countess laughed blackly at him a truly wasted death by barrayaran standards but seriously its time to stop past time the count agreed let go as soon as its safe she paused you will never be fat enough love let go anyway mark sat bent over paralyzed one leg gone pins and needles he felt plowed and harrowed more thoroughly worked over than by the three thugs in the alley the countess was a scientific fighter there was no doubt the count halflaughed but this time he made no reply to marks enormous relief they both rose and exited the library together as soon as the door shut he rolled out of the wingchair onto the floor moving his aching arms and legs and trying to restore circulation he was shaking and shivering his throat was clogged and he coughed at last over and over blessedly to clear his breathing he didnt know whether to laugh or cry felt like doing both at once and settled for wheezing watching his belly rise and fall he felt obese he felt insane he felt as if his skin had gone transparent and passersby could look and point to every private organ what he did not feel he realized as he caught his breath again after the coughing jag was afraid not of the count and countess anyway their public faces and their privates ones were unexpectedly congruent it seemed he could trust them not so much not to hurt him but to be what they were what they appeared he could not at first put a word to it this sense of personal unity then it came to him oh so thats what integrity looks like i didnt know chapter fifteen the countess kept her promise or threat to send mark touring with elena the ensuing few weeks were punctuated by frequent excursions all over vorbarr sultana and the neighboring districts slanted heavily to the cultural and historical including a private tour of the imperial residence gregor was not at home that day to marks relief they must have hit every museum in town elena presumably acting under orders also dragged him over what must have been two dozen colleges academies and technical schools mark was heartened to learn that not every institution on the planet trained military officers indeed the largest and busiest school in the capital was the vorbarra district agricultural and engineering institute elena remained a formal and impersonal factotum in marks presence whatever her own feelings upon seeing her old home for the first time in a decade they seldom escaped the ivory mask except for an occasional exclamation of surprise at some unexpected change new buildings sprouted old blocks leveled streets rerouted mark suspected that the frenetic pace of the tours was just so she wouldnt have to actually talk to him she filled the silences instead with lectures mark began to wish hed buttered up ivan more maybe his cousin could have sneaked him out to go pubcrawling just for a change change came one evening when the count returned abruptly to vorkosigan house and announced that they were all going to vorkosigan surleau within an hour mark found himself and his things packed into a lightflyer along with elena count vorkosigan and armsman pym arrowing south in the dark to the vorkosigans summer residence the countess did not accompany them the conversation en route ranged from stilted to nonexistent except for an occasional laconic code between the count and pym all halfsentences the dendarii mountain range loomed up at last a dark blot against cloud shadows and stars they circled a dimly glimmering lake to land halfway up a hill in front of a rambling stone house lit up and made welcoming by yet more human servants the prime ministers impsec guards were discreet shapes exiting a second lightflyer in their wake since it was nearing midnight the count limited himself to giving mark a brief orienting tour of the interior of the house and depositing him in a secondfloor guest bedroom with a view downslope to the lake mark alone at last leaned on the windowsill and stared into the darkness lights shimmered across the black silken waters from the village at the end of the lake and from a few isolated estates on the farther shore why have you brought me here he thought to the count vorkosigan surleau was the most private of the vorkosigans several residences the guarded emotional heart of the counts scattered personal realm had he passed some test to be let in here or was vorkosigan surleau itself to be a test he went to bed and fell asleep still wondering he woke blinking with morning sun slanting through the window hed failed to reshutter the night before some servant last night had arranged a selection of his more casual clothing in the rooms closet he found a bathroom down the hall washed dressed and went in cautious search of humanity a housekeeper in the kitchen directed him outside to find the count without alas offering to feed him breakfast he walked along a path paved with stone chips toward a grove of carefullyplanted earthimport trees their distinctive green leaves mottled and gilded by the beginnings of autumn color change big trees very old the count and elena were near the grove in a walled garden that served now as the vorkosigan family cemetery the stone residence had originally been a guard barracks serving the nowruined castle at the lakes foot its cemetery had once received the guardsmens last standdowns marks brows rose the count was a violent splash of color in his most formal military uniform imperial parade redandblues elena was equally if more quietly decorous in dendarii dressgrey velvet set off with silver buttons and white piping she squatted beside a shallow bronze brazier on a tripod little pale orange flames flickered in it and smoke rose to wisp away in the goldmisted morning air they were burning a deathoffering mark realized and paused uncertainly by the wroughtiron gate in the low stone wall whose nobody had invited him elena rose she and the count spoke quietly together while the offering whatever it was burned to ash after a moment elena folded a cloth into a pad picked the brazier off its tripod and tapped out the gray and white flakes over the grave she wiped out the bronze basin and returned it and its folding tripod to an embroidered brown and silver bag the count gazed over the lake noticed mark standing by the gate and gave him an acknowledging nod it did not exactly invite him in but neither did it rebuff him with another word to the count elena exited the walled garden the count saluted her she favored mark with a courteous nod in passing her face was solemn but mark fancied less tense and masklike than he had seen since their coming to barrayar now the count definitely waved mark inside feeling awkward but curious mark let himself in through the gate and crunched over the gravel walks to his side whats up mark finally managed to ask it came out sounding too flippant but the count did not seem to take it in bad part count vorkosigan nodded to the grave at their feet sergeant constantine bothari and the dates fidelis i found that elena had never burned a deathoffering for her father he was my armsman for eighteen years and had served under me in the space forces before that miless bodyguard i knew that but he was killed before galen started training me galen didnt spend much time on him he should have sergeant bothari was very important to miles and to us all bothari was a difficult man i dont think elena ever was quite reconciled to that shes needed to come to some acceptance of him to be easy with herself difficult criminal id heard that is very the count hesitated unjust mark expected him to add or untrue but the word he finally chose was incomplete they walked around among the graves the count giving mark a tour relatives and retainers who was major amor klyeuvi it reminded mark of all those museums the vorkosigan family history since the time of isolation encapsulated the history of barrayar the count pointed out his father mother brother sister and his vorkosigan grandparents presumably anyone dying prior to their dates had been buried at the old district capital of vorkosigan vashnoi and been melted down along with the city by the cetagandan invaders i mean to be buried here commented the count looking over the peaceful lake and the hills beyond the morning mist was clearing off the surface sunsparkle starting to glitter through avoid that crowd at the imperial cemetery in vorbarr sultana they wanted to bury my poor father there i actually had to argue with them over that despite the declaration of his will he nodded to the stone general count piotr pierre vorkosigan and the dates the count had won the argument apparently the counts some of the happiest periods of my life were spent here when i was small and later my wedding and honeymoon a twisted smile flitted across his features miles was conceived here therefore in a sense so were you look around this is where you came from after breakfast and i change clothes ill show you more ah so uh no ones eaten yet you fast before burning a deathoffering they often tend to be dawn events for just that reason i suspect the count halfsmiled the count could have had no other use for the glorious parade uniform here nor elena her dendarii greys theyd packed them along for that dedicated purpose mark glanced at the dark distorted reflection of himself in the counts mirrorpolished boots the convex surface widened him to grotesque proportions his future self is that what we all came down here for then so that elena could do this ceremony among other things ominous mark followed the count back to the big stone house feeling obscurely unsettled breakfast was served by the housekeeper on a sunny patio off the end of the house made private by landscaping and flowering bushes except for a view cut through to the lake the count reappeared wearing old black fatigue trousers and a backcountry style tunic loosecut and belted elena did not join them she wanted to take a long walk explained the count briefly so shall we prudently mark returned a third sweet roll to its covered basket he was glad for his restraint very shortly as the count led him directly up the hill they crested it and paused to recover the view of the long lake winding between the hills was very fine and worth the breath on the other side a little valley flattened out cradling old stone stables and pastures cultivated to earthgreen grasses some unemployedlooking horses idled around the pasture the count led mark down to the fence and leaned on it looking pensive that big roan over there is miless horse hes been rather neglected of late years miles didnt always get time to ride even when he was home he used to come running when miles called it was the damndest thing to see that big lazy horse get up and come running the count paused you might try it what call the horse id be curious to see if the horse can tell the difference your voices are very like to my ear i was drilled on that his name is uh ninny at marks look he added a sort of pet or stable name its name is fat ninny you edited it ha so what do i do stand here and yell here ninny ninny he felt a fool already three times what miles always repeated the name three times the horse was standing across the pasture its ears up looking at them mark took a deep breath and in his best barrayaran accent called here ninny ninny ninny here ninny ninny ninny the horse snorted and trotted over to the fence it didnt exactly run though it did kick up its heels once bouncing en route it arrived with a huff that sprayed horse moisture across both mark and the count it leaned against the fence which groaned and bent up close it was bloody huge it stuck its big head over the fence mark ducked back hastily hello old boy the count patted its neck miles always gives him sugar he advised mark over his shoulder no wonder it comes running then said mark indignantly and hed thought it was the ilovenaismith effect yes but cordelia and i give him sugar too and he doesnt come running for us he just sort of ambles around in his own good time the horse was staring at him in mark swore utter bewilderment yet another soul he had betrayed by not being miles the other two horses in some sort of sibling rivalry now arrived also a massive jostling crowd determined not to miss out intimidated mark asked plaintively did you bring any sugar well yes said the count he drew half a dozen white cubes from his pocket and handed them to mark cautiously mark put a couple into his palm and held it out as far as his arm would reach with a squeal ninny laid his ears back and snapped from side to side driving off his equine rivals then demurely pricked them forward again and grubbed up the sugar with big rubbery lips leaving a trail of grassgreen slime in marks palm mark wiped some of it off on the fence considered his trouser seam and wiped the rest off on the horses glossy neck an old ridged scar spoiled the fur bumpy under his hand ninny butted him again and mark retreated out of range the count restored order in the mob with a couple of shouts and slaps ah just like barrayaran politics mark thought irreverently and made sure the two laggards received a share of sugar as well he did wipe his palms on his trouser seams afterward quite unselfconsciously would you like to try riding him the count offered though he hasnt been worked lately hes probably a bit fresh no thank you choked mark some other time maybe ah they walked along the fence ninny trailing them on the other side till its hopes were stopped by the corner it whinnied as they walked away a staggeringly mournful noise marks shoulders hunched as from a blow the count smiled but the attempt must have felt as ghastly as it looked for the smile fell off again immediately he looked back over his shoulder the old fellow is over twenty now getting up there for a horse im beginning to identify with him they were heading toward the woods theres a riding trail it circles around to a spot with a view back toward the house we used to picnic there would you like to see it a hike mark had no heart for a hike but hed already turned down the counts obvious overture about riding the horse he didnt dare refuse him twice the count would think him surly all right no armsmen or impsec bodyguards in sight the count had gone out of his way to create this private time mark cringed in anticipation intimate chat incoming when they reached the woods edge the first fallen leaves rustled and crackled underfoot releasing an organic but pleasant tang but the noise of their feet did not exactly fill the silence the count for all his feigned countrycasualness was stiff and tense offbalance unnerved by him mark blurted the countess is making you do this isnt she not really said the count yes a thoroughly mixed reply and probably true will you ever forgive the bharaputrans for shooting the wrong admiral naismith probably not the counts tone was equable unoffended if it had been reversedif that bharaputran had aimed one short guy to the leftwould impsec be hunting my cryochamber now would miles even have dumped trooper phillipi to put mark in her place since miles would in that case be impsec in the areai fancy the answer is yes murmured the count as i had never met you my own interest would probably have been a little academic your mother would have pushed all the same though he added thoughtfully let us by all means be honest with each other mark said bitterly we cannot possibly build anything that will last on any other basis said the count dryly mark flushed and grunted assent the trail ran first along a stream then cut up over a rise through what was almost a gully or wash paved with loose and sliding rock thankfully it then ran level for a time branching and rebranching through the trees a few little horse jumps made of cut logs and brush were set up deliberately here and there the trails ran around as well as over them optionally why was he certain miles chose to ride over them he had to admit there was something primevally restful about the woods with its patterns of sun and shade tall earth trees and native and imported brush creating an illusion of endless privacy one could imagine that the whole planet was such a peopleless wilderness if one didnt know anything about terraforming they turned onto a wider double track where they could walk side by side the count moistened his lips about that cryochamber marks head came up like the horses had sensing sugar impsec wasnt talking to him the count hadnt been talking to him driven halfcrazy by the information vacuum hed finally broken down and badgered the countess though it made him feel ill to do so but even she could only report negatives impsec now knew over four hundred places the cryochamber was not it was a start four hundred down the rest of the universe to go it was impossible useless futile impsec has found it the count rubbed his face what mark stopped short they got it back hot damn its over where did theywhy didnt you he bit off his words as it came to him that there was probably a very good reason the count hadnt told him at once and he wasnt sure he wanted to hear it the counts face was bleak it was empty oh what a stupid thing to say oh mark felt incredibly stupid just now howi dont understand of all the scenarios hed pictured hed never pictured that empty where the impsec agent found it in the sales inventory of a medical supply company in the hegen hub cleaned and reconditioned are they sure its the right one if the identifications captain quinn and the dendarii gave us are correct it is the agent who is one of our brighter boys simply quietly purchased it its being shipped back by fast courier to impsec headquarters on komarr for a thorough forensic analysis right now not that apparently there is much to analyze but its a lead a break at last the supply company must have recordsimpsec should be able to trace it back toto to what yes and no the record trail breaks one step back from the supply company the independent carrier they bought it from appears to be guilty of receiving stolen property from jacksons whole surely that narrows down the search area mm one must remember that the hegen hub is a hub the possibility that the cryochamber was routed into the cetagandan empire from jacksons whole and back out again via the hegen hub is remote but real no the timing the timing would be tight hut possible illyan has calculated it the timing limits the search area to a mere nine planets seventeen stations and all the ships en route between them the count grimaced i almost wish i was sure we were dealing with a cetagandan plot the ghemlords at least i could trust to know or guess the value of the package the nightmare that makes me despair is that the cryochamber somehow fell into the hands of some jacksonian petty thief who simply dumped the contents in order to resell the equipment we would have paid a ransom a dozen times the value of the cryochamber for the dead body alone for miles preserved and potentially revivablewhatever they asked it drives me mad to think that miles is rotting somewhere by mistake mark pressed his hands to his forehead which was throbbing his neck was so tight it felt like a piece of solid wood no its crazy its too crazy we have both ends of the rope now were only missing the middle it has to be connectable norwoodnorwood was loyal to admiral naismith and smart i met him briefly of course he hadnt planned to be killed but he wouldnt have sent the cryochamber into danger or off at random was he so sure norwood had expected to be able to pick up the cryochamber from its destination within a day at most if it had arrived wherever with some sort of cryptic holdtillcalledfor note attached and then no one had called for it was it reconditioned before or after the hub supply company purchased it before then there has to be some sort of medical facility hidden in the gap somewhere maybe a cryofacility maybe maybe miles was shifted into somebodys permanent storage banks unidentified and destitute on escobar such a charity might be possible but on jacksons whole a most forlorn hope i pray so there are only a finite number of such facilities its checkable impsec is on it now yet only the frozen dead require that much expertise the mere mechanics of cleaning an emptied chamber could be done by any ships sickbay or engineering section an unmarked grave could be harder to locate or maybe no grave just disintegrated like garbage the count stared off into the trees mark bet he wasnt seeing trees mark bet he was seeing the same vision mark was a frozen little body chest blown outyou wouldnt even need a handtractor to lift itshoved carelessly mindlessly into some disposal unit would they even wonder who the little man had been or would it just be a repellent thing to them who was them dammit and how long had the counts mind been running on this same wheel of thought and how the devil was it that he could still walk and talk at the same time how long have you known this the report came in yesterday afternoon so you see it becomes measurably more important that i know where you stand in relation to barrayar he started again up the trail then took a side branch that narrowed and began to rise steeply through an area of taller trees and thinner brush mark toiled on his heels nobody in their right mind would stand in relation to barrayar they would run in relation to barrayar away the count grinned over his shoulder youve been talking too much to cordelia i fear yes well shes about the only person here who will talk to me he caught up with the count who had slowed the count grimaced painfully thats been true he paced up the steep stony trail im sorry after a few more steps he added with a flash of dark humor i wonder if the risks i used to take did this to my father he is nobly avenged if so more darkness than humor mark gauged but its more than ever necessary to know the count stopped and sat down abruptly by the side of the trail his back to a tree thats strange he murmured his face which had been flushed and moist with the hillclimb and the mornings growing warmth was suddenly pale and moist what said mark cautiously panting he rested his hands on his knees and stared at the man so oddly reduced to his eye level the count had a distracted absorbed look on his face i think i had better rest a moment suits me mark sat too on a nearby rock the count did not continue the conversation at once extreme unease tightened marks stomach whats wrong with him theres something wrong with him oh shit the sky had grown blue and fine and a little breeze made the trees sigh and a few more golden leaves flutter down the cold chill up marks spine had nothing to do with the weather it is not said the count in a distant academic tone a perforated ulcer ive had one of those and this isnt the same he crossed his arms over his chest his breath was becoming shallow and rapid not recovering its rhythm with sitting as marks was something very wrong a brave man trying hard not to look scared was mark decided one of the most frightening sights hed ever seen brave but not stupid the count did not for example choose to pretend that nothing was the matter and go charging up the trail to prove it you dont look well i dont feel well what do you feel er chest pain im afraid he admitted in obvious embarrassment more of an ache really a very odd sensation came up between one step and the next it couldnt be indigestion could it like the kind that was boiling up acidly in marks belly right now im afraid not maybe you had better call for help on your comm link mark suggested diffidently there sure as hell wasnt anything he could do if this was the medical emergency it looked like the count laughed a dry wheeze it was not a comforting sound i left it what youre the frigging prime minister you cant go around without i wanted to assure an uninterrupted private conversation for a change unpunctuated by half the underministers in vorbarr sultana calling up to ask me where they left their agendas i used to do that for miles sometimes when it got too thick drove everyone crazy but eventually they became reconciled his voice went high and light on the last word he lay back altogether in the detritus and fallen leaves no thats no improvement he extended a hand and mark his own heart lumping with terror pulled him back into the sitting position a paralyzing toxin heart failure i was to get alone with you i was to wait in your sight for twenty minutes while you died how had he made this happen black magic maybe he was programmed and part of him was doing things the rest of him didnt know anything about like one of those split personalities did i do this oh god oh shit the count managed a pallid grin dont look so scared boy he whispered just go back to the house and get my guardsmen its not that far i promise i wont move a hoarse chuckle wasnt paying any attention to the paths on the way up i was following you could he possibly carry no mark was no medtech but he had a clear cold feeling that it would be a very bad idea to try to move this man even with his new girth he was heavily outweighed by the count all right there hadnt been that many possible wrong turns had there you you dont you dare die on me godammit not now mark turned and trotted skidded and flat ran back down the path right or left left down the double track where the hell had they turned on to it though theyd pushed through some brushthere was brush all along it and half a dozen openings there was one of those horsejumps theyd passed or was it a lot of them looked alike im going to get lost in this frigging woods and run around in circles for twenty minutes till hes braindead and rigorstiff andtheyre all going to think i did it on purpose he tripped and bounced off a tree and scrambled for balance and direction he felt like a dog in a drama running for help when he arrived all hed be able to do would be bark and whine and roll on his back and no one would understand he clung to a tree gasping and staring around wasnt moss supposed to grow on the north side of trees or was that only on earth these were earth trees mostly on jacksons whole a sort of slimy lichen grew on the south sides of everything including buildings and you had to scrape it out of the door grooves ah there was the creek but had they walked up or down stream stupid stupid stupid a stitch had started in his side he turned left and ran hallelujah a tall female shape was striding down the path ahead of him elena heading back to the barn not only was he on the right path hed found help he tried to shout it came out a croak but it caught her attention she looked over her shoulder saw him and stopped he staggered up to her what the hells got into you her initial coldness and irritation gave way to curiosity and nascent alarm mark gasped out the count took sick in the woods can you get his guardsmen up there her brows drew down in deep suspicion sick how he was just fine an hour ago real sick pleasedammit hurry what did you do she began but his palpable agony overcame her wariness theres a comm link in the stable its closest where did you leave him mark waved vaguely backward somewhere i dont know what you call it on the path to your picnic spot does that make sense dont the bloody impsec guards have scanners he found he was practically stamping his feet in frustration at her slowness you have longer legs go she believed at last and ran with a blazing look back at him that practically flayed his skin i didnt do he turned and began to leg it back to where hed left the count he wondered if he ought to be running for cover instead if he stole a lightflyer and made it back to the capital could he get one of the galactic embassies there to give him political asylum she thinks i theyre all going to think i hell even he didnt trust himself why should the barrayarans maybe he ought to save steps and just kill himself right now here in these stupid woods but he had no weapon and rough as the terrain was there hadnt been any cliffs high and steep enough to fling himself over and be sure of death on impact at first mark thought hed taken another wrong turn surely the count couldnt have risen and walked onno there he was lying down on his back beside a fallen log he was breathing in short labored gasps with toolong pauses in between arms clutched in clearly in much greater pain than when mark had left him but not dead not dead yet hello boy he huffed in greeting elenas bringing help mark promised anxiously he looked up and around and listened but theyre not here yet good dont try to talk this made the count snort a laugh an even more horrible effect against the disrupted breathing only cordelia has ever succeeded in shutting me up but he fell silent after that mark prudently allowed him the last word lest he try to go another round live damn you dont leave me here like this a familiar whooshing sound made mark look up elena had solved the problem of getting transport through the trees with a floatbike a greenuniformed impsec man rode behind her clutching her around the waist elena swiftly dropped the bike through the thinner branches which crackled she ignored the whipping backlash that left red lines across her face the impsec man dismounted while the bike was still half a meter in the air get back he snarled to mark at least he carried a medkit what did you do to him mark retreated to elenas side is he a doctor no just a medic elena was out of breath too the medic looked up and reported its the heart but i dont know what or why dont have the prime ministers doctor come here have him meet us in hassadar without delay i think were going to need the facilities right elena snapped orders into a comm link mark tried to help them get the count temporarily positioned on the float bike propped between elena and the corpsman the medic glared at mark dont touch him the count whom mark had thought halfconscious opened his eyes and whispered hey the boys all right jasi jasi the medic wilted s all right mark hes frigging dying yet hes still thinking ahead hes trying to clear me of suspicion the aircars meeting us in the nearest clearing elena pointed downslope get there if you want to ride along the bike rose slowly and carefully mark took the hint and galloped off down the hill intensely conscious of the moving shadow just above the trees it left him behind he slammed faster using tree trunks to make turns and arrived at the double trail with palms scraped raw just as the impsec medic elena and armsman pym finished laying count vorkosigan across the backseat of the rear compartment of a sleek black aircar mark tumbled in and sat next to elena on the rearfacing seat as the canopy closed and sealed pym took the controls in the front compartment and they spiraled into the air and shot away the medic crouched on the floor by his patient and did logical things like attaching oxygen and administering a hypospray of synergine to stabilize against shock mark was puffing louder than the count to the point that the absorbed corpsman actually glanced up at him with a medical frown but unlike the count mark caught his breath after a time he was sweating and shaking inside the last time hed felt this bad bharaputran security troops had been firing lethal weapons at him are aircars supposed to fly this fast mark prayed they wouldnt suck anything bigger than a bug into the thruster intakes despite the synergine the counts eyes were going shocked and vague he pawed at the little plastic oxygen mask batted away the medics worried attempt to control his hands and motioned urgently to mark he so clearly wanted to say something it was less traumatic to let him than to try and stop him mark slid onto his knees by the counts head the count whispered to mark in a tone of earnest confidence all true wealth is biological the medic glanced wildly at mark for interpretation mark could only shrug helplessly i think hes going out of it the count only tried to speak once more on the hurtling trip he clawed his mask away to say spit which the medic held his head to do a nasty hacking which cleared his throat only temporarily the great mans last words thought mark blackly all that monstrous amazing life dwindled down at the end to spit biological indeed he wrapped his arms around himself and sat in a huddled ball on the floor gnawing absently on his knuckles when they arrived at the landing pad at hassadar district hospital what seemed a small army of medical personnel descended instantly upon them and whisked the count away the corpsman and the armsman were swept up mark and elena were shuttled into a private waiting area where they perforce waited at one point a woman with a report panel in her hand popped in to ask mark are you the nextofkin marks mouth opened and stopped he literally could not reply he was rescued by elena who said countess vorkosigan is flying down from vorbarr sultana she should be here in just a few more minutes it seemed to satisfy the woman who popped out again elena had it right it wasnt another ten minutes before the corridor was enlivened by the clatter of boots the countess swung in trailed by two doubletiming liveried armsmen she flashed past giving mark and elena a quick reassuring smile but blasted on through the double doors without pausing some clueless passing doctor on the other side actually tried to stop her excuse me maam no visitors beyond this point her voice overrode his dont give me that crap kid i own you his protests ended in an apologetic gurgle as he saw the armsmens uniforms and made the correct deduction with a right this way mlady their voices faded into the distance she meant that elena commented to mark with a faint sardonic curl to her lip the medical network in the vorkosigans district has been one of her pet projects half the personnel here are oathsworn to her to serve in exchange for their schooling time ticked by mark wandered to the window and stared out over the vorkosigans district capital hassadar was a new city heir of destroyed vorkosigan vashnoi almost all its building had taken place after the end of the time of isolation mostly in the last thirty years designed around newer methods of transportation than horse carts it was spread out like a city on any other developed galactic world accented by a few skypiercing towers gleaming in the morning sun still only morning it seemed a century since dawn this hospital was indistinguishable from a similar modest one on say escobar the counts official residence here was one of the few entirely modern villas in the vorkosigans household inventory the countess claimed to like it yet they used it only when in hassadar on district business more of a hotel than a home curious the shadows of hassadars towers had shortened toward noon before the countess returned to collect them mark searched her face anxiously as she entered her steps were slow her eyes tired and strained but her mouth was not distorted with grief he knew the count still lived even before she spoke she embraced elena and nodded to mark aral is stabilized theyre going to transfer him to the imperial military hospital in vorbarr sultana his heart is badly damaged our man says a transplant or a mechanical is definitely indicated where were you earlier this morning mark asked her impsec headquarters that was logical she eyed him we divided up the work load it didnt take the both of us to ride the tightbeam decoding room aral did tell you the news didnt he he swore to me he would yes just before he collapsed what were you doing slightly better than the usual what did you do to him haltingly mark tried to describe his morning stress breakfast running up hills the countess mused he set the pace ill bet militarily mark confirmed ha she said darkly was it an occlusion asked elena thats what it looked like no thats why this took me so by surprise i knew his arteries were cleanhe takes a medication for that or his awful diet would have killed him years ago it was an arterial aneurism within the heart muscle burst blood vessel stress eh said mark drymouthed was his blood pressure up her eyes narrowed yes considerably but the vessel was weakened it would have happened sometime soon anyway was there any more word come in from impsec he asked timidly while you were there no she paced to the window and stared unseeing at the web and towers of hassadar mark followed her finding the cryochamber that way was pretty shattering to our hopes at least it finally goaded aral into trying to connect with you pause did he no i dont know he took me around showed me things he tried he was trying so hard it hurt to watch it hurt still a knotted ache somewhere behind his solar plexus the soul dwelt there according to somebodyorothers mythology did it she breathed it was all too much the window was safely shatterproof but his hand was not his souldriven fist bunched drew back and struck the countess caught it with a quick open hand his selfdirected violence smacked into her palm and was deflected save that she advised him coolly chapter sixteen a large mirror in a handcarved frame hung on the wall of the antechamber to the library mark nervous detoured to stand in front of it for one last check before his inspection by the countess the brown and silver vorkosigan cadets uniform did little to conceal the shape of his body old distortions or new though when he stood up very straight he fancied it lent him a certain blunt blockiness unfortunately when he slumped so did the tunic it fit well which was ominous as when it had been delivered eight weeks ago it had been a little loose had some impsec analyst calculated his weight gain against this date he wouldnt put it past them only eight weeks ago it felt like hed been a prisoner here forever a gently held prisoner true like one of those ancient officers who upon giving their oath of parole were allowed the run of the fortress though no one had demanded his word on anything perhaps his word had no currency he abandoned his repellent reflection and trudged on into the library the countess was seated on the silk sofa careful of her long dress which was a highnecked thing in cloudsoft beige netted with ornate copper and silver embroidery which echoed the color of her hair done up in loops on the back of her head not a speck of black or gray or anything that could suggest anticipation of mourning anywhere almost arrogantly elegant were just fine here the ensemble seemed to say and very vorkosigan her head turned at marks entry and her absorbed look melted into a brief spontaneous smile it drew an answering smile from him despite himself you look well she said approvingly so do you he replied and then because it seemed too familiar added maam her brow quirked at the addition but she made no comment he paced to a nearby chair but too keyedup to sit only leaned on its back he suppressed a tendency for his right boot to tap on the marble floor so how do you think theyre going to take this tonight your vor friends well you will certainly rivet their attention she sighed you can count on it she lifted a small brown silk bag with the vorkosigan logo embroidered in silver on it and handed it across to mark it clinked interestingly from the heavy gold coins it held when you present this to gregor in the taxation ceremony tonight as proxy for aral it will serve formal notice to all that we claim you as a legitimate sonand that you accept that claim step one many others to follow and at the end of that paththe countship mark frowned deeply whatever your own feelingswhatever the final outcome of the present crisisdont let them see you shake the countess advised its all in the mind this vor system conviction is contagious so is doubt you consider the vor system an illusion mark asked i used to now i would call it a creation which like any living thing must be continually recreated ive seen the barrayaran system be awkward beautiful corrupt stupid honorable frustrating insane and breathtaking its gets most of the work of government done most of the time which is about average for any system so do you approve of it or not he asked puzzled im not sure my approval matters the imperium is like a very large and disjointed symphony composed by a committee over a threehundred year period played by a gang of amateur volunteers it has enormous inertia and is fundamentally fragile it is neither unchanging nor unchangeable it can crush you like a blind elephant what a heartening thought she smiled we arent plunging you into total strangeness tonight ivan and your aunt alys will be there and young lord and lady vortala and the others youve met here in the past few weeks fruit of the excruciating private dinner parties from before the counts collapse there had been a select parade of visitors to vorkosigan house to meet him countess cordelia had determinedly continued the process despite the weekold medical crisis in preparation for this night i expect everyone will be trolling for inside information on arals condition she added what should i tell em flat truth is always easiest to keep track of aral is at impmil awaiting a heart to be grown for transplant and being a very bad patient his physician is threatening alternately to tie him to his bed or resign if he doesnt behave you dont need to go into all the medical details details that would reveal just how badly damaged the prime minister was quite what if they ask me about miles sooner or later she took a breath if impsec doesnt find the body sooner or later there must be a formal declaration of death while aral lives i would rather it be later no one outside of the highest echelons of impsec emperor gregor and a few government officials know miles is anything but an impsec courier officer of modest rank it is a perfectly true statement that he is away on duty most who inquire after him will be willing to accept that impsec hasnt confided to you where they sent him or for how long galen once said mark began and stopped the countess gave him a level look is galen much on your mind tonight somewhat mark admitted he trained me for this too we did all the major ceremonies of the imperium because he didnt know in advance just what time of year hed drop me in the emperors birthday the midsummer review winterfairall of em i cant do this and not think of him and how much he hated the imperium he had his reasons he said admiral vorkosigan was a murderer the countess sighed and sat back yes was he youve had a chance to observe him for yourself what do you think lady im a murderer and i cant tell her eyes narrowed justly put well his military career was long and complexand bloodyand a matter of public record but i imagine galens main focus was the solstice massacre in which his sister rebecca died mark nodded mutely the barrayaran expeditions political officer not aral ordered that atrocious event aral executed him for it with his own hands when he found out without the formality of a court martial unfortunately so he evades one charge but not the other so yes he is a murderer galen said it was to cover up the evidence thered been a verbal order and only the political officer knew it so how could galen know it aral says otherwise i believe aral galen said he was a torturer no said the countess flatly that was ges vorrutyer and prince serg their faction is now extinct she smiled a thin sharp smile a madman no one on barrayar is sane by betan standards she gave him an amused look not even you and me especially not me he took a small breath a sodomite she tilted her head does that matter to you it was prominent in galens conditioning of me i know you do dammit was he glass to these people a feeliedrama for their amusement except the countess didnt seem amused an impsec report no doubt he said bitterly they fastpentad one of galens surviving subordinates a man named lars if that means anything to you it does he gritted his teeth not a chance at human dignity not one shred left to him aside from galen does arals private orientation matter to you i dont know truth matters so it does well in truth i judge him to be bisexual but subconsciously more attracted to men than to women or ratherto soldiers not to men generally i dont think i am by barrayaran standards a rather extreme er tomboy and thus became the solution to his dilemmas the first time he met me i was in uniform in the middle of a nasty armed encounter he thought it was love at first sight ive never bothered explaining to him that it was his compulsions leaping up her lips twitched why not or were your compulsions leaping up too no it took me oh four or five more days to come completely unglued well three days anyway her eyes were alight with memory i wish you could have seen him then in his forties at the top of his form mark had overheard himself verbally dissected by the countess too in this very library there was something weirdly consoling in the knowledge that her scalpel was not reserved for him alone its not just me she does this to everybody argh youre very blunt maam what did miles think of this she frowned thoughtfully hes never asked me anything its possible that unhappy period in arals youth has come to miless ears only as the garbled slander of arals political enemies and been discounted why tell me you asked you are an adult and you have a greater need to know because of galen if things are ever to be square between you and aral your view of him should be neither falsely exalted nor falsely low aral is a great man i a betan say this but i dont confuse greatness with perfection to be great anyhow is the higher achievement she gave him a crooked smile it should give you hope eh huh block me from escape you mean are you saying that no matter how screwed up i was youd still expect me to work wonders appalling she considered this yes she said serenely in fact since no one is perfect it follows that all great deeds have been accomplished out of imperfection yet they were accomplished somehow all the same it wasnt just his father who had made miles crazy mark decided ive never heard you analyze yourself maam he said sourly yes who shaved the barber me she smiled bleakly im a fool boy she evaded the question or did she a fool for love he said lightly in an effort to escape the sudden awkwardness his question had created and other things her eyes were wintry a wet foggy dusk was gathering to cloak the city as the countess and mark were conveyed to the imperial residence the splendidly liveried and painfully neat pym drove the groundcar another halfdozen of the counts armsmen accompanied them in another vehicle more as honor guards than bodyguards mark sensed they seemed to be looking forward to the party at some comment of his to the countess she remarked yes this is more of a night off for them than usual impsec will have the residence sewn up there is a whole parallel subsociety of servants at these thingsand its not been totally unknown for an armsman of address to catch the eye of some junior vor bud and marry upward if his military background is good enough they arrived at the imperial pile which was architecturally reminiscent of vorkosigan house multiplied by a factor of eight they hurried out of the clinging fog into the warm brilliantlylit interior mark found the countess formally attached to his left arm which was both alarming and reassuring was he escort or appendage in either case he sucked in his stomach and straightened his spine as much as he could mark was startled when the first person they met in the vestibule was simon illyan the security chief was dressed for the occasion in imperial parade redandblues which did not exactly render his slight form inconspicuous though perhaps there were enough other redandblues present for him to blend in except that illyan wore real lethal weapons at his hip a plasma arc and a nerve disrupter in usedlooking holsters and not the blunted dual dress sword sets of the vor officers an oversized earbug glittered in his right ear milady illyan nodded and drew them aside when you saw him this afternoon he said in a low voice to the countess how was he no need to specify who he was in this context the countess glanced around to be sure they were out of earshot of casual passersby not good simon his colors bad hes very edemic and he tends to drift in and out of focus which i find more frightening than all the rest put together the surgeon wants to spare him the double stress of having a mechanical heart installed while theyre waiting to bring the organic one up to size but they may not be able to wait he could end up in surgery for that at any moment should i see him or not in your estimation not the minute you walk in the door hell sit up and try to do business and the stress of trying will be as nothing compared to the stress of failing that would agitate the hell out of him she paused unless you just popped in for a moment to say convey a bit of good news illyan shook his head in frustration sorry since the countess did not speak again immediately into the silence that followed mark dared to say i thought you were on komarr sir i had to come back for this the emperors birthday dinner is the security nightmare of the year one bomb could take out practically the whole damned government as you well know i was en route when the news of arals illness reached me if it would have made my fast courier go any faster i would have gotten out and pushed so whats happening on komarr whos supervising the uh search a trusted subordinate now that it appears we may be searching only for a body illyan glanced at the countess and cut himself off she frowned grayly theyre dropping the priority of the search mark took a disturbed breath so how many agents do you have searching jacksons whole as many as can be spared this new crisis a jerk of illyans head indicated count vorkosigans dangerous illness is straining my resources do you have any idea how much unhealthy excitement the prime ministers condition is going to create on cetaganda alone how many his voice went sharp and too loud but the countess at least made no motion to quiet him she watched with cool interest lord mark you are not yet in a position to request and require an audit of impsecs most secret dispositions not yet not ever surely request only sir but you cant pretend that this operation is not my business illyan gave him an ambiguous noncommittal nod he touched his earbug looked abstracted for a moment and gave the countess a parting salute you must excuse me milady have fun you too his grimace echoed the irony of her smile mark found himself escorting the countess up a wide staircase and into a long reception room lined with mirrors on one side and tall windows on the other a major domo at the wideflung doors announced them by title and name in an amplified voice marks first impression was of a faceless ominous blur of colorful forms like a garden of carnivorous flowers a rainbow of vor house uniforms heavily sprinkled with parade redandblues actually outshone the splendid dresses of the ladies most of the people stood in small changing groups talking in a babble a few sat in spindly chairs along the walls creating their own little courts servants moved smoothly among them offering trays of food and drink mostly servants all those extremely physicallyfit young men in the uniform of the residences staff were surely impsec agents the toughlooking older men in the vorbarra livery who manned the exits were the emperors personal armsmen it was only his paranoia mark decided that made it seem as if all heads turned toward him and a wave of silence crossed the crowd at their entry but a few heads did turn and a few nearby conversations did stop one was ivan vorpatril and his mother lady alys vorpatril she waved countess vorkosigan over to them at once cordelia dear lady vorpatril gave her a worried smile you must bring me up to date people are asking yes well you know the drill the countess sighed lady vorpatril nodded wryly she turned her head to direct ivan evidently continuing the conversation the vorkosigan entrance had interrupted do make yourself pleasant to the vorsoisson girl this evening if the opportunity arises shes violetta vorsoissons younger sister perhaps youll like her better and cassia vorgorov is here this is her first time at the emperors birthday and irene vortashpula do get in at least one dance with her later i promised her mother really ivan there are so many suitable girls here tonight if only you would apply yourself a little the two older women linked arms to step away effectively shedding mark and ivan from their private conversation a firm nod from countess vorkosigan to ivan placed him on notice that he was on guard duty again recalling the last time mark thought he might prefer the more formidable social protection of the countess what was that all about mark asked ivan a servant passed with a tray of drinks following ivans example mark snagged one too it turned out to be a dry white wine flavored with citrus reasonably pleasant the biennial cattle drive ivan grimaced this and the winterfair ball are where all the high vor heifers are trotted out for inspection this was an aspect of the emperors birthday ceremonies galen had never mentioned mark took a slightly larger gulp of his drink he was beginning to damn galen more for what hed left out than for what and how hed forced mark to learn they wont be looking back at me will they considering some of the toads they do kiss i dont see why not shrugged ivan thank you ivan standing next to ivans tall redandblue glitter he probably did look rather like a squat brown toad he certainly felt like one im out of the running he said firmly dont bet on it there are only sixty counts heirs but a lot more daughters to place hundreds seems like once it gets out what happened to poor damned miles anything could happen you mean i wouldnt have to chase women if i just stood still theyd come to me or at any rate to his name position and money a certain glum cheer came with the thought if that wasnt a contradiction in terms better to be loved for his rank than not to be loved at all the proud fools who proclaimed otherwise had never come so close to starving to death for a human touch as he had it seemed to work that way for miles said ivan an inexplicable tincture of envy in his voice i could never get him to take advantage of it of course he couldnt stand rejection try again was my motto but hed just get all shattered and retreat into his shell for days he wasnt adventurous or maybe he just wasnt greedy tended to stop at the first safe woman he came to first elena and then when that fell through quinn though i suppose i can see why he might stop at quinn ivan knocked back the rest of his wine and exchanged the glass for a full one from a passing tray admiral naismith mark reminded himself was miless alternate personality very possibly ivan did not know everything about his cousin aw hell ivan remarked glancing over his glass rim theres one of the ones on mameres short list being aimed our way so are you chasing women or not asked mark confused theres no point in chasing the ones here its all lookdonttouch no chance by chance in this context mark gathered ivan meant sex like many backward cultures still dependent on biological reproduction instead of the technology of uterine replicators the barrayarans divided sex into two categories licit inside a formal contract where any resultant progeny must be claimed and illicit ie all the rest mark brightened still further was this event then a sexual safetyzone no tension no terror the young woman ivan had spotted was approaching them she wore a long soft pastelgreen dress dark brown hair was wound up on her head in braids and curls with some live flowers woven in so whats wrong with that one whispered mark are you kidding murmured ivan in return cassia vorgorov little shrimp kid with a face like a horse and a figure like a board he broke off as she came within earshot and gave her a polite nod hi cass he kept almost all of the pained boredom out of his voice hello lord ivan she said breathlessly she gave him a starryeyed smile true her face was a little long and her figure slight but mark decided ivan was too picky she had nice skin and pretty eyes well all of the women here had pretty eyes it was the makeup and the heady perfumes she couldnt be more than eighteen her shy smile almost made him want to cry so uselessly focused was it on ivan nobody has ever looked at me like that ivan you are a filthy ingrate are you looking forward to the dance she inquired of ivan transparently encouraging not particularly shrugged ivan its the same every year she wilted her first time here mark bet if there had been stairs mark would have been tempted to kick ivan down them he cleared his throat ivans eye fell on him and lit with inspiration cassie ivan purred have you met my new cousin lord mark vorkosigan yet she seemed to notice him for the first time mark gave her a tentative smile she stared back dubiously no id heard i guess he doesnt look exactly like miles does he no said mark fin not miles how do you do lady cassia belatedly recovering her manners she replied how do you do um lord mark a nervous bob of her head made the flowers shiver why dont you two get acquainted excuse me i have to see a man ivan waved to a redandblue uniformed comrade across the room and slithered away are you looking forward to the dance mark tried hed been so concentrated on remembering all the formal moves of the taxation ceremony and the dinner not to mention a whos who approximately three hundred names long all starting with vor hed hardly given the ensuing dance a thought um sort of her eyes reluctantly abandoned ivans successful retreat touched mark and flicked away do you come here often he managed not to blurt what to say how do you like barrayar no that wouldnt do nice fog werehaving outside tonight inside too give me a cue girl say something anything are you really a clone anything but that yes oh my more silence a lot of people are he observed not here true uh oh her face melted with relief excuse me lord mark i see my mother is calling me she handed off a spasmodic smile like a ransom and turned to hurry toward a vorish dowager on the other side of the room mark had not seen her beckon mark sighed so much for the hopeful theory of the overpowering attraction of rank lady cassia was clearly not anxious to kiss a toad if i were ivan id do handstands for a girl who looked at me like that you look thoughtful observed countess vorkosigan at his elbow he jumped slightly ah hello again yes ivan just introduced me to that girl not a girlfriend i gather yes i was watching the little playlet past alys vorpatrils shoulder i stood so as to keep her back to it for charitys sake i dont understand ivan she seemed like a nice enough girl to me countess vorkosigan smiled theyre all nice girls thats not the point what is the point you dont see it well maybe when youve had more time to observe alys vorpatril is a truly doting mother but she just cant overcome the temptation to try to micromanage ivans future ivan is too agreeable or too lazy to resist openly so he does whatever she begs of himexcept the one thing she wants above all others which is to settle into a marriage and give her grandchildren personally i think his strategy is wrong if he really wants to take the heat off himself grandchildren would absolutely divert poor alyss attention meanwhile her heart is in her mouth every time he takes a drive i can see that allowed mark i could slap him sometimes for his little game except im not sure hes conscious of it and anyway its threequarters alyss fault mark watched lady vorpatril catch up with ivan down the room checking his evenings progress down the short list already mark feared you seem able to maintain a reasonably handsoff maternal attitude yourself he observed idly that may have been a mistake she murmured he glanced up and quailed inwardly at the deathly desolation he surprised momentarily in the countesss eyes my mouth shit the look twitched away so instantly he didnt even dare apologize not altogether handsoff she said lightly attaching herself to his elbow again come on and ill show you how they crossnet barrayaran style she steered him down the long room there are as you have just seen two agendas being pursued here tonight the countess lectured amiably the political one of the old menan annual renewal of the forms of the vorand the genetic agenda of the old women the men imagine theirs is the only one but thats just an egoserving selfdelusion the whole vor system is founded on the womens game underneath the old men in government councils spend their lives arguing against or scheming to fund this or that bit of offplanet military hardware meanwhile the uterine replicator is creeping in past their guard and they arent even conscious that the debate that will fundamentally alter barrayars future is being carried on right now among their wives and daughters to use it or not to use it too late to keep it out its already here the middle classes are picking it up in droves every mother who loves her daughter is pressing for it to spare her the physical dangers of biological childbearing theyre fighting not the old men who havent got a clue but an old guard of their sisters who say to their daughters in effect we had to suffer so must you look around tonight mark youre witnessing the last generation of men and women on barrayar who will dance this dance in the old way the vor system is about to change on its blindest side the side that looks toor fails to look toits foundation another half generation from now its not going to know what hit it mark almost swore her calm academic voice concealed a savagely vengeful satisfaction but her expression was as detached as ever a young man in a captains uniform approached them and split a nod of greeting between the countess and mark the major of protocol requests your presence my lord he murmured the statement too seemed to hang indeterminately in the air between them this way please they followed him out of the long reception room and up an ornately carved white marble staircase down a corridor and into an antechamber where half a dozen counts or their official representatives were marshalled beyond a wide archway in the main chamber gregor was surrounded by a small constellation of men mostly in redandblues but three in dark ministers robes the emperor was seated on a plain folding stool even less than a chair i was expecting a throne somehow mark whispered to the countess its a symbol she whispered back and like most symbols inherited its a standardissue military officers camp stool huh then he had to part from her as the major of protocol herded him into his appointed place in line the vorkosigans place this is it he had a moment of utter panic thinking hed somehow mislaid or dropped the bag of gold along the way but it was still looped safely to his tunic he undid the silken cords with sweaty fingers this is a stupid little ceremony why should i be nervous now turn walk forwardhis concentration was nearly shattered by an anonymous whisper from somewhere in the antechamber behind him my god the vorkosigans are really going to do it step up salute kneel on his left knee he proffered the bag righthanded palm correctly up and stuttered out the formal words feeling as if plasma arc beams were boring into his back from the gazes of the waiting witnesses behind him only then did he look up to meet the emperors eyes gregor smiled took the bag and spoke the equally formal words of acceptance he handed the bag aside to the minister of finance in his black velvet robe but then waved the man away so here you are after alllord vorkosigan murmured gregor just lord mark mark pleaded hastily im not lord vorkosigan till miles is is the countesss searing phrase came back to him dead and rotted this doesnt mean anything the count and countess wanted it it didnt seem like the time to give them static thats so gregor smiled sadly thank you for that how are you doing yourself gregor was the first person ever to ask after him instead of the count mark blinked but then gregor could get the real medical bulletins on his prime ministers condition hourly if he wanted them all right i guess he shrugged compared to everybody else anyway mm said gregor you havent used your comm card at marks bewildered look he added gently i didnt give it to you for a souvenir i i havent done you any favors that would allow me to presume upon you sir your family has established a credit account with the imperium of nearly infinite depth you can draw on it you know i havent asked for anything i know honorable but stupid you may fit right in here yet i dont want any favors many new businesses start with borrowed capital they pay it back later with interest i tried that once said mark bitterly i borrowed the dendarii mercenaries and bankrupted myself hm gregors smile twisted he glanced up beyond mark at the throng nodoubt backing up in the antechamber well talk again enjoy your dinner his nod became the emperors formal dismissal mark creaked to his feet saluted properly and withdrew back to where the countess waited for him chapter seventeen at the conclusion of the lengthy and tedious taxation ceremony the residences staff served a banquet to a thousand people spread through several chambers according to rank mark found himself dining just downstream from gregors own table the wine and elaborate food gave him an excuse not to chat much with his neighbors he chewed and sipped as slowly as possible he still managed to end up uncomfortably overfed and dizzy from alcohol poisoning till he noticed the countess was making it through all the toasts by merely wetting her lips he copied her strategy he wished hed noticed sooner but at least he was able to walk and not crawl from the table afterwards and the room only spun a little it could have been worse i could have had to make it through all this while simultaneously pretending to be miles vorkosigan the countess led him to a ballroom with a polished marquetry floor which had been cleared for dancing though no one was dancing yet a live human orchestra all men in imperial service uniforms was arrayed in one corner at the moment only a half dozen of its musicians were playing a sort of preliminary chamber music long doors on one side of the room opened to the cool night air of a promenade mark noted them for future escape purposes it would be an unutterable relief to be alone in the dark right now he was even beginning to miss his cabin back aboard the peregrine do you dance he asked the countess only once tonight the explanation unfolded shortly when emperor gregor appeared and with his usual serious smile led countess vorkosigan out onto the floor to officially open the dance on the musics first repeat other couples began to join them the vor dances seemed to tend to the formal and slow with couples arranged in complex groups rather than couples alone and with far too many precise moves to memorize mark found it vaguely allegorical of how things were done here thus stripped of his escort and protectress mark fled to a side chamber where the volume of the music was filtered to background level buffet tables with yet more food and drink lined one wall for a moment he longingly considered the attraction of anesthetic drinking blurred oblivion right sure get publicly drunk and then no doubt get publicly sick just what the countess needed he was halfway there already instead he retreated to a window embrasure his surly presence seemed enough to claim it against all comers he leaned against the wall in the shadows folded his arms and set himself grimly to endure maybe he could persuade the countess to take him home early after her one dance but she seemed to be working the crowd for all that she appeared relaxed social cheerful he hadnt heard a single word out of her mouth tonight that didnt serve her goals so much selfcontrol in one so secretly strained was almost disturbing his grim mood darkened further as he brooded on the meaning of that empty cryochamber impsec cant be everywhere the countess had once said dammit impsec was supposed to be allseeing that was the intended implication of the sinister silver horuseye insignia on illyans collar was impsecs reputation just propaganda one thing was certain miles hadnt removed himself from that cryochamber whether or not miles was rotted disintegrated or still frozen a witness or witnesses must exist somewhere a thread a string a hook a connection a trail of bloody breadcrumbs something i believe its going to kill me if there isnt there had to be something lord mark said a light voice he raised his eyes from blind contemplation of his boots to find himself facing a lovely cleavage framed in raspberry pink gauze with white lace trim delicate line of collarbone smooth swelling curves and ivory skin made an almost abstract sculpture a tilted topological landscape he imagined himself shrunk to insect size marching across those soft hills and valleys barefoot lord mark she repeated less certainly he tilted his head back hoping the shadows concealed the embarrassed flush in his cheeks and managed at least the courtesy of eye contact i cant help it its my height sorry her face was equally rewarding to the eye electric blue eyes curving lips short loose ashblonde curls wreathed her head as seemed the custom for young women tiny pink flowers were braided into it sacrificing their little vegetable lives for her evenings brief glory however her hair was too short to hold them successfully and several were on the verge of falling out yes it came out sounding too abrupt surly he tried again with a more encouraging lady oh she smiled im not lady anything im kareen koudelka his brow wrinkled are you any relation to commodore clement koudelka a name high on the list of aral vorkosigans senior staff officers galens list of further assassinations if opportunity had presented hes my father she said proudly uh is he here mark asked nervously the smile disappeared in a momentary sigh no he had to go to hq tonight at the last minute ah to be sure it would be a revealing study to count the men who should have been here tonight but werent because of the prime ministers condition if mark were actually the enemy agent hed trained to be in that other lifetime it would be a fast way for him to discover who were the real key men in aral vorkosigans support constellation regardless of what the rosters said you really dont look quite like miles she said studying him with a critical eyehe stiffened but decided sucking in his gut would only draw more attention to ityour bones are heavier it would be a treat to see you two together will he be back soon she does not know he realized with a kind of horror doesnt know miles is dead doesnt know i killed him no he muttered and then masochistically asked were you in love with him too me she laughed i havent a chance i have three older sisters and theyre all taller than i am they call me the dwarf the top of his head was not quite level with the top of her shoulder which meant that she was about average height for a barrayaran woman her sisters must be valkyries just miless style the perfume of her flowers or her skin rocked him in faint delicate waves an agony of despair twisted all the way from his gut to behind his eyes this could have been mine if i hadnt screwed it up this could have been my moment she was friendly open smiling only because she did not know what he had done and suppose he lied suppose he tried suppose he found himself contrary to all reason walking in ivans most drunken dream with this girl and she invited him mountainclimbing like mileswhat then how entertaining would it be for her to watch him choke half to death in all his naked impotence hopeless helpless haplessthe mere anticipation of that pain and humiliation again made his vision darken his shoulders hunched oh for gods sake go away he moaned her blue eyes widened in startled doubt pym warned me you were moody well all right she shrugged and turned tossing her head a couple of the little pink flowers lost their moorings and bounced down spasmodically mark clutched at them wait she turned back still frowning what you dropped some of your flowers he held them out to her in his two cupped hands crushed pink blobs and attempted a smile he was afraid it came out as squashed as the blossoms oh she took them backlong clean steady fingers short undecorated nails not an idle womans handsstared down at the blooms and rolled up her eyes as if unsure how to reattach them she finally stuffed them unceremoniously through a few curls on top of her head out of order of their mates and more precarious than before she began to turn away again say something or youll lose your chance you dont wear your hair long like the others he blurted oh no shed think he was criticizing i dont have time to fool with it unconsciously compelled her fingers raked a couple of curls scattering more luckless vegetation what do you do with your time study mostly the vivacity his rebuff had so brutally suppressed began to leak back into her face countess vorkosigan has promised me if i keep my class standing shell send me to school on beta colony next year the light in her eyes focused to a laserscalpels edge and i can ill show them if miles can do what he does i can do this what do you know about what miles does he asked alarmed he made it through the imperial service academy didnt he her chin rose inspired when everyone said he was too puny and sickly and it was a waste and hed just die young and then after he succeeded they said it was only his fathers favor but he graduated near the top of his class and i dont think his father had anything to do with that she nodded firmly satisfied but they had the dieyoung part right clearly she was not apprised of miless little private army how old are you he asked her eighteenstandard im um twentytwo i know she observed him still interested but more cautious her eye lit with sudden understanding she lowered her voice youre very worried about count aral arent you a most charitable explanation for his rudeness the count my father he echoed that was miless onebreath phrase among other things have you made any friends here i dont quite know ivan gregor his mother were any of them friends exactly ive been too busy making relatives i never had any relatives before either her brows went up nor any friends no it was an odd realization strange and late i cant say as i missed friends i always had more immediate problems still do miles always seems to have a lot of friends im not miles mark snapped stung on the raw spot no it wasnt her fault he was raw all over i can see that she paused as the music began again in the adjoining ballroom would you like to dance i dont know any of your dances thats a mirror dance anybody can do the mirror dance its not hard you just copy everything your partner does he glanced through the archway and thought of the tall doors to the promenade maybemaybe outside why outside you wouldnt be able to see me nobody would be able to see me either a suspicious thought struck him did my mother ask you to do this no lady vorpatril no she laughed why ever should they come on or the music will be over she took him by the hand and towed him determinedly through the archway dribbling a few more flowers in her wake he caught a couple of buds against his tunic with his free hand and slipped them surreptitiously into his trouser pocket help im being kidnapped by an enthusiast there were worse fates a wry halfsmile twitched his lips you dont mind dancing with a toad what something ivan said oh ivan she shrugged a dismissive white shoulder ignore ivan we all do lady cassia you are avenged mark brightened still further to mediumgloomy the mirror dance was going on as described with partners facing each other dipping and swaying and moving along in time to the music the tempo was brisker and less stately than the large group dances and had brought more younger couples out onto the floor feeling hideously conspicuous mark plunged in with kareen and began copying her motions about half a beat behind just as she had promised it took about fifteen seconds to get the hang of it he began to smile a little the older couples were quite grave and elegant but some of the younger ones were more creative one young vor took advantage of a handpass to bait his lady by briefly sticking one finger up his nose and wriggling the rest at her she broke the rule and didnt follow but he mirrored her look of outrage perfectly mark laughed you look quite different when you laugh kareen said sounding startled she cocked her head in bemusement he cocked his head back at her different from what i dont know not so funereal you looked like youd lost your best friend when you were hiding back there in the corner if only you knew she pirouetted he pirouetted he swept her an exaggerated bow looking surprised but pleased she swept one back at him the view was charming ill just have to make you laugh again she decided firmly so perfectly deadpan she proceeded to tell him three dirty jokes in rapid succession he ended up laughing at the absurdity of their juxtaposition with her maidenly airs as much as anything else where did you learn those from my big sisters of course she shrugged he was actually sorry when the music came to an end this time he took the lead and urged her back into the next room for something to drink and then out onto the promenade after the concentration of the dance was over hed become uncomfortably conscious of just how many people were looking at him and it wasnt paranoid dementia this time theyd made a conspicuous couple the beautiful kareen and her vorkosigan toad it was not as dark outside as hed hoped in addition to the lights spilling from the residence windows colored spotlights in the landscaping were diffused by the fog to a gentle general illumination below the stone balustrade the slope was almost woodslike with oldgrowth bushes and trees stonepaved walkways zigzagged down with granite benches inviting lingerers still the night was chilly enough to keep most people inside which helped it was a highly romantic setting to be wasted on him why am i doing this what good was it to bait a hunger that could not feed just looking at her hurt he moved closer anyway more dizzy with her scent than with the wine and the dancing her skin was radiantly warm with the exercise shed light up a sniperscope like a torch morbid thought sex and death seemed too closeconnected somewhere in the bottom of his brain he was afraid everything i touch i destroy i will not touch her he set his glass on the stone railing and shoved his hands deep into his trouser pockets his left fingertips compulsively rotated the little flowers hed secreted there lord mark she said after a sip of wine youre almost a galactic if you were married and going to have children would you want your wife to use a uterine replicator or not why would any couple not choose to use a replicator he asked his head spinning with this sudden new tack in conversation to like prove her love for him good god how barbaric of course not id think it would prove just the opposite that he didnt love her he paused that was a strictly theoretical question wasnt it sort of i mean you dont know anyone whos seriously having this debatenot your sisters or anything he asked in worry not you surely some barbarian needed his head stuck in a bucket of ice water if so and held under for a good long time like till he stopped wriggling oh none of my sisters are married yet though its not for lack of offers but mama and da are holding out its a strategy she confided oh lady cordelia encouraged them after the second of us girls came along there was a period soon after she immigrated here when galactic medicine was really spreading out and there was this pill you could take to choose the sex of your child everyone went crazy for boys for a while the ratios evened up again lately but my sisters and i are right in the middle of the girldrought any man who wont agree in the marriage contract to let his wife use a uterine replicator is having a real hard time getting married right now the gobetweens wont even bother dealing for him she giggled lady cordelias told mama if she plays the game well every one of her grandchildren could be born with a vor in front of their names i see mark blinked is that an ambition of your parents not necessarily kareen shrugged but all else being equal that prefix does give a fellow an edge thats good to know i guess he considered his wine and did not drink ivan came out of one of the ballroom doors saw them both and gave them a friendly wave but kept on going he had not a glass but an entire bottle swinging from his hand and he cast a slightly hunted look back over his shoulder before disappearing down the walkway glancing over the balustrade a few minutes later mark saw the top of his head pass by on a descending path mark took a gulp of his drink then kareen am i possible possible for what she tilted her head and smiled forfor women i mean look at me square on i really do look like a toad all twisted up and if i dont do something about it soon im going to end up as wide as i am short and on top of it all im a clone not to mention the little breathing problem summed up that way hurling himself headfirst over the balustrade seemed a completely logical act it would save so much pain in the long run well thats all true she allowed judiciously dammit woman youre supposed to deny it all to be polite but youre miless clone you have to have his intelligence too do brains make up for all the rest in the female view not to every woman i suppose just to the smart ones youre smart yes but it would be rude of me to say so she raked her curls and grinned how the hell was he to construe that maybe i dont have miless brains he said gloomily maybe the jacksonian bodysculptors stupified me when they were doing all the rest to keep me under control that would explain a lot about my life now there was a morbid new thought to wallow in kareen giggled i dont think so mark he smiled wryly back at her no excuses no quarter now you sound like miles a young woman emerged from the ballroom dressed in some pale blue silky stuff she was athletically trim glowingly blonde and nearly as tall as ivan kareen she waved mama wants us all now delia said kareen sounding quite putout yes she eyed mark with alarmingly keen interest but drawn by whatever daughterly duty swung back inside kareen sighed pushed away from the stonework upon which she had been leaning dusted futilely at a snag in her raspberry gauze and smiled farewell it was nice meeting you lord mark it was nice talking with you too and dancing with you it was true he waved more casually than he felt as she vanished into the warm light of the residence when he was sure she was out of sight he knelt and surreptitiously collected the last of the tiny flowers she had shed and stuffed them into his pocket with the rest she smiled at me not at miles not at admiral naismith me myself mark this was how it could have been if he hadnt bankrupted himself at bharaputras now that he was alone in the dark as he had wished he discovered he didnt much care for it he decided to go find ivan and struck off down the garden walkways unfortunately the paths divided and redivided presumably to more than one destination he passed couples who had taken to the sheltered benches despite the chill and a few other men and women whod just wandered down here for private talks or to cool off which way had ivan gone not this way obviously a little round balcony made a deadend he turned back someone was following him a tall man in redandblues his face was in shadow ivan said mark uncertainly he didnt think it was ivan so youre vorkosigans clowne not ivans voice but his skewed pronunciation made the intended insult very clear mark stood square youve got that straight all right he growled so who in this circus are you the dancing bear a vor i can tell that by the low sloping forehead which vor the hairs were rising on the back of his neck the last time hed felt such exhilaration combined with intense sickness to his stomach had been in the alley in the caravanserai his heart began to pound but hes made no threat yet and hes alone wait offworlder you have no concept of the honor of the vor the man grated none whatsoever mark agreed cheerfully i think youre all insane you are no soldier right again my we are quick tonight i was trained strictly as a lone assassin death in the shadows is a sort of specialty of mine he began counting seconds in his head the man who had started to move forward sagged back again so it seems he hissed youve wasted no time promoting yourself to a countship not very subtle for a trained assassin im not a subtle man he centered his balance but did not move no sudden moves keep bluffing i can tell you this little clowne he gave it the same insulting slur as before if aral vorkosigan dies it wont be you who steps into his place well thats just exactly right purred mark so what are you all hot about vor bore shit this one knows that miles is dead how the hell does he know is he an imp sec insider but no horuseye stared from his collar he bore a ship insignia of some kind which mark could not quite make out activeduty type what to you is one more little spare vor drone living off a family pension in vorbarr sultana i saw a herd of them up there tonight swilling away youre very cocky consider the venue said mark in exasperation youre not going to carry out any death threats here it would embarrass impsec and i dont think you want to annoy simon illyan whoever the hell you are he kept on counting i dont know what hold you think you have on impsec the man began furiously but he was interrupted a smiling servant in the residences livery walked down the path carrying a tray of glasses he was a very physicallyfit young man drinks gentlemen he offered the anonymous vor glowered at him no thank you he turned on his heel and strode off shrubbery whipped in his wake scattering droplets of dew ill take one thanks said mark brightly the servant proffered the tray with a slight bow for his abused stomachs sake mark stuck with the same light wine hed been drinking most of the evening eightyfive seconds your timing is lousy he could have killed me three times over but you interrupted just as the talk was getting interesting how do you fellows pick this stuff out realtime you cant possibly have enough people upstairs to be following every conversation in the building automated keyword searches canape sir blandly the servant turned the tray and offered the other side thank you again who was that proud vor the servant glanced down the nowempty pathway captain edwin vorventa hes on personal leave while his ship is in orbital dock hes not in impsec no my lord oh well tell your boss id like to talk to him at his earliest convenience that would be lord voraronberg the castellans food and beverage manager mark grinned oh sure go away im drunk enough very good my lord not come morning ah one more thing you wouldnt know where i could find ivan vorpatril right now would you the young man stared absently over the balcony a moment as though listening though no earbug showed there is a sort of gazebo at the bottom of the next lefthand turn my lord near a fountain you might try there thank you mark followed his directions through the cool night mist in a stray ray of light fog droplets on his uniform sleeve shone like a cloud across the little silver rivers of the embroidery he soon heard the plash of the fountain a petite stone building no walls just deeply shadowed arches overlooked it it was so quiet in this pocket of the garden he could hear the breathing of the person inside only one person good he wasnt about to diminish his already low popularity still further by interrupting a tryst but it was strangely hoarse ivan there was a long pause he was trying to decide whether to call again or tiptoe off when ivans voice returned an uninviting growl of what i just wondered what you were doing nothing hiding from your mother yeah i ah wont tell her where you are good for you was the sour reply well see you later he turned to go wait he waited puzzled want a drink ivan offered after a long pause uh sure so come get it mark ducked inside and waited for his eyes to adjust the usual stone bench and ivan a seated shadow ivan proffered the gleaming bottle and mark topped up his glass only to find too late that ivan wasnt drinking wine but rather some sort of brandy the accidental cocktail tasted vile he sat down by the steps with his back to a stone post and set his glass aside ivan had dispensed with the formality of a glass are you going to be able to make it back to your ground car asked mark doubtfully dont plan to the residences staff will cart me out in the morning when they pick up the rest of the trash oh his night vision continued to improve he could pick out the glittery bits on ivans uniform and the polished glow of his boots the reflections of his eyes the gleam of wet tracks down his cheeks ivan are you mark bit his tongue on crying and changed it in midsentence to all right i ivan stated firmly have decided to get very drunk i can see that why never have at the emperors birthday its a traditional challenge like getting laid here do people do that sometimes on a dare how entertaining for impsec ivan snorted a laugh yeah there is that so who dared you nobody mark felt he was running out of probing questions faster than ivan was running out of monosyllabic replies but miles and i ivan said in the dark used to work this party together most every year i was surprised how much i missed the little buggers slanderous political commentary this time around used to make me laugh ivan laughed it was a hollow and unfunny noise he stopped abruptly they told you about finding the empty cryochamber didnt they said mark yeah when couple of days ago ive been thinking about it since not good no mark hesitated ivan was shivering in the dark do you want to go home and go to bed i sure do never make it up the hill now shrugged ivan ill give you a hand or a shoulder all right it took some doing but he hoisted ivan to his unsteady feet and they navigated back up the steep garden mark didnt know what charitable impsec guardian angel passed the word but they were met at the top not by ivans mother but by his aunt hes ah mark was not sure what to say ivan peered around blearily so i see said the countess can we spare an armsman to drive him home ivan sagged and marks knees buckled better make it two armsmen yes the countess touched a decorative comm pin on her bodice pym ivan was thus taken off his hands and mark breathed a sigh of relief his relief grew to outright gratitude when the countess commented that it was time for them to quit too in a few minutes pym brought the counts groundcar around to the entrance and the nights ordeal was over the countess didnt talk much for a change in the groundcar going back to vorkosigan house she leaned back against her seat and closed her eyes in exhaustion she didnt even ask him anything in the blackandwhite paved foyer the countess handed off her cloak to a maid and headed left toward the library youll excuse me mark im going to call impmil she looked so tired surely theyd have called you maam if there was any change in the counts condition im going to call impmil she said flatly her eyes were puffy slits go to bed mark he didnt argue with her he trudged wearily up the stairs to his bedroom corridor he paused outside the door to his room it was very late at night the hallway was deserted the silence of the great house pressed on his ears on an impulse he turned back and stepped down the hall to miless room there he paused again in all his weeks on barrayar he had not ventured in here he had not been invited he tried the antique knob the door was not locked hesitantly he entered and keyed up the lights with a word it was a spacious bedchamber given the limits of the houses old architecture an adjoining antechamber once meant for personal servants had long ago been converted to a private bathroom at first glance the room seemed almost stripped bare and neat and clean all the clutter of childhood must have been boxed and put away in an attic in some spasm of maturity he suspected vorkosigan houses attics were astonishing yet a trace of the owners personality remained he walked slowly around the room hands in his pockets like a patron at a museum reasonably enough the few mementos that had been retained tended heavily to reminders of successes miless diploma from the imperial service academy and his officers commission were normal enough though mark wondered why a battered old service issue weather manual was also framed and placed exactly between them a box of old gymkhana awards going back to youth looked like they might be heading for an attic very soon half a wall was devoted to a massive bookdisk and vid collection thousands of titles how many had miles actually read curious he took the handviewer off its hook on the wall nearby and tried three disks at random all had at least a few notes or glosses entered in the marginboxes tracks of miless thought mark gave up the survey and passed on one object he knew personally a cloissonehilted dagger which miles had inherited from old general piotr he dared to take it down and test its heft and edge so when in the past two years had miles stopped carting it around and sensibly began leaving it safely at home he replaced it carefully on the shelf in its sheath one wallhanging was ironic personal and obvious an old metal legbrace crossed militarymuseum fashion with a vor sword halfjoke halfdefiance both obsolete a cheap photonic reproduction of a page from an ancient book was matted and mounted in a wildly expensive silver frame the text was all out of context but appeared to be some sort of prejump religious gibberish all about pilgrims and a hill and a city in the clouds mark wasnt sure what that was all about nobody had ever accused miles of being the religious type yet it was clearly important to him some of these things arent prizes mark realized they are lessons a holovid portfolio box rested on the bedside table mark sat down and activated it he expected elli quinns face but the first videoportrait to come up was of a tall glowering extraordinarily ugly man in vorkosigan armsmens livery sergeant bothari elenas father he keyed through the contents quinn was next then botharijesek his parents of course miless horse ivan gregor after that a parade of faces and forms he keyed through faster and faster not recognizing even a third of the people after the fiftieth face he stopped clicking he rubbed his face wearily hes not a man hes a mob right he sat bent and aching face in his hands elbows on his knees no i am not miles miless comconsole was the secured type in no way junior to the one in the counts library mark walked over and examined it only by eye his hands he shoved back deep into his trouser pockets his fingertips encountered kareen koudelkas crumpled flowerlets he drew them out and spread them on his palm in a spasm of frustration he smashed the blooms with his other hand and threw them to the floor less than a minute later he was on his hands and knees frantically scraping the scattered bits up off the carpet again i think i must be insane he sat on his knees on the floor and began to cry unlike poor ivan no one interrupted his misery for which he was profoundly grateful he sent a mental apology after his vorpatril cousin sorry sorry though odds were even whether ivan would remember anything about his intrusion come the morning he gulped for control of his breath his head aching fiercely ten minutes delay downside at bharaputras had been all the difference if theyd been ten minutes faster the dendarii would have made it back to their drop shuttle before the bharaputrans had a chance to blow it up and all would have unfolded into another future thousands of tenminute intervals had passed in his life unmarked and without effect but that ten minutes had been all it took to transform him from wouldbe hero to permanent scum and he could never recover the moment was that then the commanders gift to recognize those critical minutes out of the mass of like moments even in the chaos of their midst to risk all to grab the golden ones miles had possessed that gift of timing to an extraordinary degree men and women followed him laid all their trust at his feet just for that except once miless timing had failed no hed been screaming his lungs out for them to keep moving miless timing had been shrewd his feet had been fatally slowed by others delays mark climbed up off the floor washed his face in the bathroom and returned and sat in the comconsoles station chair the first layer of secured functions was entered by a palmlock the machine did not quite like his palmprint bone growth and subcutaneous fat deposits were beginning to distort the pattern out of the range of recognition but not wholly not yet on the fourth try it took a reading that pleased it and opened files to him the next layer of functions required codes and accesses he did not know but the top layer had all he needed for now a private if not secured comm channel to impsec impsecs machine bounced him to a human receptionist almost immediately my name is lord mark vorkosigan he told the corporal on nightduty whose face appeared above the vid plate i want to speak with simon illyan i suppose hes still at the imperial residence is this an emergency my lord the corporal asked it is to me growled mark whatever the corporal thought of that he patched mark on through mark insisted his way past two more layers of subordinates before the impsec chiefs tired face materialized mark swallowed captain illyan yes lord mark what is it illyan said wearily it had been a long night for impsec too i had an interesting conversation with a certain captain vorventa earlier this evening i am aware you offered him some nottoooblique threats and mark had assumed that impsec guardservant had been sent to protect him ah well so i have a question for you sir is captain vorventa on the list of people who are supposed to know about miles illyans eyes narrowed no well he does thats very interesting is that helpful for you to know illyan sighed it gives me a new problem to worry about where is the internal leak now ill have to find out butbetter to know than not oh yes can i ask a favor in return maybe illyan looked extremely noncommittal what kind of favor i want in what i want in on impsecs search for miles i want to start by reviewing your reports i suppose after that i dont know but i cant stand being kept alone in the dark any more illyan regarded him suspiciously no he said at last im not turning you loose to romp through my topsecret files thank you good night lord mark wait sir you complained you were understaffed you cant turn down a volunteer what do you imagine you can do that impsec hasnt illyan snapped the point is sirimpsec hasnt you havent found miles i can hardly do less he hadnt put that quite as diplomatically as he should have mark realized as illyans face darkened with anger good night lord mark illyan repeated through his teeth and cut the link with a swipe of his hand mark sat frozen in miless station chair the house was so quiet the loudest sound he could hear was his own blood in his ears he should have pointed out to illyan how clever hed been how quick on the uptake vorventa had revealed what he knew but in no way had mark crossrevealed that he knew vorventa knew illyans investigation must now take the leak whatever it was by surprise isnt that worth something im not as stupid as you think i am youre not as smart as i thought you were either illyan you are not perfect that was disturbing he had expected impsec to be perfect somehow it had anchored his world to think so and miles perfect and the count and countess all perfect all unkillable all made out of rubber the only real pain his own he thought of ivan crying in the shadows of the count dying in the woods the countess had kept her mask up better than any of them she had to she had more to hide miles himself the man who had created a whole other personality just to escape into the trouble mark decided was that he had been trying to be miles vorkosigan all by himself even miles didnt do miles that way he had coopted an entire supporting cast a cast of thousands no wonder i can never catch up with him slowly curiously mark opened his tunic and removed gregors comm card from his inner breast pocket and set it on the comconsole desk he stared hard at the anonymous plastic chip as if it bore some coded message for his eyes only he rather fancied it did you knew you knew didnt you gregor you bastard youve just been waiting for me to figure it out for myself with spasmodic decision mark jammed the card into the comconsoles readslot no machines this time a man in ordinary civilian clothing answered immediately though without identifying himself yes im lord mark vorkosigan i should be on your list i want to talk to gregor right now my lord said the man mildly his hand danced over a keypad array to one side yes now please you are cleared he vanished the vid plate remained dark but the audio transmitted a melodious chime it chimed for quite a long time mark began to panic what ifbut then it stopped there was a mysterious clanking sound and gregors voice said yes in a bleary tone no visuals its me mark vorkosigan lord mark yeah you told me to call you yes but its a short pause five in the bleeding morning mark oh were you asleep he carolled frantically he leaned forward and heat his head gently on the hard cool plastic of the desk timing my timing god you sound just like miles when you say that muttered the emperor the vid plate activated gregors image came up as he turned on a light he was in some sort of bedroom dim in the hackground and was wearing nothing but loose black silky pajama pants he peered at mark as if making sure he wasnt talking to a ghost but the corpus was too corpulant to be anyone but mark the emperor heaved an oxygenating sigh and blinked himself to focus what do you need how wonderfully succinct if he answered in full it could take him the next six hours i need to be in on impsecs search for miles illyan wont let me you can override him gregor sat still for a minute then barked a brief laugh he swiped a hand through sleepbent black hair have you asked him yes just now he turned me down mm well its his job to be cautious for me so that my judgment may remain untrammeled in your untrammeled judgment sir sire let me in gregor studied him thoughtfully rubbing his face yes he drawled slowly after a moment lets see what happens his eyes were not bleary now can you call illyan right now sire what is this pentup demand the dam breaks i am poured out like water where did that quote come from it sounded like something of the countesss hes still up please sire and have him call me back at this console to confirm ill wait very well gregors lips twisted up in a peculiar smile lord mark thank you sire uh good night good morning gregor cut the comm mark waited the seconds ticked by stretched out of all recognition his hangover was starting but he was still slightly drunk the worst of both worlds he had started to doze when the comconsole chimed at last and he nearly spasmed out of his chair he slapped urgently at the controls yes sir illyans saturnine face appeared over the vid plate lord mark he gave mark the barest nod if you come to impsec headquarters at the beginning of normal business hours tomorrow morning you will be permitted to review the files we discussed thank you sir said mark sincerely thats twoandonehalf hours from now illyan mentioned with mark thought an understandable hint of sadism illyan hadnt slept either ill be there illyan acknowledged this with a shiver of his eyelids and vanished damnation through good works or grace alone mark meditated on gregors grace he knew he knew it before i did lord mark vorkosigan was a real person chapter eighteen the level light of dawn turned the nights lingering mist to gold a smoky autumnal haze that gave the city of vorbarr sultana an almost magical air the imperial security headquarters building stood windowless foursquare against the light a vast utilitarian concrete block with enormous gates and doors certainly designed to diminish any human supplicant fool enough to approach it in his case a redundant effect mark decided what awful architecture he said to pym beside him chauffeuring him in the counts ground car ugliest building in town the armsman agreed cheerfully it dates back to mad emperor yuris imperial architect lord dono vorrutyer an uncle to the later viceadmiral he managed to get up five major structures before yuri was killed and they stopped him the municipal stadium runs this a close second but weve never been able to afford to tear it down still stuck with it sixty years later it looks like the sort of place that has dungeons in the basement painted institutional green run by ethicsfree physicians it did said pym the armsman negotiated their way past the gate guards and slowed in front of a vast flight of steps pym arent those steps a bit oversized yep grinned the armsman youd have a cramp in your leg by the time you reached the top if you tried to take it in one go pym eased the ground car forward and stopped to let mark off but if you go around the left end here youll find a little door at ground level and a lift tube foyer thats where everybody actually goes in thank you pym popped the front canopy and mark climbed out whatever happened to lord dono after mad yuris reign assassinated by the architectural defense league i hope no he retired to the country lived off his daughter and soninlaw and died stark mad theres a bizarre set of towers he built on their estate that they charge admission to see now with a wave pym lowered the canopy and pulled away mark trod around to the left as directed so here he was bright and early or at least early hed taken a long shower donned comfortable dark civilian clothes and tanked himself on enough painkillers vitamins hangover remedies and stimulants to leave him feeling artificially normal more artificial than normal but he was determined not to let illyan bully him out of his chance he presented himself to the impsec guards in the foyer im lord mark vorkosigan im expected hardly that growled a voice from the lift tube illyan himself swung out the guards braced illyan put them back at ease with an unmilitary wave illyan too had showered and changed back into his usual undress greens mark suspected illyan had eaten pills for breakfast too thank you sergeant ill take him up what a depressing building to work in mark commented as he rose in the lift tube beside the impsec chief yes sighed illyan i visited the investigatif federate building on escobar once fortyfive stories all glass i was never closer to emigrating dono vorrutyer should have been strangled at birth but its mine now illyan glanced around with a dubious possessiveness illyan led him deep into theyes this building definitely had bowels mark decided the bowels of impsec their footsteps echoed down a bare corridor lined with tiny cubiclelike rooms mark glanced through a few halfopen doors at highlysecured cornconsoles manned by greenuniformed men one man at least had a bank of nonregulation full spectrum lights blazing away aimed at his station chair there was a large coffee dispenser at the end of the corridor he didnt think it was random chance that illyan led him to the cubicle numbered thirteen this comconsole has been loaded with every report ive received pertaining to the search for lieutenant vorkosigan said illyan coolly if you think you can do better with it than my trained analysts have i invite you to try thank you sir mark slid into the station chair and powered up the vid plate this is unexpectedly generous you should have no complaint my lord illyan stated in the tone of a directive gregor must have lit quite a fire under him earlier this morning mark reflected as illyan bowed himself out with a distinctly ironic nod hostile no that was unjust illyan was not nearly as hostile as he had a right to be its not only obedience to his emperor mark realized with a shiver illyan could have stood up to gregor on a security issue like this if hed really wanted to hes getting desperate he took a deep breath and plunged into the files reading listening and viewing illyan hadnt been joking about the everything part there were literally hundreds of reports generated by fifty or sixty different agents scattered throughout the near wormhole nexus some were brief and negative others were long and negative but somebody seemed to have visited at least once every possible cryofacility on jacksons whole its orbital and jump point stations and several adjoining local space systems there were even recentlyreceived reports tracing as far away as escobar what was missing mark realized after quite a while were any synopses or finished analyses he had received raw data only in all its mass on the whole he decided he preferred it that way mark read till his eyes were dry and aching and his stomach gurgled with festering coffee time to break for lunch he thought when a guard knocked at his door lord mark your driver is here the guard informed him politely hellit was time to break for dinner the guard escorted him back through the building and delivered him to pym it was dark outside my head hurts doggedly mark returned the next morning and started again and the next and the next more reports arrived in fact they were arriving faster than he could read them the harder he worked the more he was falling behind halfway through the fifth day he leaned back in his station chair and thought this is crazy illyan was burying him from the paralysis of ignorance he had segued with surprising speed to the paralysis of informationglut ive got to triage this crap or ill never get out of this repulsive building lies lies all lies he muttered wildly to his comconsole it seemed to blink and hum back at him sly and demure with a decisive punch he turned off the comconsole with its endless babble of voices and fountains of data and sat for a while in darkness and silence till his ears stopped ringing impsec hasnt hasnt found miles he didnt need all this data nobody did he just needed one piece lets cut this down to size start with a few explicit assumptions one miles is recoverable let impsec look for a rotted body unmarked grave or disintegration record all they wanted such a search was no use to him even if successful especially if successful only cryochambers whether permanent storage banks or other portables were of interest orless likely and notably less commoncryorevival facilities but logic put an upper cap on his optimism if miles had been successfully revived by friendly hands the first thing he would do would be to report in he hadnt ergo he was still frozen or if revived in too bad a shape to function or not in friendly hands so where the dendarii cryochamber had been found in the hegen hub well so what it had been sent there after it was emptied sinking down into his station chair with slitted eyes mark thought instead about the opposite end of the trail were his particular obsessions luring him into believing what he wanted to believe no dammit to hell with the hegen hub miles never got off the planet in one stroke that eliminated over threefourths of the trashdata clogging his view we look at jacksons whole reports only then good then what how had impsec checked all the remaining possible destinations places without known motivations or connections with house bharaputra for the most part impsec had simply asked concealing their own identity but offering a substantial reward all at least four weeks after the raid a cold trail so to speak quite a lot of time for someone to think about their surprise package time to hide it if they were so inclined so that in those cases where impsec did a second and more complete pass they were even more likely to come up empty miles is in a place that impsec has already checked off in the hands of someone with hidden motivations to be interested in him there were still hundreds of possibilities i need a connection there has to be a connection impsec had torn apart norwoods available dendarii records down to the level of a wordbyword analysis nothing but norwood was medically trained and he hadnt sent his beloved admirals cryochamber off at random hed sent it someplace to someone if theres a hell norwood i hope youre roasting in it right now mark sighed leaned forward and turned the comconsole back on a couple of hours later illyan stopped by marks cubicle closing the soundproof door behind him he leaned falsely casual on the wall and remarked how is it going mark ran his hands through his hair despite your amiable attempt to bury me i think im actually making some progress oh what kind illyan did not deny the charge mark noticed i am absolutely convinced miles never left jacksons whole so how do you explain our finding the cryochamber in the hegen hub i dont its a diversion hm said illyan noncommittally and it worked mark added cruelly illyans lips thinned diplomacy mark reminded himself diplomacy or hed never get what he needed i accept that your resources are finite sir so put them to the point everything that you do have available for this you ought to send to jacksons whole the sardonic expression on illyans face said it all the man had been running impsec for nearly thirty years it was going to take a lot more than diplomacy for him to accept mark telling him how to do his job what did you find out about captain vorventa mark tried another line the link was short and not too sinister his younger brother was my galactic operations supervisors adjutant these are not disloyal men you understand so what have you done about captain edwin nothing its too late the information about miles is now out on the vorish net as whispers and gossip beyond damage control young vorventa has been transferred and demoted leaving an ugly hole in my staffing he was good at his job illyan did not sound very grateful to mark oh mark paused vorventa thought i did something to the count is that out on the gossip net too yes mark winced well at least you know better he sighed he glanced up at illyans stony face and felt a nauseated alarm dont you sir perhaps perhaps not how not you have the medical reports mm the cardiac rupture certainly appeared natural but it could have been artificially created using a surgical handtractor the subsequent damage to the cardiac region would have masked its traces mark shuddered in helpless outrage tricky work he choked extremely precise how did i make the count hold still and not notice while i was doing this that is one problem with the scenario illyan agreed and what did i do with the hand tractor and the medical scanner id have needed one of those too two or three kilos of equipment ditched them in the woods or somewhere have you found them no have you looked yes mark rubbed his face hard and clenched and unclenched his teeth so you have all the men you need to quarter and requarter several square kilometers of woods looking for a hand tractor that isnt there but not enough to send to jacksons whole to look for miles who is i see no he had to keep his temper or hed lose everything he wanted to howl he wanted to beat illyans face in a galactic operative is a highlytrained specialist with rare personal qualities said illyan stiffly areasearches for known objects can be conducted by lowlevel troopers who are more abundant yes im sorry he was apologizing your goals remember your goals he thought of the countess and drew a deep calming breath he drew several i do not hold this as a conviction illyan said watching his face i hold it merely as a doubt thankyouithink mark snarled he sat for a full minute trying to marshall his scattered thoughts his best arguments look he said at last you are wasting your resources and one of the resources you are wasting is me send me back to jacksons whole i know more about the entire situation than any other agent you have i have some training an assassins training only maybe but some enough to lose your spies three or four times on earth enough to get this far i know jacksons whole visceral stuff you can only acquire growing up there and you wouldnt even have to pay me he waited holding his breath in the courage of his terror go back blood sprayed through his memory going to give the bharaputrans a chance to correct their aim illyans cool expression did not change your track record so far in covert ops is not notably impressive for its successes lord mark so im not a brilliant combat field commander i am not miles we all know that by now how many of your other agents are if you are as ah incompetent as you have appeared sending you would be a further waste but suppose you are more sly than even i think all your thrashing around here a mere smokescreen illyan could deliver the veiled insults too stilettosharp right between the ribs and suppose you get to miles before we do what happens then what do you mean what happens then if you return him to us as a roomtemperature corpse fit only for burying instead of a cryostat hopefulhow will we know that was the way you found him and you will inherit his name his rank his wealth and his future tempting mark to a man without an identity very tempting mark buried his face in his hands he sat crushed infuriated and wildly frustrated look he said through his fingers look either im the man who by your theory succeeded in halfassassinating aral vorkosigan and was so good i left no trace of proofor im not you can argue that im not competent enough to send or you can argue that im not trustworthy enough to send but you cant use both arguments at once pick one i await more evidence illyans eyes were like stones i swear mark whispered excess suspicion makes us bigger fools than excess trust does it had certainly been true in his case he sat up suddenly so fastpenta me illyan raised his brows mm fastpenta me you never have relieve your suspicions fastpenta interrogations could be excruciatingly humiliating experiences by all reports so what what was one more humiliation in his life warm and familiar that was what i have longed to lord mark illyan admitted but your ah progenitor has a known idiosyncratic response to fastpenta that i assume you share not the usual allergy exactly it creates an appalling hyperactivity a great deal of babble but alas no overwhelming compulsion to tell the truth it is useless in miles mark seized the hope you assume you dont know my metabolism is demonstrably not like miless cant you at least check yes said illyan slowly i can do that he pushed himself off from the wall and exited the cubicle saying carry on ill be back shortly tense mark rose and paced the little room two steps each way fear and desire pulsed in his brain the memory of the inhuman chill of baron bharaputras eyes clashed with hot rage in his throat if you want to find something look where you lost it hed lost it all on jacksons whole illyan returned at last sit down and roll up your left sleeve mark did so whats that patch test mark felt a burrlike prickle as illyan pressed the tiny medpad onto the underside of his forearm then peeled it away illyan glanced at his chrono and leaned on the comconsole watching marks arm within a minute there was a pink spot within two it was a hive within five it had grown to a hard white welt surrounded by angry red streaks that ran from his wrist to his elbow illyan sighed disappointment lord mark i highly recommend that you avoid fastpenta at all costs in your future that was an allergic reaction that was a highly allergic reaction shit mark sat and brooded and scratched he rolled down his sleeve before he drew blood if miles had been sitting here reading these files making these same arguments would you have listened to him lieutenant vorkosigan has a sustained record of successes that compels my attention results speak for themselves and as you yourself have repeatedly pointed out you are not miles you cant use both arguments at once he added icily pick one why did you even bother letting me in here if nothing i say or do can make any difference mark exploded illyan shrugged aside from gregors direct orderat least i know where you are and what you are doing like a detention cell except that i enter it voluntarily if you could lock me in a cell without a comconsole youd be even happier frankly yes just so blackly mark switched the comconsole back on illyan left him to it mark jumped out of his chair stumbled to the door and stuck his head out illyans retreating back was halfway down the corridor i have my own name now illyan mark shouted furiously illyan glanced back over his shoulder raised his brows and walked on mark tried reading another report but it seemed to turn to gibberish somewhere between his eyes and his brain he was too rattled to continue his analysis today he gave up at last and called pym for a pickup it was still light out he stared into the sunset glimpsed between the buildings on the way home to vorkosigan house till his eyes burned it was the first time that week he had returned from impsec in time to join the countess for dinner he found her and botharijesek dining casually in a groundfloor nook that looked onto a sheltered corner of the garden densely arranged with autumn flowers and plants spot lighting kept the display colorful in the gathering dusk the countess wore a fancy green jacket and long skirt a vor matrons town wear botharijesek wore a similar costume in blue obviously borrowed from the countesss wardrobe a place was set for him at the table despite the fact that he hadnt shown up for the meal for four straight days obscurely touched he slid into his seat how was the count today he asked diffidently unchanged the countess sighed as was the countesss custom there was a minute of silence before they plowed in which the countess used for an inward prayer that mark suspected involved more this day than calling blessings upon the bread botharijesek and he waited politely botharijesek meditating godknewwhat mark rerunning his conversation with illyan in his head and evolving all the smarter things he should have said too late a servant brought food in covered dishes and departed to leave them in privacy which was the way the countess preferred it when not dining formally with official guests family style huh in truth botharijesek had been lending the countess the support of a daughter in the days since the counts collapse accompanying her on her frequent trips to the imperial military hospital running personal errands acting as confidant mark suspected the countess had revealed more of her real thoughts to botharijesek than to anyone else and felt a little inexplicable envy as their favorite armsmans only child elena bothari had been practically the vorkosigans fosterdaughter vorkosigan house had been the home in which she had grown up so if he was really miless brother did that make elena his fostersister too he would have to try the idea on her and prepare to duck some other time captain botharijesek mark began after hed swallowed the first couple of bites whats going on with the dendarii at komarr or does illyan keep you in the dark too hed better not said botharijesek to be sure elena had allies that outranked even the impsec commander weve done a little reshuffling quinn retained the chief eyewitnesses to your um raid land of her not to use some more forthright term like debacle green squad part of orange and blue squads shes sent everyone else off in the peregrine under my second to rejoin the fleet people were getting itchy cooped up in orbit with no downside leave and no duties she looked distinctly unhappy at this temporary loss of her command is the ariel still at komarr then yes quinn of course captain thorne sergeant taura all still waiting they must be pretty itchy themselves by now yes said botharijesek and stabbed her fork so hard into a chunk of vat protein that it skittered across her plate itchy yes so what have you learned this week mark the countess asked him nothing you dont already know im afraid doesnt illyan pass you reports yes but due to the press of events ive only had time to glance at his analysts synopses in any case theres only one piece of news i really want to hear right encouraged mark began to detail his survey to her including his datatriage and his growing convictions you seem to have been quite thorough she remarked he shrugged i now know roughly what impsec knows if illyan has been honest with me but since impsec frankly doesnt know where miles is its all futile i swear yes said the countess i swear miles is still on jacksons whole but i cant get illyan to focus down his attention is spread all over hell and gone he has cetagandans on the brain there are sound historical reasons for that said the countess and current ones too im afraid though im sure illyan has been cagey about confiding to you any of impsecs troubles not directly connected to miless situation to say hes had a bad month would be a gross understatement she hesitated too for rather a long time mark you are after all miless clonetwin as close as one human being can be to another this conviction of yours has a passionate edge you seem to know do you suppose you really do know on some level do you mean like a psychic link he said what an awful idea she nodded faintly flushed botharijesek looked appalled and gave him a strange beseeching look dont you dare mess with her mind you this is the true measure of her desperation im sorry im not psychic only psychotic botharijesek relaxed he slumped then brightened slightly with an idea though it might not hurt to let illyan think that you think so illyan is too sturdy a rationalist the countess smiled sadly the passion is only frustration maam no one will let me do anything what is it that you wish to do i want to run away to beta colony the countess would probably help him to no i am never running away again he took a breath in place of a courage he did not feel i want to go back to jacksons whole and look for him i could do as good a job as illyans other agents i know i could i tried the idea on him he wouldnt bite if he could hed like to lock me in a security cell its days like these poor simon would sell his soul to make the world hold still for a while the countess admitted his attention isnt just spread right now its splintered i have a certain sympathy for him i dont i wouldnt ask simon illyan for the time of day nor would he give it to me mark brooded gregor would hint obliquely where i might look for a chrono you his metaphor extended itself unbidden would give me a clock if i had one son id give you a clock factory the countess sighed mark chewed swallowed stopped looked up really r she began positively then caution caught up with her really what is lord mark a free man i mean ive committed no crime within the barrayaran empire have i there being no law against stupidity im not under arrest no i could go to jacksons whole myself screw illyan and his precious resources if ah the catchhe deflated slightly if i had a ticket he ran down his whole wealth as far as he knew was seventeen imperial marks left from a twentyfive note the countess had given him for spending money earlier in the week now wadded up in his trouser pocket the countess pushed her plate away and sat back her face drained this does not strike me as a very safe idea speaking of stupidity bharaputras probably got an execution contract out on you now after what you did botharijesek put in helpfully noits on admiral naismith mark argued and i wouldnt be going back to bharaputras not that he didnt agree with the countess the spot on his forehead where baron bharaputra had counted coup burned in secret he stared urgently at her maam are you seriously asking me to finance your risking your life she said nomy saving it i canthe waved around helplessly at vorkosigan house at his whole situationgo on like this im all out of balance here im all wrong balance will come to you in time its just too soon she said earnestly youre still very new i have to go back i have to try to undo what i did if i can and if you cant what will you do then asked botharijesek coldly take off with a nice head start had the woman read his mind marks shoulders bowed with the weight of her scorn and his doubt i he breathed dont know he could not finish the sentence aloud the countess laced her long fingers i dont doubt your heart she said looking at him steadily hell and she could break that heart more thoroughly with her trust than illyan ever could with his suspicion he crouched in his seat butyou are my second chance my new hope all unlookedfor i never thought i could have another child on barrayar now jacksons whole has eaten miles and you want to go down there after him you too maam he said desperately motheri cannot be your consolation prize she crossed her arms and rested her chin in one hand cupped over her mouth her eyes were grey as a winter sea you of all people have to see mark pleaded how important a second chance can he she pushed back her chair and stood up ill have to think about this she exited the little dining room shed left half her meal on her plate mark saw with dismay botharijesek saw it too good job she snarled im sorry im sorry she rose to run after the countess mark sat abandoned and alone and blindly and halfconsciously proceeded to eat himself sick he stumbled up to his rooms level by the lift tube afterward and lay wishing for sleep more than for breath neither came to him after an interminable time his stunned headache and hot abdominal pain were just starting to recede when there came a knock on his door he rolled over with a muffled groan who is it elena he keyed on the light and sat up in bed against the carved headboard stuffing a pillow under his spine against some killer solid walnut acanthus leaves in high relief he didnt want to talk to botharijesek or to any other human being he refastened his shirt as loosely as it would go enter he muttered she came cautiously around the doorframe her face serious and pale hello are you feeling all right no he admitted i came to apologize she said you apologize to me why the countess told me something of what was going on with you im sorry i didnt understand hed been dissected again in absentia he could tell by the horrified way botharijesek was looking at him as if his swollen belly was laid open and spread wide in an autopsy with a cut from here to there aw hell what did she say now he struggled with difficulty to sit up straighter miles had talked around it but i hadnt understood how bad it really was the countess told me exactly what galen did to you the shockstick rape and the um eating disorders and the other disorder she kept her eyes away from his body onto his face a dead giveaway of the unwelcome depth of her new knowledge she and the countess must have been talking for two hours and it was all so deliberately calculated that was the most diabolical part im not so sure about the shockstick incident being calculated mark said carefully galen seemed out of his head to me over the top nobodys that good an actor or maybe it started out calculated and got out of hand and then burst out helplessly dammit botharijesek jumped a foot in the air she has no right to talk about that with you or with anybody what the hell am i the best show in town no no botharijesek opened her hands you have to understand i told her about maree that little blonde clone we found you with what i thought was going on i accused you to the countess he froze flushed with shame and a new dismay i didnt realize you hadnt told her at the first was everything he thought hed built with the countess on a rotten foundation collapsing now in ruins she wanted you for a son so badly i couldnt bring myself to but i was so furious with you tonight i blurted it all out and then what happened botharijesek shook her head in wonderment shes so betan shes so strange shes never where you think she is mentally she wasnt the least surprised and then she explained it all to mei felt like my head was being turned inside out and given a good washandbrush he almost laughed that sounds like a typical conversation with the countess his choking fear began to recede she doesnt despise me i was wrong about you botharijesek said sturdily his hands spread in exasperation its nice to know i have such a defender but you werent wrong what you thought was exactly what was going on i would have if i could have he said bitterly it wasnt my virtue that stopped me it was my highvoltage conditioning oh i dont mean wrong about the facts but i was projecting a lot of my own anger into the way i was explaining you to myself i had no idea how much you were a product of systematic torture and how incredibly you resisted i think i would have gone catatonic in your place it wasnt that bad all the time he said uncomfortably but you have to understand she repeated doggedly what was going on with me about my father huh he felt as if his head had just been given a sharp halftwist to the left i know what my father has to do with this why the hell is yours in on it she walked around the room working up to something when she did speak it came out all in a rush my father raped my mother thats where i came from during the barrayaran invasion of escobar ive known for some years its made me allergically sensitive on the subject i cant stand it her hands clenched yet its in me i cant escape it it made it very hard for me to see you clearly i feel like ive been looking at you through a fog for the last ten weeks the countess has dispelled it indeed her eyes did not freeze him any more the count helped me too more than i can say oh what was he to say so it hadnt been just him theyd been talking about for the past two hours there was clearly more to her story but he sure wasnt going to ask for once it wasnt his place to apologize im not sorry you exist however you got here she smiled crookedly actually neither am i he felt very strange his fury at the violation of his privacy was fading to be replaced by a lightheartedness that astonished him he was greatly relieved to be unburdened of his secrets his dread was shrunken as if giving it away had literally diminished it i swear if i tell four more people ill be altogether free he swung his legs out of the bed grabbed her by the hand led her to a wooden chair beside his window climbed up and stood on it and kissed her thank you she looked quite startled what for she asked on the breath of a laugh firmly she repossessed her hand for existing for letting me live i dont know he grinned exhilarated but the grin faded in dizziness and he climbed down more carefully and sat she stared down at him and bit her lip why do you do that to yourself no use to pretend he didnt know what that was the physical manifestations of his compulsive gorge were obvious enough he felt monstrous he swiped a hand over his sweaty face i dont know i do think half of what we call madness is just some poor slob dealing with pain by a strategy that annoys the people around him how is it dealing with pain to give yourself more pain she asked plaintively he halfsmiled hands on his knees staring at the floor there is a kind of riveting fascination to it takes your mind off the real thing consider what a toothache does to your attention span she shook her head id rather not thank you galen was only trying to screw up my relation with my father he sighed but he managed to screw up my relation with everything he knew he wouldnt be able to control me directly once he turned me loose on barrayar so he had to build in motivations that would last he added lowly it ricocheted back on him because in a sense galen was my father too my fosterfather first one i ever had the count had been alive to that one i was so hungry for identity when the komarrans picked me up on jacksons whole i think i must have been like one of those baby birds that imprints on a watering pot or something because its the first parentbirdsized thing it sees you have a surprising talent for information analysis she remarked i noticed it even back at jacksons whole me he blinked certainly not not a talent surely or hed be getting better results but despite all his frustrations he had felt a kind of contentment in his little cubicle at impsec this past week the serenity of a monks cell combined with the absorbing challenge of that universe of data in an odd way it reminded him of the peaceful times with the virtual learning programs in his childhood back at the clonecreche the times when no one had been hurting him the countess thinks so too she wants to see you what now she sent me to get you but i had to get my word in first before it got any later and i lost my chance or my nerve all right let me pull myself together he was intensely grateful wine had not been served tonight he retreated to his bathroom washed his face in the coldest water forced down a couple of painkiller tabs and combed his hair he slipped one of the backcountrystyle vests over his dark shirt and followed botharijesek into the hall she took him to the countesss own study which was a serene and austere chamber overlooking the back garden just off her bedroom her and her husbands bedroom mark glimpsed the dark interior down a step and through an archway the counts absence seemed an almost palpable thing the countess was at her comconsole not a secured government model just a very expensive commercial one shell flowers inlaid on black wood framed the vid plate which was generating the image of a harriedlooking man the countess was saying sharply well find out the arrangements then yes tonight now and then get back to me thank you she batted the offkey and swung around to face mark and botharijesek are you checking on a ticket to jacksons whole he asked tremulously hoping against hope no oh of course not how could she let him go he was a fool it was useless to suppose i was checking on getting you a ship if youre going youll need a lot more independent mobility than scheduled commercial transport will allow buy a ship he said stunned and hed thought that line about the clock factory had been a joke isnt that pretty expensive lease if i can buy if i have to there seem to be three or four possibilities in barrayar or komarr orbit stillhow he didnt think even the vorkosigans could buy a jumpship out of pocket change i can mortgage something the countess said rather vaguely looking around since synthetics came in you cant hock the family jewels any more he followed her gaze not vorkosigan house no its entailed same problem with the district residence at hassadar i can pledge vorkosigan surleau on my bare word though the heart of the realm oh shit all these houses and history are all very well she complained raising her eyebrows at his dismayed expression but a bloody museum doesnt make a very liquid asset in any case the finances are my problem youll have your own worries a crew was the first thought that popped into his head and out of his mouth a jumppilot and engineer will come with the ship at a minimum as for supercargo well there are all those idle dendarii hanging in komarr orbit i imagine you could find a volunteer or two among them its obvious they cant take the ariel back into jacksonian local space quinnie has bleeding fingers by now from scratching at the doors botharijesek said even illyan wont be able to hold her much longer if impsec doesnt get a break soon will illyan try to hold me asked mark anxiously if it werent for aral id be going myself said the countess and i sure as hell wouldnt let illyan stop me you are my proxy ill deal with impsec mark bet she would the dendarii im thinking of are highly motivated buti foresee problems getting them to follow my orders who will be in command of this little private excursion its the golden rule boy he who has the gold makes the rules the ship will be yours the choice of companions will be yours if they want a ride they have to cooperate that would last past the first wormhole jump then quinn would lock me in a closet the countess puffed a laugh despite herself hm that is a point she leaned back in her station chair and steepled her fingers together her eyes halfclosed for a minute or two they opened wide again elena she said will you take oath to lord vorkosigan the fingers of her right hand fanned at mark im already sworn to lord vorkosigan elena said stiffly meaning to miles the grey eyes went flinty death releases all vows and then glinted the vor system never has been very good at catching the curve balls thrown at it by galactic technologies do you know i dont think there has ever been a ruling as to the status of a voiceoath when one of the respondents is in cryostasis your word cant be your breath when you dont have any breath after all we shall just have to set our own precedent elena paced to the window and stared out into nothing the reflecting lights of the room obscured any view of the night at last she turned decisively on her heel went down on both knees in front of mark and raised her hands pressed palm to palm automatically mark enclosed her hands with his own my lord she said i pledge you the obedience of a liegewoman um said mark urn i think i may need more than that try this one i elena botharijesek do testify i am a freewoman of the district vorkosigan i hereby take service under lord mark pierre vorkosigan as an armsmanarmswomansimple and will hold him as my liege commander until my death or he releases me shocked botharijesek stared up at him not very far up true you cant do that can you well said the countess watching this playlet with her eyes alight there isnt actually a law saying a counts heir cant take a female armsman its just never been done you know tradition elena and the countess exchanged a long look hesitantly as if halfhypnotized botharijesek repeated the oath mark said i lord mark pierre vorkosigan vassal secundus to emperor gregor vorbarra do accept your oath and pledge you the protection of a liege commander this by my word as vorkosigan he paused actually he said aside to the countess i havent made my oath to gregor yet either would that invalidate this details said the countess waving her fingers you can work out the details later botharijesek stood up again she looked at him like a woman waking up in bed with a hangover and a strange partner she didnt remember meeting the night before she rubbed the backs of her hands where his skin had touched hers power just how much vorpower did this little charade give him just as much as botharijesek allowed mark decided eyeing her athletic frame and shrewd face no danger she would permit him to abuse his position the uncertainty in her face was giving way to a suppressed pleasure that delighted his eye yes that was the right move no question but that he had pleased the countess who was grinning outright at her subversive son now said the countess how fast can we pull this together how soon can you be ready to travel immediately said botharijesek at your command maam said mark i do feelits nothing psychic you understand its not even the general itch its only logic but i do think we could be running out of time how so asked botharijesek theres nothing more static than cryostasis were all going crazy from uncertainty sure but thats our problem miles may have more time than we do mark shook his head if miles had fallen frozen into friendly or even neutral hands they ought to have responded to the rumors of reward by now but if someone wanted to revive him theyd have to do the prep first were all very conscious right now of how long it takes to grow organs for transplant the countess nodded wryly ifwherever miles iscommitted to the project soon after they got him they could be nearly ready to attempt a revival by now they might botch it said the countess they might not be careful enough her fingers drummed on the pretty shell inlay i dont follow that objected botharijesek why would an enemy bother to revive him what fate could be worse than death i dont know sighed mark but if there is one i bet the jacksoninans can arrange it chapter nineteen with breath came pain he was in a hospital bed that much he knew even before opening his eyes from the discomfort the chill and the smell that seemed right vaguely if unpleasantly familiar he blinked to discover that his eyes were plastered with goo scented translucent medical goo it was like trying to see through a pane of glass covered with grease he blinked some more and achieved a limited focus then had to stop and catch his breath from the effort there was something terribly wrong with his breathing labored panting that didnt provide enough air at all and it whistled the whistling came from a plastic tube down his throat he realized trying to swallow his lips were dry and cracked the tube blocking his mouth prevented him from moistening them he tried to move his body sent back shooting aches and pains burning through every bone there were tubes going into or perhaps out of his arms and his ears and his nose there were too damn many tubes that was bad he realized dimly though how he knew he could not have said with a heroic effort he tried to raise his head and see down his body the tube in his throat shifted painfully ridges of ribs belly gaunt and sunken red welts radiated all over his chest like a longlegged spider crouched just beneath his skin its body over his sternum surgical glue held together jagged incisions multiple scarlet scars looking like a map of a major river drainage delta he was pocked with monitorpads more tubes ran from places orifices ought not to be he caught a glimpse of his genitalia lying in a limp discolored lump there was a tube from there too pain from there would be subtly reassuring but he couldnt feel anything at all he couldnt feel his legs or feet either though he could see them his whole body was covered thickly with the scented goo his skin was peeling in nasty big pale flakes stuck in the stuff his head fell back on a pad and black clouds boiled in his eyes too many damn tubes bad he was in a muzzy halfawake state floating between confusing dreamfragments and pain when the woman came she leaned into his blurred vision were taking the pacer out now her voice was clear and low the tubes had gone away from his ears or maybe hed dreamed them your new heart will be beating and your lungs working all on their own she bent over his aching chest pretty woman of the elegantly intellectual type he was sorry he was dressed only in goo in front of her though it seemed to him that he had carried on with even less to wear once he could not remember where or how she did something to the spiderbody lump he saw his skin part in a thin red slit and then be sealed again she seemed to be cutting out his heart like an antique priestess making sacrifice but that could not be for his labored breathing continued shed definitely taken out something for she placed it on a tray held by her male assistant there she watched him closely he watched her in return blinking away the distortions of the ointment she had straight silky black hair bound in a knotmore of a wad actuallyon the back of her head a few fine strands escaped to float around her face golden skin brown eyes with a hint of an epicanthic fold stubby stubborn black lashes the bridge of her nose was coolly arched a pleasant original face not surgically altered to a mathematically perfect beauty but enlivened by an alert tension not an empty face somebody interesting was in there but not alas somebody familiar she was tall and slim dressed in a pale green lab smock over other clothes doctor he tried to guess but it came out a formless gurgle around the plastic in his mouth im going to take that tube out now she told him she pulled something sticky from around his lips and cheekstape more dead skin came with it gently she drew out the throattube he gagged it was like unswallowing a snake the relief of being rid of it almost made him pass out again there was still some sort of tube oxygenblocking his nostrils he moved his jaw and swallowed for the first time in in anyway his tongue felt thick and swollen his chest hurt terribly but saliva flowed his dry mouth rehydrated one did not really appreciate saliva till one was forced to do without it his heart beat fast and light like bird wings fluttering it did not feel right but at least he felt something whats your name she asked him the subliminal terror he had been studiously ignoring yawned black beneath him his breath quickened in his panic despite the oxygen he could not get enough air and he could not answer her question ah he whispered ag he did not know who he was nor how he had come by this huge burden of hurt the notknowing frightened him far more than the hurt the young man in the paleblue medical jacket snorted i think im going to win my bet that ones coagulated behind the eyeballs all short circuits back there he tapped his forehead the woman frowned in annoyance patients dont come popping up out of cryostasis like a meal out of a microwave it takes just as much healing as if the original injury hadnt killed them and more it will be a couple of days before i can even begin to evaluate his higher neural functions still she pulled something sharp and shiny from the lapel of her jacket and moved around him touching him and watching a monitor readout on the wall above his head when his right hand jerked back at a prick she smiled yeah and when my prick jerks up at a right hand ill smile he thought dizzily he wanted to speak he wanted to tell that blue fellow to take a wormhole jump to hell and take his bet with him all that came out of his mouth was a hollow hiss he shuddered with frustration he had to function or die that he was bonesure of be the best or be destroyed he didnt know where this certainty came from who was going to kill him he didnt know them some faceless them no time to rest march or die the medical duo left driven by the obscure fear he began to try to exercise isometrics in his bed all he could move was his right arm attracted by his thrashing as reported by his monitor pads the youth came back and sedated him when the darkness closed in again he wanted to howl he had very bad dreams after that any content would have been welcome to his bewildered brain but all he could remember when he woke was the badness an interminable time later the doctor returned to feed him sort of she touched a control to raise the head of his bed saying chattily lets try out your new stomach my friend friend was he he needed a friend no question sixty milliliters of glucose solutionsugar water the first meal of your life so to speak i wonder if you have enough basic muscle control to suck on a straw yet he did once she touched a few drops of liquid to his lips to get him started suck and swallow you couldnt get much more basic than that except that he couldnt drink it all thats all right she rippled on your stomachs not fully grown yet you see neither were your heart or lungs lilly was in a hurry to have you awake all your replacement organs are a bit undersized for your body which means theyre going to be working hard and wont grow as fast as they did in the vat youre going to be short of breath for quite a while still it made it all easier to install more elbow room for me which i appreciated he wasnt quite sure if she was talking to him or just to herself as a lonely person might talk to a pet she took the cup away and came back with a basin sponges and towels and began washing him section by section why was a surgeon doing nursing care dr r durona read the name on the breast pocket of her green coat but she seemed to be doing a neurophysiological examination at the same time checking her work you were quite a little mystery you know delivered to me in a crate raven said you were too small to be a soldier but i picked out enough camouflage cloth and nerve disrupter shieldnetting along with the fortysix grenade fragments to be quite sure you werent just a bystander whatever you were that needlegrenade had your name on it unfortunately not in writing she sighed half to herself who are you she did not pause for an answer which was just as well the effort of swallowing the sugar water had exhausted him again an equally pertinent question was where was he and he was peeved that she who must surely know didnt think to tell him the room was an anonymous hightech medical locale without windows on a planet not a ship how do i know that a vague picture of a ship in his head seemed to shatter at his touch what ship for that matter what planet there ought to be a window a big window framing a high hazy cityscape with a rapid river cutting through it and people there were people missing who ought by rights to be here though he could not picture them the mix of generic medical familiarity and particular strangeness tied his guts in knots the cleaningcloths were icy grating but he was glad to be rid of the goo not to mention all the disgusting crud stuck in it he felt like a lizard shedding his skin when she was done all the dead white flakes were gone the new skin looked very raw she rubbed depilatory cream over his face which seemed redundant and stung like hell he decided he liked the sting he was starting to relax and enjoy her ministrations embarrassingly intimate though they were she was returning him at least to the dignity of being clean and she did not feel like an enemy some sort of ally at least on the somatic level she cleaned his face of cream beard and a good deal of skin and also combed his hair though unfortunately like his skin his hair too seemed to be coming out in alarming clumps there she said sounding satisfied she held a large handmirror up to his face see anybody you recognize she was watching him closely he realized noting his eyes focus and track thats me well i suppose i can get used to it red skin stretched over its frame of bones jutting nose a sharp chin the grey eyes looked bizarrely hungover their whites solid scarlet his dark hair was patchy like a bad case of mange hed really been hoping for something much betterlooking he tried to speak to ask his mouth moved but like his thoughts too disconnectedly for coherence he puffed air and spittle he couldnt even swear which made him want to swear even more which rapidly degenerated into a gurgling snarl she hastily took the mirror away and stood staring at him in worry steady on if he kept thrashing around theyd probably hit him with another dose of sedative and he didnt want that he lay back panting helplessly she lowered the bed again dimmed the lights and made to leave he managed a moan it worked she came back lilly called your cryochamber pandoras box she murmured reflectively but i thought of it as the enchanted knights crystal coffin i wish it were as easy as waking you with a kiss she bent over eyelids fluttering halfclosed and touched her lips to his he lay very still halfpleased halfpanicked she straightened watched him another moment and sighed didnt think it would work maybe im just not the right princess you have a very strange taste in men milady he thought dizzily how fortunate for me feeling hopeful of his future for the first time since recovering consciousness he lay quietly and let her go surely she would come back before he had passed out or been knocked out this time natural sleep came to him he didnt exactly like it if i should die before i wakebut it served his bodys craving and blotted out the pain slowly he gained control of his left arm then he made his right leg twitch his beautiful lady came back and fed him more sugar water but with no more sweet kisses for dessert by the time he compelled his left leg to twitch she came back again but this time there was something terribly wrong dr durona looked ten years older and had grown cool cold her hair was parted in the middle and hung down in two smooth wings chopped off at jawlength with threads of silver gleaming in the ebony her hands on his body helping him to sit up were dryer colder more severe not caressing ive gone into a timewarp no ive been frozen again no im taking too long to recover and shes pissed at me for making her wait no confusion clogged his throat hed just lost the only friend he had and he didnt know why i have destroyed our joy she massaged his legs very professionally provided him with a loose patient gown and made him stand up he almost passed out she put him back to bed and left when she came back the next time shed changed her hair yet again this time it was grown long held back tightly bound in a silver ring on the back of her head and flowing down in a bluntended horsetail with wide silver streaks running through it shed aged another ten years he swore whats happening to me her manner was a little softened but nothing so happy as at first she walked him across the room and back which drained him totally after which he slept again he was deeply distressed when she returned once more in her cold shorthaired incarnation he had to admit she was efficient getting him up and moving she barked at him like a drill sergeant but he walked and then he walked unassisted she steered him outside of his room for the first time to where a short hallway ended in a sliding door and then back theyd just turned for another circuit when the door at the end hissed open and dr durona came through she was in her horsetail morph he stared at the winghaired dr durona beside him and almost burst into tears its not fair youre confusing me dr durona strode up to dr durona he blinked back the water in his eyes and focused on their name tags winghair was dr c durona horsetail was dr p durona but wheres my dr durona i want dr r hi chrys hows he doing asked dr p dr c answered not too badly ive just about worn him out for this therapysession though i should say so dr p moved to help catch him as he collapsed he could not make his mouth form words they came out choked sobs overdone it id say not at all said dr c supporting his other side together they steered him back to bed but it looks like mental recovery is going to come after physical recovery in this one which is not good the pressures on lillys getting impatient he has to start making connections soon or hell be no use to us lilly is never impatient chided dr p she is this time said dr c grimly will the mental recovery really follow she helped him lie back without falling anyones guess rowan has guaranteed us the physical tremendous job that theres plenty of electrical activity in his brain something has to be healing yes but not instantly came a warmly amused voice from the hallway what are you two doing to my poor patient it was dr durona again she had long fine hair bunched in a messy wad on the back of her head pure ebony dark he peered worriedly at her name tag as she approached smiling dr r durona his dr durona he whimpered in relief he wasnt sure he could take much more confusion it hurt more than the physical pain his nerves seemed more shattered than his body it was like being in one of his bad dreams except that his dreams were much nastier with more blood and dismemberment not just a greencoated woman standing all around a room arguing with herself pt stands for physical torture dr c quipped that explained it come back and torture him again later dr r invited butgently how hard dare i push dr c was intent serious standing with her head cocked making notes on a report panel urgent queries are coming down from above you know i know physical therapy no oftener than every four hours till i give you the goahead and dont run his heart rate above oneforty that high an unavoidable consequence of its still being undersized you have it love dr c snapped her report panel closed and tossed it to dr r then marched out dr p wafted after her his dr durona dr r came to his side smiled and brushed his hair out of his eyes youre going to need a haircut soon and new growth is starting on the bare patches thats a very good sign with all that happening on the outside of your head i think there has to be something happening on the inside hey only if you counted spasms of hysteria as activity a tear left over from his earlier burst of terror escaped his eye at a nervous blink she touched its track oh she murmured in sympathetic worry which he found suddenly embarrassing i am not i am not i am not a mutant what she leaned closer whats your name he tried whzz dbuh his tongue would not obey him he knew the words he just couldnt make them come out whzz yr nine did you repeat me she brightened its a start ngh whzz yr nine he touched her jacket pocket hoping she wouldnt think he was trying to grope her what she glanced down are you asking whats my name gh gh my name is dr durona he groaned and rolled his eyes my name is rowan he fell back onto his headpad sighing with relief rowan lovely name he wanted to tell her it was a lovely name but what if they were all named rowanno the sergeantly one had been called chrys it was all right he could cut his dr durona out of the herd if he had to she was unique his wavering hand touched her lips then his own but she didnt take the hint and kiss him again reluctantly only because he didnt have the strength to hold her he let her pull her hand from his maybe he had dreamed that kiss maybe he was dreaming all of this a long uncertain time passed after she left but for a change he did not doze off he lay awake awash in disquieting disconnected thought the thoughtstream carried odd bits of jetsam an image here what might be a memory there but as soon as his attention turned inward to examine it the flow of thoughts froze and the tide of panic rose again well and so let him occupy himself otherwise only watching his thoughts at an angle obliquely let him observe himself reflected in what he knew and play detective to his own identity if you cant do what you want do what you can and if he couldnt answer the question who was he he might at least take a crack at where was he his monitor pads were gone he was no longer radiotagged it was very silent he slipped out of bed and navigated to the door it opened automatically onto the short hallway which was dimly lit by nightstrips at floor level including his own there were only four rooms off the little corridor none had windows or other patients a tiny office or monitorstation was emptyno a beverage cup steamed on the countertop next to a switchedon console its program on hold somebody would be back soon he nipped past and tried the only exit door at the corridors end it too opened automatically another short corridor two wellequipped surgeries lined it both were shut down cleaned tip nightsilent and windowless a couple of storage rooms one locked one not two palmlocked laboratories one had a bank of small animal cages at one end that he could glimpse dimly through the glass it was all crammed with equipment of the medicalbiochemical sort far more than a mere treatment clinic would require the place fairly reeked of research how do i knowno dont ask just keep going a lifttube beckoned at the corridors end his body ached breathing hurt but he had to grab his chance go go go wherever he was he was at the very bottom of it the tubes floor was at his feet it rose into dimness lit by panels reading s s sl the tube was switched off its safety door locked across the opening he slid it open manually and considered his options he could switch the tube on and risk lighting up some security monitor panel somewhere why could he picture such a thing or he could leave it off and climb the safetyladder in secret he tried one rung of the ladder his vision blackened he backed down carefully and switched on the tube he rose gently to level sl and swung out a tiny foyer had one door solid and blank it opened before him and closed behind him he stared around what was obviously a junkstorage chamber and turned back his door had vanished into a blank wall it took him a full minute of frightened examination to convince himself his sputtering brain wasnt playing tricks on him the door was disguised as the wall and hed just locked himself out he patted it frantically all over but it would not readmit him his bare feet were freezing on the polished concrete floor and he was dizzy and dreadfully tired he wanted to go back to bed the frustration and fear were almost overwhelming not that they were so vast but that he was so weak you only want it cause you cant have it perverse go on he told himself sternly he made his way from support to support to the outer door of the storage chamber it too was locked from the outside he found out the hard way when it sealed behind him go on the storage room had opened onto another short corridor centered around an ordinary lifttube foyer this level pretended to be the end of the line level b openings marked bl g and so on ascended out of sight he went for the zeropoint g g for ground yes he exited into a darkened lobby it was a neat little place elegantly furnished but in the manner of a business rather than a home with potted plants and a reception or security desk no one around no signs but there were windows at last and transparent doors they reflected a dim replica of the interior it was night outside he leaned on the comconsole desk jackpot here was not only a place to sit down but data in abundance hell it was palmlocked and would not even turn on for him there were ways to overcome palmlockshow did he the fragmentary visions exploded like a school of minnows eluding his grasp he nearly cried with the uselessness of it sitting in the station chair with his tooheavy head laid in his arms across the blank unyielding vid plate he shivered god i hate cold he wobbled over to the glass door it was snowing outside tiny scintillant dots whipping by slantwise through the white are of a floodlight they would be hard and hiss and sting on bare skin a weird vision of a dozen naked men standing shivering in a midnight blizzard flitted across his minds eye but he could attach no names to the scene only a sensation of deep disaster was that how he had died freezing in the wind and snow recently nearby i was dead the realization came to him for the first time a burst of shock radiating outward from his belly he traced the aching scars on his torso through the thin fabric of his gown and im not feeling too good now either he giggled an offbalance noise disturbing even to his own ears he stifled his mouth with his fist he must not have had time to be afraid before because the retroactive wash of terror knocked him to his knees then to his hands and knees the shivering cold was making his hands shake uncontrollably he began to crawl he must have triggered some sensor because the transparent door hissed open oh no he wasnt going to make that error again and get exiled to the outer darkness he began to crawl away his vision blurred and he got turned around somehow icy concrete instead of smooth tile beneath his hand warned him of his mistake something seemed to seize his head halfshock halfblow with a nasty buzzing sound violently rebuffed he smelled singed hair fluorescent patterns spun on his retinas he tried to withdraw but collapsed across the doorgroove in a puddle of ice water and some slimy orange glop like gritty mold no damn it no i dont want to freeze again he curled up in desperate revulsion voices shouts of alarm footsteps babble warm oh blessed warm hands pulled him away from the deadly portal a couple of womens voices and one mans how did he get up here shouldnt have gotten out call rowan wake her up he looks terrible no a hand held his face to the light by his hair thats the way he looks anyway you cant tell the face belonging to the hand loomed over his harsh and worried it was rowans assistant the young man whod sedated him he was a lean fellow with eurasian features with a definite bridge to his nose his blue jacket said r durona insanely enough but it wasnt dr r so call him brother durona the young man was saying dangerous its incredible that he penetrated our security in that condition na secrty words his mouth was making words fire safty he added reflectively dolt the young mans face jerked back in bewildered offense are you talking to me short circuit hes talking his dr duronas face circled overhead her voice thrilled he recognized her even with her fine hair loose falling all around her face in a dark cloud rowan my love raven what did he say the youths dark brows wrinkled id swear he just said fire safety gibberish i guess rowan smiled wildly raven all the secured doors open outward without codelocks for escape in case of fire or chemical accident ordo you realize the level of understanding that reveals no said raven coldly that dolt must have stung considering its source he grinned darkly up at the hovering faces and the lobby ceiling wavering beyond them an older alto voice came in from the left restoring order disbanding the crowd if you dont have a function here get back to bed a dr durona whose shortcut hair was almost pure white the owner of the alto voice shuffled into his field of view and stared thoughtfully down at him dear heart rowan he almost escaped disabled as he is hardly an escape said brother raven even if hed somehow gotten through the force screen hed have frozen to death in twenty minutes out there tonight dressed like that how did he get out an upset dr durona confessed he must have gone past the monitor station while i was in the lav im sorry suppose he had made it this far in the daytime speculated the alto suppose he had been seen it could have been disastrous ill palmlock the door to the private wing after this the flustered dr durona promised im not sure that will be enough considering this remarkable performance yesterday he couldnt even walk still this fills me with hope as much as alarm i think we have something here we had better set a closer guard who can be spared asked rowan several dr duronas clad variously in robes and nightgowns looked at the young man aw no raven protested rowan may watch him in the daytime and continue her work you will take the night shift the whitehaired woman instructed firmly yes maam the youth sighed she gestured imperiously take him back to his room now you had better check him for damages rowan ill get a float pallet said rowan you dont need a float pallet for him scoffed raven he knelt gathered the wanderer up in his arms and grunted to his feet showing off his strength well no he weighs about as much as a wet coat come on short circuit back to bed with you muzzily indignant he suffered himself to be carried off rowan hovered apprehensively at his side across the lobby down the tube through the storage chamber and back into the peculiar buildingunderabuilding at least in response to his continued shivering she set the beds heatbubble zone to a higher temperature this time rowan examined him with particular attention to his aching scars he hasnt managed to rip anything apart inside but he seems physiologically upset it may be from the pain do you want me to give him another two ccs of sedative asked raven no just keep the room dim and quiet hes exhausted himself once he warms up i think hell sleep on his own she touched his cheek then his lips tenderly that was the second time today that he spoke do you know she wanted him to speak to her but he was too tired now and too rattled there had been a tension among those people tonight all those dr duronas that was more than medical fear for a patients safety they were very worried about something something to do with him he might be a blank to himself but they knew more and they werent telling him rowan eventually pulled her night robe more closely about herself and left raven arranged two chairs one for a seat and one for his feet settled down and began reading from a handviewer studying for he occasionally reran screens or made notes learning to be a doctor no doubt he lay back drained beyond measure his excursion tonight had nearly killed him and what had he learned for all his pains not much except this i am come to a very strange place and i am a prisoner here chapter twenty mark botharijesek and the countess were in the library of vorkosigan house going over ship specs the day before the scheduled departure do you think i would have time to stop and see my clones on komarr mark asked the countess a little wistfully would illyan let me impsec had settled on a komarran private boarding school as the clones initial depository after consultation with the countess who had in turn kept mark informed impsec liked it because it meant they had only one location to guard the clones liked it because they were together with their friends the only familiarity in their sudden new situation the teachers liked it because the clones could all be treated as one remedial class and brought up to academic speed together at the same time the young refugees had a chance to mingle with youths from normal if mostly upperclass families and begin to get a handle on socialization later when it was safer the countess was pushing for placement in fosterfamilies despite the clones awkward age and size how will they learn to form families themselves later if they have no models shed argued with illyan mark had listened in on that conversation with the most intense imaginable fascination and kept his mouth tightly shut certainly if you wish the countess now said to mark illyan will kick but thats pure reflex except i can think of one proper complaint he might have because of your destination if you encounter house bharaputra again god forbid it might be better if you dont know everything about impsecs arrangements stopping on your way back might be more prudent the countess looked as if she didnt care for the flavor of her own words but years of living with security concerns made her reasoning automatic if i encounter vasa luigi again the clones will be the least of my worries mark thought wryly what did he want of a personal visit anyway was he still trying to pass himself off as a hero a hero should be more selfcontained and austere not so desperate for praise as to pursue hisvictimsbegging for it surely hed played the fool enough no he sighed at last if any of them ever want to talk to me they can find me i guess no heroine was going to kiss him anyway the countess raised her brows at his tone but shrugged agreement led by botharijesek they turned to more practical matters involving fuel costs and lifesupport system repairs botharijesek and the countesswho mark was reminded had been a ship captain herself oncewere deep into a startlingly technical discussion involving necklin rod adjustments when the comconsole image split and simon illyans face appeared hello elena he nodded to her in the comconsoles station chair i wish to speak with cordelia please botharijesek smiled nodded muted the outgoing audio and slid aside she beckoned urgently to the countess whispering do we have trouble hes going to block us worried mark agitated as the countess settled into the comconsoles station chair hes going to nail me to the floor i know he is hush reproved the countess smiling slightly both of you sit over there and resist the temptation to talk simon is my meat she reopened her audio transmission mode yes simon what can i do for you milady illyan gave her a short nod in a word you can desist this scheme you are putting forward is unacceptable to whom simon not to me who else gets a vote security illyan growled you are security ill thank you to take responsibility for your own emotional responses and not try to shift them onto some vague abstraction or get off the line and let me talk to captain security then all right its unacceptable to me in a wordtough i request you to desist i refuse if you want to stop me ultimately youll have to generate an order for marks and my arrest i will speak to the count said illyan stiffly with the air of a man driven to a last resort hes much too ill and ive spoken with him already illyan swallowed his bluff without gagging much i dont know what you think this unauthorized venture can do besides muddy the waters maybe risk lives and cost you a small fortune well thats just the point simon i dont know what mark will be able to do and neither do you the trouble with impsec is that youve had no competition lately you take your monopoly for granted a bit of hustle will be good for you illyan sat with his teeth clenched for a short time you put house vorkosigan at triple risk with this he said at last you are endangering your last possible backup i am aware and i choose the risk do you have that right i have more right than you the government is in the biggest uproar behind closed doors that ive seen in years said illyan the centrist coalition is scrambling to find a man to replace aral and so are three other parties excellent i hope one of them may succeed before aral gets back on his feet or ill never get him to retire is that what you see in this illyan demanded a chance to end your husbands career is this loyal milady i see a chance to get him out of vorbarr sultana alive she said icily an end i have often despaired of over the years you pick your loyalties ill pick mine who is capable of succeeding him asked illyan plaintively a number of men racozy vorhalas or sendorf to name three if not there was something terribly wrong with arals leadership one mark of a great man is the legacy of men he leaves behind him to whom hes passed on his skills if you think aral so small as to have stifled all possible others around him spreading smallness like a plague then perhaps barrayar is better off without him you know i dont think that good then your argument annihilates itself you tie me in knots illyan rubbed his neck milady he said at last i didnt want to have to say this to you but have you considered the possible dangers of letting lord mark get to lord miles before anyone else she leaned back in her chair smiling her fingers lightly drumming no simon what dangers are you thinking of the temptation to promote himself illyan bit out murder miles say what you damn mean her eyes glinted dangerously so youll just have to make sure your people get to miles first wont you ive no objection damn it cordelia he cried harried you realize that if they get into trouble the first thing theyre going to do is cry to impsec for rescue the countess grinned you live to serve i believe you fellows say in your oath dont you well see snapped illyan and cut the comm whats he going to do asked mark anxiously at a guess go over my head since ive already cut him out with aral that leaves only one choice i dont think ill bother getting up i expect ill get another call here shortly distracted mark and botharijesek attempted to carry on with the ship specs mark jumped when the comm chimed again an anonymous young man appeared nodded to the countess stated lady vorkosigan emperor gregor and vanished gregors face appeared in his place looking bemused good morning lady cordelia you really ought not to stir up poor simon that way you know he deserved it she said equably i admit he has far too much on his mind at the moment suppressed panic turns him into a prick every time its what he does instead of running in circles screaming a way of coping i suppose while others of us cope by becoming overanalytical gregor murmured the countesss lip twitched and mark suddenly thought he knew who might shave the barber his security concerns are legitimate gregor continued is this jacksons whole venture wise a question that can only be answered by empirical testing so to speak i grant you simon argues sincerely buthow do you consider barrayars concerns will best be served sire thats the question you must answer im divided in mind are you divided in heart her question was a challenge she opened her hands halfplacation halfpleading one way or another youre going to be dealing with lord mark vorkosigan for a long time to come this excursion if it does nothing else will test the validity of all doubts if they are not tested they will always remain with you an unanswered itch and thats not fair to mark how very scientific he breathed they regarded each other with equal dryness i thought it might appeal to you is lord mark with you yes the countess gestured him to her side mark entered the range of the vid pickup sire so lord mark gregor studied him gravely it seems your mother wants me to give you enough rope to hang yourself mark swallowed yes sire or save yourself gregor nodded so be it good luck and good hunting thank you sire gregor smiled and cut the comm they did not hear from illyan again in the afternoon the countess took mark with her to the imperial military hospital on her daily visit to her husband mark had made that journey in her company twice before since the counts collapse he didnt much care for it for one thing the place smelled entirely too much like the clinics that had helped make a torment of his jacksonian youth he found himself remembering details of early surgeries and treatments that he thought hed altogether forgotten for another the count himself still terrified mark even laid low his personality was as powerful as his life was precarious and mark wasnt sure which teetering aspect scared him more his feet slowed to a halt in the hospital corridor outside the prime ministers guarded room and he stood in indecisive misery the countess glanced back and stopped yes i really dont want to go in there she frowned thoughtfully i wont force you but ill predict you a prediction say on oh seeress you will never regret having done so but you may deeply regret not having done so mark digested that all right he said faintly and followed her they tiptoed in quietly on the deep carpeting the drapes were open on a wide view of the vorbarr sultana cityscape sweeping down to the ancient buildings and the river that bisected the capitals heart it was a cloudy chilly rainy afternoon and grey and white mists swirled around the tops of the highest modern towers the counts face was turned to the silver light he looked abstracted bored and ill his face puffy and greenish only partly a reflection of the light and the green uniform pajamas that reminded all forcibly of his patientstatus he was peppered with monitor pads and had an oxygen tube to his nostrils ah his head turned at their entry and he smiled he keyed up a light at his bedside which cast a warmer pool of illumination that nonetheless failed to improve his color dear captain mark the countess bent to his bedside and they exchanged a longerthanformal kiss the countess swung herself up on the end of his bed and perched there crosslegged arranging her long skirt casually she began to rub his bare feet and he sighed contentedly mark advanced to about a meter distance good afternoon sir how are you feeling hell of a deal when you cant kiss your own wife without running out of breath he complained he lay back panting heavily they let me into the lab to see your new heart the countess commented its chickenheart sized already and beating away cheerfully in its little vat the count laughed weakly how grotesque i thought it was cute you would if you really want grotesque consider what you want to do with the old one after the countess advised with a wicked grin the opportunities for tasteless jokes are almost irresistible the mind reels murmured the count he glanced up at mark still smiling mark took a breath lady cordelia has explained to you what i intend to do hasnt she sir mm the counts smile faded yes watch out for your back nasty place jacksons whole yes i know so you do he turned his head to stare out the grey window i wish i could send bothari with you the countess looked startled mark could read her thought right off her face has he forgotten bothari is dead but she was afraid to ask she pasted a brighter smile on her mouth instead im taking botharijesek sir history repeats itself he struggled to sit up on one elbow and added sternly it had better not boy yhear he relaxed back into his pillows before the countess could respond and make him her face lost its tension he was clearly a little fogged but he wasnt so far out of it as to have forgotten his armsmans violent death elenas smarter than her father was ill give her that he sighed the countess finished with his feet he lay back brows drawn down apparently struggling to think of more useful advice i once thoughti only found this out when i grew old understandthat there is no more terrible fate than to become the mentor to be able to tell how yet not to do to send your protege out all bright and beautiful to stand your fire i think ive found a worse fate to send your student out knowing damn well you havent had a chance to teach enough be smart boy duck fast dont sell yourself to your enemy in advance in your mind you can only be defeated here he touched his hands to his temples i dont even know who the enemy is yet said mark ruefully theyll find you i suppose sighed the count people give themselves to you in their talking and in other ways if you are quiet and patient and let them and not in such a damn rush to give yourself to them you go batblind and deaf eh i guess so sir said mark baffled huh the count had run himself completely out of breath youll see he wheezed the countess eyed him swung herself off the bed and stood up well said mark and nodded briefly goodbye his word hung in the air insufficient cardiac conditions are not contagious dammit what are you scared of he swallowed and cautiously went nearer the count he had never touched the man except the once when trying to help load him onto the float bike afraid emboldened he held out his hand the count grasped it a brief strong grip his hand was big and square and bluntfingered a hand fit for shovels and picks swords and guns marks own hand seemed small and childlike plump and pale by contrast they had nothing in common but the grip confusion to the enemy boy whispered the count turnabout is fair play sir his father snorted a laugh mark made one final vidcall that evening his last night on barrayar he sneaked off to use the console in miless room not in secret exactly but in private he stared at the blank machine for ten minutes before spasmodically punching in the code he had obtained a middleaged blonde womans image appeared over the vid plate when the chime stopped the remains of a striking beauty made her face strong and confident her eyes were blue and humorous commodore koudelkas residence she answered formally its her mother mark choked down panic to quaver may i speak with kareen koudelka pleasemaam a blonde brow twitched i believe i know which one you are butwho may i say is calling lord mark vorkosigan he got out just a moment my lord she left the range of the vid pickup he could hear her voice fading in the distance calling kareen there was a muffled bumping in the background garbled voices a shriek and kareens laughing voice crying no delia its for me mother make her go away mine all mine out the sound of a door thumping closed on presumably flesh a yelp then a firmer and more final slam panting and tousled kareen koudelka arrived in range and gave him a starryeyed hi if not just like the look lady cassia had given ivan it was a robust and blue nearcousin mark felt faint hello he said breathlessly i called to say goodbye no dammit that was much too short what um excuse me thats not quite what i meant but im going to be traveling offplanet soon and i didnt want to leave without speaking to you again oh her smile drooped when will you come back im not sure but when i do id like to see you again well sure sure she said what a lot of joyful assumptions were embedded in that sure her eyes narrowed is there something wrong lord mark no he said hastily um was that your sister i heard in the background just now yes i had to lock her out or shed stand out of range and make faces at me while we talked her earnest air of injury was immediately spoiled when she added thats what i do to her when fellows call he was a fellow how how normal he led her on with one question after another to talk about her sisters her parents and her life private schools and cherished children the commodores family was welltodo but with some sort of barrayaranstyle work ethic driving a passion for education and accomplishment an ideal of service running like an undercurrent towing them all into their future he went awash in her words dreamily sharing she was so peaceable and real no shadow of torment nothing spoiled or deformed he felt like he was feeding not his belly but his head his brain felt warm and distended and happy a sensation nearerotic but less threatening alas after a time she became conscious of the disproportion in the conversation good heavens im babbling im sorry no i like listening to you talk thats a first in this family im lucky to get a word in edgewise i didnt talk till i was three they had me tested it turned out it was just because my sisters were answering everything for me mark laughed now they say im making up for lost time i know about lost time mark said ruefully yes ive heard a little i guess your life has been quite an adventure not an adventure he corrected a disaster maybe he wondered what his life would look like reflected in her eyes something shinier maybe when i get back i can tell you a bit about it if he got back if he brought this off im not a nice person you should know that before before what the more overextended their acquaintance became the harder it would be to tell her his repellent secrets look i you have to understand god he sounded just like botharijesek working up to her confession im kind of a mess and im not just talking about my outsides hell hell and what had this f nice young virgin to do with the arcane subtleties of psychoprogramming tortures and their erratic results what right had he to put horrors in her head i dont even know what i should tell you now was too soon he could feel that clearly but later might be too late leaving her feeling betrayed and tricked and if he continued this conversation one more minute hed drift into abjectblurting mode and lose the one bright unpoisoned thing hed found kareen tilted her head in puzzlement maybe you ought to ask the countess do you know her well to talk to oh yes she and my mother are best friends my mother used to be her personal bodyguard before she retired to have us mark sensed the shadowy league of grandmothers again powerful old women with genetic agendas he felt obscurely that there were some things a man ought to do for himself but on barrayar they used gobetweens he had in his camp an ambassadoressextraordinary to the whole female gender the countess would act for his good yeah like a woman holding down a screaming child to get it a painful vaccination that would save it from a deadly disease how much did he trust the countess did he dare trust her in this kareen before i come back do me a favor if you get a chance to talk privately to the countess ask her what she thinks you ought to know about me before we get better acquainted tell her i asked you to all right i like to talk with lady cordelia shes sort of been my mentor she makes me think i can do anything kareen hesitated if youre back by winterfair will you dance with me again at the imperial residence ball and not hide in the corner this time she added sternly if im back by winterfair i wont have to hide in the corner yes good ill hold you to your word my word as vorkosigan he said lightly her blue eyes widened oh my her soft lips parted in a blinding smile he felt like a man whos gone to spit and had a diamond pop accidentally from his lips instead and he couldnt call it back and reswallow it there must be a vorish streak in the girl to take a mans word so seriously i have to go now he said all right lord markbe careful iwhy do you say that he hadnt said a word about where he was going or why he swore my father is a soldier you have that same look in your eyes that he gets when hes lying through his teeth about some difficulty hes heading into he can never fool my mother either no girl had ever told him to be careful like she meant it he was touched beyond measure thank you kareen reluctantly he cut the comm with a gesture that was nearly a caress chapter twentyone mark and botharijesek hitched a ride from barrayar back to komarr on an impsec courier vessel very like the one theyd ridden before the last favor mark swore that he would ever ask of simon illyan this resolve lasted till they arrived at komarr orbit where mark found that the dendarii had given him his winterfair gift early all of medic norwoods personal effects had finally arrived shipped from the main dendarii fleet impsec being impsec they had opened it first so much the better they would hardly have let mark touch it if they had not convinced themselves theyd already emptied it of all its secrets with botharijeseks backing mark begged bluffed bullied and whined his way to access to it with obvious reluctance impsec admitted him under supervision to a locked room in their orbital hq but they admitted him mark turned botharijesek loose to oversee the arrangements for the ship the countesss agent had located as a dendarii shipmaster botharijesek was not only the most logical person for the logistical tasks she was probably overkill with barely a pang of conscience mark dismissed her from his thoughts to plunge into his examination of his new treasure box alone in an empty room heavenly after his first excited pass through the materialwhich included old clothing a disk library letters and souvenir knickknacks from norwoods four years of dendarii servicemark depressed was inclined to allow impsec was right there was nothing here of value nothing up any of the sleevesimpsec had checked mark set aside clothing boots mementos and all the physical effects it gave him a queer feeling to handle the old clothes marked with the wear of a body that was gone forever too damn much mortality around here he turned his attention instead to the more intellectual detritus of the medics life and career his library and technical notes impsec had gone through this same focusing before him he noted glumly he sighed and settled back in his station chair for a long slog he desperately wanted norwood to yield him the clue if only so that a man he had inadvertently led to his death might not have died so in vain i never want to be a combat commander again ever he hadnt expected it to be obvious but his connector when he finally ran across it hours later was just about as subliminal as they came it was a note handjotted on a plastic flimsy stuck in a pile of similar notes interspersed in a cryoprep training manual for emergency medical technicians all it said was see dr durona at for laboratory materials not the durona mark backpedaled to norwoods certifications and transcripts part of the medics computerized records hed already seen in the impsec files on barrayar norwood had taken his dendarii cryonics training at a certain beauchene life center a respected commercial cryorevival facility on escobar the name dr durona did not appear anywhere among his immediate instructors it did not appear on a listing of the life centers staff it did not in fact appear anywhere at all mark checked it all again to be sure there are probably lots of people named durona on escobar its not that rare a name he clutched the flimsy anyway it itched in his palm he called quinn aboard the ariel moored nearby ah she said eyeing him without favor in the vid youre back elena said you were what do you think youre doing never mind that look is there anyone here among the dendarii any medics or medtechs who were trained at the beauchene life center preferably at the same time as norwood or near his time she sighed there were three in his group red squads medic norwood and orange squads medic impsec has already asked us about that mark where are they now red squads medic was killed in a shuttle crash several months ago agh he ran his hands through his hair orange squads man is here on the ariel right mark crowed happily i have to talk to him he almost said put him on then remembered he was on impsecs private line and certainly being monitored send a personnel pod to pick me up one impsec has already interrogated him at great length and two who the hell are you to give orders elena hasnt told you much i see curious did botharijeseks dubious armsmans oath then outrank her loyalties to the dendarii or was she just too busy to chat how much time had he beenhe glanced at his chrono my god i happen to be on my way to jacksons whole very soon and if you are very nice to me i might ask impsec to release you to me and let you ride along as my guest maybe he grinned breathlessly at her the smoldering look she gave him in return was more eloquent than the bluest string of swear words hed ever heard her lips movedcounting to tenbut no sound came out when she did speak her tone was clipped to a burr ill have your pod at the stations hatch ring in eleven minutes thank you the medic was surly look ive been through this for hours on end were done i promise ill keep it brief mark assured him just one question the medic eyed mark malignantly perhaps correctly identifying him as the reason why hed been stuck shipbound in komarr orbit for the last dozen weeks when you and norwood were taking your cryonics training at beauchene life center do you ever remember meeting a dr durona handing out lab supplies maybe the place was kneedeep in doctors no can i go now the medic made to rise wait that was your one question and the impsec goons asked it before you and that was the answer you gave them wait let me think mark bit his lip anxiously the name alone was not enough to hare off on not even for him there had to be more do you ever remember norwood being in contact with a tall striking woman with eurasian features straight black hair brown eyes extremely smart he didnt dare to suggest an age it could be anywhere between twenty and sixty the medic stared at him in astonishment yeah how did you know what was she what was her relation with norwood she was a student too i think he was chasing her for a time playing off his military glamour to the hilt but i dont think he caught her do you remember her name roberta or something like that rowanna i dont remember was she from jacksons whole escobaran i thought the medic shrugged the clinic had postdoc trainees from all over the planet to take residencies in cryorevival i never talked to her i saw her with norwood a couple of times he might have figured wed try to cut him out with her so the clinic is a top place with a wide reputation we thought so wait here mark left the medic sitting in the ariels little briefing room and rushed out to find quinn he hadnt far to rush she was waiting in the corridor her boot tapping quinn quick i need a visual off sergeant tauras helmet recorder from the drop mission just one still impsec confiscated the originals you kept copies surely she smiled sourly maybe please quinn wait here she returned promptly and handed him a data disk this time she followed him into the briefing room since the secured console wouldnt take his palmprint any more no matter how he wriggled it mark perforce let her power it up he fastforwarded tauras visuals to the image he wanted a closeup of a tall darkhaired girl her head turning eyes wide mark blurred the background of the clonecreche in the view only then did he motion the medic to look hey is it her its the medic peered shes younger but its her where did you get that never mind thank you i wont take any more of your time youve been a great help the medic exited as reluctantly as he had entered staring back over his shoulder whats this all about mark quinn demanded when were on my ship and on our way ill tell you not before he had a headstart on impsec and he wasnt going to give it up if they were anything less than desperate theyd never let him go countess or no countess it was quite fair he didnt have any information impsec didnt potentially hed just put it together a little differently where the hell did you get a ship my mother gave it to me he tried not to smirk the countess rats shes turning you loose dont begrudge me my little ship quinn after all my parents gave my big brother a whole fleet of ships his eyes gleamed ill see you on board as soon as captain botharijesek reports it ready his ship not stolen nothing faked or false his by right of legitimate gift he whod never had a birthday present had one now twentytwo years worth the little yacht was a generation old formerly owned by a komarran oligarch in the balmy days before the barrayaran conquest it had been quite luxurious once but obviously had been neglected for the past ten years or so this did not represent hard times for the komarran clan mark understood they were in process of replacing it hence the sale the komarrans understood business and the vor understood the relation between business and taxation business under the new regime had recovered much of its former vigor mark had declared the yachts lounge to be the missionbriefing room he glanced around now at his invitees draped variously over the furniture secured to the carpeted deck around a fake fireplace that ran a vid program of atavistic dancing flames complete with infrared radiance quinn was there of course still in her dendarii uniform she had entirely overgrazed her fingernails and had taken to cheekbiting instead bel thorne sat silent and reserved a permanent bleakness emphasizing the fine lines around its eyes sergeant taura loomed next to thorne big and puzzled and wary it was no strikegroup mark wondered if he ought to have packed along more muscle no if there was one thing his first mission had taught him it was that if you didnt have enough force to win it was better not to engage force at all what he had done was cream off the maximum expertise the dendarii could supply on the subject of jacksons whole captain botharijesek entered and gave him a nod were on our way weve broken orbit and your pilot has the comm twenty hours to the first jump point thank you captain quinn made a place beside her for botharijesek mark sat on the fake fieldstone hearth with his back to the crackling flames his hands clasped loosely between his knees he took a deep breath welcome aboard and thank you all for coming you all understand this is not in official dendarii expedition and is neither authorized nor funded by impsec our expenses are being privately paid by countess vorkosigan you are all listed as being on unpaid personal leave with one exception i have no formal authority over any of you nor you over me we do have an urgent mutual interest which demands we pool our skills and information the first piece is the proper identity of admiral naismith youve brought captain thorne and sergeant taura up to speed on that havent you quinn bel thorne nodded old tung and i had it figured out a long time ago miless secret identity isnt as secret as he hoped im afraid it was news to me rumbled sergeant taura it sure explained a lot id wondered about though welcome to the inner circle anyway said quinn officially she turned to mark all right what do you have a connection finally oh quinn im up to my ass in connections its motive im missing now youre ahead of impsec then maybe not for long theyve sent an agent to escobar for more details on the beauchene life centertheyre bound to make the same connection i did eventually but i planned this expedition with a primary list of twenty sites on jacksons whole to recheck in depth as a result of something i found in norwoods personal effects ive altered the order of the list if miles gets revivedwhich is part of my hypothesishow long dyou think it would be till he did something to draw attention to himself not long said botharijesek reluctantly quinn nodded wryly though he could well wake amnesic for a time or forever she did not add aloud though mark could see the fear in her face its almost more normal than not in cryorevivals the thing isimpsec and we are not the only ones looking for him im getting a timingitch whose attention will he draw first mm said quinn glumly thorne and taura exchanged a worried look all right mark rubbed his hands through his hair he did not rise and pace milesfashion for one thing quinns disapproving glances made him feel like he was starting to waddle heres what i found and heres what i think when norwood was on escobar for his cryoprep training he met a certain dr roberta or rowanna durona from jacksons whole who was there also taking a residency in cryorevival they had some positive relationship enough anyway that when norwood was cornered at bharaputras he remembered her and trusted her enough to ship her the cryochamber remember norwood was also under the impression at this time that house fell was our ally because the durona group works for house fell wait a minute said quinn instantly house fell claims not to have the cryochamber mark held up a restraining hand let me give you a little jacksonian history as far as i know it about ninety or a hundred years ago my god lord mark how long is this story going to be asked botharijesek quinn glanced up sharply at her use of the barrayaran honorific bear with me you have to understand who the durona group is about ninety years ago the present baron ryovals father was setting up his arcane little genetic slavetrade the manufacture of humans to order at some point it occurred to him why hire genius from outside grow your own mental properties are the most elusive to create genetically but the old ryoval was a genius himself he started a project that culminated in the creation of a woman he named lilly durona she was to be his medical research muse his slavedoctor in both senses she grew was trained and put to work and she was brilliant about this time the old baron ryoval died not too mysteriously during an early attempt at a brain transplant i say not too mysteriously because of the character his son and successor the present baron ryoval immediately revealed his first project was to get rid of all his potential siblingrivals the old man had sired a lot of children ryovals early career is something of a jacksonian legend the eldest and most dangerous males he simply had assassinated the females and some of the younger males he sent to his bodymodification laboratories and thence to his veryprivate bordellos to service the customers on that side of the business i suppose theyre all dead by now if theyre lucky ryoval also apparently used this direct management approach on the staff he had inherited his father had handled lilly durona as a cherished treasure but the new baron ryoval threatened to send her after his sisters to satisfy the biological fantasies of his customers directly if she didnt cooperate she began to plot her escape with a despised young halfbrother of ryovals by the name of georish stauber ah baron fell said thorne thorne was looking enlightened taura fascinated quinn and botharijesek horrified the same but not yet lilly and young georish escaped to the protection of house fell in fact i gather that lilly was georishs ticket in they both set up in service to their new masters with considerable negotiated autonomy at least on lillys part it was the deal deals are as semisacred as anything can be on jacksons whole georish began to rise through the ranks of house fell and lilly began the durona research group by cloning herself again and again the durona group which is now up to thirty or forty cloned sisters serves house fell in several ways its sort of a family doctor for upper level fell executives who dont want to entrust their health to outside specialist houses like bharaputra and since house fells stock in trade is weapons theyve done rd on military poisons and biologicals and their antidotes the durona group made house fell a small fortune on peritaint and a few years later made it a huge fortune on peritaints antidote the durona group is kind of quietly famous if you follow that sort of thing which impsec does there was a pile of stuff on em even in the strippeddown files they let me see though most of this is common knowledge on jacksons whole georish not least owing to the coup he brought house fell in the person of lilly ascended to the pinnacle a few years back when he became baron fell now enter the dendarii mercenaries and now you have to tell me what happened mark nodded to bel thorne ive only caught garbled bits bel whistled i knew some of this but i dont think id ever heard the whole story no wonder fell and ryoval hate each other it glanced at quinn she nodded permission to proceed well about four years ago miles brought the dendarii a little contract it was for a pickup our employerexcuse me barrayar ive been calling them our employer for so long its a reflex keep that reflex mark advised bel nodded the imperium wanted to import a galactic geneticist i dont quite know why it glanced at quinn nor do you need to said she but a certain dr canaba who was then one of house bharaputras top genetics people wanted to defect house bharaputra takes a lethally dim view of employees departing with a head full of trade secrets so canaba needed help he struck a deal with the barrayaran imperium to take him in thats where i come from taura put in yes said thorne taura was one of his pet projects he um insisted on taking her along unfortunately the supersoldier project had recently been canceled and taura sold to baron ryoval who collects genetic excuse me sergeant oddities so we had to break her out of house ryoval in addition to breaking canaba out of house bharaputra um taura youd better say what happened next the admiral came and rescued me from ryovals main biologicals facility the big woman rumbled she heaved a large sigh as if at some sweet memory in the process of escaping we totally destroyed house ryovals main gene banks a hundredyearold tissue collection went up in smoke literally she smiled baring her fangs house ryoval lost about fifty percent of its assets that night baron fell estimated thorne added at least mark hooted then sobered that explains why you all think baron ryovals people will be hunting for admiral naismith mark said thorne desperately if ryoval finds miles first hell have him revived just so he can kill him again and again and again thats why we were all so insistent that you play miles when we were pulling out of jacksons whole ryoval has no motive to take revenge on the clone just on the admiral i see gee thanks ah whatever happened to dr canaba if i may ask he was delivered safely said quinn he has a new name a new face a new laboratory and a salary that ought to keep him happy a loyal new subject for the imperium hm well that brings me to the other crossconnection its not a new or secret one though i dont know yet what to make of it neither does impsec incidentally though as a result of it theyve sent agents to check the durona group twice baronne lotus bharaputra the barons wife is a durona clone tauras clawed hand flew to her lips that girl yes that girl i wondered why she gave me the cold chills id seen her before in another incarnation the clone of a clone the baronne is one of the oldest of lilly duronas clone daughters or sisters or whatever you want to call the tribe hive she didnt sell herself cheaply lotus went renegade for one of the biggest bribes in jacksonian historycocontrol or nearly so of house bharaputra shes been baron bharaputras mate for twenty years and now it seems shes getting one other thing the durona group among them have an astonishing range of bioexpertise but they refuse to do clonebrain transplants it was written right into lilly duronas foundationdeal with house fell but baronne bharaputra who must be over sixtystandard apparently plans to embark on her second youth very shortly judging from what we witnessed rats muttered quinn so thats another crossconnection said mark in fact its a damned cats cradle of crossconnections once you get hold of the right thread but it doesnt explain to me at least why the durona group would conceal miles from their own house fell bosses yet they must have done so if they have him quinn said gnawing on her cheek if mark conceded although he brightened slightly it would explain why that incriminating cryochamber ended up in the hegen hub the durona group wasnt trying to hide it from impsec they were trying to hide it from other jacksonians it almost all fits said thorne mark opened his hands and held them apart palm to palm as if invisible threads ran back and forth between them yeah almost he closed his hands together so here we are and there were going our first trick will be to reenter jacksonian space past fells jump point station captain quinn has brought along quite a kit for doctoring our identities coordinate your ideas with her on that one we have ten days to play with it the group broke up to study the new problems each in his her or its own way botharijesek and quinn lingered as mark rose and stretched his aching back his aching brain that was quite a pretty piece of analysis mark said quinn grudgingly if its not all hot air she ought to know thank you quinn he said sincerely he too prayed it wouldnt all turn out to be hallucinatory an elaborate mistake yes hes changed a bit i think botharijesek observed judiciously grown yeah quinns gaze swept him up and down true marks heart warmed in hungry anticipation of a crumb of approval hes fatter lets get to work mark growled chapter twentytwo he could remember studying tonguetwisters once he could even picture a whole screenlist of them black words on pale blue had it been for some sort of rhetoric course unfortunately though he could picture the screen he could only remember one of the actual lines he struggled to sit upright in bed and try it sheshells shsh she shells she shit he took a breath and started over again again his tongue seemed thick as an old sock it felt staggeringly important to recover control of his speech as long as he kept talking like an idiot they were going to keep treating him like one it could be worse he was eating real food now not sugarwater or soft sludge hed been showering and dressing on his own for two whole days no more patient gowns theyd given him a shirt and pants instead like ship knits their grey color at first pleased him hen worried him because he could not think why it pleased him she sells sea shells by the sea shore ha he lay back wheezing in triumph he glanced up to see dr rowan leaning in the doorway watching him with a slight smile still catching his breath he waved his fingers at her in greeting she pushed off and came to sit at his side on his bed she wore her usual concealing green smock and carried a sack raven said you were babbling half the night she remarked but you werent were you you were practicing yuh he nodded gotta talk cmand he touched his lips and waved vaguely around the room obey you think so do you her brows arched in amusement but her eyes beneath them regarded him sharply she shifted and swung his tray table across between them sit up my authoritarian little friend i brought you some toys secon chilhd he muttered glumly and shoved himself upright again his chest only ached at least he seemed done with the more repulsive aspects of his second infancy a second adolescence still to come god forbid maybe he could skip over that part why do i dread an adolescence i cannot remember he laughed briefly as she upended the bag and spread about two dozen parts from some disassembled hand weapons across the table test huh he began to pick them up and fit them together stunner nerve disrupter plasma arc and a projectile gun slide twist click knock home one two three four he laid them in a row powr cells dea not armin me eh theseextras he swept half a dozen spare or odd parts aside into a pile ha trick he grinned smugly at her you never pointed those at me or yourself while you were handling them she observed curiously mm didn notice she was right he realized he fingered the plasma arc doubtfully did anything come up for you while you were doing that she asked he shook his head in renewed frustration then brightened membered somthin smornin tho inna shar at speed his speech slurred into unintelligibility again a logjam of the lips in the shower she translated encouragingly tell me slow down as much as you need slow is death he enunciated clearly she blinked still tell me ah well think i wuzza boy ridin onna horse old man on nother horse uppa hill s chilly horses puffin lak i m his deep breaths were not deep enough to satisfy trees mountain two three mountain covered w trees all strung togther wf new plastic tubes runnin down to a shack a t bottom granda happy cause tubes are efficient he struggled to get that last word out intact and succeeded menr appy too what are they doing in this scene she asked sounding baffled these men he could see it again in his head the memory of a memory burnin wood makin sugar that makes no sense sugar comes from biological production vats not from burning trees said rowan trees he asserted brown sugr trees another memory wavered up the old man breaking off a chunk of something that looked like tan sandstone and giving him a taste by popping it in his mouth the feel of the gnarled old stained fingers cool against his cheek sweetness tinged with leather and horses he shivered at the overwhelming sensory blast this was real but he still could name no names granda mountains mine he added the thought made him sad and he didnt know why what own em he frowned glumly anything else no s all there is his fists clenched he straightened them spreading his fingers carefully on the tray table are you sure this wasnt a dream from last night wo inna shar he insisted its very strange this i expected she nodded to the reassembled weapons and began putting them back in the cloth bag that a toss of her head indicated his little story doesnt fit trees made out of sugar sound pretty dreamlike to me doesnt fit what a desperate excitement surged through him he grabbed her around one slim wrist trapping her hand with a stunner still in it doesn fi wha wha d you know nothing na nothin that hurts she said levelly he let go of her instantly na nothin he insisted again somthin wha she sighed finished bagging the weapons and sat back and studied him it was a true statement that we did not know who you were it is now a truer statement that we are not sure which one you are i gotta choice tell me you are at a tricky stage of your recovery cryorevival amnesiacs seldom recover all of their memories at once it comes in little cascades a typical bellcurve a few at first then a growing mass then it trails off a few last holes may linger for years since you had no other gross cranial injuries my prognosis is that you will eventually recover your whole personality but a most sinister but he stared at her beseechingly at this stage on the verge of cascading a cryoamnesic can be so hungry for identity hell pick up a mistaken one and start assembling evidence to support it it can take weeks or months to get it straightened out again in your case for special reasons i think this is not only more than usually possible it could be more than usually difficult to detangle again i have to be very very careful not to suggest anything to you that i am not absolutely certain about and its hard because im theorizing in my head probably just as urgently as you are i have to be sure that anything you give me really comes from you and is not a reflection of some suggestion on my part oh he sagged back in bed horribly disappointed there is a possible shortcut she added he surged back up again wha gimme there is a drug called fastpenta one of its derivatives is a psychiatric sedative but its usual use is as an interrogation drug its actually a misnomer to call it a truth serum though laymen insist on doing so i know faspent his brows drew down he knew something important about fastpenta what was it it has some extremely relaxing effects and sometimes in cryorevival patients it can trigger memory cascades ah however it can also be embarrassing under its influence people will happily talk about whatever crosses their minds even their most intimate and private thoughts good medical ethics requires me to warn you about that also some people are allergic to the drug whered you learn goo medcal ethics he asked curiously strangely she flinched escobar she said and eyed him where we now id rather not say just yet how could that contamnate m memry he demanded indignantly i can tell you soon i think she soothed soon mm he growled she pulled a little white packet from her coat pocket opened it and peeled off a plasticbacked dot hold out your arm he obeyed and she pressed the dot against the underside of his forearm patch test she explained because of what i theorize about your line of work i think you have a higher than normal chance of allergy artificiallyinduced allergy she peeled the dot away againit prickledand gazed closely at his arm a pink spot appeared she frowned at it does that itch she asked suspiciously no he lied and clenched his right hand to keep from scratching at the spot a drug to give him his mind backhe had to have it turn white again blast you he thought to the pink splotch you seem to be a little sensitive she mused marginally pleassse her lips twisted in doubt well what do we have to lose ill be right back she exited and returned shortly with two hyposprays which she laid on the tray table this is the fastpenta she pointed and this is the fastpenta antagonist you let me know right away if you start to feel strange itch tingle have trouble breathing or swallowing or if your tongue starts to feel thick feels thck now he objected as she pushed up both his sleeves on his thin white arms and pressed the first spray to the inside of his elbow how dl tell youll be able to tell now just lie back and relax you should start to feel dreamy like youre floating by the time you count backward from ten try it te nan ei seben si fav fo treetwowun he did not feel dreamy he felt tense and nervous and miserable you sure yo go rat one his fingers began to drum on the tray table the sound was unnaturally loud in his ears objects in the room were taking on hard bright outlines with colored fringes rowans face seemed suddenly drained of personality an ivory mask the mask loomed threateningly toward him whats your name it hissed i i yiyi his mouth clogged with stutters he was the invisible eye nameless strange the mask murmured your blood pressure should be going down not up abruptly he remembered what was so important about fastpenta faspentmaksmeyper she shook her head in noncomprehension yiper he reiterated out of a mouth that seemed to be seizing up in spasms he wanted to talk a thousand words rushed to his tongue a chaincollision along his nerves ya ya ya this isnt usual she frowned at the hypospray still in her hand no sht his arms and legs drew up like coiled springs rowans face grew charming like a dolls his heart raced the room wavered as if he were swimming underwater with an effort he uncoiled he had to relax he had to relax right now do you remember anything she asked her dark eyes were like pools liquid and beautiful he wanted to swim in those eyes to shine in them he wanted to please her he wanted to coax her out of that green cloth armor to dance naked with him in the starlight to his mumbles to this effect suddenly found voice in poetry of a sort actually it was a very dirty limerick playing on some obvious symbolism involving wormholes and jumpships fortunately it came out rather garbled to his relief she smiled but there was some unfunny association las time i recited that sombod beat shit outta me wuz i faspent then too alertness coursed through her lovely long body youve been given fastpenta before what else do you remember about it is name wuz galen angry wi me doan know why he remembered a reddening face wavering over him radiating an implacable murderous hatred blows raining on him he searched himself for remembered fear and found it oddly mixed with pity i doan unnerstan what else did he ask you about doan know told im nother poem you recited poetry at him under fastpenta interrogation fer hours made im mad as hell her brows rose one finger touched her soft lips which parted in delight you beat a fastpenta interrogation remarkable lets not talk about poetry then but you remember ser galen huh galen fit he cocked his head anxiously ser galen yes the name was important she recognized it tell me im not sure every time i think im taking a step forward with you we seem to go two sideways and one back lak to step out wi you he confided and listened to himself in horror as he went on to describe briefly and crudely what else he would like to do with her ah ah sorry mlady he stuffed his fingers into his mouth and bit them its all right she soothed its the fastpenta noizza testostrone she laughed outright it was most encouraging but his momentary elation was drowned again in a new wash of tension his hands plucked and twisted at his clothing and his feet twitched she frowned at a medical monitor on the wall your blood pressure is still going up charming as you are under fastpenta this is not a normal reaction she picked up the second hypospray i think wed better stop now m not a normal man he said sadly mutant a wave of anxiety rushed over him you gonna tak my brain out he asked in sudden suspicion eyeing the hypospray and then in a mindblinding blast of realization hey i know where i am im on jacksons whole he stared at her in terror jumped to his feet and bolted for the door dodging her lunge no wait wait she called running after him with the glittering hypospray still in her hand youre having a drug reaction stop let me get rid of it poppy grab him he dodged the horsetailhaired dr durona in the lab corridor and flung himself into the lift tube boosting himself up with yanks on the safety ladder that sent bolts of searing pain through his halfhealed chest muscles a whirling chaos of corridors and floors shouts and running footsteps resolved at last into the lobby he had found before he shot past some workmen maneuvering a floatpallet stacked with cases through the transparent doors no force screen shocked him backward this time a greenparkad guard turned in slow motion drawing a stunner mouth open on a shout that emerged as thickly as cold oil he blinked in blinding grey daylight at a ramp a paved lot for vehicles and dirty snow ice and gravel bit his bare feet as he ran gasping across the lot a wall enclosed the compound there was a gate in the wall open and more guards in green parkas dont stun him a woman yelled from behind him he ran into a grimy street and barely dodged a groundcar the piercing greywhiteness alternated with bursts of color in his eyes a broad open space across the street was dotted with bare black trees with branches like clutching claws straining at the sky he glimpsed other buildings behind walls farther down the street looming and strange nothing was familiar in this landscape he made for the open space and the trees black and magenta dizziness clouded his eyes the cold air seared his lungs he staggered and fell rolling onto his back unable to breathe half a dozen dr duronas pounced on him like wolves upon their kill they took his arms and legs and pulled him up off the snow rowan dashed up her face strained a hypospray hissed they hustled him back across the roadway like a trussed sheep and hurried him inside the big white building his head began to clear but his chest was racked with pain as if it were clamped in a squeezing vise by the time they put him back in his bed in the underground clinic the druginduced false paranoia had washed out of his system to be replaced by real paranoia do you think anyone saw him an alto voice asked anxiously gate guards another voice bit out delivery crew anybody else i dont know rowan panted her hair escaping in snowdampened wisps half a dozen groundcars went by while we were chasing him i didnt see anyone in the park i saw a couple of people walking volunteered another dr durona at a distance across the pond they were looking at us but i doubt they could see much we were a hell of a show for a few minutes what happened this time rowan the whitehaired alto dr durona demanded wearily she shuffled closer and stared at him leaning on a carved walking stick she did not seem to carry it as an affectation but as a real prop all deferred to her was this the mysterious lilly i gave him a dose of fastpenta rowan reported stiffly to try and jog his memory it works sometimes for cryorevivals but he had a reaction his blood pressure shot up he went paranoid and he took off like a whippet we didnt run him down till he collapsed in the park she was still catching her own breath he saw as his agony started to recede the old dr durona sniffed did it work rowan hesitated some odd things came up i need to talk with lilly immediately said the old dr duronanotlilly apparently i but she was cut off when his shivering stuttering attempt to talk blended into a convulsion the world turned to confetti for a moment he came back to focus with two of the women holding him down rowan hovering over him snapping orders and the rest of the duronas scattering ill come up as soon as i can said rowan desperately over her shoulder i cant leave him now the old dr durona nodded understanding and withdrew rowan waved away a proffered hypospray of some anticonvulsant im writing a standing order this man gets nothing without a sensitivity scan first she ran off most of her helpers and made the room dim and quiet and warm again slowly he recovered the rhythm of his breath though he was still very sick to his stomach im sorry she told him i didnt realize fastpenta could do that to you he tried to say its not your fault but his powers of speech seemed to have relapsed dddi diddi do bad thing she took far too long to reply maybe it will be all right two hours later they came with a floatpallet and moved him were getting some other patients dr chrys of the winghair told him blandly we need your room lies halftruths where they moved him to puzzled him most of all he had visions of a locked cell but instead they took him upstairs via a freight lift tube and deposited him on a campbed set up in rowans personal suite it was one of a row of similar chambers presumably the duronas residencefloor her suite consisted of a sitting roomstudy and a bedroom plus a private bath it was reasonably spacious though cluttered he felt less like a prisoner than like a pet being smuggled against the rules into some womens dormitory though he had seen another malemorph dr durona besides raven a man of about thirty dr chrys had addressed as hawk birds and flowers they were all birds and flowers in this concrete cage later still a young durona brought dinner on a tray and he ate together with rowan at a little table in her sitting room as the grey day outside faded to dusk he supposed there was no real change in his prisonerpatient status but it felt good to be out of the hospitalstyle room free of the monitors and sinister medical equipment to be doing something so prosaic as having dinner with a friend he walked around the sitting room after they ate mind f i look it your things go ahead let me know if anything comes up for you she still would not tell him anything directly about himself but she low seemed willing at least to talk about herself his internal picture of the world shifted as they spoke why do i have wormhole maps in my head maybe he was going to have to recover himself the hard way learn everything that existed in the universe and whatever was left that dwarfishmanshaped hole in the center would be him by process of elimination a daunting task he stared out the polarized window at the faint glitter hanging in he air as if fairy dust were falling all around he recognized the force screen for what it was now an improvement in cognition over is initial headfirst encounter with it the shield was militarygrade he realized impermeable down to viruses and gas molecules and up to what projectiles and plasma certainly must be a powerful generator around here somewhere the protection was a late addon to the buildings architecture not incorporated into its design some history inherent there we are on jacksons whole aren we he asked yes what does that mean to you danger bad things happenin what is this pla he waved around the durona clinic ya so what you do whym i here we are the personal clinic of house fell we do all sorts of medical tasks for them as needed house fell weapons the associations fell into place quite automatically biological weapons he eyed her accusingly sometimes she admitted and biological defenses too was he a house fell trooper a captured enemy trooper hell what army would employ a halfcrippled dwarf as any kind of trooper house fell give me to you to do no no swhym i here thats been a great puzzle for us too you arrived frozen in a cryochamber with every sign of having been prepped in great haste a crate addressed to me via common carrier with no return address we hoped if we revived you you could tell us s more goin on than that yes she said frankly bu you won tell me not yet wha happens if i walk outta here she looked alarmed please dont that could get you killed again again she nodded by who that depends on who you are he veered off the subject then ran the conversation around to it three more times but could not lull or trick her into telling him any more about himself exhausted he gave up for the night only to lie awake on his cot worrying the problem as a predator might worry a carcass but all his bonetossing did no good but to freeze his mind with frustration sleep on it he told himself tomorrow must bring him something new whatever else this situation was it wasnt stable he felt that felt balanced as though on a knifeedge below him lay darkness concealing feathers or sharpened stakes or maybe nothing at all an endless fall he wasnt quite sure of the rationale behind the hot bath and the therapeutic massage exercise now he could see that dr chrys had lugged in an exercise bicycle to rowans study and let him sweat himself near to passing out anything that painful must be good for him no pushups yet though hed tried one and collapsed with a wideeyed muffled squeak of agony and been yelled at quite firmly by an irate dr chrys for attempting unauthorized bodily motions dr chrys had made notes and gone off again leaving him to rowans tenderer mercies he lay now steaming gently in rowans bed dressed in a towel while she reviewed skeletomuscular structure all up and down his back dr chryss fingers doing massage had been like probes rowans hands caressed not anatomically equipped to purr he did manage a small encouraging moan of appreciation now and then she worked down to his feet and toes and started back up face down mashed comfortably into her pillows he became gradually aware that a very important bodily system was reporting for duty for the first time since his revival reserection indeed his face flushed in a mixture of embarrassment and delight and he flung an arm up asifcasually to conceal his expression shes your doctor shell want to know it wasnt as if she werent intimately familiar with every part of his body inside and out already shed been up to her bloody elbows in him literally he stayed hidden in his armcave anyway roll over rowan said and ill do your other side er drather not he mumbled into the pillow why not um member how you keep askin if somethin has come up for me yes well somethin has there was a brief silence then oh in that case definitely roll over i need to examine you he took a breath things we do fer science he rolled over and she took away his towel has this happened before she inquired no firs time in my life this life her long cool fingers probed quickly medically that looks good she said with enthusiasm thank you he carolled cheerfully she laughed he didnt need a memory to tell him it was a very good sign when a woman laughed at his jokes at this point experimentally gently he pulled her down to face him hooray for science lets see what happens he kissed her she kissed him back he melted speech and science were both put aside for a time after that not to mention the green coat and all the layers underneath her body was as lovely as hed imagined a pure aesthetic of line and curve softness and floral hidden places his own body contrasted vividly a little rack of bones scored with shocking red scars an intense consciousness of his recent death welled up in him and he found himself kissing her frantically passionately as if she were life itself and he could so consume and possess her he didnt know if she was enemy or friend if this was a right or wrong thing but it was warm and liquid and moving not icy and still surely the most opposite thing imaginable to cryostasis seize the day because the night waited coldly implacable this lesson burned from his center outward like radiation her eyes widened only his shortness of breath forced him to slow down to a more decorous reasonable pace his ugliness ought to have bothered him but it didnt and he wondered why we make love with our eyes closed who had told him that the same woman whod told him its not the meat its the motion opening rowans body was like facing that pile of fieldstripped weaponry he knew what to do what parts counted and which were camouflage but could not remember how hed learned it all the training was there yet the trainer was erased it was a more deeply disturbing coupling of the familiar with the strange than any hed yet experienced here she shivered sighed and relaxed and he kissed his way back up her body to murmur in her ear um doan think i can do pushups jus yet oh her glazed eyes opened and focused my yes a few moments of experiment found a medicallyapproved position flat on his back in great comfort with no pressure or strain on his chest arms or abdomen and then it was his turn that felt right ladies first and then he wouldnt have pillows thrown at him for falling asleep immediately afterwards a terribly familiar pattern with all the details wrong rowan had done this before too he judged though perhaps not often but great expertise on her part was scarcely required his body worked just fine dr d he sighed up at her yr a genius aes asku aesch that greek guy coul tak lessons in resurrction from you she laughed and oozed down beside him body to body my height doesnt matter when were lying down hed known that too they exchanged lesshurried exploratory kisses savored slowly like afterdinner mints youre very good at that she murmured wheezily nibbling on his ear yea his grin faded and he stared at the ceiling brows drawing down in a combination of gentle postcoital melancholy and renewed if purely mental frustration wonder if i was married her head drew back and he could have bitten his tongue at her stricken look doan think so he added quickly no no she settled back again youre not married which ever one i am thats right huh he hesitated winding her long hair in his fingers spreading it idly out in a fan across the burst of red lines on his torso so who dyou think you were makin love to jus now she touched a long index finger gently to his forehead you just you this was most pleasing but wuzzat love or therapy she smiled quizzically tracing his face a little of both i think and curiosity and opportunity ive been pretty immersed in you for the past three months it felt like an honest answer seems tme you made t opportunity a small smirk escaped her lips well maybe three months interesting so hed been dead a bit over two months he must have absorbed a lot of the durona groups resources in that time to begin with three months of this womans labor were not cheap why you doin this he asked frowning at the ceiling as she snuggled carefully around his shoulder i mean twhole thing what dyou expect me to do for you halfcrippled tonguetied blank and stupid not a dollar to his nonexistent name youre all hangin on mrecovery like im your hope f heaven even the brutally efficient physical therapist chrys hed come to see as pushing him for his good he almost liked her best for her merciless drive he resonated to it who else wants me tha you should hide me enemies or friends enemies for certain rowan sighed mm he lay back in lassitude she dozed he didnt he touched her net of hair and wondered what did she see in him i thought it as the enchanted knights crystal coffin i picked out enough grenade fragments to be certain you werent a bystander so there was work to be done nor did the durona group want any ordinary mercenary if this was jacksons whole they could hire ordinary thugs by the boatload but then hed never thought he was an ordinary man not even for a minute oh milady who do you need me to be chapter twentythree the rediscovery of sex fairly immobilized him for the next three days but his instinct for escape surfaced one afternoon when rowan left him sleeping but he wasnt he unlidded his eyes and traced the pattern of scars on his chest and thought it over out was clearly a wrong direction in was one he hadnt tried yet everybody here seemed to go to lilly with their problems very well he would go to lilly too up or down as a jacksonian leader she ought traditionally to lodge in either a penthouse or a bunker baron ryoval lived in a bunker or at least there was a dim image in his head associated with that name involving shadowy subbasements baron fell took the penthouse at apogee looking down on it all from his orbital station he seemed to have a lot of pictures in his head of jacksons whole was it his home the thought confused him up up and in he dressed in his grey knits borrowed some of rowans socks and slipped into the corridor he found a lift tube and took it to the top floor just one above rowans it was another floor of residence suites at its center he found another lift tube palmlocked any durona could use it a spiral staircase wound around it he climbed the stairs very slowly and waited near the top till he had all his breath back he knocked on the door it slid aside and a slim eurasian boy of about ten regarded him gravely what do you want the boy frowned i want to see your grandmother bring him in robin a soft voice called the boy ducked his head and motioned him inside his sock feet trod noiselessly across a deep carpet the windows were polarized against the dark grey afternoon and pools of warmer yellower lamplight fought the gloom beyond the window the force field revealed itself with tiny scintillations as water droplets or particulars matter were detected and repelled or annihilated a shrunken woman sat in a wide chair and watched him approach her through dark eyes set in a face of old ivory she wore a highnecked black silk tunic and loose trousers her hair was pure white and very long a slim girl most literally twin to the boy was brushing it over the back of the chair in long long strokes the room was very warm regarding her regarding him he wondered how he could ever have thought that worried old woman with the cane might be lilly hundredyearold eyes looked at you differently maam he said his mouth felt suddenly dry sit down she nodded to a short sofa set around the corner of the low table in front of her violet dear a thin hand all white wrinkles and blue ropy veins touched the girls hand which had paused protectively on her black silk shoulder bring tea now three cups robin please go downstairs and get rowan the girl arranged the hair in a falling fan around the womans upright torso and the two children vanished in unchildlike silence clearly the durona group did not employ outsiders no chance of a mole ever penetrating their organization with equal obedience he sank into the seat shed indicated her vowels had a vibrato of age but her diction containing them was perfect have you come to yourself sir she inquired no maam he said sadly only to you he thought carefully about how to phrase his question lilly would not be any less medically careful than rowan about yielding him clues why cant you identify me her white brows rose well put you are ready for an answer i think ah the lift tube hummed and rowans alarmed face appeared she hurried out lilly im sorry i thought he was asleep its all right child sit down pour the tea for violet reappeared around the corner bearing a large tray lilly whispered to the girl behind a faintly trembling hand and she nodded and scampered off rowan knelt in what appeared to be a precise old ritualhad she once held violets place he rather thought soand poured green tea into thin white cups and handed it round she sat at lillys knees and stole a brief reassuring touch of the white hair coiled there the tea was very hot since hed lately taken a deep dislike to cold this pleased him and he sipped carefully answers maam he reminded her cautiously rowans lips parted in a negative alarmed breath lilly crooked up one finger and quelled her background said the old woman i believe the time has come to tell you a story he nodded and settled back with his tea once upon a time she smiled briefly there were three brothers a proper fairy tale ai the eldest and original and two young clones the eldestas happens in these taleswas born to a magnificent patrimony titlewealthcomforthis father if not exactly a king commanded more power than any king in prejump history and thus he became the target of many enemies since he was known to dote upon his son it occurred to more than one of his enemies to try and strike at him through his only child hence this peculiar multiplication she nodded at him it made his belly shiver he sipped more tea to cover his confusion she paused can you name any names yet no maam mm she abandoned the fairy tale her voice grew more clipped lord miles vorkosigan of barrayar was the original he is now about twentyeight standard years old his first clone was made right here on jacksons whole twentytwo years ago a purchase by a komarran resistance group from house bharaputra we do not know what this clone names himself but the komarrans elaborate substitution plot failed about two years ago and the clone escaped galen he whispered she glanced sharply at him he was the chief of those komarrans yes the second clone is a puzzle the best guess is that he was manufactured by the cetagandans but no one knows he first appeared about ten years ago as a fullblown and exceptionally brilliant mercenary commander claiming the quite legal betan name of miles naismith in his maternal line he has shown himself no friend to the cetagandans so the theory that he is a cetagandan renegade has a certain compelling logic no one knows his age though obviously he can be no more than twentyeight she took a sip of her tea it is our belief that you are one of those two clones shipped to you like a crate of frozen meat with my chest blown out yes so what cloneseven frozen onescant be a novelty here he glanced at rowan let me go on about three months ago bharaputras manufactured clone returned homewith a crew of mercenary soldiers at his back that he had apparently stolen from the dendarii fleet by the simple expedient of pretending to be his clonetwin admiral naismith he attacked bharaputras clonecreche in an attempt to either steal or possibly free a group of clones slated to be the bodies for brain transplants a business which i personally loathe he touched his chest he failed no but admiral naismith followed in hot pursuit of his stolen hip and troops in the melee that ensued downside at bharaputras main surgical facilities one of the two was killed the other escaped along with the mercenaries and most of bharaputras very valuable clonecattle they made a fool of vasa luigii laughed myself sick when i first heard about it she sipped tea demurely he could actually almost picture her doing so though it made his eyes cross slightly before they jumped the dendarii mercenaries posted a reward for the return of a cryochamber containing the remains of a man they claim to have been the bharaputranmade clone his eyes widened me she held up a hand vasa luigi baron bharaputra is absolutely convinced that they were lying and that the man in the box was really their admiral naismith me he said less certainly georish stauber baron fell refuses to even guess and baron ryoval would tear a town apart for even a fifty percent chance of laying hands on admiral naismith who injured him four years ago as no one has in a century her lips curved in a scalpelsmile it all made sense which made no sense at all it was like a story heard long ago in childhood and reencountered in another lifetime familiarity under glass he touched his head which ached rowan matched the gesture with concern dont you have medical records something at some risk we obtained the developmental records of bharaputras clone unfortunately they only go up to age fourteen we have nothing on admiral naismith alas one cannot run a triangulation on one data point he turned toward rowan you know me inside and out cant you tell youre strange rowan shook her head half your bones are plastic replacement parts do you know the real ones that are left show old breaks old traumas id guess you not only older than bharaputras clone ought to be id guess you older than the original lord vorkosigan and that makes no sense if we could just get one solid certain clue the memories youve reported so far are terribly ambiguous you know weapons as the admiral mightbut bharaputras clone was trained as an assassin you remember ser galen and only bharaputras clone should do that i found out about those sugar trees theyre called maple trees and they originate on earthwhere bharaputras clone was taken for training and so on she flung up her hands in frustration if youre not getting the right answer he said slowly maybe youre not asking the right question so what is the right question he shook his head mutely why his hands spread why not turn my frozen body over to the dendarii and collect the reward why not sell me to baron ryoval if he wants me so much why revive me i wouldnt sell a laboratory rat to baron ryoval lilly stated flatly she twitched a brief smile old business between us how old older than he whoever he was as for the dendariiwe may deal with them yet depending on who you are they were approaching the heart of the matter he could sense it yes four years ago admiral naismith visited jacksons whole and besides counting a most spectacular coup on ry ryoval left with a certain dr hugh canaba one of bharaputras top genetics people now i knew canaba more to the point i know what vasa luigi and lotus paid to get him here and how many house secrets he was privy to they would never have let him go alive yet hes gone and no one on jacksons whole has ever been able to trace him she leaned forward intently assuming canaba was not just disposed of out an airlockadmiral naismith has shown he can get people out in fact its a speciality hes famous for that is our interest in him you want offplanet he glanced around at lilly duronas comfortable selfcontained little empire why i have a deal with georish stauberbaron fell its a very old deal as we are very old dealers my time is surely running out and georish is growing she grimaced unreliable if i dieor if he diesor if he succeeds in having his brain transplanted to a younger body as he has attempted at least once to arrangeour old deal will be broken the durona group might be offered less admirable deals than the one we have enjoyed so long with house fell it might be broken upsoldweakened so as to invite attack from old enemies like ry who remembers an insult or an injury forever it might be forced to work it does not choose ive been looking for a way out for the last couple of years admiral naismith knows one she wanted him to be admiral naismith obviously the most valuable of the two clones what if im the other one he stared at his hands they were just his hands no hints there you might be ransomed by whom washe savior or commodity what a choice rowan looked uneasy what am i to you if i cant remember who i am no one at all little man her dark eyes glinted momentarily like obsidian chips this woman had survived nearly a century on jacksons whole it would not do to underestimate her ruthlessness on the basis of one picky prejudice about clonebrain transplants they finished their tea and retreated to rowans room what in all that seemed familiar to you rowan asked him anxiously when they were alone on her little sofa all of it he said in deep perplexity and yetlilly seems to think i can spirit you all away like some kind of magician but even f i am admiral naismith i cant remember how i did it sh she tried to calm him youre ripe for memorycascade i swear i can almost see it starting your speech has improved vastly in just the last few days all that therapeutic kissing he smiled a suggestive compliment hat won him as hed hoped some more therapy but when he came up for air he said it wont come back to me if im the other one i remember galen earth a house in london whats the clones name we dont know she said and at his exasperated grasp of her bands added no we really dont admiral naismith shouldnt be miles naismith he should be mark pierre vorkosigan how the hell did he know that mark pierre piotr pierre peter peter pumpkin eater had a wife and wouldnt keep her a taunt from out of a crowd that had put an old man into a terrifying murderous rage hed had to be restrained by the image escaped him granda if the bharaputramade clone is the third son he could be named anything something wasnt right he tried to imagine admiral naismiths childhood as a cetagandan secret covert ops project his childhood it must have been extraordinary if hed not only escaped at the age of eighteen or less but invaded cetagandan intelligence and established his fortune within a year but he could think of nothing from such a youth a complete blank what are you going to do with me if im not naismith keep me is a pet for how long rowan pursed her lips in worry if you are the bharaputranmade cloneyoure going to need to get off jacksons whole yourself the dendarii raid made an awful mess out of vasa luigis headquarters he has blood to avenge as well as property and pride if its the caseill try to get you out you or you all ive never gone against the group she rose and paced across her sitting room yet i lived a year on escobar alone when i was taking my cryorevival training ive often wondered what it would be like to be half of a couple instead of onefortieth of a group would i feel bigger were you bigger when you were all of one on escobar i dont know its a silly conceit stillone cant help thinking of lotus lotus baronne bharaputra the one who left your group yes lillys oldest daughter after rose lilly says if we dont hang together well all hang separately its a reference to an ancient method of execution that i know what hanging is he said hastily before she could go into the medical details rowan stared out her window jacksons whole is no place to be alone you cant trust anybody an interesting paradox makes for quite a dilemma she searched his face for irony found it and frowned its no joke indeed even lilly duronas selfreferential maternal strategy hadnt quite solved the problem as lotus had proved he eyed her were you ordered to sleep with me he asked suddenly she flinched no she paced again but i did ask permission lilly said to go ahead it might help attach you to our interests she paused does that seem terribly cold to you on jacksons wholemerely prudent and attachments surely ran two ways jacksons whole was no place to be alone but you cant trust anyone if anyone was sane here he swore it was by accident reading an exercise that had at first given him a stabbing sensation in the eyes and instant excruciating headaches was getting easier he could go for up to ten minutes at a time now before it became too blinding to bear holed up in rowans study he pushed himself to the limits of pain an informationbite a few minutes rest and try again beginning at the center outward he read up first on jacksons whole its unique history nongovernmental structure and the one hundred and sixteen great houses and countless houses minor with their interlocking alliances and vendettas roiling deals and betrayals the durona group was well on its way to growing into a house minor in its own right he judged budding from house fell like a hydra also like a hydra reproducing asexually mentions of houses bharaputra hargraves dyne ryoval and fell triggered images in his head that did not come from the vid display a few of them were even starting to crossconnect too few he wondered if it was significant that the houses that seemed most familiar were also the ones most famous for dealing in offplanet illegalities whoever i am i know this place and yet his visions tasted small in scope too shallow to represent a formative lifetime maybe hed been a small person still it was more than he could dredge up from his subconscious regarding the youth of the putative admiral naismith the cetagandanproduced clone granda those had been memories with mass an almost stunning sensory weight who was granda jacksonian fosterer komarran mentor cetagandan trainer someone huge and fascinating mysterious and old and dangerous granda had no source he seemed to come with the universe sources perhaps a study of his progenitor the crippled barrayaran lordling vorkosigan might yield up something hed been made in vorkosigans image after all which was a hell of a thing to do to any poor sod he pulled up a listing of references to barrayar from rowans comconsole library there were some hundreds of nonfiction books vids documents and documentaries for the sake of a frame he began with a general history scanning rapidly the fiftythousand firsters wormhole collapse the time of isolation the bloody centuries the rediscovery the words blurred his head felt full to bursting familiar so achingly familiar he had to stop panting he darkened the room and lay down on the little sofa till his eyes stopped throbbing but then if hed ever been trained to replace vorkosigan it all ought to be very familiar indeed hed have had to study barrayar forward and backward i have he wanted to beg rowan to shackle him to a wall and give him another dose of fastpenta regardless of what it did to his blood pressure the stuff had almost worked maybe another try the door hissed hello the lights came up rowan stood in the doorway are you all right headache reading you shouldnt try to take it so fast he supplied silently rowans constant refrain of the last few days since his interview with lilly but this time she cut herself off he pushed up she came and sat by him lilly wants me to bring you upstairs all right he made to rise but she stopped him she kissed him it was a long long kiss which at first delighted and then worried him he broke away to ask rowan whats the matter i think i love you this is a problem only my problem she managed a brief unhappy smile ill handle it he captured her hands traced tendon and vein she had brilliant hands he did not know what to say she drew him to his feet come on they held hands all the way to the entrance to the penthouse lifttube when she disengaged to press the palm lock she did not take his hand again they rose together and exited around the chromium railing into lillys living room lilly sat upright and formal in her wide padded chair her white hair braided today in a single thick rope that wound down over her shoulder to her lap she was attended by hawk who stood silently behind her and to her right not an attendant a guard three strangers dressed in grey quasimilitary uniforms with white trim were ranged around her two women seated and a man standing one of the women had dark curls and brown eyes that turned on him with a gaze that scorched him the other older woman had short lightbrown hair barely touched with grey but it was the man who riveted him my god its the other me or notme they stood eye to eye this one was painfully neat boots clean uniform pressed and formal his mere appearance a salute to lilly insignia glinted on his collar admiral naismith naismith was the name stitched over the left breast of his officers pocketed undress jacket a sharp intake of breath an electric snap of the grey eyes and a halfsuppressed smile made the short mans face wonderfully alive but if he was a bony shadow of himself this one was him doubled stocky squaredoff muscular and intense heavyjowled and with a notable gut he looked like a senior officer bodymass balanced over stout legs spread in an aggressive parade rest like an overweight bulldog so this was naismith the famous rescuer so desired by lilly he could believe it his utter fascination with his clonetwin was penetrated by a growing dreadful realization im the wrong one lilly had just spent a fortune reviving the wrong clone how angry was she going to be for a jacksonian leader such a vast mistake must feel like counting coup on yourself indeed lillys face was set and stern as she glanced toward rowan its him all right breathed the woman with the burning eyes her hands were clenched in tight fists in her lap do i know you maam he said politely carefully her torchlike heat perturbed him halfconsciously he moved closer to rowan her expression was like marble only a slight widening of her eyes like a woman drilled neatly through the solar plexus by a laser beam revealed a depth of what feeling love hate tension his headache worsened as you see said lilly alive and well let us return to the discussion of the price the round table was littered with cups and crumbshow long had this conference been going on whatever you want said admiral naismith breathing heavily we pay and go any price within reason the brownhaired older woman gave her commander an oddly quelling look we came for a man not an animated body a botched revival suggests a discount for damaged goods to my mind that voice that ironic alto voice i know you his revival is not botched said rowan sharply if there was a problem it was in the prep the hot woman jerked and frowned fiercely but in fact hes making a good recovery measurable progress every day its just too soon youre pushing too hard a glance at lilly the stress and pressure slow down the very results they seek to hurry he pushes himself too hard he winds himself in knots so that lilly held up a placating hand so speaks my cryorevival specialist she said to the admiral your clonebrother is in a recovering state and may be expected to improve if that is in fact what you desire rowan bit her lip the hot woman chewed on her fingertip now we come to what i desire lilly continued and you may be pleased to learn it isnt money let us discuss a little recent history recent in my view that is admiral naismith glanced out the big square windows framing another dark jacksonian winter afternoon with low scudding clouds starting to spit snow the force screen sparkled silently eating the ice spicules recent history is much on my mind maam he said to lilly if you know it you know why i dont wish to linger here get to your point not nearly oblique enough for jacksonian business etiquette but lilly nodded how is dr canaba these days admiral what succinctly for a jacksonian lilly again described her interest in the fate of the absconded geneticist yours is the organization that made hugh canaba completely disappear yours is the organization that lifted ten thousand marilacan prisoners of war from under the noses of their cetagandan captors on dagoola four though i admit they have spectacularly notdisappeared somewhere between those two proven extremes lies the fate of my little family you will pardon my tiny joke if i say you appear to me to be just what the doctor ordered naismiths eyes widened he rubbed his face sucked air through his teeth and managed a strainedlooking grin i see maam well in fact such a project as you suggest might be quite negotiable particularly if you think you might like to join dr canaba im not prepared to pull it out of my pockets this afternoon you understand lilly nodded but as soon as i make contact with my backup i think something might be arranged then as soon as you make contact with your backup return to us admiral and your clonetwin will be made available to you no began the hot woman halfrising her comrade caught her arm and shook her head and she sank back into her seat right bel she muttered wed hoped to take him today said the mercenary glancing at him their eyes intersected joltingly the admiral looked away as if guarding himself from some toointense stimulus but as you can see that would strip me of what seems to be my main bargaining chip lilly murmured and the usual arrangement of half in advance and half on delivery is obviously impractical perhaps a modest monetary retainer would reassure you they seem to have taken good care of him so far said the brownhaired officer in an uncertain voice but it would also the admiral frowned give you an opportunity to auction him to other interested parties i would caution you against starting a bidding war in this matter maam it could become the real thing your interests are protected by your uniqueness admiral no one else on jacksons whole has what i want you do and i think vice versa we are very well suited to deal for a jacksonian this was bending over backward to encourage take it close the deal he thought then wondered why what did these people want him for outside a gust of wind whipped the snowfall to a blinding whirling curtain it ticked on the windows it ticked on the windows lilly was the next to be aware her dark eyes widening no one else had noticed yet the cessation of that silent glitter her startled gaze met his as his head turned back from his first stare outward and her lips parted for speech the window burst inward it was a safetyglass instead of slicing shards they were all bombarded by a hail of hot pellets the two mercenary women shot to their feet lilly cried out and hawk leaped in front of her a stunner appearing in his hand some kind of big aircar was hovering at the window one two three four huge troopers leaped through transparent biotainer gear covered nervedisruptor shieldsuits their faces were fully hooded and goggled hawks repeated stunner fire crackled harmlessly over them youd get farther if you threw the damned stunner at them he looked around wildly for a projectile weapon knife chair tableleg anything to attack with over one of the mercenary womens pocket comm links a tinny voice was crying quinn this is elena something just dropped the buildings force screen im reading energy dischargeswhat the hell is going on in there you want backup yes screamed the hot woman rolling aside from a stunner beam which followed her crackling across the carpet stunnertag the assault was a snatch not an assassination then hawk finally recovered the wit to pick up the round table and swing with it he hit one trooper but was stunnerdropped by another lilly stood utterly still watching grimly a gust of cold wind fluttered her silk pant legs nobody aimed at her which ones naismith boomed an amplified voice from one of the biotainered troopers the dendarii must have disarmed for the parley the brownhaired mere closed handtohand on an intruder not an option open to him he grabbed rowans hand and dodged behind a chair trying to get a clear run toward the exit tube take em both the leader shouted over the din a trooper leaped toward the lift tube to cut them off the rectangular facet of his stunner discharger winked in the light as he found nearpointblank aim like hell yelled the admiral cannoning into the trooper the trooper stumbled and his aim went wild the last thing he saw as he and rowan dove for the lift tube was a stunner beam from the leader taking naismith in the head both the other dendarii were down they descended with agonizing slowness if he and rowan could get to the force screen generator could they get it turned back on and trap the attackers inside stunner fire sizzled after them starry bursts on the walls they twisted in air somehow landed on their feet and stumbled backward into the corridor no time to explainhe grabbed rowans hand and slapped it flat to the duronakeyed lockpad and hit the poweroff square with his elbow the trooper pursuing them yelped and fell three meters not quite headfirst he winced at the thud and towed rowan down the corridor where are the generators he yelled over his shoulder at her other duronas alarmed were appearing from all directions a pair of greenclad fell guards burst into the corridors far end and pelted toward the penthouse lifttube but what side were they on he pulled rowan into the nearest open doorway lock it he gasped she keyed the door shut they were in some duronas residence suite a culdesac made a poor bolthole but help seemed to be on the way he just wasnt sure for whom something just dropped your force screen from the inside it could only have been dropped from the inside he halfbent mouth wide for air lungs on fire heart racing and chest aching a dizzy darkness clouding his vision he stumbled to the dangerous window anyway trying to get a handle on the tactical situation muffled shouts and thumps penetrated from the wall by the corridor how thelld those bastards get your screen down he wheezed to rowan clutching the windowsill didnt hear an explosiontraitor i dont know rowan replied anxiously thats outerperimeter security fells men are supposed to be in charge of it he stared out over the icy parking lot of the compound a couple more greenclad men were running across it shouting pointing upward taking cover behind a parked vehicle and struggling to get a projectileweapon aimed another guard made urgent negative gestures at them a miss could take out the penthouse and everyone in it they nodded and waited he craned his neck face to the glass trying to see upward and to the left the armored aircar loomed still hovering at the penthouse window the assailants were withdrawing already damn no chance with the forcescreen im too slow the aircar rocked as the troopers hastily reboarded hands flashed and a thick little greyclad figure was dragged across the gap six heartstopping flights above the concrete a limp trooper was dragged across too they were leaving no wounded for questioning rowan teeth clenched pulled him back get out of the line of fire he resisted her theyre getting away he protested we should fight them now on our own turf another aircar rose from the street beyond the old and obsolete compound wall a small civilian model unarmed and unarmored it fought for altitude through its canopy he could see a blurred greyclad figure at the controls a white flash of teeth set in a grimace the assailants armored car yawed away from the window the dendarii aircar tried to ram it to force it down sparks sprayed plastic cracked and metal screeched but the armored car shook it off it pinwheeled to the pavement and landed with a terminal crunch rented i bet he groaned watching gonna have to pay for it good try it almost workedrowan are any of those aircars down there yours you mean the groups yes but come on weve got to get down there but the building was crawling with security by now theyd be nailing everyone to the wall till identified and cleared he could scarcely leap out the window and fly down the five flights though he longed to oh for a cloak of invisibility oh yes carry me can you carry me i suppose but he raced to the door and fell backwards into her arms as it opened again why she asked do it do it do it he hissed through his teeth she dragged him sack out into the corridor he studied the chaos through slitted eyes gasping realistically assorted agitated duronas milled behind a cordon of fell security now blocking the entry to the penthouse get dr chrys to take my feet he muttered out of the corner of his mouth temporarily too overwhelmed to argue rowan cried chrys help me we have to get him downstairs oh given the impression that this was some kind of medical emergency dr chrys asked no questions she grabbed his ankles and within seconds they were forcing their way through the mob two doctors durona carrying a whitefaced injuredlooking fellow at a rungreenclad armed men stepped hastily aside and waved them on as they reached the ground floor chris tried to gallop toward the clinic area for a moment he was yanked two ways then he freed his feet from the astonished dr chrys and pulled away from rowan she gave chase and they arrived at the outer door together the guards attention was focused on the efforts of the two men with the projectile launcher his eyes followed their aim to the shadowy form of their retreating target being swallowed by the snowy clouds no no dont shoot the launcher burped the bright explosion rocked the car but did not bring it down take me to the biggest fastest thing you can make go he gasped to rowan we cant let them get away we cant let fells men blow it up either hurry why those goons just kidnapped my my brother he panted gotta follow bring em down if we can follow if we cant the dendarii must have reinforcements of some kind if we dont lose hem or fell lillys his his liegewoman isnt she he has to respond or someone does he was shivering violently lose em and well never get em back theyre figuring on it what the hell would we do if we caught them rowan objected they just tried to kidnap you and you want to run after them thats i job for security i ami am what what am i his frustrated stutters segued into a confettiscramble of perception no not again his vision cleared with the hiss of a hypospray biting cold on his arm dr chrys was supporting him and rowan had one thumb pressed against his eyelid holding it up while she stared into his eye while her other hand slipped the hypospray back into her pocket a kind of glassy bemusement descended upon him as if he were wrapped in cellophane that should help said rowan no it doesnt he complained or tried to his words came out a mumble they had dragged him out of the lobby out of sight near one of the lift tubes to the underground part of the clinic he had only lost moments to the convulsion then there was still a chancehe struggled in chryss grip which tightened the snap of womens steps not a guards boots rounded the corner lilly appeared her face set and her nostrils flaring flanked by dr poppy rowan get him out of here lilly said in a voice deadlevel in tone despite its breathlessness georish will be downside himself to investigate this one he has to never have been here our attackers seem to have been one of naismiths enemies the story will be that the dendarii came here looking for naismiths clone but didnt find him chrys get rid of the physical evidence in rowans room and hide those files go chrys nodded and ran rowan took over holding him on his feet he had an odd tendency to slump as if he were melting he blinked against the drug no we have to go after lilly tossed rowan a credit chit and dr poppy handed her a couple of coats and a medical bag take him out the back door and disappear use the evacuation codes pick a place at random and go to ground not one of our properties report in on a secured line from a separate location by then i should know what i can salvage from this mess her wrinkled lips peeled back on ivory teeth set in anger move girl rowan nodded obediently and didnt argue at all he noticed indignantly holding him firmly by the arm she guided his stumbling feet down a freight lifttube through the subbasement and into the underground clinic a concealed doorway on its second level opened onto a narrow tunnel he felt like a rat scurrying through a maze rowan stopped three times to key through some security device they came out in some other buildings underlevel and the door disappeared behind them indistinguishable from the wall they continued on through ordinary utility tunnels you use this route often he panted no but every once in a while we want to get something in or out not recorded by our gate guards who are baron fells men they emerged finally in a small underground parking garage she led him to a little blue lightflyer elderly and inconspicuous and bundled him into the passenger seat this isn righ he complained thicktongued admiral naismithsomeone should go after admiral naismith naismith owns a whole mercenary fleet rowan strapped herself into the pilots seat let them tangle with his enemies try to calm down and catch your breath i dont want to have to dose you again the flyer rose into the swirling snow and rocked uncertainly in the gusts the city sprawling below them disappeared quickly into the murk as rowan powered them up she glanced aside at his agitated profile lilly will do something she reassured him she wants naismith too its wrong he muttered its all wrong he huddled in the jacket rowan had wrapped around him she turned up the heat im the wrong one it seemed he had no intrinsic value but his mysterious hold on admiral naismith and if admiral naismith was removed from the deal the only person still interested in him would be vasa luigi wanting vengeance upon him for crimes he couldnt even remember committing worthless unwanted lonely and scared his stomach churned in pain and his head throbbed his muscles ached tense as wire all he had was rowan and apparently the admiral who had come searching for him who had very possibly risked his life to recover him why i have to do something the dendarii mercenaries are they all here does the admiral have ships in orbit or what how much backup does he have he said it would take time for him to contact his backup how much time where did the dendarii come in from a commercial shuttleport can they call down air support how manyhow much where his brain tried madly to assemble data that wasnt there into patterns for attack relax rowan begged theres nothing we can do were only little people and youre in no condition youll drive yourself into another convulsion if you keep on like this screw my condition i have toi have to rowan raised wry eyebrows he lay back in his seat with a sick sigh drained i should have been able to do this to do something he listened to nothing halfhypnotized by the sound of his own shallow breathing defeated again he didnt like the taste he brooded at his pale and distorted reflection on the inside of the canopy time seemed to have become viscous the lights on the control panel died they were suddenly weightless his seat straps bit him fog began to stream up around them faster and faster rowan screamed fought and banged the control panel it flickered momentarily they had thrust again then lost it again they descended in stutters whats wrong with it damn it rowan cried he looked upward nothing but icy fogthey dropped below cloud level then above them a dark shape loomed big lift van heavy its not a systems failure were being intermittently fielddrained he said dreamily were being forced down rowan gulped concentrated trying to keep the flyer level in the brief bursts of control my god is it them again no i dont know maybe they had some backup with adrenalin and determination he forced his wits to function through the sedativehaze make a noise he said make a splash what she didnt understand she didnt catch it she should have somebody should havecrash this sucker she didnt obey are you crazy they lurched to ground rightsideup and intact in a barren valley all snow and crackling scrub somebody wants to make a snatch weve got to leave a mark or well just disappear off the map without a trace no comm link he nodded toward the dead panel we have to make footprints set fire to something something he fought his seat straps for escape too late four or five big men surrounded them in the gloom stunners at ready one reached up and unlatched his door and dragged him out be careful dont hurt him rowan cried fearfully and scrambled after hes my patient we wont maam one of the big parkaclad men nodded politely but you mustnt struggle rowan stood still he stared around wildly if he made a sprint for their van could he his few steps forward were interrupted when one of the goons grabbed him by his shirt and hoisted him into the air pain shot through his scarred torso as the man twisted his hands behind his back something coldly metallic clicked around his wrists they were not the same men whod broken into the durona clinic no resemblance in features uniforms or equipment another big man crunched through the snow he pushed back his hood and shone a hand light upon the captives he appeared about fortystandard with a craggy face olive brown skin and dark hair stripped back in a simple knot his eyes were bright and very alert his black brows bent in puzzlement as he stared at his prey open his shirt he told one of the guards the guard did so the craggy man shone the handlight on the spray of scars his lips drew back in a white grin suddenly he threw back his head and laughed out loud the echoes of his voice lost themselves in the empty winter twilight ry you fool i wonder how long it will take you to figure it out baron bharaputra rowan said in a thin voice she lifted her chin in a quick defiant jerk of greeting dr durona said vasa luigi in return polite and amused your patient is he then you wont refuse my invitation to join us please be our guest youll make it quite the little family reunion what do you want from him he has no memory the question is not what i want from him the question is what someone else may want from him and what i may want from them ha even better he motioned to his men and turned away they chivvied their captives into the closed lift van one of the men split off to pilot the blue lightflyer where should i leave this sir take it back to the city and park it on a side street anywhere see you home yes sir the van doors closed the van lifted chapter twentyfour mark groaned bright prickles of pain shot through a dark nausea you gonna give him a dose of synergine said a voice surprised i didnt get the idea the baron wanted this one handled gently you want to clean up the flyer if he vomits his breakfast rumbled another voice ah the baron will do his own handling he just specified he wanted him alive which he is a hypospray hissed poor sod said the first voice reflectively thanks to the synergine mark began to recover from the stunner hit he didnt know how much time and space lay between him and the durona clinic theyd changed vehicles at least three times after hed regained consciousness once to something bigger and faster than an aircar they stopped at some location and he and the troopers all went through a decontamination chamber the anonymouslydressed troopers went their way and he was given over to two other guards big flatfaced men in black trousers and red tunics house ryovals colors oh they laid him facedown hands and feet bound in the back of a lightflyer the gray clouds darkening toward evening gave no clue as to the direction they were heading miles is alive the relief of that fact was so intense he smiled in elation even with his face squashed into the sticky plastic seat what a joyful sight the skinny little bugger had been upright and breathing hed almost wept what hed done was undone he could really be lord mark now all my sins are taken from me almost he prayed that durona doctor had spoken straight about miles still recovering miless eyes had been frighteningly bewildered and he hadnt recognized quinn which must have nearly slain her youll get better well get you home and youll get better hed haul miles home and everything would be all right again better than all right it would be wonderful as soon as that idiot ryoval had his delusions straightened around mark was ready to gut the man outright for screwing up his family reunion imp sec will handle him they entered an underground parking garage without his getting a glimpse of the exterior of their destination the two guards hauled him roughly to his feet and released his legs which twitched and tingled they passed through an electronic security chamber after which his clothing was taken from him they marched him through the facility it wasnt a prison it wasnt one of house ryovals famous bordellos the air bore a faint unsettling medical tang the place was far too utilitarian to be where surgical bodysculpture was done on patrons it was too secret and secure to be where slaves were done to order where humans were made into things not humanly possible it wasnt very large there were no windows underground where the hell am i he would not panic he entertained himself with a brief vision of what ryoval might do to his own troopers once he discovered theyd snatched the wrong twin if ryoval did not realize the mistake at the very first sight of him he toyed with the idea of concealing his identity for a while let miles and the dendarii get a bigger headstart they had not been taken they were free found him they must come for him and if not them impsec impsec could not be more than a week behind him and closing fast ive won godammit ive won his head was still spinning with a bizarre mixture of elation and terror when the guards delivered him to ryovals presence it was a luxurious office or study the baron evidently kept private quarters here for he glimpsed a living room beyond an archway mark had no trouble recognizing ryoval hed seen him in the vid recording from the ariels first mission here the conversation where hed threatened to have admiral naismiths severed head encased in plastic for a wallhanging in another man this might be dismissed as hyperbole but mark had the uneasy feeling ryoval had meant it literally ryoval was leaning halfseated on his comconsole desk he had shining dark hair arranged in elaborate bands a highbridged nose and smooth skin strong and youthful for a centenarian hes wearing a clone marks smile became vulpine he hoped ryoval would not mistake his poststun tremula for fear the guards sat him in a chair and fastened him down with metal bands to his wrists wait outside the baron instructed them it wont be long they exited ryovals hands were trembling slightly the skin of his bronzed face was faintly moist when he looked up and smiled back at mark his eyes seemed alight with some internal glow the look of a man so filled with the visions inside his head he scarcely saw the present reality mark was almost too enraged to care cloneconsumer admiral ryoval breathed happily i promised you we would meet again as inevitably as fate he looked mark up and down his dark brows rose youve put weight on the last four years good living mark snarled uncomfortably reminded of his nakedness for all hed loathed the dendarii uniform it had actually made him look rather good quinn had personally retailored it for this masquerade and he wished for it back presumably it had been what had fooled ryovals troopers though in that moment of heroic temporary insanity im so glad you are alive at first id hoped for your unpleasant death in one of your little combats but upon reflection i actually began to pray for your survival ive had four years to plan this meeting revising and refining id have hated for you to miss your appointment ryoval did not recognize him as notnaismith ryoval was barely seeing him at all he seemed to be looking through him the baron began to stride up and down in front of him pouring out his plans like a nervous lover elaborate plans for vengeance that ranged from the obscene to the insane to the impossible it could be worse ryoval could be making these threats right now to that thin little vagueeyed bewildered cryoamnesic who would not know even who he was let alone why these things should be happening to him the thought sickened mark yeah better me than him right now no shit he means to terrorize you its only words what was it the count had said dont sell yourself to your enemy in advance in your mind hell ryoval wasnt even his enemy all these gaudy scenarios had been tailored for miles no not even for miles for admiral naismith a man who didnt exist ryoval chased a ghost a chimera ryoval stopped beside him interrupting his whispered tirade curiously he ran a moist hand down marks body fingers curving in precise anatomical tracing of the muscles hidden beneath the layer of fat do you know he breathed id planned to have you starved but i think ive changed my mind i believe ill have you forcefed instead the results could be even more amusing in the long run mark shivered sickly for the first time ryoval felt it beneath his probing fingers and grinned the man had an appalling instinct for the target better he should keep ryoval focused on the chimera better we should get the hell out of here he took a breath i hate to burst your bubble baron but i have some bad news for you now did i ask you to speak ryovals fingers traced back up to pinch the flesh around his jaw this isnt an interrogation this isnt an inquisition confession will gain you nothing not even death it was that damned contagious hyperactivity even miless enemies caught it im not admiral naismith im the clone the bharaputrans made your goons grabbed the wrong guy ryoval merely smiled nice try admiral but weve been watching the bharaputran clone at the durona clinic for days i knew you would come for him after what you did to try and get him back the first time i dont know what passion he inspires in youwere you lovers youd be amazed how many people have clones made for that purpose so when quinn had sworn no one could possibly be following them shed been right ryoval hadnt been following them hed been waiting for them swell it had been his actions not his words or his uniform which had convicted him of being naismith but i will obtain him too ryoval shrugged very soon no you wont baron i really am the other clone prove it to yourself have me examined ryoval chuckled what do you suggest a dna scan even the duronas couldnt decide he sighed deeply theres so much i want to do to you i scarcely know where to begin i must take it slowly and in logical order one cannot torture body parts that have already been removed for example i wonder how many years i can make you last decades mark felt his selfcontrol cracking im not naismith he said his voice going high with strain ryoval grasped marks chin and tilted it up his lips twisting in ironic disbelief then i will practice on you a dryrun and naismith will be along in time youre going to be astonished at what will be along in time impsec would have no hesitation whatsoever about taking ryovals house apart around him no inhibitions even by jacksonian standards to rescue miles he of course wasnt miles he reflected worriedly on that as the guards entered again at ryovals summons the first beating was unpleasant enough it wasnt the pain it was pain without escape fear without release that worked upon the mind tensed the body ryoval watched mark screamed without restraint no silent suffering manly pride here thank you maybe that would convince ryoval he was not naismith this was crazy still the guards broke no bones and ended the exercise perfunctorily they left him locked naked in a very cold tiny room or closet without windows the air vent was perhaps five centimeters across he couldnt get his fist let alone his body though it he tried to prepare to steel himself to give himself hope time was on his side ryoval was a supremely practiced sadist but of a psychological bent ryoval would keep him alive and relatively undamaged at least at first after all nerves must be intact to report pain a mind must be relatively unclouded to experience all the nuances of agony elaborate humiliations rather than immediate flaying to death must be first on the menu all he had to do was survive laterthere wouldnt be a later the countess had said marks going to jacksons whole would force illyan to assign more agents here whether he wanted to or not that alone being a sure benefit of marks journey even if he accomplished nothing personally at all and what after all were a few more humiliations to him miless immense pride could be shattered he had none torture was old news to him oh ryoval have you ever got the wrong man now if ryoval were half the psychologist he clearly imagined himself to be he would have grabbed a few of miless friends to torment in front of him that would work beautifully on miles but not of course on him he had no friends hell ryoval i can think of worse things than you can no matter his friends would rescue him any time now now he kept up his mental defiance till the technicians came for him they returned him to his little cell afterward presumably to give him some solitude to think about it he didnt think for quite some time he lay on his side breathing in tiny gasps halfconscious arms and legs slowly starfishing in rhythm to the pain inside that didnt stop at length the clouds lifted a little from his vision and the pain eased fractionally to be replaced by a black black rage the techs had secured him shoved a tube down his throat and pumped him full of some repulsive highcalorie sludge laced with an antiemetic they told him to prevent him getting rid of it later and a cocktail of metabolic aids to speed digestion and deposition it was far too subtly complex to have been designed on the spot it must be something house ryoval kept in stock and hed imagined this was his own private and unique perversion he thought hed done himself harm before but ryovals people took it far beyond the limits of merely toying with pain under the eye of their master whod come to watch and study him with a growing smile ryoval knew hed seen it in the mans sly pleased eyes ryoval had stripped his very own rebellion of all its secret pleasure the one somatic power that had been his call his control taken from him ryoval had hooked him gotten under his skin way under they could do to you all day long and you could just notbethere but it was as nothing compared to getting you to do to yourself the difference between mere torture and true humiliation was in the participation of the victim galen whose torments were physically much milder than anything ryoval contemplated had known this galen had always had him doing to himself or thinking he was that ryoval knew this too he demonstrated later when he administered a violent aphrodisiac to mark by hypospray before giving him to hisguards or were they employees borrowed from one of the bordellos so that he became a glazedeyed participant in his own degradation it doubtless made a great show for the hovering holovids recording it all from every angle they brought him back to his little cell to digest this new experience much as theyd brought him back to digest the first forcefeeding it took a long time for the shock and drugfog to clear away he oscillated slowly between a drained lassitude and horror curious the drug had shortcircuited his shockstick conditioning reducing it to something like a case of the hiccups or the show would have been much duller and shorter ryoval had watched no ryoval had studied his consciousness of the mans eyes had become an obsession ryovals interest had not been erotic mark felt the baron must have become bored with the stereotyped banality of every possible physical act decades ago ryoval had been watching him for reflexes small betrayals of interest fear despair the exercise had not been arranged for the sake of pain there had been plenty of pain but it had been incidental discomfort from the forcefeeding and running out of neurotransmitters mostly that wasnt the torture mark realized that was only the pretesting my torture is still being designed suddenly he saw what was coming all whole first ryoval would condition him to this addict him by repeated doses only then would he add pain and pin him vibrating between pain and pleasure require him to torture himself to win through to the dark reward and then he would withdraw the drug and let mark conditioned to the scenarios continue and he would and then ryoval would offer him his freedom and he would weep and beg to stay plead to remain a slave destruction by seduction endgame revenge complete you see me ryoval but i see you i see you the forcefeedings turned out to be on a schedule of every three hours it was the only clock he had or he would have thought time had stopped he had surely entered eternity hed always thought being skinned alive was something done with sharp knives or dull ones ryovals technicians did it chemically spraying carefully selected areas of his body with an aerosol they wore gloves masks protective clothing he tried but failed to grab off a mask and let one share what they administered he cursed his littleness and cried and watched his skin bubble up and drip away the chemical was not a caustic but rather some strange enzyme his nerves were left horribly intact exposed touching anything or being touched was agony after that especially the pressure of sitting or lying down he stood in the little closetcell shifting from foot to foot touching nothing for hours till his shaking legs finally gave way it was all happening so fast where the hell was everybody how long had he been here a day so i have survived one day therefore i can survive another oneday it couldnt be worse it could only be more he sat and rocked mind half whitedout with pain and rage especially rage from the moment of the first forcefeeding it hadnt been naismiths war any more this was personal now between ryoval and him but not personal enough hed never been alone with ryoval hed always been outnumbered outweighed passed from one set of bindings to another admiral naismith was being treated as a fairly dangerous little prick even now that wouldnt do he would have told them everything all about lord mark and miles and the count and the countess and barrayar and kareen but the forcefeedings had stopped his mouth and the drug had stripped him of language and the other things had kept him too busy screaming it was all ryovals fault the man watched but he didnt listen i wanted to be lord mark i just wanted to be lord mark was that so bad he still wanted to be lord mark hed almost had it brushing his grasp ripped away he wept for it hot tears splashing like molten lead on his notskin he could feel lord mark slipping from him racked apart buried alive disintegrating i just wanted to be human screwed up again chapter twentyfive he circled the room for the hundreth time tapping on the walls if we could figure out which one is the exterior he said to rowan maybe we could break through it somehow with what our fingernails what if were three floors up will you please sit down rowan gritted youre driving me crazy we have to get out we have to wait lilly will miss us and something will be done by who and how he glared around their little bedroom it wasnt designed as a prison it was only a guest room with its own bath attached no windows which suggested it was underground or in an interior section of the house if it was underground breaking through a wall might not be much use but if they could bore into another room the possibilities bloomed one door and two stunnerarmed guards outside of it theyd tried enticing the guards into opening the door last night once with faked illness and once for real when his frantic agitation had resulted in another convulsion the guards had handed in rowans medical bag which was no help because then the exhausted woman had started responding to his demands for action by threatening to sedate him survive escape sabotage he recited it had become a litany running through his head in an endless loop its a soldiers duty im not a soldier said rowan rubbing her darkringed eyes and vasa luigi isnt going to kill me and if he was going to kill you hed have done it last night he doesnt play with his prey like ryoval does she bit her lip perhaps regretting that last sentence or maybe hes going to leave us in here together till kill you she rolled over in bed and pulled her pillow over her head you should have crashed that lightflyer a noise from under the pillow might have been either a groan or a curse he had probably mentioned that regret a few too many times when the door clicked open he spun as if scalded a guard halfsaluted politely baron bharaputras compliments maam sir and would you prepare to join him and the baronne for dinner we will escort you upstairs when youre ready the bharaputras dining room had large glass doors giving a view onto an enclosed winterfrosted garden and a big guard by every exit the garden glimmered in the gathering gloom they had been here a full jacksonian day then twentysix hours and some odd minutes vasa luigi rose at their entry and at his gesture the guards faded back to positions outside the doors giving an illusion of privacy the dining room was arranged stylishly with individual couches and little tables set in a tiered semicircle around the view of the garden a very familiarlooking woman sat on one of the couches her hair was white streaked with black and wound up in elaborate braids around her head dark eyes thin ivory skin softening with tiny wrinkles a highbridged nosedr durona again she was dressed in a fine flowing silk shirt in a pale green perhaps accidentally reminiscent of the color of the durona lab coats and soft trousers the color of cream dr lotus durona baronne bharaputra had elegant tastes and the means to indulge them rowan dear she nodded she held out a hand as if rowan might give it a courtiers kiss lotus said rowan flatly and compressed her lips lotus smiled and turned her hand over converting it into an invitation to sit which they all did lotus touched a control pad at her place and a girl wearing bharaputra brown and pink silks entered and served drinks to the baron first curtseying with lowered eyes before him a very familiarlooking girl tall and willowy with a highbridged nose fine straight black hair bound at her nape and flowing in a horsetail down her back when she made her offering to the baronne her eyes flicked up and opened like flowers to the sun bright with joy when she bowed before rowan her upturning gaze grew startled and her dark brows drew down in puzzlement rowan gazed back equally startled a look that changed to dawning horror as the girl turned away when she bowed before him her frown deepened you she whispered as if amazed run along lilly dear dont gawk said the baronne kindly as she left the room with a swaying walk she glanced covertly back over her shoulder at them lilly rowan choked you named her lilly a small revenge rowans hands clenched in deep offense how can you knowing what you are knowing what we are how can you choose death over life the baronne shrugged or worselet lilly choose it for you your time of temptation is not yet rowan my dear sister ask yourself again in twenty or thirty years when you can feel your body rotting around you and see if the answer comes so easily then lilly loved you as a daughter lilly used me as her servant love the baronne chuckled its not love that keeps the durona herd together its predator pressure if all the exterior economic and other dangers were removed the far corners of the wormhole nexus would not be far enough for us to get away from our dear sibs most families are like that actually rowan assimilated the point she looked unhappy but she didnt disagree vasa luigi cleared his throat actually dr durona you wouldnt have to travel to the far reaches of the galaxy for a place of your own house bharaputra could find a use for your talents and training and perhaps even a little autonomy head of a department for example and later who knowsmaybe even a division no thank you rowan bit out the baron shrugged did the baronne look faintly relieved he interrupted urgently baronwas it really ryovals squad who took admiral naismith do you know where well now thats an interesting question vasa luigi murmured eyeing him ive been trying to contact ry all day without success i suspect that wherever ry is your clonetwin is alsoadmiral he took a deep breath why do you think i am the admiral sir because i met the other one under telling circumstances i dont think the real admiral naismith would permit his bodyguard to give him ordersdo you his head was aching whats ryoval doing to him really vasa this is not dinnerconversation reproved the baronne she glanced curiously at him besideswhy should you care miles what have you done with your baby brother the quote came from nowhere fell out of his mouth he touched his lips uncertainly rowan stared at him so did lotus vasa luigi said as to your question admiral it turns on whether ry has come to the same conclusions as i did if he haslikely hes not doing much if he hasnt his methods will depend upon your clonetwin i dont understand ryoval will study him experiment his choice of actions will flow from his analysis of his subjects personality that didnt sound so bad he pictured multiplechoice tests he frowned bewildered ry is an artist in his way continued the baron he can create the most extraordinary psychological effects ive seen him turn an enemy into a slave utterly devoted to his person who will obey any order the last man who attempted to assassinate him and had the misfortune to live ended up serving drinks at ryovals private parties and begging to offer gratification of any kind to any guest on request what did you ask for the baronne inquired dryly white wine it was before your time love i watched though the man had the most haunted eyes are you considering selling me to ryoval he asked slowly if hes the highest bidder admiral your and your clonetwins raid upon my propertyand i am still not certain you did not plan it together from first to lastwas very costly to my house and his eyes glinted personally annoying ill not bother avenging myself upon a cryoamnesic but i do wish to shave my losses if i sell you to ry youll be better punished than even i care to think about ry would be delighted to own a matched pair vasa luigi sighed house ryoval will always be a minor house i fear as long as ry allows his personal gratification to outweigh its profits its a shame i could do so much more with his resources the girl returned served little plates of hors douvers refreshed their drinks some wineandfruit concoction and wafted out again slowly vasa luigis eyes followed her the baronnes eyes narrowed noting his gaze her lashes swept down focusing on her drink as his head turned back what about the dendarii mercenaries as a bidder yes just let bharaputra make that offer and the dendarii would come knocking on his door with a plasma cannon high bid indeed this game must be a short one bharaputra could not put him up for auction without revealing that he had him and then and then what if nothing else you could use their competition to force ryovals bid up he added slyly their resources are too finite i fear and not here we saw them yesterday a mere covert ops team no ships no backup i understand they only revealed their identity at all in order to get lilly to talk with them but i have reason to believe there is another player in this game my instincts twitch looking at you i have the oddest urge to take a modest middlemans profit and let the negative bidders apply to house ryoval the baron chuckled negative bidder oh people with plasma cannons he tried not to react vasa luigi continued which brings us back to the original questionwhat is lillys interest in all this why did lilly set you to revive this man rowan for that matter how did lilly obtain him when some hundreds of other earnest searchers could not she didnt say said rowan blandly but i was glad for a chance to sharpen my skills thanks to your security guards excellent aim he was quite a medical challenge the conversation became medicaltechnical between lotus and rowan and then more desultory as the clonegirl served them an elaborate meal rowan evaded as smoothly as the baron questioned and no one expected him to know anything but baron bharaputra seemed not to be in a hurry clearly he was setting up to play some land of waiting game afterwards the guards escorted them back to their room which he realized at last was part of a corridor of identical chambers designed perhaps to house the servants of important visitors where are we he hissed at rowan as soon as the door shut behind them could you tell is this bharaputras headquarters no said rowan his main residence is still under renovation something about a commando raid blowing out several rooms she added snappishly he walked slowly around their chamber but he did not take up banging on the walls again to rowans obvious relief it occurs to me that theres another way to escape besides breaking from the inside out thats to get someone else to break from the outside in tell me would it be harder to break in and take someone held prisoner by house bharaputra house fell or house ryoval well fell would be the hardest i suppose he has more troops and heavy weapons ryoval would be the easiest ryovals really a house minor except hes so old he gets the honors of a house major by habit so if one wanted someone bigger and badder than bharaputra one might go to fell one might and if one knew help were on the way it might be tactically brighter to leave said prisoner at ryovals rather than to have him shifted to some more formidible location it might she conceded we have to get to fell how we cant even get out of this room out of the room yes we must get out of the room but we might not have to get out of the house if one of us could just get to a comconsole for a few uninterrupted minutes call fell call someone let the world know vasa luigi has us that would start things moving call lilly said rowan sturdily not fell i need fell lilly cant break into ryovals he considered the uneasy possibility that he and the durona group might be starting to move at crosspurposes he wanted a favor from fell whom lilly wished to escape stillone would not have to offer very much to interest fell in a raid on ryoval a breakeven in materials and the profit in old hatred yeah he wandered into the bathroom and stared at himself in the mirror who am i a skinny haggard pale oddlooking little man with desperate eyes and a tendency to convulsions if he could even decide which one his clonetwin was glimpsed so painfully yesterday he could dub himself the other by process of elimination the fellow had looked like naismith to him but vasa luigi was no fool and vasa luigi was convinced of the reverse he had to be one or the other why couldnt he decide if i am naismith why did my brother claim my place at that moment he discovered why it was called a cascade the sensation was of being under a waterfall of some river that emptied a continent tons of water battering him to his knees he emitted a tiny mewl crouching down with his arms wrapping his head shooting pains behind his eyes and terror locking his throat he pressed his lips together to prevent any other sound escaping that would attract rowan in all her concern he needed to be alone for this oh yes no wonder i couldnt guess i was trying to choose between two wrong answers oh mother oh da oh sergeant your boy has screwed up this one bad real bad lieutenant lord miles naismith vorkosigan crawled on the tiled floor and screamed in silence just a faint hiss no no no oh shit elli bel elena taura mark mark that stout glowering controlled determined fellow had been mark he could not remember anything about his death he touched his chest fearfully tracing the evidence of what event he squeezed his eyes shut trying to remember the last that he could the raid downside at bharaputras surgical facility yes mark had engineered a disaster mark and bel between them and hed come flying down to try and pull all their nuts out of the fire some megalomanic inspiration to top mark show him how the experts did it to take those clonechildren from vasa luigi who had offended him take em home to mother crap what does my mother know about all this bynow nothing he prayed they were all still here on jacksons whole somehow how long had he been dead where the hell is impsec besides rolling around here on this bathroom floor of course ow ow ow and elli do i know you maam hed asked he should have bitten his tongue out rowan elli it made sense in a weird way his lover was a tall browneyed darkhaired toughminded smart woman the first thing presented to his confused awakening senses had been a tall browneyed darkhaired toughminded smart woman it was a very natural mistake he wondered if elli was going to buy that explanation his taste for heavilyarmed girlfriends did have potential drawbacks he inhaled a hopeless laugh it clogged in his throat taura here did ryoval know it did he know what a lovely big clawed hand shed had in the destruction of his gene banks four years ago or did he just blame admiral naismith true all of ryovals bounty hunters hed encountered subsequently had seemed focused obsessively and exclusively upon himself but ryovals troopers had mistaken mark for the admiral had ryoval surely mark would tell him he was the clone hell id tell him the same if it were me on the offchance of confusing the issue what was happening to mark why had mark offered himself as miless ransom mark couldnt possibly be cryoamnesic too could he no lilly had said the dendarii and the clones and admiral naismith had all escaped so how did they come to be back they came looking for you admiral dipshit and had run headlong into ryoval looking for the same thing he was a damned rendezvous what a merciful state cryoamnesia was he wished for it back are you all right rowan called doubtfully she stepped to the bathroom door and saw him on the floor oh no another convulsion she dropped to her knees beside him long fingers checking for damages did you hit yourself on anything ah ah ill not bother avenging myself upon a cryoamnesic vasa luigi had said he had better remain a cryoamnesic then for the moment till he had a better grip on things and on himself i think im all right he suffered her to anxiously put him to bed she stroked his hair he stared at her in dismay through halflidded pretendpostconvulsionsleepy eyes what have i done what am i going to do chapter twentysix he had forgotten why he was here his skin was beginning to grow back he wondered where mark had gone people came and tormented a nameless thing without boundaries and went away again he met them variously his emerging aspects became personas and eventually he named them as well as he could identify them there was gorge and grunt and howl and another quiet one that lurked on the fringes waiting he let gorge go out to handle the forcefeedings because gorge was the only one who actually enjoyed them gorge after all would never have been permitted to do all that ryovals techs did grunt he sent forth when ryoval came again with the hypospray of aphrodisiac grunt had also been responsible for the attack on maree the bodysculptured clone he rather thought though grunt when not all excited was very shy and ashamed and didnt talk much howl handled the rest he began to suspect howl had been obscurely responsible for delivering them all to ryoval in the first place finally hed come to a place where he could be punished enough never give aversion therapy to a masochist the results are unpredictable so howl deserved what howl got the elusive fourth one just waited and said that someday they would all love him best they did not always stay within their lines howl had a tendency to eavesdrop on gorges sessions which came regularly while howls did not and more than once gorge turned up riding along with grunt on his adventures which then became exceptionally peculiar nobody joined howl by choice having named them all he finally found mark by process of elimination gorge and grunt and howl and the other had sent lord mark deep inside to sleep through it all poor fragile lord mark barely twelve weeks old ryoval could not even see lord mark down in there could not reach him could not touch him gorge and grunt and howl and the other were all very careful not to wake the baby tender and protective they defended him they were equipped to an ugly grotty hardbitten bunch these psychic mercenaries of his unlovely but they got the job done he began to hum little marching tunes to them from time to time chapter twentyseven absence makes the heart grow fonder and miles feared the converse rowan had pulled her pillow over her head again he continued to pace and talk he couldnt seem to stop himself in the time that had passed since his concealed memory cascade he had evolved a multitude of plans for their escape all with some fatal flaw unable to put any of them into effect he had reordered and refined them out loud over and over rowan had stopped critiquing them yesterday in fact shed stopped talking to him at all shed given up trying to pet him and relax him and instead tended to stay on the far side of the room or hide for long periods in the bathroom he couldnt blame her his returning nervous energy seemed to be building to something like a frenzy this forced confinement was stressing her affection for him to the limit and he had to admit he had not been able to conceal his slight new hesitation toward her a coolness in his touch an increased resistance to her medical authority he loved and admired her no question and would be delighted to have her in charge of any sickbay he owned under his command but guilt and the sense of no privacy had combined to cripple his interest in intimacy he had other passions at the moment and they were consuming him dinner was due soon assuming three meals per long jacksonian day theyd been here four days the baron had not spoken with them again what schemes was vasa luigi evolving out there had he been auctioned yet what if the next person through the door was his buyer what if nobody bid at all what if they left him in here forever meals were usually brought on a tray by a servant under the watchful eye of a couple of stunnerarmed guards hed tried everything he could think of short of breaking his cover to suborn them in their brief snatches of conversation theyd just smiled at him he was dubious of his ability to outrun a stunnerbeam but at the next opportunity he resolved to try he hadnt had a chance to try anything lever he was ready to try something stupid surprise sometimes worked the lock clicked he spun poised to dart forward rowan get up he hissed im going to try for it oh hell she moaned emerging without faith browbeaten she rose and trudged around the bed to stand by his side stunning hurts you know and then you throw up youll probably have convulsions yes i know but at least itll shut you up for a while she muttered under her breath he rose on the balls of his feet then sank back again as the servant entered oh my whats this there was suddenly a new player in he game and his mind locked into overdrive rowan watching him or his announced bolt looked up too and her eyes widened it was the clonegirl lillylilly junior he supposed he must think of herin her brownandpink silk houseservants uniform a long wrap skirt and spangled jacket straightbacked she carried their meal tray and set it down on the table across the room incomprehensibly the guard nodded at her and withdrew closing the door behind him she began to lay out their meal servantfashion rowan approached her lips parted he saw a dozen possibilities instantly also that this chance might ever come again there was no way in his debilitated state that he could overpower the girl himself what about that sedative rowan had threatened him with could rowan get the drop on her rowan was not good at catching oblique hints and terrible at following cryptic orders shed want explanations shed want to argue he could only try goodness you two look alike he chirped brightly glaring at rowan she gave him a look of exasperated bafflement which she converted to a smile as the girl turned toward them how is it that we rate uh such a highborn servant milady lillys smooth hand touched her chest i am not my lady she lid in a tone that suggested he must be a complete fool not without reason but you she looked searchingly at rowan i dont understand you did the baronne send you miles asked no but i told the guards your food was drugged and the baronne sent me to stay and watch you eat it she added somewhat offthecuff is that uh true he asked no she tossed her head making her long hair swing and dropped him from her attention to focus hungrily upon rowan who are you she is the baronnes sister he said instantly daughter to your ladys mother did you know you were named after your uh grandmother grandmother tell her about the durona group rowan he said urgently give me a chance to speak then why dont you rowan said through her teeth smiling does she know what she is ask her if she knows what she is he demanded then stuffed his knuckle into his mouth and bit it the girl hadnt come for him shed come for rowan he had to let rowan take this one well rowan glanced at the closed door and back to the girl the duronas are a group of thirtysix cloned siblings we live under the protection of house fell our motherthe first duronais named lilly too she was very sad when lotusthe baronneleft us lotus used to be my older sister you see you must be my sister too then has lotus told you why she had you are you to be her daughter her heir i am to be united with my lady said the girl there was a faint defiance in her tone but her fascination with rowan was obvious i wondered if you were to take my place jealousy madness rowans eyes darkened in muted horror do you understand just what that means what a clonebrain transplant is she will take your body lilly and you will be nowhere yes i know its my destiny she tossed her head again flipping her hair back from her face her tone was one of conviction but her eyes was there the faintest question in her eyes so much alike you two he murmured circling them in suppressed anxiety smiling ill bet you could exchange clothes with each other and no one could tell the difference rowans quick glance told him yes shed caught it but thought he was pushing it too hard naw he went on pursing his lips and tilting his head i dont think so the girls too fat dont you think shes too fat rowan i am not fat said lilly junior indignantly rowans clothes would never fit you youre wrong said rowan giving up and letting herself be pushed into fastforward hes an idiot lets prove it lilly she began to peel out of her jacket blouse trousers slowly very curiously the girl took off her jacket and skirt and took up rowans outfit rowan did not yet touch lillys silks laid out neatly on the bed oh that looks nice said rowan she nodded toward the bathroom you should go look at yourself i was wrong miles admitted nobly steering the girl toward the bathroom no time to plot no way to give orders hed have to utterly rely on rowans initiative actually rowans clothes look quite good on you imagine yourself as a durona surgeon theyre all doctors there did you know you could be a doctor too out of the corner of his eye he saw rowan tear the bands from her hair and shake it loose and grab for the silks he let the door shut behind him and lilly and aimed her at the mirror he turned on the water to mask the sound of rowans knock on the outer door of the guard opening it of her retreat hair swinging down across her face lilly stared into the long mirror she glanced at him by her side in it waving his hand as if to introduce her to herself then down at the top of his head by her shoulder he grabbed a cup and took a gulp of water to clear his throat for action how long could he keep the girl distracted in here he didnt think he could successfully sap her on the skull and he was not completely certain which item in rowans medical satchel sitting on the countertop was the threatened sedative to his surprise she spoke first youre the one who came for me arent you for all us clones uh the disastrous dendarii raid on bharaputras had she been one of the rescuees what was she doing back here then excuse me ive been dead lately and my brain isnt working too well cryoamnesia it might have been me but you might have met my clonetwin you have clonesibs too at least one my brother you were really dead she sounded faintly disbelieving he pulled up his gray knit shirt and displayed his scars oh she said impressed i guess you were rowan put me back together shes very good no dont draw her attention to the missing rowan you could be just as good ill bet if you tried if you were trained what was it like being dead her eyes were suddenly intent upon his face he shrugged his shirt back down dull really boring a blank i dont remember anything i dont remember dying his breath caught the projectile weapons muzzle bright with flame hischest bursting outward terrible pain he inhaled and leaned against the counter legs suddenly weak lonely you wouldnt like it i guarantee he took her warm hand being alive is much better being alive is is he needed something to stand on he scrambled up on the counter instead crouching eye to eye with her at last he twined her hair in his hand tilted his head and kissed her just a brief press of the lips you can tell youre alive when somebody touches you back she drew back shocked and interested you kiss differently from the baron his brain seemed to hiccup the baron has kissed you yes sampling his wifes new body early how soon was that transplant scheduled have you always lived with uh your lady no i was brought here after the clonecreche was wrecked the repairs are almost complete ill be moving back soon but not for long no the temptations to the baron must be interesting after all she would have her brain destroyed soon and be unable to accuse vasa luigi could do anything but damage her virginity what was this doing to her apparent mental conditioning her allegiance to her destiny something obviously or she wouldnt be here she glanced at the closed door and her mouth went round in sudden suspicion she pulled her hand from his grip and raced back to the empty bedroom oh no sh sh he ran after her grabbed her hand again lunged up to stand on the bed to turn her face to his and regain eye contact dont shout he hissed if you run out and tell the guards youll be in terrible trouble but if you just wait until she comes back no one will ever know he felt quite vile to be playing so on her obvious panic but it had to be done be quiet and no one will ever know he had no idea if rowan intended to come back for that matter by this point maybe she had just wanted to escape from him none of his plans had assumed a piece of luck like this lilly junior could physically overpower him with ease though he was not sure if she realized it one good punch to his chest would drop him to the floor she wouldnt even have to hit him very hard sit down he told her here next to me dont be afraid actually i cant imagine what you could possibly be afraid of if your destiny doesnt make you blink you must be a courageous girl woman sit he drew her down she glanced from him to the door in great uncertainty but allowed herself to be settled temporarily her muscles were tight as springs tell me tell me about yourself tell me about your life you are a most interesting person do you know me i cant remember much about my life right now which is why i ask its a terror to me not to be able to remember its killing me whats the very earliest thing about yourself that you can remember why i suppose the place i lived before i came to the creche there was a woman who took care of me i havethis is sillybut i remember she had some purple flowers as tall as was that grew out of this little square of a garden hardly a meter square and they smelled like grapes yes tell me more about those flowers they were in for a long conversation he feared and then what that rowan had not yet been brought back was a very good sign that she might not be coming back left an unsettling dilemma for lilly junior so what could the baron and baronne possibly do to her his mind mocked savagely kill her they talked of her life in the creche he teased out an account of the dendarii raid from her point of view how she had managed to rejoin the baron sharp sharp kid what a mess for mark the pauses grew longer he was going to end up talking about himself soon just to keep things going and that was incredibly dangerous she was running out of conversation her eyes turning more and more often toward the door rowans not coming back said lilly junior at last is she i think not he said frankly i think shes escaped clean how can you tell if they had caught her they would have come for you even if they didnt bring her back here from their point of view rowan is still in here its you whos missing you dont think they could have mistaken her for me do you she gasped in alarm taken her to be united with my lady he wasnt sure if she was afraid for rowan or afraid that rowan would steal her place what a ghastly hideous new paranoia how soon are you no he reassured her himself no at a glance in the hallway sure youd look quite alike but someone would have to take a closer look for that shes years older than you its just not possible what should i do she tried to get to her feet he held her arm pulled her back to his side on the bed nothing he advised its all right tell themtell them i made you stay in here she looked askance at his littleness how trickery threats psychological coercion he said truthfully you can blame it on me she looked most dubious how old was she hed spent the last two hours teasing out her whole life story and there didnt seem to be very much of it her talk was an odd mixture of sharpness and naivete the greatest adventure of her life had been her brief kidnapping by the dendarii mercenaries rowan shes made it out then what would she come back for him how this was jacksons whole you couldnt trust anyone people were meat here like this girl in front of him he had a sudden nightmarish picture of her emptyskulled blankeyed im sorry he whispered you are so beautiful on the inside you deserve to live not be eaten by that old woman my lady is a great woman she said sturdily she deserves to live more what kind of twisted ethics drove lotus durona to make of this girl an imitationwilling sacrifice who did lotus think she was fooling only herself apparently besides said lilly junior i thought you liked that fat blonde you were squirming all over her who oh thats right that must have been your clonetwin my brother he corrected automatically what was this story mark she was getting relaxed now reconciled to her strange captivity and bored she looked at him speculatively would you like to kiss me again she inquired it was his height it brought out the beast in women unthreatened they became bold he normally considered it a quite delightful effect but this girl worried him she was not his equal but he had to kill time keep her in here keep her entertained for as long as possible well all right after about twenty minutes of tame and decorous necking she drew back and remarked thats not the way the baron does it what do you do for vasa luigi she unfastened his trouserstrings and started to show him after about a minute he choked stop dont you like it the baron does im sure dreadfully aroused he fled to the chair by the little dining table and scrunched himself up in it thats um very nice lilly but its too serious for you and me i dont understand just exactly so she was a child despite her grownup body he was increasingly certain of it when you are older you will find your own boundaries and you can invite people across them as you choose right now you scarcely know where you leave off and the world begins desire should flow from within not be imposed from without he tried to choke off his own flow by sheer willpower halfsuccessfully vasa luigi you scum she frowned thoughtfully im not going to be older he wrapped his arms around his drawnup knees and shuddered hell he suddenly remembered how hed met sergeant taura how they had become lovers in that desperate hour ah ambushed again by the potholes in his memory there were certain obvious parallels with his current situation it must be why his subconscious was trying to apply the old successful solution but taura was a bioengineered mutation shortlived the dendarii medicos had stolen her a little more time with metabolic adjustments but not much every day was a gift each year a miracle she was living her whole life as a smashandgrab and he heartily approved lilly junior could live a century if she wasnt cannibalized she needed to be seduced to life not sex like integrity love of life was not a subject to be studied it was a contagion to be caught and you had to catch it from someone who had it dont you want to live he asked her i dont know i do i want to live and believe me i have considered the alternative deeply you are a funny little ugly man what can you get from life everything and i mean to get more i want i want wealth power love victories splendid brilliant victories shining reflected in the eyes of comrades someday a wife children a herd of children tall and healthy to rock those who whispered mutant right back on their heels and over on their pointed heads and i mean to have a brother mark yeah the surly little fellow that baron ryoval was quite possibly taking apart strand by strand right now in miless place his nerves stretched to the screaming point with no release ive got to make time he finally persuaded lilly junior to go to sleep wrapped up in the covers on rowans side of the bed chivalrously he took the chair a couple of hours into the night and he was in agony he tried the floor it was cold his chest ached he dreaded the thought of waking with a cough he finally crept into the bed on top of the covers and curled up facing away from her he was intensely conscious of her body the reverse was obviously not so his anxiety was the more enormous for being so formless he didnt have control of anything near morning he at last warmed up enough to doze rowan mlove he muttered muzzily nuzzling into her scented hair and wrapping himself around her warm long body mlady a barrayaran turn of phrase he knew where that milady came from at long last she flinched he recoiled consciousness returned ak sorry lilly junior sat up shaking off his uglylittleman grasp grope actually i am not my lady sorry wrong referent i think of rowan as milady inside my head she is milady and im her court fool knight i really am a soldier you know despite being short at the second knock on the door he realized what had awakened him breakfast quick into the bathroom rattle around in there i swear we can keep this going another round for once he did not try to engage the guards in conversation leading to bribery lilly junior came back out when the door closed again behind the servant she ate slowly dubiously as if she doubted her right to food he watched her increasingly fascinated here have this other roll you can put sugar on it you know im not allowed to eat sugar you should have sugar he paused you should have everything you should have friends you should have sisters you should have education to the limits of your minds powers and work to challenge your spirit work makes you bigger more real you eat it up and grow you should have love a knight of your own much taller you should have ice cream i mustnt get fat my lady is my destiny destiny what do you know about destiny he rose and began to pace zigzagging around bed and table im a frigging expert on destiny your lady is a false destiny and do you know how i know she takes everything but she doesnt give anything back real destiny takes everythingthe last drop of blood and strip out your veins to be sureand gives it back doubled quadrupled a thousandfold but you cant give halves you have to give it all i know i swear ive come back from the dead to speak the truth to you real destiny gives you a mountain of life and puts you on top of it his conviction felt utterly megalomanic he adored moments like this youre insane she said staring at him warily how would you know youve never met a sane person in your life have you think about it her rising interest fell its no use im a prisoner anyway where would i go lilly durona would take you in he said promptly the durona group is under house fells protection you know if you could get to your grandmother youd be safe her brows drew down just like rowans had when she was knocking holes in his escape plans how they cant leave us in here forever suppose he walked behind her gathered up her hair and held it in a messy wad on the back of her head i didnt get the impression vasa luigi meant to keep rowan past the point of need for secrecy when i go so should she if they thought you were rowan i bet you could just walk right out what would i say as little as possible hello dr durona your ride is here pick up your bag and go i couldnt you could try if you fail youll lose nothing if you win youll win everything andif you got awayyou could tell people where ive gone who took me and when all it takes is a few minutes of nerve and thats free we make it ourselves out of ourselves nerve cant be taken away from you like a purse or something hell why am i telling you that you escaped the dendarii mercenaries on nerve and wit alone she looked utterly boggled i was doing it for my lady ive never done anything for for myself he felt like crying strung up to the point of pure nervous collapse this was the sort of allout exalted eloquence he usually reserved for persuading people to risk their lives not save them he leaned across to whisper demonically in her ear do it for yourself the universe will be around to collect its cut later after breakfast he tried to help her fix her hair rowanfashion he was terrible at hair since rowan was too the final result was quite convincing he fancied they survived the delivery and removal of lunch he knew it wasnt dinner when they didnt knock before entering there were three guards and a man in house livery two of the guards took him wordlessly and fastened his hands in front of him he was grateful for that small favor behind his back would have been excruciating after the first halfhour they prodded him into the hall no sign of vasa and lotus out looking for their lost clone he hoped he glanced back over his shoulder dr durona the house man nodded at lilly junior i am to be your driver where to she brushed a loose wisp of hair from her eyes picked up rowans bag stepped forward and said home rowan miles said she turned take all for it will all be taken back in time thats a grave truth he moistened dry lips kiss me goodbye she tilted her head wheeled bent pressed her lips to his briefly followed the driver well it was enough to impress the guards howd you rate that one inquired amiably amused as he was led in the opposite direction im an acquired taste he informed them smugly cut the chat sighed the senior man he made two attempted breaks on the way to the groundcar after the second the biggest guard simply slung him over his shoulder headdown and threatened to drop him if he wriggled theyd used enough force tackling him the second time that miles didnt think he was joking they bundled him into the back of the vehicle between two of them where are you taking me to a transfer point one said what transfer point thats all you need to know he kept up a steady stream of commentary bribes threats insults and at last invective but they never rose to the bait again he wondered if any of them could be the man whod killed him no no one involved in that mess at the surgical facility could be so calm about it all these guys had been far away that day his voice went hoarse it was a long ride groundcars were hardly used outside the cities the roads were so bad and they were far outside any city it was past dusk when they pulled over beside a lonely intersection they handed him off to two humorless flatfaced men in red and black house livery who were waiting patiently as oxen ryovals colors these men fastened his hands behind his back and his ankles too before slinging him into the back of a lightflyer it rose silently into darkness looks like vasa luigi got his price rowan if shed made it must send anyone looking for him to bharaputras where miles would not be not that he was so sure vasa luigi wouldnt just cheerfully sic them right on to ryoval but if ryovals location was easy to find they would have found it by now by god i could be the first impsec agent onsite hed have to be sure and point that out in his report to illyan he had looked forward to making posthumous reports to illyan now he wondered if he was going to live long enough chapter twentyeight i hate to be the one to tell you this baron said the technician but your torture victim appears to be having a wonderful time gorge grinned around the tube gagging his mouth as baron ryoval walked around him and stared admiring his amazing stomach perhaps there are a number of possible psychological defenses in these situations ryoval said split personalities and identification with the captor included i expected naismith to work through them all eventually butso soon i didnt believe it either sir so i took a series of brain scans the results were unusual if his personality is indeed splitting it should show up on the scan something shows up on the scan he seems to be shielding portions of his mind from our stimuli and his surface responses certainly suggest a split but the pattern is abnormally abnormal if that makes sense sir not really ryoval pursed his lips with interest ill take a look at them whatever is going on hes not faking it that i am sure of so impossibly fast murmured ryoval when do you think he snapped how could i have missed it im not sure early the first daymaybe the first hour but if he keeps it up hes going to be very elusive to bring much force to bear upon he can keep changing shifts so can i stated ryoval coldly the pressure in his stomach was growing into pain howl prodded anxiously but gorge would not give way it was still his turn the other listened attentively the fourth one always listened when baron ryoval was present rarely slept almost never spoke i didnt expect him to reach this stage of disintegration for months it throws off my timetable the baron complained yes baron arent we fascinating dont we intrigue you i must consider how best to refocus him ryoval mused bring him to my quarters later ill see what a little quiet conversation and a few experiments will yield in the way of new directions beneath his flattened affect the other shivered in anticipation two guards delivered himthem to baron ryovals pleasant living room there were no windows though a large holovid display took up most of one wall presently running a view of some tropical beach but ryovals quarters were surely underground nobody would break through windows here his skin was still patchy the techs had sprayed the raw areas with some kind of coating to keep him from oozing on ryovals fine furniture and dressed the other wounds with plastic bandage so they wouldnt break open and bleed and stain think thisll do any good the tech with the sprayer had asked probably not his comrade had sighed i suppose id better go ahead and put a cleaning crew on call wish hed put down a tarp or something the guards sat him now in a low wide chair it was just a chair no spikes or razors or impalements his hands were fastened behind him which meant he could not settle back he spread his knees and sat uncomfortably upright panting the senior guard asked ryoval do you wish us to secure him sir ryoval raised an eyebrow can he stand up without help not readily from that position ryovals lips crooked up in amused contempt as he gazed down at his prisoner ah were getting there slowly leave us ill call you dont interrupt it may become noisy your soundproofing is very effective sir the flatfaced guards saluted and withdrew there was something wrong with those guards when not following orders they tended to just sit or stand wordless and blank constructed that way no doubt gorge and grunt and howl and the other stared around with interest wondering whose turn it was going to be next you just had your turn said howl to gorge itll be me dont bet on it said grunt could be me if it werent for gorge said the other grimly id take my turn right now now i have to wait youve never taken a turn said gorge curiously but the other was silent again lets watch a show said ryoval and pouched a remote the tropic display changed to a lifesized vid recording of one of grunts sessions with the creatures from the bordello grunt watched himself with great interest and delight from all these new angles gorges work was gradually threatening to put many interesting events out of sight below his equator i am thinking of sending a copy of this to the dendarii mercenary fleet ryoval murmured watching him imagine all your senior staff officers viewing this i think it would fetch a few to me no no ryoval was lying his presence here was still secret or he wouldnt be present here and ryoval could be in no rush to give that secret away the other muttered dryly send a copy to simon illyan why dont you and see what that fetches you but illyan belonged to lord mark and mark wasnt here and anyway the other never ever ever spoke aloud imagine that pretty bodyguard of yours joining you here ryoval went on in detail grunt was perfectly willing to imagine some parts of it though other parts offended even him howl not me said howl thats not my job well just have to make a new recruit they all said he could make a thousand of them at need he was an army flowing like water parting around obstacles impossible to destroy with any one cut the vid display changed to one of howls finest moments the one which had given him his name shortly after hed been chemically skinned the techs had painted sticky stuff on him that made him itch unbearably the techs hadnt had to touch him hed almost killed himself theyd given him a transfusion afterwards to replace the blood lost in the raking wounds he stared impassively at the convulsing creature in the vid the show that ryoval wanted to see was himself looking at him right now must have all the drama and excitement of watching a testpattern boring ryoval looked like he wanted to aim the remote at him and switch programs the other waited with growing impatience he was beginning to get his breath back but there was still the damned low chair to contend with it had to be tonight by the next opportunity if any ever came gorge might have immobilized them all yes he waited ryovals lips puffed with disappointment watching his serene profile he shut the vid off and rose and walked around the chair studying him through narrowed eyes youre not even with me are you youve gone up around some bend i must think what will bring you back to me or should i say you all ryoval was much too perceptive i dont trust you said gorge to the other doubtfully what will happen to me after and me added grunt only howl said nothing howl was very tired i promise mark will still feed you gorge the other whispered from deep inside at least now and then and grunt mark could take you to beta colony there are people there who could help you clean up enough to come out in the daylight i think you wouldnt need ryovals hypospray poor howl is all exhausted anyway hes worked the hardest covering for the rest of you lot anyway grunt what if ryoval decides on castration next maybe you and howl can get together and mark could rent you a squad of beautiful women wouldnt women be a lovely changewith whips and chains this is jacksons whole i bet you could find some in the vid directory you dont need ryoval we save mark and hell save us i promise who are you to pledge marks word said gorge grumpily i am the closest to him youve certainly hidden out the best said howl with a hint of resentment it was necessary but we will all perish one by one as ryoval hunts us down hes terribly sharp we are the originals the new recruits would only be distorted shadows of us anyway this was true they all could see im bringing you a friend to play with ryoval commented walking around him having ryoval behind him had some odd effects on his internal topography gorge flattened howl emerged then sank again as ryoval came back in view grunt watched alertly for his cues rocking just slightly your clonetwin the one my stupid squad failed to take along deep down inside lord mark came wide awake screaming the other smothered him up he lies he lies their fumble proved to be a costly error for which they will pay your double vanished then somehow turned up with vasa luigi a typically smooth bit of sleight of hand on vasas part im still not convinced dear lotus doesnt have a private line of some kind into the durona group ryoval circled him again it was very disorienting vasa is quite convinced his twin is the admiral and you are the clone he has infected me with his doubts though if as he claims the man is indeed cryoamnesic it could prove most disappointing even if hes right but it doesnt matter now i have you both just as i predicted can you guess what is the first thing i shall have you two do to each other grunt could spoton though not with the whispered refinements ryoval added lord mark raged wept with terror and dismay not a vibration rippled grunts slackmouthed surface nor marred the flat glisten of his eyes with any inner purpose wait begged the other the baron walked to a counter or bar made of some zebragrained polished wood and unwrapped an array of glittering tools which no one could quite see though howl stretched his neck meditatively ryoval looked his kit over you have to stay out of my way and not sabotage me said the other i know ryoval gives you what you hunger forbut its a trick ryoval doesnt feed you said gorge ryoval is my food whispered the other youll only get one chance said howl nervously and then theyll come after me i only need one chance ryoval turned back a surgical handtractor gleamed in his grip grunt frightened gave way to the other i believe said ryoval that i will pull out one of your eyes next just one that should have some interesting psychological focusing effects when i threaten the remaining one smoothly howl gave way last of all reluctantly gorge gave way as ryoval walked toward them killers first attempt to struggle to his feet failed and he fell back damn you gorge he tried again shifted his weight forward heaved up stepped once halfunbalanced without the use of his arms to save himself ryoval watched highly amused unalarmed by the waddling little monster he doubtless thought he had created trying to work around gorges new belly was something like being the blind zen archer but his alignment was absolute his first kick took ryoval in the crotch this folded him neatly over and put his upper body within practical range he flowed instantly into the second kick striking ryoval squarely in the throat he could feel cartilage and tissue crunch all the way back to ryovals spine since he was not wearing steelcapped boots this time it also broke several of his toes smashed up and down at right angles he felt no pain that was howls job he fell over getting up again wasnt easy with his hands still shackled behind him wallowing around on the floor trying to get his legs under himself he saw with disappointment that ryoval wasnt dead yet the man writhed and gurgled and clutched his throat on the carpet next to him but the rooms computer control did not recognize the barons voice commands now they had a little time yet he rolled near to ryovals ear i am too a vorkosigan the one who was trained as a deeppenetration mole and assassin it really pisses me off when people underestimate me yknow he managed to get back on his feet and studied the problem which was ryoval was still alive he sighed swallowed stepped forward and pounded the man with repeated blows of his feet till ryoval stopped vomiting blood convulsing and breathing it was a nauseating process but in all he was very relieved that there seemed no part of himself who actually enjoyed it even killer had to muster a determined professionalism to see it through to the end he considered the other whom he now recognized as killer galen made you mostly didnt he yes but he didnt make me out of nothing you did very well hiding out stalking id wondered if any of us possessed any sense of timing at all im glad at least one of us does it was what the count our father said killer admitted pleased and embarrassed to be praised that people would give themselves to you if you waited them out and didnt rush to give yourself to them and i did and ryoval did he added shyly the counts a killer too you know like me hm he pulled his wrists against the shackles and limped over to the zebrawood counter to study ryovals kit the selection included a laserdrill as well as a sickening assortment of knives scalpels tongs and probes the drill was a shortfocalrange surgical type suitable for cutting bone a dubious weapon but a most suitable tool he wobbled around and tried to pick it up behind his back he almost wept when he dropped it he was going to have to get down on the floor again awkwardly he did so and lumbered around till he managed to grub up the drill it took many minutes of fiddling but at last he got it turned around and aimed in such a way as to cut through his shackles without either slicing his hand off or burning himself in the butt released he flung his arms around his swollen torso and rocked himself like someone rocking a weary child his foot was starting to throb the assorted mass vectors had apparently also combined to wrench his back when hed kicked ryoval in the throat he stared aside at his victimtormentorprey cloneconsumer he felt apologetic toward the body he had pummeled underfoot it wasnt your fault you died what ten years ago it was the one up top inside the skull who had been his enemy an illogical fear possessed him that ryovals guards would break in and save their master even in death he crawled over much easier now that he had his hands free took the laserdrill and made certain that no one would be transplanting that brain again ever no one no way he sagged back into the low chair and sat in utter exhaustion waiting to die ryovals men surely had orders to avenge their fallen lord no one came right the boss had locked himself in his quarters with a prisoner and a surgical kit and told his goons not to bother him how long before one worked up the courage to interrupt his little hobby could be quite a long time the weight of hope returning was an almost intolerable burden like walking on a broken bone i dont want to move he was very angry with impsec for abandoning him here but thought he might forgive them everything if only they would charge in now and waft him away without any further exertion or effort on his part havent i earned a break the room grew very silent that was overkill he thought staring down at ryovals body a trifle unbalanced that and youve made a mess on the carpet i dont know what to do next who was speaking killer gorge grunt howl all of them youre good troops and loyal but not too bright bright is not our job it was time for lord mark to wake up had he ever really been asleep all right gang he muttered aloud enfolding himself everybody up the low chair was a torturedevice in its own right ryovals last snide dig with a groan he regained his feet it was impossible that an old fox like ryoval would have only one entrance to his den he poked around the underground suite office living room small kitchen big bedroom and a rather oddly equipped bathroom he gazed longingly at the shower he had not been allowed to bathe since hed been brought here but he was afraid it might wash off the plastic skin he did brush his teeth his gums were bleeding but that was all right he drank a little cold water at least im not hungry he vented a small cackle he found the emergency exit at last in the back of the bedroom closet if its not guarded stated killer it must be boobytrapped ryovals main defenses will work from the outside in said lord mark slowly from the inside out it will be set up to facilitate a quick escape for ryoval and ryoval alone it was palmlocked palmlock pads read pulse temperature and the electrical conductivity of the skin as well as the whorls of fingerprints and grooves of lifelines dead hands didnt open palmlocks there are ways around palm locks murmured killer killer had been trained in such things once in a previous incarnation lord mark let go and floated watching the surgical array was almost as useful as an electronics kit in killers hands given abundant time and as long as the palm lock was never going to be required to work again lord mark gazed dreamily as killer loosened the sensorpad from the wall touched here cut there the control virtual on the wall lit at last ah murmured killer proudly oh said the rest the display projected a small glowing square it wants a codekey said killer in dismay his panic at being trapped quickened their heart rate howls tenuous containment loosened and electrical twinges of pain coursed through them wait said lord mark if they needed a codekey so must ryoval baron ryoval has no successor ryoval had no secondincommand no trained replacement he kept all his oppressed subordinates in separate channels of communication house ryoval consisted of baron ryoval and slaves period thats why house ryoval failed to grow ryoval didnt delegate authority ever therefore ryoval had no place nor trusted subordinates with whom to leave his private codekeys he had to carry them on his person at all times the blackgang whimpered as lord mark turned around and returned to the living room mark ignored them this is my job now he turned ryovals body over on its back and searched it methodically from head to toe down to the skin and farther he missed no possibility not even hollow teeth he sat back uncomfortably distended belly aching sprained back on fire his level of pain was rising as he reintegrated which made it a very tentative process it has to be here it has to be here somewhere run run run the blackgang gibbered in a remarkably unified chorus shut up and let me think he turned ryovals right hand over in his own a ring with a flat black stone gleamed in the light he laughed out loud he swallowed the laugh fearfully looking around the barons soundproofing held apparently the ring would not slide off stuck riveted to the bone he cut off ryovals right hand with the laser drill the laser also cauterized the wrist so it wasnt too drippy nice he limped slowly and painfully back to the bedroom closet and stared at the little glowing square just the size of the rings stone which way up would the wrong rotation trigger an alarm lord mark pantomimed baron ryoval in a hurry slap the palm lock turn his hand over and jam the ring into the code slotthis way he whispered the door slid open on a personal lift tube it extended upward some twenty meters its antigrav control pads glowed green for up red for down lord mark and killer gazed around no obvious defenses such as a tanglefield generator a faint draft brought a scent of fresh air from above lets go screamed gorge and grunt and howl lord mark stood spraddlelegged and stodgy staring refusing to be rushed it has no safety ladder he said at last so what so what killer sagged back and muffled the rest of them and waited respectfully i want a safety ladder muttered lord mark querulously he turned away and wandered back through ryovals quarters while he was at it he looked for clothes there wasnt much to choose from this clearly was not ryovals main residence just a private suite the garments were all too long and not wide enough the trousers were impossible a soft knit shirt stretched over his raw skin though a loose jacket left open provided some more protection a betanstyle sarong bathwear wrapped his loins a pair of slippers were sloppy on his left foot tight on his swollen broken right foot he searched for cash keys anything else of use but there was no handy climbing gear ill just have to make my own safety ladder he hung the laser drill around his neck on a tie made from a couple of ryovals belts stepped into the bottom of the lift tube and systematically began to burn holes in the plastic side too slow the black gang wailed howl howled inside and even killer screamed run dammit lord mark ignored them he turned on the up field but did not let it take them clinging to his hot hand and foot holds he pocked his way upward it was not difficult to climb buoyed in the flowing grav field only hard to remember to keep his three points of contact his right foot was nearly useless the black gang gibbered in fear mulish and methodical mark ascended melt a hole wait move a hand foot hand foot melt another hole wait three meters from the top his head came level with a small audio pickup flush to the wall and a shielded motion sensor i imagine it wants a code word in ryovals voice lord mark remarked blandly observing cant oblige it doesnt have to be what you guess killer said it could be anything plasma arcs poison gas no ryoval saw me but i saw ryoval it will be simple and elegant and you will do it to yourself watch he gripped his handhold and extended the laser drill up past the motion sensor for the next burn the lift tubes grav field switched off even halfexpecting it he was nearly ripped from his perch by his own weight howl could not contain it all mark screamed silently flooded in pain but he clung and did not let them fall the last three meters of ascent could have been called a nightmare but he had new standards for nightmares now it was merely tedious there was a tanglefield trap at the top entrance but it faced outward the laser drill disarmed its controls he managed a crippled shuffling crabwise walk into a private underground garage it contained the barons lightflyer the canopy opened at the touch of ryovals ring he slid into the lightflyer adjusted the seat and controls as best he could around his distorted and aching contours powered it up eased it forward that button on the control panelthere the garage door slid aside once through he shot up and up and up through the dark the acceleration pummeling him nobody even fired on him there were no lights below a rocky winter waste the whole little installation must be underground he checked the flyers map display and picked his direction east toward the light that seemed right he kept accelerating chapter twentynine the lightflyer banked miles craned his neck and caught a glimpse of what was below or what wasnt below dawn was creeping over a wintry desert there appeared to be nothing of interest for kilometers around s funny said the guard who was piloting the lightflyer doors open he touched his comm and transmitted some sort of codeburst the other guard shifted uneasily watching his comrade miles twisted around trying to watch them both they descended rocks rose around them then a concrete shaft ah concealed entrance they came to the bottom and moved forward into an underground garage huh said the other guard wheres all the vehicles the flyer came to rest and the bigger guard dragged miles out of the backseat and unfastened his ankles and stood him upright he almost fell down again the scars on his chest ached with the strain from his hands bound behind his back he got his feet under himself and stared around much as the guards were doing just a utilitarian garage badlylit echoing and cavernous and empty the guards marched him toward an entrance they coded through some automatic doors and walked to an electronic security chamber it was up and running humming blankly vaj one guard called were here scan us no answer one of the guards went forward looked around tapped a code into a wall pad bring him through anyway the security chamber passed him he was still wearing the grey knits the duronas had given him no interesting devices woven into the fabric it seemed alas the senior guard tried an intercom several times nobody answers what should we do asked his comrade the senior man frowned strip him and take him to the boss i guess those were the orders they pulled his shipknits off him he was far too outmassed to fight them but he regretted the loss deeply it was too damned cold even the oxlike guards stared a moment at his raked and scored chest they refastened his hands behind him and marched him through the facility their eyes shifting warily at every intersection it was very quiet lights burned but no people appeared anywhere a strange structure not very large plain andhe sniffeddecidedly medical in odor research he decided ryovals private biological research facility evidently after the dendarii raid of four years ago ryoval had decided his main facility wasnt secure enough miles could see that this place did not have the businessair of the other locale it felt militaryparanoid the sort of place where if you went there to work you didnt come out again for years at a time or considering ryoval ever he glimpsed a few lablike rooms in passing but no techs the guards called out a couple of times no one answered they came to an open door beyond which lay some sort of study or office baron sir the senior guard ventured we have your prisoner the other guard rubbed his neck if hes not here should we go ahead and work him like the other one he hasnt ordered it yet better wait quite ryoval was not the sort to reward initiative in subordinates miles suspected with a deep nervous sigh the senior man stepped across the threshold and looked around the junior man prodded miles forward in his wake the study was finely furnished with a real wood desk and an odd chair in front of it with metal wristlocks for the person who sat in it nobody ran out on a conversation with baron ryoval till baron ryoval was ready apparently they waited what do we do now dont know this is as far as my orders went the senior man paused could be a test they waited about five more minutes if you dont want to look around said miles brightly i will they looked at each other the senior man his forehead creased drew a stunner and sidled cautiously through an archway into the next room his voice came back after a moment shit and after another moment an odd mewling wail cut off and swallowed this was too much even for the dim bulb who held miles with his ham hand still locked firmly around miless upper arm the second guard followed the first into a large chamber arranged as a living room a wallsized holovid was blank and silent a zebragrained wood bar divided the room an extremely low chair faced an open area baron ryovals very dead body lay there faceup naked staring at the ceiling with dry eyes there were no obvious signs of a struggleno overturned furniture nor plasma arc burns in the wallsexcept upon the body there the marks of violence were focused utterly concentrated throat crushed torso pulped dried blood smeared around his mouth a double line of fingertipsized black dots were stitched neatly across the barons forehead they looked like burns his right hand was missing cut away the wrist a cauterized stump the guards twitched in something like horror an alltootemporary paralysis of astonishment what happened whispered the junior man which way will they jump how did ryoval control his employeeslaves anyway the lesser folk through terror of course the middlemanagement and tech layer through some subtle combination of fear and selfinterest but these his personal bodyguards must be the innermost cadre the ultimate instrument by which their masters will was forced upon all the rest they could not be as mentally stunted as their stolidity suggested or they would be useless in an emergency but if their narrow minds were intact it followed that they must be controlled through their emotions men whom ryoval let stand behind him with activated weapons must be programmed to the max probably from birth ryoval must be father mother family and all to them ryoval must be their god but now their god was dead what would they do was i am free even an intelligible concept to them without its focal object how fast would their programming start to break down not fast enough an ugly light compounded of rage and fear was growing in their eyes i didnt do it miles pointed out with quick prudence i was with you stay here growled the senior man ill reconnoiter he loped off through the barons apartment to return in a few minutes with a laconic his flyers gone lift tube defenses buggered all to hell too they hesitated ah the downside of perfect obedience crippled initiative hadnt you better check around the facility miles suggested there might be survivors witnesses maybe maybe the assassin is still hiding somewhere where is mark what do we do with him asked the junior man with a jerk of his head at miles the senior man scowled in indecision take him along or lock him up or kill him you dont know what the baron wanted me for miles interrupted instantly better take me along till you find out he wanted you for the other one said the senior man with an indifferent glance down at him little naked halfhealed with his hands bound behind him the guards clearly did not perceive him as a threat too right hell after a brief muttered conference the junior man pushed him along and they began as rapid and methodical a tour of the facility as miles would have wished to make himself they found two of their redandblack uniformed comrades dead a mysterious pool of blood snaked across a corridor from wall to wall they found another body fully dressed as a senior tech in a shower the back of his head crushed with some blunt object on descending levels they found more signs of struggle of looting and of bynomeansrandom destruction comconsoles and equipment smashed had it been a slave revolt some power struggle among factions revenge all three simultaneously was the murder of ryoval its cause or its goal had there been a mass evacuation or a mass killing at every corner miles braced himself for a scene of carnage the lowest level had a laboratory with half a dozen glasswalled cells lining one end from the smell some experiment had been left cooking far too long he glanced into the cells and swallowed they had been human once those lumps of flesh scar tissue and growths they were now culturedishes of some kind four had been female two male some departing tech as an act of mercy had neatly cut each ones throat he eyed them desperately his face pressed to the glass surely they were all too large to have been mark surely such effects could not have been achieved in a mere five days surely he did not want to enter the cells for a closer examination at least it explained why more of ryovals slaves did not try to resist there was an air of awful economy about it dont like your work in the bordello girl sick of the boredom and brutality of being a guard man how would you like to go into scientific research the last stop for any wouldbe spartacus among ryovals human possessions bel was right we should have nuked this place the last time we were here the guards gave the cells a brief glance and pressed on miles hung back seized by inspiration it was worth a try shit miles hissed and jumped the guards spun around that that man in there he moved i think im going to vomit cant have the senior guard stared through the transparent wall at a body which lay with its back to them he couldnt possibly have witnessed anything from in there could he said miles for gods sake dont open the door shut up the senior guard chewed his lip stared at the control virtual and after an irresolute moment coded open the door and trod cautiously within gah said miles what snapped the junior guard he moved again he he sort of spasmed the junior man drew his stunner and followed his comrade inside covering him the senior man extended his hand faltered and on second thought pulled his shock stick from his belt and prodded it warily toward the body miles smacked the door control with a duck of his forehead the glass seal slid shut barely in time the guards smashed into the door and up it like rabid dogs it barely transmitted the vibration their mouths were open howling curses and threats at him but no sound passed the transparent walls must be spacegrade material it stopped stunner fire too the senior man pulled out a plasma arc and began burning the wall started to glow slightly not good miles studied the control panel there he pushed at menu blocks with his tongue till it brought up oxygen and reset it down as far as it would go would the guards pass out before the wall gave way to the plasma arc yes good environmental system that ryovals dogs crumpled against the glass clawed hands relaxing in unconsciousness the plasma arc fell from nerveless fingers and shut off miles left them sealed in their victims tomb it was a lab there had to be cutters and tools of all sorts right it took several minutes of contortions working behind his back during which he nearly passed out but his shackles gave way at last he whimpered with relief as his hands came free weapons all weapons per se had been taken apparently by the departing inhabitants and without a biotainer suit he was disinclined to reopen the glass cell and retrieve the guards gear but a laserscalpel from the lab made him feel less vulnerable he wanted his clothing shivering from the cold he trotted back through the eerie corridors to the security entrance and donned his knits again he turned back into the facility and began to seriously search he tried every comconsole he came to that wasnt smashed all were internally dedicated no way to tap an outside channel where is mark it occurred to him suddenly that if there could be anything worse than being held prisoner in some cell here waiting for his tormentors to come again it would be to be locked in a cell here waiting for tormentors who never came again in what was perhaps the most frantic halfhour hed ever experienced in his life he opened or broke open every door in the facility behind every one he expected to find a sodden little body its throat mercifully cut he was wheezing and fearing another convulsion when with great relief he found the cellclosetnear ryovals quarters empty it stank of recent occupation though and the bloodstains and other stains on the walls and floor turned his stomach cold and sick but wherever mark was and in whatever condition he was not here he had to get out of here too he caught his breath and found a plastic basket and went shopping in the labs for useful electronic equipment cutters and wires circuitdiagnostics readers and relays whatever he could find when he thought he had enough he returned to the barons study and proceeded to dissect the damaged comconsole he finally managed to jump the palmlock only to have a little bright square patch come up onview and demand insert codekey he cursed and stretched his aching back and sat again this was going to be tedious it took another pass through the facility for equipment before he was able to jump the codekey block and the comconsole would never be the same but at last finally he punched through to the planetary communications net there was another short glitch while he figured out how to charge the call to house ryovals account all fees were collected in advance here on jacksons whole he paused a moment wondering who to call barrayar kept a consulate on the hargravesdyne consortium station some of the staff were actually diplomatic andor economic personnel but even they doubled as impsec analysts the rest were agentsproper running a thin network of informants scattered across the planet and its satellites and stations admiral naismith had a contact there but had impsec been here already was this their work rescuing mark no he decided it was ruthless but not nearly methodical enough in fact it was utter chaos so why didnt you guys come looking for mark a bothersome question and one to which he had no answer he punched through the consulates code let the circus begin they were down on him in half an hour a tense impsec lieutenant named iverson with a rented squad of local muscle from house dyne in paramilitary uniforms and with decent military equipment theyd dropped straight from orbit in a shuttle heat wavered off its skin in the watery morning light miles sat on a rock outside the pedestrian entrance or more properly speaking emergency exit hed found and watched sardonically as they all galloped out weapons at the ready and spread out as if to take the installation by assault the officer hurried up to him and halfsaluted admiral naismith iverson was no one he knew at this level of the echelon the man must take him for a valued but nonbarrayaran impsec hireling the one and only you can tell your men to relax the installation is secured you secured it yourself iverson asked in faint disbelief more or less weve been looking for this place for two years miles suppressed an irate remark about people who couldnt find their own prick with a map and a handlight where is ah mark the other clone my double we dont know sir acting on a tip from an informant we were about to make an assault on a house bharaputra location to retrieve you when you called i was there last night your informant did not know i was moved had to be rowanshed got out hooray you would have been embarrassingly late iversons lips thinned this has been an incredibly fouledup operation from first to last the orders kept changing tell me miles sighed have you heard anything from the dendarii mercenaries a covert ops team from your outfit is supposed to be on its way sir iversons sirs were tinged with uncertainty the dubious regard of a barrayaran regular for a selfpromoted mercenary i wish to ascertain for myself if the installation is fully secure if you dont mind go ahead miles said youll find it an interesting tour if you have a strong stomach iverson marched his troopers indoors miles would have laughed if he werent screaming inside he sighed slipped from his perch and followed them miless people came in a small personnel shuttle swooping right into the concealed garage he watched them on the monitor from ryovals study and gave them directions how to find him quinn elena taura and bel all in halfarmor they came clanking into the study doubletime almost as impressively useless as the impsec crowd why the party clothes was his first weary question as they heaved into view he should stand and receive and return salutes and things but ryovals station chair was incredibly comfortable and he was incredibly tired miles quinn cried passionately with the sight of her concerned face he realized just how very angry he was and guilty for it furiously angry because furiously afraid where is mark damn you all captain quinn he put her on notice that this was dutytime before she could fling herself on him she skidded to a halt in midfling and came to a species of attention the others piled up behind her we were just coordinating with impsec for a raid on house bharaputra quinn said breathlessly youve come back to yourself you were cryoamnesichave you recovered that durona doctor said you would about ninety percent i think im still finding holes in my memory quinnwhat happened she looked slightly overwhelmed since when when you were killed start from five days ago when you came to the durona group we came looking for you found you after nearly four bleeding months you were stunned mark was taken and lilly durona hustled me and my surgeon off to what she thought was going to be safety miles cued her to the focus he wanted oh she was your doctor i thoughtnever mind quinn bit back her emotions pulled off her helmet and pushed back her hood raked redtipped fingers through her smashed curls and began organizing the information into its essentials combatstyle we lost hours at the start by the time elena and taura got another aircar the snatchers were long gone they searched but no luck when they got back to the durona group bel and i were just waking up lilly durona insisted you were safe i didnt believe her we pulled out and i contacted impsec they started to pull in their people who were scattered all over the planet looking for clues as to your whereabouts and sent them to focus on mark more delays while they worked through their pet theory that the kidnappers were cetagandan bountyhunters and house ryoval had about fifty different sites and facilities to check on not including this one which really was secret then lilly durona decided you were missing after all since it seemed more important to find you we diverted all available forces to that but we had fewer leads we didnt even find the abandoned lightflyer for two days and it yielded up no clues right but you suspected ryoval had mark but ryoval wanted admiral naismith we thought ryoval would figure out he had the wrong man he ran his hands over his face his head was aching and so was his stomach did you ever figure that ryoval wouldnt care in a few minutes i want you to go down the corridor and look at the cell they kept him in and smell it i want you to look closely in fact go now sergeant taura stay reluctantly quinn led elena and bel out miles leaned forward taura bent to hear taura what happened youre a jacksonian you know what ryoval is what this place is how did you all lose sight of that she shook her big head captain quinn thought mark was a complete screwup after your death she was so angry she could barely give him the time of day and at first i agreed with her but i dont know he tried so hard the creche raid only failed by a hair if wed been faster or if the shuttle defense perimeter had done their job we would have brought it off i think he grimaced in agreement theres no mercy for failures of timing in nomargin operations like that one was commanders can have no mercy either or you might as well stay in orbit and feed your troops directly into the ships waste disintegrators and save steps he paused quinn will be a good commander someday i think so sir taura pulled off her helmet and hood and stared around i kind of came to like the little schmuck though he tried he tried and failed but no one else tried at all and he was so alone alone yes here for five days we really did think ryoval would figure out he wasnt you maybe maybe so some part of his mind clung to that hope himself maybe it hadnt been as bad as it looked as bad as his galloping imagination supplied quinn and company returned looking universally grim so he said youve found me now maybe we can all focus on mark ive been all over this place in the last hours and i havent found a clue did the absconding staff take him along is he out wandering around in the desert somewhere freezing ive got six of iversons men looking outside with scopes and another one checking the facilitys disintegration records for fiftyplus kilo lumps of protein and other bright ideas folks elena came back from a peek in the next room who do you figure did the honors on ryoval miles opened his hands dont know he had hundreds of mortal enemies after his career he was killed by an unarmed person a kick to the throat then beaten to death somehow after he was down i noticed that you notice the tool kit yeah miles it was mark how could it have been it had to have happened sometime last night after what five days of being worked overand marks a little guy like me i dont think its physically possible marks a little guy but not like you said elena and he almost killed a man in vorbarr sultana with a kick to the throat what he was trained miles he was trained to take out your father who is an even bigger man than ryoval and has years of combat experience yes but i never believed when was mark in vorbarr sultana amazing how being dead for two or three months will put you out of touch for the first time his impulse to fling himself directly back into activeduty command status was checked a maniac with threequarters of a memory and a habit of going into convulsions is just what we want in charge sure not to mention the shortness of breath oh and about your father i should mentionno maybe that had better wait elena eyed him in worry what about he was interrupted by a buzz from the comm link iverson had given him as a courtesy yes lieutenant admiral naismith baron fell is here at the entrance with a doublesquad he ah says hes here to collect his deceased halfbrothers body as nextofkin miles whistled soundlessly and grinned is he now well tell you what let him come inside with one bodyguard and well talk he may know something dont let his squad in yet though do you think thats wise how the hell should i know sure in a few minutes baron fell himself puffed in escorted by one of iversons rental troopers and flanked by a big greenclad guard barons fells round face was slightly pinker than usual with the exertion otherwise he was the same plump grandfatherly figure as ever exuding the usual dangerously deceptive good cheer baron fell miles nodded how good to see you again fell nodded back admiral yes i imagine everything looks good to you just now so it really was you the bharaputran sniper shot your clonetwin did an excellent job of pretending to be you afterward i must say much to the confusion of an already very confused situation argh yes and ah what brings you here trade stated fell jacksonian shorthand for you first miles nodded the late baron ryoval had me brought me here in a lightflyer by two of his erstwhile bodyguards we found things much as you see them i um neutralized them at my first opportunity how i came to be in their hands is a more complicated story meaning thats all you get till i get some there are some extraordinary rumors starting to circulate about my dear departedhe is departed i trust oh yes you can see in a moment thank you my dear departed halfbrothers death i had one firsthand a former ryoval employee from here fled directly to him as an informant right i hope his virtue was rewarded it will be as soon as i ascertain he was telling the truth well why dont you come look he had to get up out of the station chair he marshalled the effort with difficulty and led the baron into the living room the house fell bodyguard and the dendarii following the big bodyguard shot a worried glance at sergeant taura looming over him she smiled back her fangs gleaming hi there youre kinda cute you know she told him he recoiled and sidled closer to his master fell hurried to the body knelt by its right side and held up the severed wrist he hissed with disappointment who has done this we dont know yet said miles thats how i found him exactly fell shot him a sharp glance yes fell traced the black holes across the corpses forehead whoever did this knew what he was doing i want to find the assassin to avenge your brothers death elena asked cautiously no to offer him a job fell laughed a booming jolly sound do you realize how many people have been trying for how many years to accomplish this ive an idea said miles if you can help in the next room ryovals halfbutchered comconsole chimed fell looked up eyes intent no one can call in here without the codekey he stated and heaved to his feet miles barely beat him back into the study and slid into the station chair he activated the vid plate yes and almost fell out of his seat again marks puffy face formed above the vid plate he looked like hed just come out of a shower face scrubbed hair wet and slicked back he was wearing grey knits like miless blue bruises going greenishyellow around the edges made what skin miles could see look like a patchwork quilt but both eyes were open and very bright his ears were still on ah he said cheerfully there you are i thought you might be have you figured out who you are yet mark miles almost tried to crawl through the vid image are you all right where are you you have i see good im at lilly duronas god miles what a place what a woman she let me have a bath she put my skin back on she fixed my foot she gave me a hypo of musclerelaxant for my back with her own hands she performed medical services too intimate and disgusting to describe but very badly needed i assure you and held my head while i screamed did i mention the bath i love her and i want to marry her all this was delivered with such deadpan enthusiasm miles could not tell if mark was joking what are you on he asked suspiciously pain killers lots and lots of pain killers oh its wonderful he favored miles with a weird broad grin but dont worry my head is perfectly clear its just the bath i was holding it together till she gave me the bath it unmanned me do you know what a wonderful thing a bath is when youre washing offnever mind how did you get out of here and back to the durona clinic miles asked urgently in ryovals lightflyer of course the codekey worked behind miles baron fell drew in his breath mark he leaned into the vid pick up with a smile would you put lilly on a moment please ah baron fell said mark good i was going to call you next i want to invite you to tea here at lillys we have a lot to talk about you too miles and bring all your friends mark gave him a sharply meaningful glance quietly miles reached down and pressed the alert button on iversons comm link why mark because i need them my own troops are much too tired for any more work today your troops please do as i ask because i ask it because you owe me mark added in a voice so low miles had to strain to hear marks eyes burned a brief spark fell muttered he used it he has to know he leaned in again and said to mark do you know what you have in ah hand mark oh baron i know what im doing i dont know why so many people have so much trouble believing that mark added in a tone of hurt complaint i know exactly what im doing then he laughed it was a very disturbing laugh edgy and too loud let me talk to lilly said fell no you come here and talk to lilly said mark petulantly anyway you want to talk to me he nailed fells eye with a direct look i promise you will find it profitable i believe i do want to talk with you murmured fell very well miles youre there in ryovals study where i was mark searched his face for what miles could not guess but then mark nodded quietly to himself as if satisfied is elena there yes elena leaned forward on miless other side what do you need mark i want to talk to you a moment armswoman privately would you clear the room of everyone else please everyone you cant miles began armswoman notnot leigesworn you cant be technically i suppose shes not now that youre alive again said mark he smiled sadly but i want a service my first and last request elena privately elena looked around everybody out please miles this is between mark and me armswoman miles muttered allowing himself to be thrust back out into the corridor how can elena shut the door on them all miles called iverson to arrange transport and other things it was still a polite race with fell but it was clearly a race elena emerged after a few minutes her face was strained you go on to duronas mark has asked me to find something for him here ill catch up collect all the data you can for impsec while youre at it then said miles feeling bewildered by the pace of events somehow he seemed not to be in charge here ill tell iverson to give you a free hand butarmswoman does that mean what i think it does how can it means nothing now but i owe mark we all do he killed ryoval you know i was beginning to realize it had to be so i just didnt see how with both hands tied behind his back he says i believe him she turned again toward ryovals suite that was mark miles muttered heading reluctantly in the opposite direction he couldnt have acquired some other clonebrother while he was dead could he it didnt sound like mark for one thing he sounded like he was glad to see me thats mark oh yes said quinn that was mark all right he quickened his pace even taura had to lengthen her stride to keep up chapter thirty the dendariis little personnel shuttle kept pace with baron fells larger drop shuttle they arrived at the durona groups clinic almost simultaneously a house dyne shuttle belonging temporarily to impsec was waiting politely across the street from the entrance by the little park just waiting as they were circling for a landing miles asked quinn who was piloting elliif we were flying along in a lightflyer or an aircar or something and i suddenly ordered you to crash it would you now asked quinn startled the shuttle lurched no not now i mean theoretically obey instantly no questions asked well sure i suppose so id ask questions afterward though probably with my hands wrapped around your neck thats what i thought miles sat back satisfied they rendezvoused with baron fell at the front entrance where the gate guards prepared to code open a portal in the force screen fell frowned at the three dendarii in their halfarmor quinn and bel and taura trailing miles in his grey knits this is my facility fell pointed out his own pair of greenclad men eyed them without favor these are my bodyguards said miles for whom i have a demonstrated need your force screen appears to have a malfunction he was taken care of said fell grimly that wont happen again nevertheless by way of concession miles jerked his thumb at the shuttle by the park my other friends can wait outside fell frowned thinking it over all right he said at last they followed him inside hawk met them bowed to the baron and escorted them formally up through the series of lift tubes to lilly duronas penthouse the word for it miles thought rising past the chromium railing was tableau it was all arranged as perfectly as any stage setting mark was the centerpiece he sat back comfortably in lilly duronas own chair his bandaged right foot propped on a silk pillow on the low round tea table surrounded by duronas lilly herself her white hair braided today like a crown wreathing her head stood at marks right hand leaning bemusedly on the upholstered chair back smiling down beneficently upon the top of his head hawk took up position on marks left side dr chrys dr poppy and dr rose clustered admiringly around them dr chrys had a large fireextinguisher by her knee rowan was not here the window had been repaired on the center of the table sat a transparent coldbox within it lay a severed hand wearing a big silver ring set with what appeared to be a square black onyx marks physical appearance disturbed miles he had been braced to witness traumas of unnamed tortures but mark was covered neck to ankle in concealing grey knits like his own only the bruises on his face and the bandage on his foot hinted at the past five days activities but his face and body were strangely and unhealthily bloated his stomach shockingly so more than the stoutlybalanced figure hed seen here in dendarii uniform just a few days ago and far beyond the almostduplicate of himself hed tried to rescue from the raid on the clone creche four months ago in another person baron fell for example the nearobesity wouldnt have made him even blink but mark could this be miles himself someday if he slowed down he had a sudden urge to swear off desserts elli was frankly staring horrified and repelled mark was smiling a little control box lay under his right hand his index finger kept pressure on a button baron fell saw the coldbox containing the hand and started for it crying ah stop said mark the baron stopped and cocked his head at him yes he said warily the object you are interested in is sitting in that sealed box on top of a small thermal grenade controlled he lifted his hand with the remote in it by this deadman switch there is a second positivecontrol switch in the hands of another person outside of this room stun me or jump me and it will go off frighten me and my hand might slip tire me out and my finger might give way annoy me enough and i might just let go for the hell of it the fact that you have made such an arrangement said fell slowly tells me you know the value of what you hold you wouldnt youre bluffing he stared piercingly at lilly dont try me said mark still smiling after five days of your halfbrothers hospitality im in a real hostile mood whats in that box is valuable to you not to me however he took a breath you do have some things that are valuable to me baron lets deal fell sucked on his lower lip and stared into marks glittering eyes ill listen he said at last mark nodded a couple of duronas hurried to bring chairs for baron fell and miles the bodyguards arranged themselves standing fells guards looked like they were thinking hard watching the box and their master the dendarii watched the greenclad guards in turn fell settled himself with a formal air halfsmiling eyes intent tea inquired lilly thank you said the baron the two durona children hurried out at her nod the ritual was begun miles sat gingerly and clamped his teeth together hard whatever was going on here he hadnt been briefed it was clearly marks show but he wasnt entirely sure mark was sane right now smart yes sane no baron fell looked like he might be coming to the same conclusion staring across the tea table at his selfappointed host the two opponents waited in silence for the tea to arrive sizing each other up the while the boy brought in the tray and set it beside the gruesome box the girl poured just two cups lillys finest imported japan green for mark and the baron and offered tea cookies with them no said mark to the cookies in a tone of loathing thank you the baron took two and nibbled one mark started to lift his tea cup lefthanded but his hand was shaking too badly and he set it hastily back in its saucer on the arm of lillys chair before it could spill and scald the girl slipped silently up to him and lifted it to his lips he sipped and nodded gratefully and she settled down with the cup by his left knee to serve again at his word hes hurt one hell of a lot worse than hes managing to look right now miles realized his stomach cold the baron looked at marks trembling left hand and more dubiously at his right and shifted uneasily baron fell mark said i think you will agree with me that time is of the essence shall i begin please do in that coldbox mark nodded toward the severed hand is the key to house ryoval ry ryovals ah secret decoder ring mark cackled loudly bit back the laugh and nodded to the girl for another sip of tea he regained control of his voice and continued embedded in the rings crystal are all of the late baron ryovals personal codekeys now house ryoval has a peculiar administrative structure to say that ry ryoval was a paranoid control freak would be a gross understatement but ryoval is dead leaving his scattered subordinates at scattered locations without their accustomed direction when the rumors of his death reach them who knows what they will do youve seen one example and a day or two from now the vultures will be flying in from all over to tear at the carcass of house ryoval possession is rather more than nine points of the nonexistent law around here house bharaputra alone has obvious congruent interests in house ryovals wares im sure you can think of others baron fell nodded but a man who had ryovals own codekeys in his hand today could be at a considerable advantage mark went on particularly if he was wellsupplied with personnel to provide material backup without the tedious delays of cracking ryovals codes one by one he could put himself in position to take immediate control of most or all of house ryovals current assets from the top down instead of piecemeal add to that a wellknown tie of blood to lend legitimacy to his claims and i think most of the competition would sheer off without need for any expensive confrontation at all my halfbrothers codekey ring is not yours to trade said fell coldly oh yes it is said mark i won it i control it i can destroy it and he licked his lips the girl raised the teacup again i paid for it you would not now be offered this exclusiveand it is still exclusiveopportunity if not for me the baron gave a very tiny nod of concession go on what would you say the value of the durona group is compared to the value of house ryovals current assets proportionally the baron frowned onetwentieth onethirtieth perhaps house ryoval has far more real estate the er intellectual property value is harder to calculate they specialize in rather different biological tasks leaving asideor leaving behindthe real estate house ryoval is clearly enormously more valuable facilities techs slaves client list surgeons geneticists i would have to say so all right lets trade i will give you house ryoval in exchange for the durona group plus value in a bearerpaid credit chit equal to ten percent of the assets of house ryoval ten percent an agents fee said fell looking at lilly lilly smiled and said nothing a mere agents fee mark agreed cheap at twice the price which notcoincidentally is at least what you will lose without the advantages of ry ryovals codekeys and what would you do with all these ladies if you had them ah mark what i wist wist from wistful i think i like the verb form better thinking of setting up in business here yourself baron mark miles froze appalled at this new vision no sighed mark i wist to go home baron i wist it real bad i will give the durona groupto themselves and you will let them go free and unmolested and without pursuit to wherever theywist escobar was it lilly he looked up at lilly who looked down at him and smiled and nodded slightly how very bizarre murmured the baron i think you are mad oh baron you have no idea a weird chuckle escaped mark if he was acting it was the best acting job miles had ever seen not excluding his own wildest flights of scam the baron sat back and crossed his arms his face grew stony with thought would he decide to try to jump them frantically miles began trying to calculate the military options of a sudden firefight dendarii on deck impsec in orbit himself and mark at risk the sudden bright muzzleflare of a projectile weaponoh god what a mess ten percent said the baron at last less the value of the durona group who calculates the value of that intellectual property baron i do and they evacuate immediately all property notes files and experiments in progress to be left intact mark glanced up at lilly she bent and whispered in his ear the durona group shall have the right to duplicate technical files and have the right to carry away personal items such as clothing and books the baron stared thoughtfully at the ceiling they may carry awaywhat each one may carry no more they may not duplicate technical files and their credit account remains as it has always been mine lillys brows drew down another whispered conference behind her hand with mark he waved away some objection and pointed orbitward she finally nodded baron fell mark took a deep breath its a deal its a deal fell confirmed watching him with a slight smile my hand on it mark intoned he snickered turned his control box over and twisted a knob on the underside he set it back down on his chairarm and shook out his trembling fingers fell stretched in his chair shaking off the tension the guards relaxed miles almost fell into a puddle cripes what have we done at lillys direction assorted duronas scattered in a hurry its been very entertaining doing business with you mark fell rose i dont know where home is for you but if you ever decide you want a job come see me again i could use an agent like you in my galactic affairs your sense of timing is viciously elegant thank you baron mark nodded ill keep it in mind should some of my other options not work out your brother too fell added as an afterthought assuming his full recovery of course my troops could use a more active combat commander miles cleared his throat house fells needs are mainly defensive i prefer the dendariis more aggressive type of assignments he said there may be more assault work upcoming said fell his eyes going slightly distant thinking of conquering the world miles inquired the fell empire the acquisition of house ryoval will put house fell in an interestingly unbalanced position said fell it would not be worthwhile to pursue a policy of unlimited expansion and cope with all the opposition that must result for a mere five or so years of rule but if one were to live for another fifty years say one might find some most absorbing work for a military officer of capacity fell raised an inquiring brow at miles no thank you and i wish you all joy of each other mark gave miles a sliteyed feline glance of amusement what an extraordinary solution mark had wrought miles thought what a deal did a jacksonian defy his upbringing by joining the side of the angels rebel by becoming incorruptible so it appeared i think my brother is more jacksonian than he realizes a renegade jacksonian the mind boggles at fells gesture one of his bodyguards carefully picked up the transparent box fell turned to lilly well old sister youve had an interesting life i still have it smiled lilly for a while long enough for me greedy little boy so this is the end of the road the last of our bloodpact who would have imagined it all those years ago when we were climbing out of ryovals sewers together not i said fell they embraced each other goodbye lilly goodbye georie fell turned to mark the deal is the deal and for my house this is for me for old times sake he stuck out a thick hand may i shake your hand sir mark looked bewildered and suspicious but lilly nodded to him he allowed his hand to be engulfed by fells thank you said georish stauber sincerely he jerked his chin at his guards and vanished down the lift tube in their company do you think this deal will hold mark asked lilly in a thin worried voice long enough for the next few days georish will be much too busy assimilating his new acquisition it will absorb all his resources and then some and after that it will be too late regret later yes pursuit and vengeance no its enough its all we need she stroked his hair fondly you just rest now have some more tea were going to be very busy for a while she turned to gather up the young duronas robin violet come along quickly she hurried them into the interior of her quarters mark slumped looking very tired he grimaced in bemusement at the teacup switched it to his right hand and swirled it thoughtfully before drinking elli touched her halfarmor helmet listened and vented a sudden bitter bark of laughter the impsec commander at hargravesdyne station is on the line he says his reinforcements have arrived and where should he send them miles and mark looked at each other miles didnt know what mark was thinking but most of the responses that were leaping to his mind were violently obscene home said mark at last and they can give us a ride while theyre at it i have to get back to the dendarii fleet said miles urgently ah where are they elli on their way from illyrica to rendezvous off escobar but you sir are going nowhere near them till impsec medical has cleared you for active duty she said firmly the fleet is fine youre not illyan would pin my ears back if i sent you anywhere but home right now and then theres your father what about my father miles asked elena had started to say somethingicy terror seized his chest a kaleidoscopic vision of assassinations mortal illnesses and political plots all rolled together spun through his mind not to mention aircar accidents he had a major coronary failure while i was there said mark they had him tied to a bed in impmil waiting for a heart transplant at the time i left actually they should be doing the surgery right about now you were there what did you do to him miles felt like hed just had his magnetic poles reversed i have to get home thats what i just said said mark wearily why dyou think we trooped all the way back here but to drag you home it wasnt for the free holiday at ry ryovals health spa let me tell you mother thinks im the next vorkosigan heir i can deal with barrayar i think but i sure as hell cant deal with that it was all too much too fast he sat down and tried to calm himself again before he triggered another convulsion that was just the sort of little physical weakness that could win one an immediate medical discharge from the imperial service if one wasnt careful about who witnessed it he had assumed the convulsions were a temporary snag in his recovery what if they were a permanent effect oh god i am going to lend lilly my ship said mark since baron fell sothoughtfully has stripped her of sufficient funds to buy thirtysix passages to escobar what ship asked miles not one of mine the one mother gave me lilly ought to be able to sell it at escobar orbit for a tidy profit i can pay back mother and get vorkosigan surleau out of hock and still have an impressive amount of pocketchange id like to have my own yacht someday but i really couldnt use this one for a while what what what i was just thinking mark went on that the dendarii here could ride along with lilly provide her with a little military protection in exchange for a free and fast ride back to the fleet save impsec the price of four commercial passages too four miles glanced at bel so very silent throughout who met his eyes bleakly and get everybody the hell out of here as fast as possible added mark before something else goes wrong amen muttered quinn rowan and elli on the same ship not to mention taura what if they all got together and compared notes what if they fell into a feud worse what if they struck up an alliance and colluded to partition him by treaty north miles and south miles it wasnt he swore that he picked up so many women compared to ivan he was practically celibate it was just that he never put any down the accumulation could become downright embarrassing over a long enough timespan he needed lady vorkosigan to put an end to this nonsense but even elli the bold refused to volunteer for that duty yes said miles that works home captain quinn arrange marks and my transport with impsec sergeant taura would you please put yourself at lilly duronas disposal the sooner we evacuate from here the better i agree and um bel would you stay and talk with me please quinn and taura took the hint and made themselves scarce mark mark was in on this miles decided and anyway he was a little afraid to ask mark to get up afraid of what his movements would reveal that flip phrase about ry ryovals health spa was entirely too obvious an attempt to conceal what sit bel miles nodded to baron fells vacated chair it put them in an equilateral triangle he and mark and bel bel nodded and settled its helmet in its lap and its hood pushed back miles thought of how hed perceived bel as a female in this room five days ago prior to his memory cascade his eye had always conveniently interpreted bel as male before for some reason strange there was a brief uneasy silence miles swallowed and broke it i cant let you go back to command of the ariel he said i know said bel it would be bad for fleet discipline i know said bel its not just if you had been a dishonest herm and kept your mouth shut and kept on pretending to have been fooled by mark no one would ever have known i know said bel it added after a moment i had to get my command back in the emergency i didnt think i could let mark go on giving orders too dangerous to those whod followed you yes and i would have known added bel captain thorne admiral naismith sighed i must request your resignation you have it sir thank you and that was done so fast he thought back over the scattered pictures in his head of marks raid there were still pieces missing he was pretty sure but there had been deaths too many deaths had made it irredeemable do you know what happened to phillipi shed had a chance i thought mark and bel exchanged a look bel answered she didnt make it oh im sorry to hear that cryorevival is a chancy business sighed bel we all undertake the risks when we sign on mark frowned it doesnt seem fair bel loses its career and i get off free bel stared a moment at marks beaten bloated body huddled down in lillys big chair its brows rose slightly what do you plan to do bel asked miles carefully go home to beta colony youve talked about it i dont know said bel its not for lack of thinking ive been thinking for weeks im not sure id fit in at home anymore ive been thinking myself said miles a prudent thought it strikes me that certain parties on my side would be less paranoid about the idea of you running around the wormhole nexus with a head full of barrayaran classified secrets if you were still on illyans payroll an informantperhaps an agent i dont have elli quinns talents for scam bel said i was a shipmaster shipmasters get to some interesting places they are in position to pick up all kinds of information bel tilted its head i will seriously consider it i assume you dont want to cash out here on jacksons whole bel laughed outright no shit think about it then on the way back to escobar talk to quinn decide by the time you get there and let her know bel nodded rose and looked around lilly duronas quiet living room im not altogether sorry you know it said to mark one way or another weve pulled almost ninety people out of this stinking gravity well out of certain death or jacksonian slavery not a bad score for an aging betan you can bet ill remember them too when i remember this thank you whispered mark bel eyed miles do you remember the first time we ever saw each other it asked yes i stunned you you surely did it walked over to his chair and bent and took his chin in its hand hold still ive been wanting to do this for years it kissed him long and quite thoroughly miles thought about appearances thought about the ambiguity of it thought about sudden death thought the hell with it all and kissed bel back straightening again bel smiled voices floated from the lift tube some durona directing right upstairs maam elena botharijesek rose behind the chromium railing and swept the room with her gaze hello miles i have to talk with mark she said all in a breath her eyes were dark and worried can we go somewhere she asked mark d rather not get up mark said his voice was so tired it slurred quite miles bel please go away she said straightly puzzled miles rose to his feet he gave her a look of inquiry her return look said not now later he shrugged come on bel lets go see if we can lend anyone a hand he wanted to find rowan he watched them as he descended the lift tube with bel elena pulled a chair around and sat across it backwards her hands already opening in urgent remonstration mark was looking extremely saturnine miles turned bel over to dr poppy for liaison duty and sought rowans suite as hed hoped she was there packing another young durona sat and watched looking a little bewildered miles recognized her at once lilly junior you made it rowan rowans face lit with delight and she hurried to embrace him miles your name is miles naismith i thought so youve cascaded when well he cleared his throat actually it was back at bharaputras her smile went a little flat before i left and you didnt tell me security he offered warily you didnt trust me this is jacksons whole you said it yourself i was more worried about vasa luigi i can see that i suppose rowan sighed when did you each get in i made it yesterday morning lilly came in last night smooth i never dreamed you could get her out too the one escape was lockandkey to the other you got yourself out which enabled lilly to get herself out he flashed a smile at lilly junior who was watching them curiously i did nothing that seems to be the story of my life lately but i do believe youll all make it offplanet before vasa luigi and lotus figure it out well all have lifted before dusk listen she led him to her window the dendarii personnel shuttle with sergeant taura piloting and about eight duronas aboard was lifting heavily from the courtyard of the walled compound pointwomen going up to prepare the ship for the others to come escobar miles rowan said enthusiastically were all going to escobar oh lilly youre going to love it there will you stay in a group when you get there miles asked at first i think till it gets less strange for the others lilly will release us at her death baron fell anticipates that i think less competition for him in the long run i expect hell have the top people stripped from house ryoval and installed here by tomorrow morning miles walked around the room and noticed a familiar little remote box on the sofaarm ah it was you who had the other control to the thermal grenade i might have known so you were listening in i wasnt sure if mark was bluffing mark wasnt bluffing about anything she stated with certainty were you here when he came in yes it was a little before dawn this morning he came staggering in from a lightflyer wearing the most peculiar costume and demanding to speak with lilly miles raised his brows at the image what did the gate guards say they said yes sir he had an aura i dont know how to describe it except i could picture large thugs in dark alleyways scrambling to get out of his way your clonetwin is a formidable young man miles blinked lilly and chrys took him off to the clinic on a floatpallet and i didnt see him after that then the orders started flying she paused so will you be going back to your dendarii mercenaries then yes after some rr i guess not settling down after that close call i confess the sight of projectileweapons gives me a new and unpleasant twitch buti hope i wont be cashing out of the dendarii for a long time yet um these convulsions ive been having will they go away they should cryorevival is always chancy so you dont picture yourself retiring to escobar say we visit escobar now and then for fleet repairs and personnel repairs its a major nexus intersection we may cross paths again not the same way we first met i trust rowan smiled let me tell you if i ever do need cryorevival again ill leave orders to look you up he hesitated i need my lady vorkosigan to put an end to this wandering could rowan be it the thirtyfive sistersinlaw would be a distant drawback safely far away on escobar what would you think of the planet barrayar as a place to live and work he inquired cautiously her nose wrinkled that backward pit why i have some interests there in fact its where im planning to retire its a very beautiful place really and underpopulated they encourage um children he was skirting dangerously close to breaking his cover the strained identity hed risked so much lately to retain and thered be lots of work for a galactictrained physician ill bet but ive been a slave all my life vhy would i choose to be a subject when i could choose to be a citizen she smiled wryly and came to him and twined her arms around his shoulders those five days we were locked up together at vasa luigisthat wasnt an effect of the imprisonment was it thats the way you really are when youre well pretty much he admitted id always wondered what adult hyperactives did for a living running several thousand troops would just about absorb your energies wouldnt it yes he sighed i think ill always love you some but living with you fulltime would drive me crazy you are the most incredibly domineering person i think ive ever met youre supposed to fight back he explained i rely on he couldnt say elli or worse all my women my partner fighting back otherwise i couldnt relax and be myself right too much togetherness had destroyed their love or at least her illusions the barrayaran system of using gobetweens to make marital arrangements was beginning to look better all the time maybe it would be best to get safely married first and then get to know each other by the time his bride figured him out it would be too late for her to back out he sighed and smiled and gave rowan an exaggerated courtly bow i shall be pleased to visit you on escobar milady that would be joust perfect sir she returned deadpan ow dammit she could be the one she underestimated herself lilly junior sitting on the sofa watching all this with fascination coughed miles glanced at her and thought about her account of her time with the dendarii does mark know youre here lilly he asked i dont know ive been with rowan the last time mark saw you you were going back with vasa luigi i think hed like to know you changed your mind he tried to talk me into staying on the ship he didnt talk so well as you she admitted he made this all happen he bought your passage out of here and miles wasnt sure he wanted to think about the coin i just trailed along come on at least say hello goodbye and thank you it will cost you nothing and i suspect it would mean something to him reluctantly she rose and allowed him to tow her out rowan gave them a nod of approval and returned to her hasty packing chapter thirtyone did you find them lord mark asked yes said botharijesek tightly did you destroy them yes mark flushed and leaned his head back against lillys chair feeling the weight of gravity he sighed you looked at them i told you not to i had to to be sure i was getting the right ones no you didnt you could simply have destroyed them all thats what i finally did i started to look then i turned off the sound then i put them on fastforward then i started just spotchecking i wish you hadnt i wish i hadnt mark there were hundreds of hours of those holovids i couldnt believe there was so much actually there were only about fifty hours or maybe it was fifty years but there were multiple simultaneous recordings i could always see a holovid pickup hovering out of the corner of my eye no matter what was going on i dont know if ryoval made them to study and analyze or just to enjoy a bit of both i guess his powers of analysis were appalling i dont understand some of what i saw would you like me to explain it to you no good i can understand why youd want them destroyed out of context they would have been a horrible lever for blackmail if you want to swear me to secrecy ill vow anything thats not why i have no intention of keeping any of this a secret nobody is ever going to get a handle on me again pull my secret strings ever again in general outline you can tell the whole wormhole nexus for all i care butif impsec got hold of those holovid recordings they would end up in illyans hands and he would not be able to keep them from the count or the countess either though im sure hed try or eventually miles can you imagine the count or the countess or miles watching that shit she drew in her breath between her teeth i begin to see think about it i have lieutenant iverson was furious when he broke in and found the melted casings hes going to send complaints up through channels let him if impsec cares to air any complaints about me or mine i will air my complaints about them like where the hell were they for the last five days i will have no compunction nor mercy about calling in that debt on anyone from illyan down cross me will they he trailed off in a hostile mutter her face was greenishwhite im so sorry mark her hand touched his hesitantly he seized her wrist held it hard her nostrils flared but she did not wince he sat up or tried to dont you dare pity me i won save your sympathy for baron ryoval if you must i took him suckered him i beat him at his own game on his own ground i will not allow you to turn my victory into defeat for the sake of your damned feelings he released her wrist she rubbed it watching him levelly thats the thing of it i can shed ryoval if theyll let me but if they know too muchif they had those damned vidstheyd never be able to leave it alone ever their guilt would keep them coming back to it and they would keep me coming back to it i dont want to have to fight ry ryoval in my head or in their heads for the rest of my life hes dead im not its enough he paused snorted and you have to admit it would be particularly bad for miles oh yes botharijesek breathed agreement outside the dendarii personnel shuttle with sergeant taura piloting lifted the first load of duronas to marks yacht in orbit he paused to watch it rise from sight yes go go go get out of this hole you me all of us clones forever go be human too if you can if i can botharijesek looked back at him and said theyll insist on a physical exam you know yeah theyll see some i cant conceal the beatings and god knows i cant conceal the forcefeedingsgrotesque werent they she swallowed and nodded i thought you were going tooh never mind right i told you not to look but the longer i can avoid examination by a competent impsec doctor the vaguer i can be about all the rest you have to be treated surely lilly durona has done an excellent job and by my request the only record is in her head i should be able to slide right by dont try to avoid it altogether botharijesek advised the countess would spot that even if no one else did and i cant believe you dont need something more not physically oh elena if theres one thing ive learned in the past week its just how badly crosswired i really am down in the bottom of my brain the worst thing i met in ryovals basement was the monster in the mirror ryovals psychic mirror my pet monster the fourheaded one demonstrably worse even than ryoval himself stronger quicker slyer he bit his tongue aware that he was starting to say far too much aware that he sounded like he was edging into dementia he didnt think he was edging into dementia he suspected he was edging into sanity the long way around the hard way i know what im doing on some level i know exactly what im doing in a couple of the vidsyou seemed to be fooling ryoval with a fake split personality talking to yourself i could never have fooled ryoval with a fake anything he was in this trade for decades mucking about in the bottoms of peoples brains but my personality didnt exactly split more like it inverted nothing could be called split that felt so profoundly whole it wasnt something i decided to do it was just something i did she was looking at him with extreme worry he had to laugh out loud but the effect of his good cheer was apparently not so reassuring to her as he might have desired you have to understand he told her sometimes insanity is not a tragedy sometimes its a strategy for survival sometimes its a triumph he hesitated do you know what a blackgang is mutely she shook her head something i picked up in a museum in london once way back in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries on earth they used to have ships that sailed across the tops of the oceans that were powered by steam engines the heat for the steam engines came from great coal fires in the bellies of the ships and they had to have these suckers down there to stoke the coal into the furnaces down in the filth and the heat and the sweat and the stink the coal made them black so they were called the blackgang and the officers and fine ladies up above would have nothing to do with these poor grotty thugs socially but without them nothing moved nothing burned nothing lived no steam the blackgang unsung heroes ugly lowerclass fellows now she thought he was babbling for sure the panegyric of fierce loyalty for his black gang that he wanted to sing into her ear was probably not a good idea just now yeah and nobody loves me gorge whispered plaintively youd better get used to it never mind he smiled instead but i can tell you galen looks pretty small after ryoval and ryoval i beat in a strange sense i feel very free right now and i intend to stay that way you appear to me to be excuse me a little manic right now mark in miles this would be normal well usual but eventually he tops out and finally he bottoms out i think you need to watch out for this pattern you may share it with him are you saying its a mood swing on a bungee cord a short laugh puffed from her lips despite herself yes ill beware of the perigee hm yes though its the apogee where everybody else has to duck and run usually im also on well several painkillers and stimulants right now he mentioned or i would never have made it through the last couple of hours im afraid some of them are starting to wear off good that would account to her for some of his babble perhaps and had the advantage of being true do you want me to get lilly durona no i just want to sit here and not move i think that might be a good idea elena swung out of her chair and picked up her helmet i know what i want to be when i grow up now though he offered to her suddenly she paused and raised her brows i want to be an impsec analyst civilian one who doesnt send his people to the wrong place or five days late or improperly prepared i want to sit in a cubicle all day long surrounded by a fortress and get it right he waited for her to laugh at him instead to his surprise she nodded seriously speaking as the one out on the sharp end of the impsec stick i would be delighted she gave him a halfsalute and turned away he puzzled over the look in her eyes as she descended out of sight down the lifttube it wasnt love it wasnt fear oh so thats what respect looks like oh i could get used to that as mark had declared to elena he just sat for a time staring out the window he was going to have to move sooner or later maybe he could use the excuse of his broken foot to inveigle a floatchair lilly had promised him that her stimulants would buy him six hours of coherence after which the metabolic bill would be delivered by hulking biothugs with spiked clubs virtual repomen for his neurotransmitter debt he wondered if the absurd dreamy image was the first sign of the approaching biochemical breakdown he prayed hed hold out at least till he was safely in the impsec shuttle oh brother carry me home voices echoed up the lift tube miles appeared with a durona trailing along after him he was skeletally thin and ghostly pale in his duronaissued grey suit the two of them seemed to be on some kind of growthreciprocal if he could magically transfer all the kilos ryoval had foisted on him the last week directly to miles they would both look much better mark decided but if he kept growing fatter would miles attenuate altogether and vanish unsettling vision its the drugs boy its the drugs oh good said miles elena said you were still up here with the cheerful air of a magician presenting a particularly good trick he urged the young woman to step forward do you recognize her its a durona miles said mark in a gentle weary tone im going to see them in my dreams he paused is this a trick question then he sat up shocked by recognition you could tell clones apartits her just so smiled miles pleased we smuggled her out from bharaputras rowan and i shes going to go to escobar with her sisters ah mark settled back ah oh good hesitantly he rubbed his forehead take back your coup vasa luigi i didnt think you were interested in rescuing clones miles miles winced visibly you inspired me er he hadnt meant that as a reference to ryovals clearly miles had dragged the reluctant girl up here in a bid to make mark feel better less clearly to miles though like crystal to himself was an element of subtle rivalry for the first time in his life miles was feeling the hot breath of fraternal competition on the back of his neck do i make you uneasy ha get used to it boy ive lived with it for twentytwo years miles had spoken of mark as my brother in the same tone hed use for my boots or maybe my horse orgive credit nowmy child a certain smug paternalism miles hadnt been expecting an equal with an agenda of his own suddenly mark realized he had a delightful new hobby one that would provide entertainment for years to come god im going to enjoy being your brother yes mark said cheerily you can do it too i knew you could if you only tried he laughed to his dismay it turned into a sob in his throat he choked off both he didnt dare laugh or express any other emotion right now his control was much too thin im very glad he stated as neutrally as he could miles whose eye had caught the whole play nodded good he stated equally neutrally bless you brother miles understood this at least what it was like to teeter on the raw edge they both glanced at the durona girl she moved uneasily under the weight of this double expectation she flipped back her hair mustered words when i first saw you she said to mark i didnt like you much when you first saw me i didnt like me much either yes he encouraged i still think youre funnylooking even funnierlooking than the other one she nodded at miles who smiled blandly but but words failed her as cautiously and hesitantly as a wild bird at a feeder she ventured nearer to him bent and kissed him on one puffy cheek then like a bird she fled hm said miles watching her swoop back down the lifttube i was hoping for a little more enthusiastic a demonstration of gratitude youll learn said mark equably he touched his cheek and smiled if you think thats ingratitude try impsec miles advised glumly you lost how much equipment mark cocked an eyebrow an illyanquote oh youve met him oh yes i wish i could have been there i wish you could have been there too said mark sincerely he was acerb ill bet he does acerb almost better than anyone i know except for my mother when shes lost her temper which thank god is not very often you should have seen her annihilate him then said mark clash of the titans i think youd have enjoyed it i did oh we have a lot to talk about it seems for the first time mark realized they did his heart lifted unfortunately so did another interruption via the tube a man in house fell livery looked over the chromium railing saw him and gave him a semisalute i have a courier delivery for an individual named mark he said im mark the courier trod over to him flashed a confirming scanner over his face opened a thin case chained to his wrist and handed him a card in an unmarked envelope baron fells compliments sir and he trusts this will help speed you on your way the credit chit ah ha and a very broad hint along with it my compliments to baron fell and and what do we want to say to baron fell miles id keep it down to thank you i think miles advised at least till were far far away tell him thank you mark told the courier who nodded and marched out again the way he had come in mark eyed lillys comconsole in the corner of the room it seemed a very long way off he pointed could you um bring me the remotereader off that comconsole over there miles sure miles retrieved and handed him the board i predict said mark waving the card around that i will be seriously shortchanged but not quite enough so that i would risk going back to fell and arguing about it he inserted the card into the readslot and smiled spoton what did you get asked miles craning his neck well thats a very personal question said mark miles uncraned guiltily trade were you sleeping with that surgeon miles bit his lip curiosity obviously struggling with his gentlemanly manners mark watched with interest to see how it would come out personally hed bet on curiosity miles took a rather deep breath yes he said at last thought so their good fortune mark decided was divided exactly fiftyfifty miles got the good luck and he got the rest but not this time two million miles whistled two million imperial marks impressive no no two million betan dollars what about eight million marks i guess isnt it or is it closer to ten depends on the current exchange rate i guess its not nearly ten percent of the value of house ryoval anyway more like two percent mark calculated aloud and had the rare and utter joy of rendering miles vorkosigan speechless what are you going to do with it all miles whispered after about a minute invest said mark fiercely barrayar has an expanding economy doesnt it he paused first though im going to kick back one million to impsec for their services the last four months nobody gives money to impsec why not look at your mercenary operations for instance isnt being a mercenary supposed to be profitable the dendarii fleet could be a veritable cash cow for impsec if it were run right they take out their profit in political consequences said miles firmly thoughif you really do it i want to be there to see the look on illyans face if youre good ill let you come along oh im really going to do it all right there are some debts i cannot ever repay he thought of phillipi and the others but i intend to pay the ones i can in their honor though you can bet ill keep the rest i should be able to double it again in about six years and be back to where i started or better its a lot easier to make two million out of one million than it is to make two out of one if i understand the game correctly ill study up miles stared at him in fascination i bet you will do you have any idea how desperate i was when i started on that raid how scared i intend to have a value no one can ignore again even if its only measured in money money is a kind of power almost anyone can have you dont even need a vor in front of your name he smiled faintly maybe after a while ill get a place of my own like ivans after all it would look funny if i was still living in my parents house at the age of say twentyeight and that was probably enough milesbaiting for one day miles would demonstrably lay down his life for his brother but he did have a notable tendency to try to subsume the people around him into extensions of his own personality i am not your annex i am your brother yes mark rather fancied they were both going to be able to keep track of that now he slumped wearily but happily i do believe said miles still looking nicely stunned you are the first vorkosigan to make a profit in a business venture for five generations welcome to the family mark nodded they were both silent for a time its not the answer mark sighed finally he nodded around at the durona groups clinic and by implication to all of jacksons whole this piecemeal clonerescue business even if i blew vasa luigi entirely away someone else would just take up where house bharaputra left off yes miles agreed the true answer has to be medicaltechnical somebody has to come up with a better safer lifeextension trick which i believe somebody will a lot of people have to be working on it in a lot of places the braintransplant technique is too risky to compete it must end someday soon i dont have any talents in the medicaltechnical direction said mark in the meantime the butchery goes on i have to take another pass at the problem before someday somehow but not today miles said firmly no out the window he saw a personnel shuttle descending into the duronas compound but it wasnt the dendarii one returning yet he nodded is that by chance our transport i believe so said miles going to the window and looking down yes and then there was no more time while miles was gone checking on the shuttle and couldnt watch mark rounded up half a dozen duronas to help pry his stiff bent halfparalyzed body out of lillys chair and lay him on a floatpallet his crooked hands shook uncontrollably till lilly pursed her lips and gave him another hypospray of something wonderful he was perfectly content to be carried out horizontally his broken foot was a socially acceptable reason not to be able to walk he looked nicely invalidish with his leg propped up conspicuously the better to persuade the impsec fellows to carry him to his bunk when they arrived topside for the first time in his life he was going home chapter thirtytwo miles eyed the old mirror in the antechamber to the library of vorkosigan house the one that had been brought into the family by general count piotrs mother as part of her dowry its frame ornately carved by some vorrutyer family retainer he was alone in the room with no one to observe him he slipped up to the glass and stared uneasily at his own reflection the scarlet tunic of the imperial parade redandblues did not exactly flatter his toopale complexion at the best of times he preferred the more austere elegance of dress greens the goldencrusted high collar was not unfortunately quite high enough to hide the twin red scars on either side of his neck the cuts would turn white and recede eventually but in the meantime they drew the eye he considered how he was going to explain them dueling scars i lost or maybe love bites that was closer he traced them with a fingertip turning his head from side to side unlike the terrible memory of the needlegrenade he did not remember acquiring these that was far more disturbing than the vision of his death that such important things could happen to him and he didnt couldnt remember well he was known to have medical problems and the scars were almost neat enough to look medical maybe people would let them pass without comment he stepped back from the mirror to take in the general look his uniform still had a tendency to hang on him despite his mothers valiant attempts to make him eat more these last few weeks since theyd arrived home shed finally turned the problem over to mark as if yielding to superior expertise mark had grinned with amusement and then he had preceded to harass miles without mercy actually the attentions were working miles did feel better stronger the winterfair ball was sufficiently social without formal governmental or military obligation that he was able to leave the dual dress sword set at home ivan would be wearing his but ivan had the altitude to carry it off at miless height the long sword of the pair looked damned silly practically dragging on the ground not to mention the problem of tripping over it or banging his dance partner in the shins footsteps sounded in the archway miles turned quickly and swung one booted leg up and leaned against a chairarm pretending to have been ignoring the narcissistic attractions of his reflection ah there you are mark wandered in to join him pausing to study himself briefly in the mirror turning to check the fit of his clothing his clothing fit very well indeed mark had acquired the name of gregors tailor a closelyguarded impsec secret by the simple expedient of calling gregor and asking him the boxy loose cut of the jacket and trousers was aggressively civilian but somehow very sharp the colors honored winterfair sort of a green so dark as to be almost black was trimmed with a red so dark as to be almost black the effect was somewhere between festive and sinister like a small cheerful bomb miles thought of that very odd moment in rowans lightflyer when hed been temporarily convinced he was mark how terrifying it had been to be mark how utterly isolated the memory of that desolation made him shiver is that how he feels all the time well no more not if i have anything to say about it looks good miles offered yeah mark grinned youre not so bad yourself not as cadaverous quite youre improving too slowly actually mark was miles thought the most alarming distortions of whatever horrors ryoval had inflicted upon mark and which he resolutely refused to talk about had gradually passed off a solid residue of flesh yet lingered however what weight are you finally going to choose miles asked curiously youre looking at it or i wouldnt have invested the fortune in the wardrobe er are you comfortable miles inquired uncomfortably marks eyes glinted yes thank you the thought that a oneeyed sniper at a range of two kilometers at midnight in a thunderstorm could not possibly mistake me for you is very comfortable indeed oh well yes there is that i suppose keep exercising mark advised him cordially its good for you mark sat down and put his feet up mark the countesss voice called from the foyer miles in here said miles ah she said sweeping into the antechamber there you both are she smiled at them with a greedy maternal gloat looking most satisfied miles could not help feeling warmed as if some last lingering ice chip inside from the cryofreezing finally thawed steaming gently the countess wore a new dress more ornate than her usual style in green and silver with ruffs and tucks and a train a celebration of fabric it did not make her stiff thoughit wouldnt dare the countess was never intimidated by her clothing quite the reverse her eyes outshone the silver embroidery father waiting on us miles inquired hell be down momentarily im insisting we leave promptly at midnight you two can stay longer if you wish of course hell overdo i predict proving to the hyenas hes too tough for them to jump even when the hyenas arent circling any more a lifetime of reflex try and focus his attention on the district miles it will drive poor prime minister racozy to distraction to feel aral is looking over his shoulder we really need to get out of the capital down to hassadar after winterfair miles who had a very clear idea just how much recovery chest surgery took said i think youll be able to persuade him please throw your vote in i know he cant fool you and he knows it too ahjust what can i expect tonight medically speaking hell dance twice once to prove he can do it and the second time to prove the first wasnt a fluke after that youll have no trouble at all persuading him to sit down miles predicted with confidence go ahead and play mother hen and he can pretend hes stopping to please you and not because hes about to fall over hassadar strikes me as a very good plan yes barrayar does not quite know what to do with retired strong men traditionally they are decently deceased and not hanging around to pass comments on their successors aral may be something of a first though gregor has had the most horrifying idea oh hes muttering about the viceroyalty of sergyar as a post for aral when he is fully recovered the present viceroy has been begging to come home it seems whining actually a more thankless task than colonial governor i cannot imagine an honest man gets ground to powder trying to play interface between two sets of conflicting needs the home government above and the colonists below anything you can do to disabuse gregor of this notion i would greatly appreciate oh i dont know miless brows rose thoughtfully i meanwhat a retirement project a whole planet to play with sergyar and didnt you discover it yourself back when you were a betan astronomical survey captain indeed if the barrayaran military expedition hadnt been ahead of us sergyar would be a betan daughtercolony right now and much better managed believe me it really needs someone to take it in hand the ecological issues alone are crying for an injection of intelligencei mean take that worm plague a little betanstyle prudence could have well they figured it out eventually i guess miles and mark looked at each other it wasnt telepathy but the thought that perhaps aral vorkosigan wasnt the only overenergetic aging expert gregor might be glad to export from his capital was surely being shared between them right this second marks brows drew down how soon might this be maam oh not for at least a year ah mark brightened armsman pym stuck his head around the archway ready milady he reported they all herded into the blackandwhite paved hall to find the count standing at the foot of the curved stairs he watched them with delight as they trooped into his view the count had lost weight in his medical ordeal too but it only made him look more fit in his redandblues he managed uniform and swordset with unconscious ease in three hours hed be drooping miles gauged but by then hed have made a lasting first impression on his many observers on this his first formal outing with his new heart his color was excellent his gaze as knifesharp as ever but there was no dark at all in his hair anymore aside from that you really might think he could live forever except miles didnt think that anymore it had scared the hell out of him retroactively this whole cardiac episode not that his father must die someday perhaps before himthat was the proper order of things and miles could not wish it upon the count for it to be the other way aroundbut that miles might not be here when it happened when he was needed might be off indulging himself with the dendarii mercenaries say and not get the word for weeks too late being both in uniform the lieutenant saluted his father the admiral now with the usual tinge of irony with which they commonly exchanged such military courtesies miles would rather have embraced him but it would look odd to hell with what it looked like he walked over and hugged his father hey boy hey said the count surprised and pleased its not that bad really he embraced miles in return the count stood back and looked them all over his elegant wife histwo nowsons smiling as smugly as any rich man could he opened his arms as if to embrace them all briefly and almost shyly are the vorkosigans ready to storm the winterfair ball then dear captain i predict they will surrender to you in droves hows your foot mark mark stuck out his right shoe and wriggled it fit to be trod upon by any vor maiden up a hundred kilos sir steel toe caps underneath he added to miles aside im taking no chances the countess attached herself to her husbands arm lead on love vorkosigans victorious vorkosigans convalescent was more like it miles reflected following but you should see what the other guys look like not to miless surprise practically the first person the vorkosigans party met upon entering the imperial residence was simon illyan illyan was dressed as usual for these functions parade redandblues concealing a multitude of comm links ah hes here in person tonight the count murmured spotting his old security chief across the vestibule there must be no major messes going on elsewhere then good they divested their snowspangled wraps to gregors household staff miles was shivering he decided his timing had been skewed by this last adventure usually he managed to arrange an offplanet assignment during winter in the capital illyan nodded and came over to them good evening simon said the count good evening sir all calm and quiet so far tonight thats nice the count raised a dryly amused eyebrow at him im sure prime minister racozy will be delighted to hear it illyan opened his mouth and closed it er habit he said in embarrassment he stared at count vorkosigan with a look almost of frustration as if the only way he knew how to relate to his commander of thirty years was by making reports but admiral count vorkosigan was no longer receiving them this feels very strange he admitted youll get used to it simon countess vorkosigan assured him and towed her husband determinedly out of illyans orbit the count gave him a parting halfsalute seconding the countesss words illyans eye fell on miles and mark instead hm he said in the tone of a man who had just come out secondbest in some horsetrade miles stood up straighter the impsec medicos had cleared him to return to duty in two months pending a final physical exam he had not bothered mentioning the little problem with the convulsions to them perhaps the first one had just been an idiosyncratic effect of the fastpenta sure and the second and third ones drug flashbacks but he hadnt had any more after that miles smiled diffidently trying to look very healthy illyan just shook his head looking at him good evening sir mark said to illyan in turn was impsec able to deliver my winterfair gift to my clones all eight illyan nodded five hundred marks each individually addressed and on time yes my lord good mark gave one of his sharperedged smiles the sort that made one wonder what he was thinking the clones had been the pretext mark had given illyan for handing over to impsec the million betan dollars hed sworn he would the funds were now in escrow for their needs among other things paying for their place in that exclusive school illyan had been so boggled hed gone absolutely robotic an effect miles had watched with great fascination by the time the clones were out on their own the million would be about used up mark had figured but the winterfair gifts had been personal and separate mark did not ask how his gift had been received though miles was dying to know but rather drifted on with another polite nod as if illyan were a clerk with whom he had just concluded some minor business miles saluted and caught up mark was suppressing a deep grin resulting in a smirklike look all this time mark confided to miles in a low voice i was worried about never having received a present it never even crossed my mind to worry about never having given one winterfair is an entrancing holiday yknow he sighed i wish id known those clonekids well enough to pick something right for each but at least this way they have a gift of choice its like giving them two presents in one how the devil do you folks give anything to say gregor though we fall back on tradition two hundred liters of dendarii mountain maple syrup delivered annually to his household takes care of it if you think gregors bad think about our father though its like trying to give a winterfair gift to father frost himself yes ive been puzzling over that one sometimes you cant give back you just have to give on did you ah sign those credit chits to the clones sort of actually i signed them father frost mark cleared his throat thats the purpose of winterfair i think to teach you how to give on being father frost is the endgame isnt it i think so im getting it figured out mark nodded in determination they walked on together into the upstairs reception hall and snagged drinks they were collecting a lot of attention miles noted with amusement covert stares from the flower of the vor assembled there oh barrayar do we have a surprise for you he sure surprised me it was going to be huge fun having mark for a brother an ally at last i think miles wondered if he could ever draw mark on to love barrayar as he did the thought made him strangely nervous best not to love too much barrayar could be lethal to take for ones lady still a challenge enough challenges to go around no artificial shortages of those here miles would have to be careful about anything mark might interpret as an attempt to dominate him though marks violent allergy to the least hint of control was perfectly understandable miles thought but it made mentoring him a task of some delicacy better not do too good a job big brother youre expendable now yknow he ran a hand down the bright uniform cloth of his jacket coolly conscious of just what expendable meant yet being beaten by your student was the ultimate victory for a teacher an enchanting paradox i cant lose miles grinned yeah mark catch me if you can if you can ah mark nodded to a man in a winered vor house uniform across the room isnt that lord vorsmythe the industrialist yes id love to talk with him do you know him can you introduce me sure thinking of more investing are you yes ive decided to diversify twothirds barrayaran investments onethird galactic galactic im putting some into escobaran medical technology if you must know lilly yep she needs the setup capital im going to be a silent partner mark hesitated the solution has to be medical you know and do you want to bet she wont return a profit nope in fact id be very leery of laying any bet against you mark smiled his sharpest good youre learning too miles led mark over and performed the requested introduction vorsmythe was delighted to find someone who actually wanted to talk about his work here the bored look pasted on his face evaporating with marks first probing question miles turned mark loose with a wave vorsmythe was gesturing expansively mark was listening as though he had a recorder whirring in his head miles left them to it he spied delia koudelka across the chamber and made for her to claim a dance later and possibly cut out ivan if he was lucky she might offer him a chance to use that line about the dueling scars too chapter thirtythree after a most fascinating chat on the topic of barrayaran highgrowth economic sectors vorsmythe was reclaimed by his wife for some escort purpose and dragged out of the window embrasure he and mark had taken over he parted with mark reluctantly promising to send him some prospectuses mark looked around for miles again the count was not the only vorkosigan in danger of overdoing it tonight while trying to prove his health to assorted observers mark had realized mark had by default become miless confidant for selftests he didnt want to share with his impsec superiors checking knowledge bases going over old material ranging from service regs to fivespace math mark had made a joke about it exactly once before he realized the depth of terror that was driving miless obsessive probing particularly when they actually found some hole or another in miless memory it bothered mark deeply this new hesitation this desperate diffidence in his big brother he hoped miless obnoxious selfconfidence would return soon it was another strange reciprocity that miles should have things he wanted to remember and couldnt while mark had things he wanted to forget and couldnt he would have to encourage miles to show him around some more miles enjoyed playing the expert it put him automatically in the oneup position to which he was addicted yeah let miles expand his highlyinflatable ego a bit mark could afford it now hed give miles a run for it some other time when miles was up to speed again when it was more sporting finally by hopping up on a chair and craning his neck mark spotted his brother just leaving the reception chamber in the company of a blonde woman in blue velvetdelia koudelka kareens tallest sister theyre here oh god he abandoned the chair and went on a fast search for the countess he finally ran her to ground in a third floor lounge chatting with some older women obviously cronies she took one look at his anxious smile and excused herself to join him in a nook in the carpeted corridor have you run into a problem mark she asked arranging her skirts on the little settee he perched gingerly on the opposite end i dont know the koudelkas are here i promised back at the emperors birthday to dance with kareen if i made it home in time and id asked her to talk with you about me did she yes what did you tell her well it was a long conversation oh shit but the gist of it was that i judged you an intelligent young man who had had some very unpleasant experiences but if you could be persuaded to use that intelligence to get your problems straightened out i could support your suit betan therapy something like that ive been thinking about betan therapy a lot but i dread the thought of my therapists notes all ending up in some impsec analysts report i dont want to be a damned show again i think i could do something about that could you he looked up shaken with hope even though you wouldnt get to see the reports either yes i would appreciate that maam consider it a promise my word as a vorkosigan an adopted vorkosigan even more so than he but he did not doubt her word mother with you all things seem possible i dont know what details you told kareen very few shes only eighteen after all barely assimilating her own new adulthood more hm advanced matters could wait i judged she has to get through school first before undertaking any longterm commitment she added pointedly oh um he wasnt sure if he was relieved or not its all out of date anyway ive acquired a whole new set of problems since much worse ones i dont sense that mark to me you have appeared much more centered and relaxed since you and miles got back from jacksons whole even though you wont talk about it i dont regret knowing myself maam i dont even regret being myself me and the black gang but i do regret being so far from kareen i believe i am a monster of some sort and in the play caliban does not marry prosperos daughter in fact he gets stomped for trying as i recall yes how could he possibly explain gorge and grunt and howl and killer to someone like kareen without frightening or disgusting her how could he ask her to feed his abnormal appetites even in some dream or fantasy play it was hopeless better not to try the countess smiled wryly there are several things wrong with your analogy mark in the first place i can guarantee you are not subhuman whatever you think you are and kareen is not superhuman either though if you insist on treating her as a prize and not as a person i can also guarantee you will run yourself into another kind of trouble her raised brows punctuated the point i added as condition to my blessing on your suit the suggestion that she take the opportunity during her schooling on beta colony next year for some extra tutoring a little betan education in certain personal matters could go a long way i think to widening her perceptions enough to admit um complexities without choking a certain liberality of view an eighteenyearold simply cannot acquire on barrayar oh that was an idea which had never even crossed his mind tackling the problem from kareens end it made so much sense id thought about school on beta colony for myself next year some galactic education would look good on my record when i apply here for the job i have in mind i dont want to leave it all to pure nepotism the countess tilted her head in bemusement good it seems to me as though you have a sound set of longrange plans wellcoordinated to advance all your goals you have only to carry them through i entirely approve longrange but tonight is right now and what were you planning to do tonight mark dance with kareen i dont see the problem with that youre allowed to dance whatever you are this is not the play mark and old prospero has many daughters one may even have a low taste for fishy fellows how low oh the countess held out her hand at a level about equal to marks standing height at least that low go dance with the girl mark she thinks youre interesting mother nature gives a sense of romance to young people in place of prudence to advance the species its a trickthat makes us grow walking across the residence ballroom to greet kareen koudelka felt like the most terrifying thing mark had ever voluntarily done not excepting the first dendarii combat drop onto jacksons whole there the resemblance ended for after that things improved lord mark she said happily they told me you were here you asked ive come to redeem my word and my dance milady he managed a vorish bow good its about time ive saved out all the mirror dances and the called reels all the simple dances he could be expected to do i had miles teach me the steps to mazeppas minuet last week he added hopefully perfect oh the musics starting she hauled him onto the inlaid floor she wore a swirling dark green dress with red trim that set off her ashblonde curls in a sort of positive paranoia he wondered if her outfit could possibly have been deliberately colorcoordinated with his own clothes surely it must be a coincidence how my tailor to my mother to her mother to her hell any impsec analyst ought to be able to figure out that data trail grunt alas had a distracting and distressing tendency to mentally undress her and worse but grunt was not going to be permitted to speak tonight this one is lord marks job and he isnt going to screw it up this time grunt could just lurk down in there and build up steam lord mark would find a use for the power starting with keeping the beat there was even a dancemazeppas minuet as it happenedwhere the two partners touched each other holding the hand or the waist for almost the entire pattern all true wealth is biological the count had said mark finally saw exactly what he meant for all his million betan dollars he could not buy this the light in kareens eyes though it couldnt hurt what was that damned earth bird or other that built wildly elaborate nests to attract a mate they were in the middle of a mirror dance so kareenyoure a girl i uh had this argument with ivan what do you think is the most attractive thing a fellow can have a lightflyer wealth rank he hoped his tone suggested he was running some sort of scientific survey nothing personal maam she pursed her lips wit she said at last yeah and what store are you going to buy that in with all your betan dollars boy mirror dance my turn said kareen whats the most important thing a woman can have trust he answered without thinking and then thought about it to the point of almost losing his step he was going to need a mountain of trust no lie so start building it tonight lord mark old boy hauling one bloody basket load at a time if you have to he managed to make her laugh out loud four times after that he kept count he ate too much even gorge was sneakily sated drank too much talked too much and danced far too much and generally had a hell of a good time the dancing was a little unexpected kareen reluctantly lent him to a string of several curious girlfriends he was interesting to them only as a novelty he judged but he wasnt inclined to be picky by two hours after midnight he was stimulated to the point of babbling and starting to limp better to call it quits before howl had to come out and take charge of his burntout remains besides miles had been sitting quietly in a corner for the last hour looking uncharacteristically wilted a word passed to an imperial household servant brought the counts groundcar back for them driven by the ubiquitous pym who had taken the count and countess home earlier miles and mark took over the rear compartment both sagging into their seats pym pulled out past the residences guarded gates and into the winter streets grown as nightquiet as the capitals streets ever did only a few other vehicles prowling past miles turned the heat up high and settled back with his eyes halfclosed mark and his brother were alone in the compartment mark counted the number of people present one two three four five six seven lord miles vorkosigan and admiral naismith lord mark vorkosigan and gorge grunt howl and killer admiral naismith was a much classier creation mark thought with a silent sigh of envy miles could take the admiral out to parties introduce him to women parade him in public almost anywhere but barrayar itself i suppose what my black gang lacks in savoir fairs we make up in numbers but they all ran together he and the black gang on the deepest level no part could be excised without butchering the whole so ill just have to look after you all somehow you just live down there in the dark because someday in some desperate hour i may need you again you took care of me ill take care of you mark wondered what admiral naismith took care of for miles something subtle but importantthe countess even saw it what was it she had said i wont seriously fear for miless sanity till hes cut off from the little admiral hence the desperate edge in miless drive to reclaim his health his job with impsec was his lifeline to admiral naismith i think i understand that oh yes did i ever apologize for getting you killed mark asked aloud not that i recall it wasnt altogether your fault i had no business mounting that drop mission should have taken vasa luigi up on his ransom offer except except what he wouldnt sell you to me i suspect he was already planning to get a higher bid from ryoval even then that would be my guess ah thank you im not sure it made a difference in the end miles said apologetically since ryoval just tried again oh yes it made a huge difference in the end all the difference in the world mark smiled slightly in the dark vorbarr sultanas wildly assorted architecture passed by outside the canopy snowsoftened to a kind of unity what do we do tomorrow mark asked sleep in murmured miles oozing down a little further in his stiff uniform collar rather like paste being sucked back into a tube after that the party season ends here in three days with the winterfair bonfires if myour parents really go down to the district i suppose ill divide my time between hassadar and here till impsec lets me come back to work hassadar is slightly warmer than vorbarr sultana this time of year ahyoure invited to come along with me if you like thank you i accept what do you plan to do after your medical leave is over i think ill sign up for one of your schools which one if the count and countess are going to be mainly residing in hassadar maybe the district college there hm i should warn you youll find a more um rural crowd there than you would in vorbarr sultana youll run into more barrayaran oldstyle thinking good thats exactly what i want i need to learn how to handle those hassles without accidentally killing people er said miles true what are you going to study it almost doesnt matter it will give me an official status studentand a chance to study the people data i can get off a machine but im weak on people theres so much to learn i need to know everything it was another kind of hunger this insatiable gluttony for knowledge an impsec analyst must surely possess the hugest possible database the fellows hed met at the coffee dispenser in impsec hq had conducted flashing conversations with each other over the most appalling range and depth of subjects he was going to have to hustle if he wanted to compete in that crowd to win miles laughed whats funny im just wondering what hassadar is going to learn from you the ground car turned in at the gates of vorkosigan house and slowed maybe ill get up early said mark theres a lot to do miles grinned sleepily puddled down in his uniform welcome to the beginning
